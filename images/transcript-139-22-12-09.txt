SIX STRANGE CASES OF HUMANOIDS IN NEW YORK STATE
Dec 9, 2022

Summary:
Dec 9, 2022
Sightings of UFOs are undeniably interesting, but far more compelling are cases involving humanoids. Face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrial entities provide a profound insight into the UFO phenomenon and the alien presence on our planet. ETs are being seen all over the world, in every state, in every country. This video presents six extraordinary and unusual cases of humanoid entities from the state of New York. Each of these cases are strange and unique, and each offers an opportunity to further our understanding of extraterrestrials.

CASE ONE: IMPLANTED BY ALIENS. In 1955, eight-year-old Richard Price was playing near his home in Lansingburgh, NY when he encountered short humanoid ETs and a landed UFO. He was taken onboard the craft, physically examined and given an alien implant. Further procedures followed. Richard was then returned, but his life would never be the same. His case became on of the first involving the scientific study of an alien implant.

CASE TWO: A UFO LANDS ON MAIN STREET. On July 31, 1967, security guard Sidney Zipkin came upon a UFO landed in a parking lot along Main Street in Churchville, NY. To Sidney’s shock, two short humanoids raced into the craft which took off straight up. Sidney told his superiors who could see that Sidney was badly shaken. Unknown to any of them, numerous other people, including several police officers, saw UFOs in the same area at the same time.

CASE THREE: THE NEWFIELD UFO FLAP. On the evening of October 24, 1967, two young boys, Donald Chiszar and Pat Crozer were outside their home in Newfield, NY and looking up, saw a large structured craft with portholes hovering about 130 feet overhead. Looking through the portholes, the saw two strange-looking humanoids staring down at them. The craft took off, but the next night it returned. So began a massive UFO flap involving hundreds of witnesses.

CASE FOUR: “THEY WERE NOT HUMAN.” On the evening of June 10, 1972, an anonymous nurse, her mother and infant son, drove home along Coleman Station Road in Millerton, NY. Without warning, a massive craft dropped from the sky and hovered overhead only 150 feet away. Looking through the portholes, they saw five gray-skinned humanoids looking right back at them. They raced away and to their shock, the UFO began to follow them home.

CASE FIVE: “I AM NOT AFRAID OF THEM.” On February 26, 1983, Monique O’Driscoll drove with her daughter through upstate New York. Suddenly a massive boomerang-shaped craft appeared low overhead. Monique mentally called out, “Don’t Go!” To her amazement, the craft approached even closer. Two months later, Monique was visited again, only this time she had missing time. Going under hypnosis, she recalled being taken onboard the craft.

CASE SIX: THE GROUP ABDUCTIONS. In September 1989, a group of five friends (James, Curtis, Petra, Brian and Paul) decided to spend the Labor Day weekend at a trailer in a forested area of Saugerties, NY. That evening, the trailer filled with light and they experienced a period of missing time. Over the next four years, each time they spent time at the trailer, weird things happened. Under hypnosis, they learned that they were all being taken together onboard a UFO.

These six cases are just the tip of the iceberg, but together they show what it’s like to have a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials. Each have multiple witnesses and additional corroborating evidence. And each makes one fact very clear: we are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today's episode I call six strange cases of humanoids in New York state sightings are 
very interesting but I think far more interesting are cases in which people see humanoids face to 
face and or are taken on board of course these cases have been taking place for many decades 
still continuing pretty much to the present day and as we know occurring all over the world 
but in this episode I decided to limit the cases that I'm presenting here 
to New York State I've studied the accounts in this state while doing research for a book 
and I was surprised to find how many cases there are it's well over the hundreds it's 
probably closer to thousands if not tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands there 
was a lot of cases to choose from but I decided to pick six that I think were particularly unique 
had some interesting features that I think reveal something about the Extraterrestrial presence on 
our planet have something to say about how we interact with the extraterrestrials have 
unusual features to them or are really credible having multiple Witnesses and or physical evidence 
and have pronounced differences between each case and also have taken place over a period of decades 
so again there are six cases and I'd like to present each of these to you and you 
can decide for yourself what this has to say about the UFO phenomenon so let's get started with case one which I call implanted by aliens 
this took place in lansenberg New York in 1955 to a gentleman by the name of Richard Price 
again the year was 1955 and Richard Price who was only eight years old and his friend were playing 
on the street near his home on 10th Avenue and again this is in Lansingburgh New York 
they both heard this weird sound similar they said to an approaching train kind of a whistling sound 
now Richard's friend became frightened and ran away but he however became curious and started 
running around the neighborhood searching for the source of this sound so after several minutes he 
followed this sound to the Oakwood Cemetery I'll find I found this quite interesting because I've 
actually documented many cases of UFOs hovering over cemeteries I did a previous episode on such 
encounters but with Richard Price the first thing he noticed upon reaching the Oakwood Cemetery in 
the source of this sound was two strange figures who were both about his height quite short 
he said they had dark slanted eyes and wore what appeared to be helmets and uniforms and realizing 
they were not human he became quite frightened and turned and tried to run away but he wasn't 
able to do this and instead he felt himself drawn towards the beings who actually escorted him onto 
a 150 foot wide disc shaped craft that sat in a clearing in the woods next to the Oakwood Cemetery 
the being's elevated price up into the craft and once inside he said he was undressed by the beings 
and placed on an examination table two of the other beings joined the group and they all began 
to physically examine him he said they actually spoke verbally in a strange language which he 
compared to stereo equipment being played too slowly he watched a viewing screen on the wall as 
the beings placed a small apparently an implant in a very private and sensitive portion of his body 
now one of the beings spoke to him at this point and warned him to never try to remove this implant or he could die strangely Richard was not frightened by this at the time 
and after this apparent procedure in which an implant was allegedly placed in his body 
he was dressed back in his clothes the beings then handed him a piece of parchment-like 
material with what looked like Richard said in Alien alphabet full of strange geometric symbols 
at this point they showed him images on a view screen of other craft in what he likened to a 
virtual reality display and some reports on this case because this case has been reported widely 
he says he saw what looked like a weird city and what might be another planet 
and that was pretty much the end of the experience afterwards he was escorted off the craft and back 
to the same location in the Oakwood Cemetery he immediately ran home and told his father what 
happened unfortunately his father did not believe him and assumed that Richard was just having a 
vivid imagination and he learned pretty early on to keep quiet he did later tell his grandmother 
who believed him but she also said that he should be careful about revealing his story to people 
unfortunately the pressure to tell other people became too strong 
and at age 16 while in high school Richard decided to share his story with a classmate 
and this turned out not to be a good idea words spread fast about Richard's encounters they 
started ridiculing him calling him the spaceman and he felt himself becoming quite isolated 
and as Richard says The Experience itself wasn't bad but the after effects were bad 
so this is something we do see with a lot of encounters and this story followed him into 
college and things got much worse in college I this story spread like wildfire and was causing 
all kinds of disruptions so he was called in to see the principal and the principal decided 
that Richard based only on this story was mentally unbalanced and sent him to see a psychologist the 
psychologist actually agreed with the principal and admitted Richard into a psychiatric hospital 
and things went downhill from here he was heavily medicated told that he was insane and they would 
not release him oh they would only release him if he agreed to say that this incident never happened 
and realizing he was not going to get out otherwise Richard agreed to tell them that 
there was no such UFO incident however in his heart he still believed that this did happen 
and once he got out he just didn't talk about it at that point he did keep this piece of apparent alien parchment for a while but at one point as happens in 
many other cases it mysteriously disappeared and although he searched for it he could never find it 
and it was years later in 1981 that he decided to go to the doctor 
because where this implant had been placed on his body he started to feel this odd lump 
and the doctor examined it and he was puzzled by it and by the swelling but recommended that 
they take no action because there did not appear to be any damage there no pain and as long as it 
didn't change they decided to just leave it alone and Richard's condition remained stable for years 
actually for eight years until 1989 when this object started to protrude more than usual and 
was shortly later it popped out with a feeling Richard said like an electrical shock and this 
is where the story takes a very interesting turn Richard actually saved this object this apparent 
ET implant and gave it to Dr David Pritchard Pritchard is not only a UFO researcher but a 
teacher of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT a very respected School 
and he conducted this alleged alien implant to a scientific analysis using a scanning electron 
microscope and a secondary iron Mass spectrometer and it showed some unusual properties for sure 
Pritchard determined that this was to his surprise actually organic material composed 
mostly of quote carbon oxygen and hydrogen plus other what appear to be normal Earthly substances 
it did appear to have a core of translucent material with a collagen Sheen encasing it 
apparently as a result of having been inside Richard's body for an extended period of time 
but even more interesting projecting up from the object were three little appendages 18 
microns wide or approximately one quarter the width of a human hair 
there was some nitrogen in this apparent implant as well but less than 
Pritchard expected and what exactly it was could not be determined however Richard himself is 
certain that this was in fact placed there by the ETS and at a 1997 conference in Albany New York 
he revealed that all these years later this early childhood experience continued to affect his life 
afterwards he said he found it very difficult to concentrate in school he experienced considerable 
emotional distress he did get married but due to this encounter he says it contributed to his 
divorce so yeah this had a profound effect on his life price is considering writing a book about 
his experiences but as far as I know he has not done so yet but it's definitely an important case 
I like this case because it has physical evidence and another thing that's really interesting to me 
about it was how deeply and profoundly it affected the witness Richard Price it's really quite a 
remarkable case and again one of the first cases ever involving an alien implant that was actually 
analyzed scientifically so a very important case and now we move to case two which I call 
a UFO lands on Main Street and this took place in Churchville 
New York on July 31st 1967 and the main witness is a gentleman by the name of Sydney Zipkin this 
next case occurred on July 31st 1967 and again the main witness is a gentleman by the name of Sydney 
Zipkin he was 50 years old when this occurred and what's interesting about this case is that some 
people are more likely than others to encounter UFOs people such as security guards night Watchmen 
Pilots police officers and other people whose jobs entail them staying outside late at night and this 
is a case in point Sydney Zipkin was a security guard and on the evening of July 31st 1967 he was 
driving through the Churchville Park parking lot this is just off Main Street in Churchville and 
he says he saw a 50-foot wide cigar-shaped object drop out of the sky and land Softly on the cement 
he brought his truck to a stop and he approached within 100 feet of this strange object and aimed 
his headlights directly at it and according to Sydney Zipkin this object was dark in color 
roundish in the center and had green lights on the bottom of it and some of the reports uh 
this object was described as being Saturn shaped but as he's watching this object he says and I 
quote two dwarfs dressed in shiny black uniforms end quote rushed by his truck and ran into the UFO 
and that come quite by surprise and shortly later this object took off straight up and disappeared 
and that you'd think would be the end of this report but it's not the national investigative 
committee for aerial phenomena assigned a couple of investigators to the case 
and after interviewing him they said that he appeared to be entirely truthful and 
he remained steadfast in his report his story did not change a further 
investigation revealed that there were apparently several other Witnesses it was later learned that four police officers two sheriffs and two deputies in separate locations 
saw UFOs in that area about four hours after Zipkin reported seeing this object landed in 
the parking lot and further research revealed that there were other Witnesses at least eight 
others one who was at a college and seven other Witnesses who saw a UFO in the sky that evening 
some of these Witnesses include Daniel Mullen Ronald Phillips Arnold Johnson Ronald bump and 
Bruce Kenny so these Witnesses are actually named and I think that does lend Credence 
to Sydney zipkin's encounter Sydney however did have a difficult time with this it did appear in 
newspapers and there were people who were clearly skeptical as Sydney says in his own words nobody 
believes me even my brother I always thought it was a bunch of garbage myself but when you see 
one yourself it's not a laughing matter it's a pretty a serious it's a pretty serious thing 
there's a planet or something out there and the government ought to look into it and he later 
said you can laugh at what I'm telling you in fact I used to laugh myself when people said they saw 
these things but I saw this with my own eyes and I swear to God as a witness that I saw what I saw 
and yes Sydney Zipkin does have other people who believe he's telling the truth in fact his 
Superior his boss for his job said that Zipkin came running up to him his superior's name 
is Clarence Johnson and Clarence Johnson said that Sydney Zipkin was quote white as a ghost 
and another person who verifies Sydney's story is Alvin Grant the county parks director 
who said that Sydney Zipkin was a reliable employee in that his terrified condition 
testified to the truth of his story however there was a weird aftermath to this case one week later 
Sydney Zipkin was fired from his job apparently this case brought a lot of attention to him 
and it was revealed that Sydney did have a prior criminal record for petty theft and a few other 
things but for whatever reason whether it was this incident or not Sydney Zipkin lost his job 
but what's interesting about this case is this UFO landed on Main Street in a very heavily 
populated case and it has many other Witnesses so while this case does have some unusual and 
controversial elements to it it appears to be entirely genuine and is well corroborated by 
numerous other Witnesses who saw UFOs in that area at that time so a good case and now let's move 
to case three the New Field New York UFO flap and this took place in 1967 it involves actually many 
hundreds of witnesses but initially began with just two witnesses two young boys by the names 
of Donald chiser and Pat Crozier it was around 9 30 p.m on October 24 1967 when two youngsters 
John Donald chiser who was 13 years old and his friend Pat Crozier who was 10 years old 
were both outside their homes in Newfield New York when they saw a bright glowing object hovering at 
a very low altitude they estimate about 130 feet overhead is that it was round it had a cupola 
on top and what appeared to be a little antenna type device they said a box like protrusion stuck 
out from the bottom of the craft and that this protrusion had red green and white lights on it 
the rim of the craft itself had squarish red and white lights so as they're watching this 
thing and trying to determine what it is this object suddenly tilts towards them and at this 
point Donald and Pat could see that there were two large Square portholes separated by a single bar 
they said the craft appeared to have strange lettering or symbols along the bottoms of the 
portholes and inside through these portholes they could see two humanoid finger figures sitting 
down in small seats operating control panels that were filled with small lights and knobs 
these beings were quite short it appeared to be about five and a half feet tall and had a very 
strange appearance brown skin that looked like it had a weird bumpy texture and they watched this 
for quite some time about two minutes finally the subject tilted up at the rear became very 
bright then assumed a horizontal position and disappeared they said quote like a puff of wind 
so it was quite an amazing case and it was the next night actually that 
they went outside again and this same craft or one just like it appeared again 
this time they had walkie-talkies and they said that when this craft appeared and again 
it was quite low there were walkie-talkies malfunctioned and dogs were barking nearby 
and looking around they saw that there was another one of these craft so this started to create a little bit of Buzz around town especially because the night before 
the boys encounter their first encounter a gentleman by the name of Stanley Orr said he 
saw weird lights and over the next week activity ramped up to an incredible degree and by October 
30th more than get this 100 sightings were made by local residents and this became known as the quote 
great Ithaca flap this appeared in newspapers the Air Force sent an investigator and said 
it was airplanes astronomers analyzed these uh reports and could not come up with an explanation 
there was a student who says that he set off a version of what we know of as sky lanterns and 
that this might have contributed to at least some of the sightings but it certainly does not explain what Donald chiser and Pat Crozier saw which was a solid metallic looking craft 
with lights and portholes and ETS looking down at them is quite a case it's a very interesting 
case with so many witnesses animal effects what appear to be electromagnetic effects 
and a very pronounced wave of UFO activity that went on for at least one month 
so an important case I think and now we move to case four they were not human 
and this took place primarily in the town of Millerton it does involve multiple Witnesses 
who prefer to remain anonymous and it took place in the year of 1972. and this one is quite a doozy 
of a case it was late on the evening of June 10 1972 when an anonymous nurse was driving 
with her 65 year old mother and her infant son outside of a Millerton New York along a street 
called Coleman Station Road when they noticed a multi-colored lighted object flashing very 
high in the sky ahead of him they both assumed it was a plane when without warning it dropped down 
out of the sky at a tremendous rate of speed they assumed at this point that this was a plane about 
to crash right in front of them when suddenly it stopped and hovered only a few hundred feet away 
and only then did they realize it was not a plane as the witness says in her own words and I quote 
it made a very soft quiet humming sound as it hovered just above the trees 
I was terrified my hands were shaking as I clenched the steering wheel I was so 
afraid for all of us in the car especially my infant son asleep in his car seat in the back 
the object was absolutely huge just tremendous in size it was saucer shaped with some sort 
of Dome around the entire Dome we could clearly see a panel of windows 
what we saw through the windows gave me nightmares for many years there were beings looking out at us 
they were not human in appearance I counted five but my mother swore she counted six 
I do not know what they were but they were not human beings from our view we could see 
large oval black eyes with big bug-like heads attached to what appeared to be very thin necks 
with long thin arms my mother and I both thought that they appeared gray in color 
as they watched the object it sent down a blue white beam of light from underneath 
the craft and this beam actually struck their car Illuminating the interior like daylight 
and in fact the light was so bright that both women were forced to cover their eyes 
and it stayed like that for about a full minute or even two minutes at which point the beam of light 
retracted at this point the craft started to move still afraid the nurse pressed her foot to the 
accelerator and raced home but to her shock this UFO actually followed them or rather kept in front 
of them in the sky at just above Tree Top level and this object remained in view the entire trip 
home she drove off Coleman Station Road got onto Route 22 drove for another five minutes then took 
a left onto McGee Hill Road where she lived and she quickly drove the rest of the distance home 
and they all ran inside this object was still there they could hear the faint whining of the 
object as it finally moved away and as the witness says I don't think either one of us actually slept 
that night I was still shaking the next morning it was such a traumatic experience for us 
and here's another very interesting aspect to this story mind you there are already two witnesses 
but the nurse was so upset by what she had seen that the next morning she phoned the 
civil defense authorities who told her that they had received quote thousands of calls 
now most of the callers were reporting distant objects but a few they told her involved close-up 
encounters and as the nurse says in her own words I have told hundreds of people about that 
evening and I will continue to tell everyone that asks until I am no longer able to there is life 
outside our little world I don't understand the whys and hows but I know there is I have seen it 
quite a dramatic case so this case I thought was interesting because it followed them for so long 
and it affected them so profoundly it does not appear to be an actual contact case I don't think 
we can rule out that they were taken on board or not but it does not appear that they were 
but it's really quite an amazing description of a really remarkable and prolonged UFO 
event involving humanoids and that's why I wanted to include it in today's episode 
and now we move to case number five I am not afraid of them and this involves a 
witness by the name of Monique Driscoll who was a witness to the very famous Hudson Valley UFO wave 
and she's not only a witness to a UFO sighting but apparently an actual onboard encounter 
this took place in 1983 and I think it's a very important case from 1982 to 1986 there was a 
very intense wave of sightings over the Hudson Valley area of New York State this actually was 
well beyond just Hudson Valley appearing in Connecticut in some neighboring areas as well 
and it was during this wave of sightings that the number of on-board UFO Encounters 
in this area Rose sharply at least tripling in number it was on February 26 1983 that a woman 
by the name of Monique O'Driscoll and her daughter actually witnessed this Hudson Valley UFO triangle 
when she saw it Monique actually sent out a mental message to the UFO saying don't go 
and to her amazement it appeared to respond to her thoughts and approached much more closely 
and here's where the story gets even stranger two months later in April of 1983 she was walking her 
dog outside her home in Lake Carmel New York when she saw strange lights hovering nearby and she 
returned home thinking that she had just seen the UFO again and had a very close-up sighting but to 
her shock and puzzlement she discovered that it was now an hour later than it should have been 
and realizing that this could mean that she had actually had a more extensive encounter 
she agreed to undergo hypnosis with the famed UFO researcher Bud Hopkins 
so Bud Hopkins hypnotically regressed her to the time of this incident and to her amazement she 
recalled that she was walking her dog outside and the next moment she found herself on board this 
craft apparently on board this craft she was lying on her back in a small round room that looked like 
it was covered with computer panels she was being physically examined by she said little people 
with big bald heads they placed a weird small silver instrument on her chest which vibrated 
and despite the unusual nature of this experience Monique says she remade remained 
entirely calm throughout as she says and I quote I am not afraid of them right now I feel restful 
so this was a huge wave of activity in this area at that time there's actually a book about it 
written by Philip embrogno Jalen heineck and Bob Pratt and it's a very interesting book 
Philip imbrogno actually spoke with Bud Hopkins about the reasons for this wave of sightings and 
why were they there and Bud Hopkins told him simply they are looking for people 
at the time Philip ambrognos as he was really not convinced about the reality of abduction claims 
but as he says and I quote I soon changed my mind when I discovered that over 82 percent of all the 
abduction cases I looked into were people who had been scanned previously by the UFO's white light 
so that appeared to be true in Monique's case because she had mentally called out to this UFO and it approached her much more closely and it was just two months later that she found herself 
having an on-board UFO encounter so that's just one of many many onboard UFO encounters which 
took place during the Hudson Valley UFO wave and I like that case because it involves a witness who 
allowed her real name to be used who seems quite credible who drew illustrations of The Craft that 
she saw and also had no fear of her encounters so it's an interesting case to say the least 
and now we move to the last case in today's show which I call case six the group abductions 
this took place in Socrates New York actually over a period of several years but it was primarily in 
September of 1989 when a group of friends began to experience abductions or onboard encounters 
together encounters involving multiple Witnesses being taken all at once are relatively rare in 
the literature so this case is I think unusual in that regard involving four five witnesses 
all of whom corroborate each other's story it was Labor Day weekend in September 1989. 
when the Farmingdale resident Curtis Walton who was a store manager and his friend James 
lafonte a messenger from Merrick and several other friends decided that they would spend a weekend 
in a semi-remote area in Socrates New York one of them had a trailer there 
and they ended up spending many weekends there and what was supposed to be a fun holiday on 
this occasion however turned out to be one of the strangest weekends of their lives 
these friends Curtis Walton James lafonte and several others including Brian leisure 
Paul cecere and their friend Petra all on themselves having an incredible experience 
they had gone to bed and in the middle of the night the trailer lit up with this really bright 
light and uh that's all they really remembered but this happened many many times and after 
several instances of this sort of thing they realized something very strange was happening 
and they ended up going under hypnosis they found a researcher who agreed to regress 
them and under hypnotic regression they found that they were being regularly taken on board 
it was this one incident in September of 1989 that really woke them up to it but it happened 
many times as James lafonte says during one of his hypnotic regressions I'm on a table they have big 
eyes their skins look molded and after recalling being taken on board and mostly physically 
examined he said other things happened he found that they would be grouped together and they would 
sometimes be put in Intimate situations he said and as he says they would take us into the room 
and start doing medical experiments and sometimes there would be two or three of us in the same room 
in the course of four years I believe we were abducted about 60 times 
it was always seemed to follow the same pattern the trailer would light up and they couldn't move other times they found themselves being led out of the trailer by Grays and led to a 
certain field not far from the trailer and it was there that they were taken on board 
not surprisingly James lafonte says that he recalled having experiences as a very little kid 
as he says ever since I was a child I used to wake up and I used to see white lights 
and shadowy figures so as an adult with during this experience in this trailer 
he saw his friends also on board the UFO Curtis Walton Brian Ledger Paul sincere and Petra 
and not only did he recall seeing them they recalled seeing him 
James says and I quote I do know that they need our genes to propagate their own species 
so he thinks ultimately the reason for these onboard experiences had to do with genetics 
Curtis Walton and the others also went under hypnosis and according to Curtis and I quote 
we were just going up there for fun but as it turns out week by week we were all being abducted 
as a group I would see James across the room in the same thing being done to him Curtis also 
remembered not only the trailer lighting up but sometimes being led out of the trailer and he says 
he had a reproductive material removed from him on several occasions and this is verified by their 
other friends Brian leisure says that quote when I was on the ship I remember seeing James and Petra 
and Brian like the other Witnesses also remembers having encounters as a little kid 
as he says when I was a little kid I guess I could call them like shadow people because they used to 
come out of the shadows and the Shadows would come alive and then they'd be these little small guys 
and Petra also agrees as she says when I was younger I remember an alien Looking Through the 
Windows being watched a feeling of being watched all the time James and Kirk saw me on the UFOs 
so James says that he remember seeing them throughout the years not only as adults but 
as little kids and all of them remembered being on this craft so again this appears to be not 
only a single group onboard experience but many and that makes it quite unusual as you can see 
a well verified case they did all appear on the program sightings several years ago and bravely 
stepped forward and talked about what they had seen so I think yeah it's an important case
those are the six cases I wanted to present to you today and I think you'll agree they certainly 
are interesting and unique and have something to say about the nature of the UFO phenomenon 
I did present them all along with many others in my book UFOs over New York a true history of 
extraterrestrial Encounters in the Empire State and again these are just the tip of the iceberg 
there are so many more cases that I could have presented but this one I think does give you a 
fair cross-section of what it's like to encounter humanoids and absolutely these are strange cases 
so once again I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time 
keep searching for answers keep asking questions and most important keep having fun
