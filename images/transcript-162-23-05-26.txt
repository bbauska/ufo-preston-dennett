ETS LOVE ALFALFA! - SIGHTINGS, LANDINGS, HUMANOIDS: 20 TRUE CASES
May 26, 2023

Summary:
May 26, 2023
There are many strange patterns to UFO activity, and one of them appears to be a connection to the food crop, alfalfa. There are dozens of cases in which UFOs are seen over alfalfa fields. These are not only low-level sightings, but landings and humanoid encounters. They have been occurring since the modern age of UFOs and continue today.

The question is why? What is it about alfalfa that is attracting so many UFOs? This video presents a chronology of cases from all over the world. Most of these cases involve physical evidence such as animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances, and most often: landing traces. These cases not only provide outstanding evidence of UFO reality, they provide some startling insights into ET behavior.

Jan 1950: Rosamond CA. The Gettys family is startled when as UFO hovers at low level over their alfalfa farm, causing all kinds of unusual effects.

Dec 1953: Tome, NM. Farmer Julian Torres and his wife are drawn outside by their barking dogs, only to see a 14-foot wide-glowing object hovering only a few feet above their alfalfa fields.

Sep 1962: Orland, CA. Rancher A.T. Gray goes to investigate what he first thought were two cars parked in an alfalfa field, only to realize it was a UFO shining down beams onto the plants.

Dec 1965: Tucuman, Argentina. Farmer Antonio Lozano watches a glowing red object land in his field, leaving behind a 15-foot-wide burned circle in his alfalfa field.

Mar 1969: Marshall, MI. It was a sunny morning when Wayne Kidder and his family saw a dome-shaped object parked in their alfalfa field. It stayed for 20 minutes when it disappeared suddenly.

Aug 1970: Vallodolid, Spain. Mrs. C.R. is drawn outside by an eerie whistling noise to see a landed metallic craft. Standing next to it is a uniformed humanoid staring intently at their alfalfa fields.

Sep 1974: Sioux City, IA: George Hoffman steps outside his farmhouse and sees a glowing object darting low over his alfalfa fields. Inspecting the area, he finds a semi-circle of burned vegetation.

Aug 1975: Rochester, MN. When numerous residents see a UFO land at a local alfalfa farm, an inspection of the area reveals a strange landing trace shows exposure to a very high heat source.

Sep 1975: Starbuck, MN. Farmer Gordon Hovendick usually grew corn, but this year decided to grow alfalfa. When harvesting his crop, he discovers numerous strange rings of burned vegetation in his fields.

Aug 1977: Arthur, NB. When Janet Magnuson and her cousin have a close-up encounter with a UFO, an investigation reveals a burned circle in a nearby alfalfa field.

Oct 1980: Orbisonia, PA. An anonymous witness is picking alfalfa for her rabbits when a UFO hovers low overhead. She brings the alfalfa home, but her rabbits refuse to eat it.

Jan 1981: Trans-en-Provence, France. Retired stonemason Renato Nicolai encounters a landed UFO in the wild alfalfa next to his house, leading to one of the most well-verified UFO landing trace cases on record.

Oct 1984: Prato di Principato, Italy. Alfalfa farmer Giuseppe Cocozza is checking his fields when he comes upon a 3-foot-tall humanoid holding a strange instrument and poking it into the ground. When the figure notices Giuseppe, it flees towards an oddly-shaped craft landed nearby.

Aug 1988: Elmwood, WI: Farmers Charles and Evelyn Hutchins are shocked to find strange circular rings in their alfalfa fields, only to learn that their neighbor had seen UFOs in the area.

Oct 1990: Barada, NB: Charlie Kirkendall is cutting his alfalfa fields and discovers two mysterious circles burned into his field. Neighbors flock to his field to see, when word spreads that some of the neighbors in the area have been seeing strange lights at night.

Aug 1992: Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Phyllis Collins finds a nine-foot-diameter circle of flattened alfalfa in her fields and calls in an agricultural scientist to investigate, who informs her that he has been studying numerous similar circles made recently in the surrounding areas.

Aug 2000: Kondoros, Hungary. An anonymous farmer is driving his tractor through his alfalfa fields when he is confronted by a short humanoid figure less than feet tall who fearlessly approaches him.

As these cases (and many others) show, ETs are attracted to alfalfa. Could it be that they recognize its value as a food source, rich in vitamins and useful for its many medicinal properties? It certainly looks that way! Whatever the reason, the connection between UFOs and alfalfa is undeniable. There are too many cases to ignore. ETs love alfalfa!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I've got a very unusual episode today I always say that but this one is really unusual I think I call 
it et's love alfalfa and by alfalfa I don't mean the little rascal I mean the food crop it's a food 
source both for humans for livestock for Animals of all kinds in fact Alfalfa has been farmed for 
thousands of years it's an excellent food crop it actually puts lots of nitrogen into the soil 
and it's very widely used across the world for good reasons I mean it has all kinds of vitamins 
including Vitamin K Vitamin C it's got folates thiamin riboflavin magnesium iron and copper 
and it's also got a lot of medicinal properties it's very valuable health-wise it's been known to 
lower cholesterol it's used to decrease blood pressure decrease blood sugar it 
improves cardio metabolic health and it's a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
and apparently the ETS love it too perhaps they know this perhaps this is why I found so many 
cases of ETS hovering at very low altitude over Alfalfa crops but more often Landing 
in a number of cases humanoids I mean these cases are really interesting I'm going to present about 
20 cases today traveling through time starting the early 1950s all the way up to the 2000s so 
you can see this is a very consistent feature of UFO encounters now there's something about 
Alfalfa that is attracting ETS I first heard about this from researcher Gordon Creighton and he's a 
long time pioneering researcher now deceased but I read a quote from him about this connection to 
UFO Encounters in the Alfalfa crop and it's Gordon Creighton says the occupants of mysterious craft 
have been reported to have shown an unusual interest in the animal food crop alfalfa 
so yeah when I heard about I thought you know I know of some cases and that's when I decided to 
dig deep and I did find 20 cases as always I think this is just the tip of the iceberg it 
would be very easy to find a lot more cases like these but I picked out 20 of what I think are 
more interesting and better authenticated cases of this kind and I find it very interesting because 
I think this shows some interesting aspects to ET Behavior they're clearly interested in Alfalfa so 
I actually asked Dolly saffron about this for those of you who don't know Dolly saffron she 
is a contactee fully conscious I wrote a book about her encounters called symmetry and I 
thought she might have some interesting insights into this so I asked her and she says oh yeah she is quite familiar with the fact that ETS do in fact eat Alfalfa just like we do so I thought that 
was interesting these cases I think show sort of a human side to et's and I think these cases have 
something to teach us about not only ET Behavior but who they are so that's really why I wanted 
to present these cases today that because they're so interesting they provide all kinds of evidence 
this is not just eyewitness testimony in fact the majority of these cases do have physical evidence 
and by that I mean Landing traces animal reactions some cases physiological reactions and I love the 
fact that quite a few of them actually involve humanoids so I think you'll find it interesting 
I'd certainly hope so again 20 cases that's a lot to cover so let's just get started now these cases 
do occur all over the world but the first case I'd like to cover occurred in Rosamond California 
and this case comes from pioneering UFO researcher James McDonald and this involves 
a very low flying disc was in January of 1950 when John Gettys his wife and young 
daughter were in their farmhouse in Rosamond when a UFO hovered directly over their house 
so their Farmhouse was surrounded by fields of Alfalfa and this disc hovered so low it shook 
the entire house that's not all the only thing it Disturbed their television set and it sent weird 
vibrations through their bodies so this is a weird physiological effect and in fact John 
Gettys said it was the most Vivid experience of his entire life it's a good case involving both 
electromagnetic and physiological effects and the question is why was it hovering so 
low over the house could it have been attracted to the Alfalfa Fields it's a bit circumstantial 
in this case but as we go on we'll see these cases definitely do show an interest on the 
et's part in alfalfa moving along to three years later this next case occurred in Tome New Mexico 
and this was in December of 1953 this case first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal 
newspaper and was later reported to researcher Donald Kehoe a very well respected researcher 
the main Witnesses were Julian Torres a farmer and his wife they were woken up at around 2 A.M by the 
Frantic barking of their dog so Torres jumps up and grabs his gun because he thought someone might 
be trying to steal his newborn calf but instead he saw a 14-foot wide object glowing orange orange 
red and hovering mere feet above his Alfalfa field this was only about 500 feet from his farmhouse 
now his wife she came outside too took one look at it and ran back inside 
this object remained in place for about three to four minutes which is a pretty long time for an 
object that that is that low and at this point the object flared up and ascended at a 45 degree 
angle into the sky and was gone so there's no word about any marks in the field but this is a good 
example of an animal reaction case and again a UFO hovering at very low level over an alfalfa field 
here's an even better case a lot of these cases are quite brief so I'm going to go through them 
fairly quickly this next case occurred in Orland California this was on September 10 1962 and we 
actually know the exact location this is located at 4th Avenue and Wyo Road this was reported to 
apro the aerial phenomenon research organization and the main witness is Rancher A.T Gray 
now gray was helping out his friend John Gilmore who actually owned this Farm in Orland 
and gray went out into the fields to shut off an irrigation pump in the Alfalfa field 
and this is when he saw what he first thought were actually a couple of cars with their lights 
on parked in the field so he drove out there and he saw that this was not two cars this 
was an actually an object floating in the air his point he thought it might be a helicopter but it 
was clear that it wasn't and as he got close you could see that this object was pretty much silent 
and it was not a helicopter he saw instead a quote blunt-shaped object and was hovering only 20 feet 
in the air that's very low it had two lights on each side each of these lights were about three 
feet in diameter so pretty big they were shining down onto the Alfalfa field now you can see at 
this point or here that this object was making a soft swishing noise and when he started to 
approach it closer he got to within 150 feet of it this object then zoomed towards him actually 
skimming the ground then zipped off very quickly in fact according to gray it moved so quickly it 
was out of sight in three to four seconds and as the Rancher says as Rancher gray says I tell 
you it gives a man a darn funny feeling boy it sure threw me for a loop I'll tell you one thing 
I'm sure going to keep an eye on this area I'd sure like to have a better look at that thing 
so the owner of the ranch John Gilmore reported it to the Sheriff's Office who told the Orlando 
California registered newspaper and that's how this case found its way to UFO researchers 
it's a pretty interesting case and they just get more interesting as time goes on 
here's a very brief case which occurred in tucumon Argentina in December 1965. 
the main witness in this case is a farmer by the name of Antonio Lozano and he saw this brilliant 
red light actually land in his Alfalfa field after just a few moments this object took off 
and the farmer Antonio went into his Alfalfa field and this is when he found a large curved 
forked burned impression in his Alfalfa field and he measured it it was about 15 feet in diameter 
so this was not a huge craft but certainly not a tiny little thing and is one of many many cases of this kind involving Landing traces now here's another very 
interesting case this was four years later March 23rd 1969 and this occurred in Marshall Michigan 
the main witness is Wayne Kidder his wife and their son Brian and they were in their home 
in Marshall it was around 11 A.M so this is a daylight sighting when they saw a dome-shaped 
object just sitting there in their Alfalfa field this object was a shiny metal and glinted in the 
morning sun and was pretty big it was about they estimate 50 to 60 feet wide and 15 to 20 feet high 
so as uh the main witness Wayne says it was a solid object which had the appearance of stainless 
steel or aluminum and they actually watched it for 20 minutes a very long time it was quite 
cold out so they went inside to get their coats and when they came back out the object was gone 
now this was investigated by a gentleman by the name of Reverend Gerald F Boyer 
now it's an interesting case of a UFO landing in in the Alfalfa field 
here this next case is probably one of my favorite of this whole presentation 
and this occurred in Europe actually in valo dolid Spain via dolid Spain this is on August 16 1970. 
and one of the main Witnesses is senorita we don't know her full name of just her initials which is 
c r and she works at the farm of Don Louis de Diego now this was at night she was watching 
TV when she heard this very loud noise as she described it in quote intense Whistling noise 
not the same time she heard this noise there was interference on her television screen 
so she turned off the TV it was late at night she was getting ready to go to bed and then she went 
outside to investigate this noise and I'll just let her describe what she saw because it's crazy 
as she says you can't imagine my astonishment when I found that outside on the entrance Road 
there was a weird thing with various lights on it and near it a man looking at the field of alfalfa 
that we have there he was standing there looking fixedly at the field of alfalfa so apparently he 
was studying it she looked at the object which she said was silver it wasn't huge about the size of a 
car maybe 12 feet wide she estimates pretty tall seven to eight feet tall and it had a transparent 
cupola on top on top of that there was a flashing blue light and there were white purple and yellow 
lights around the circumference now this figure was fairly tall about five feet ten inches tall 
and he was dressed in a dark tight-fitting garment with a belt and a helmet in a sort 
of weird white glowing what looked like bracelets around his cuffs his wrists and around his ankles 
so he began walking towards the landed object this really frightened the main witness as she says 
I was very scared so I went back indoors and shut the door after a while I heard the whistle again 
like at the beginning so after this whistling sound faded away she looked outside and the object 
was gone but she did see something else and that's what makes this case to me so interesting as the 
witness says I could see absolutely clearly that at the spot where the UFO landed the whole area 
was shining with a uniform glow the next morning even by daylight you could see quite clearly black 
Footprints at the place they were boot shaped with the heel narrower than the front part of the sole 
so yeah an important case I think involving a humanoid a landing Landing traces and 
electromagnetic interference and it's also so interesting that this figure was staring fixedly 
at the Alfalfa field I wonder what he was thinking in so many cases here's another one this occurred 
in Sioux City Iowa this was on September 4 1974. the main witness is George Hoffman 
and he was drawn outside of his home by this glowing object which hovered very 
low level tree top level and it was moving in erratic motions he said over his Alfalfa field 
and there were animal reactions his dog and cattle seemed to react to the presence of this object 
and he watched it for about five minutes at which point it darted off into the distance and was gone 
so he went to inspect his Alfalfa fields and sure enough he found a 
burned semi-circle in his Alfalfa field he said it was weird because the ground itself 
was burned Almost White apparently due to exposure he guesses to a high heat source 
so again a really good Landing Trace case as well as an animal reaction case and here's another very 
interesting case this one occurred in Rochester Minnesota and this is on August 3rd 1975. 
and there were multiple witnesses to this apparent UFO landing at the alpha Farm of Willard Anderson 
and the first witness to see it was actually Anderson's neighbor Donald prig who saw a glowing 
red Object Land in the field and it seemed to disappear at this point so he called his neighbor 
Willard and told him and Willard himself didn't see anything but knowing of this report he decided 
to go out the next morning and inspect his field and this is when he got a surprise as he says and 
I quote I found a brown patch about 15 by 30 feet in the Alfalfa field I don't know what caused it 
but it wasn't there yesterday and it turns out there were other Witnesses another witness to 
this incident was Ivan benkin who was driving with his daughter Lisa and they said they saw a quote 
big red ball of fire it came down towards the ground almost looking like it crashed and exploded 
so this whole incident drew a lot of attention from the neighbors a lot of people came in to see 
this patch of burned ground but it was interesting it didn't actually looked burned it looked like 
it had been exposed to a high heat source as one person who visited this Landing tray said 
there were modeled places of green in the brown patch but the lines of the brown patch were 
clearly discernible now there was some talk of this possibly being a meteor or bolide but 
there is no other evidence other than this brown patch so hard to say for sure but the witnesses 
who particularly Donald prig who saw this object himself they leaned towards the UFO explanation 
and here's another case which occurred just one month later and actually in the same state this 
is in September 1975 near Starbuck Minnesota and the main witness is Gordon hovendick 
now he usually grew corn but this year 1975 he decided to grow alfalfa and he was out there 
cutting his third crop when he noticed a dark ring in the middle of his Alfalfa field so he didn't 
actually see any UFOs there's no eyewitnesses to that but there was this mysterious ring 
and what's interesting about this is not all the grass was crushed or burned this was just a ring 
so it was 10 feet in diameter and the ring itself was about eight inches wide and 
looked like it had been exposed to a high heat Source it's kind of smoke Smoky and powdery Gray 
now this did get into the newspapers and the author of the newspaper article in the Starbuck time speculated this ring might actually be a sort of what investigators might 
call fairy rings which are sometimes due to the mushrooms the in particular mycelium mushrooms 
he admitted this was only a pure guess however the main witness Gordon thought this would probably be 
better evidence of a UFO landing though again he didn't actually see any object Landing 
but again this was in an alfalfa field and given that there's so many other cases of UFOs landing in Alfalfa Fields I leaned towards the UFO explanation 
and here's another case same year only this case occurred in Mancus Colorado 
this is a tiny little town and this account comes from a gentleman by the name of Frank Andrews 
and it's an interesting story that Frank has to tell so I'm just going to quote him at 
some length and let him tell the story in his own words as Frank Andrews says 
one dark night in 1975 when we were living in Mancus Colorado and we were on our way 
home from visiting my wife's brother in Durango we witnessed an amazing spectacle overhead in the sky 
we pulled off the road for a few minutes to watch this most unusual display of lights 
we continued on our way home to ponder what we had just seen we had read about these encounters but didn't believe any of it until it happened to us 
my wife and I talked half the night away trying to figure out what we had seen our new house was 
on 11 beautiful Acres with fantastic views in all directions and ranches all around us 
it had taken us a full year to build the place ourselves and we met many neighbors during 
that time and one of these good neighbors was a blacksmith named Epic he was the real honest to 
good blacksmith from the old days he used tools of the trade that were out of The Westerns charcoal 
Forge huge Anvil hammers chisels but lacking all the electrified equipment of modern times 
I visited my friend epic the morning after our night Under The Lights I don't remember if I had 
mentioned our encounter before he showed me his Alfalfa field but what I saw in his field helped 
me believe more in UFOs he too had seen the bright lights from his bedroom window but didn't get up 
to investigate until after Dawn and his epic said Frank I've got to show you something really weird 
and Frank continues his story as we walked out in his field standing knee-deep in the 
Luscious green blue Alfalfa I observed A Perfect Circle about 20 feet across burnt into epics field 
This Grass crater was only about a mile from where we had seen the bright lights the night before 
I asked Epic have you told anyone else about this he replied no Frank I haven't but I think that 
I'll call the newspapers I'm not sure if he did but Frank Andrews did and this is how this article 
came to be published in the newspapers pretty interesting case of a UFO landing in an alfalfa 
field it's really amazing how many there are two years later August 17 1977 this next case occurred 
in the tiny teeny little town of Arthur Nebraska of course there's lots of crops grown in Nebraska 
and it was at 11 PM on August 17 when Janet Magnuson and her cousin Barb Mendenhall were 
driving on a gravel road this is about five miles east of Arthur when they saw an object glowing a 
brilliant dark red moving over the hill to their left our Janet slammed on the brakes as the car 
engine died and as Janet says in her own words it was real huge maybe as long as a football field 
she says that this object had oval Windows around the circumference which she says quote emitted 
the most spectacular red I've ever seen the most dark deep red but the most brilliant red 
so this was not a fireball or anything like that I mean it had oval Windows around it and she says 
it was actually football shaped with a dome on top so your classic sort of saucer she said it 
moved very slowly and it was inching towards them rocking back and forth until it was right over 
the road directly in front of him he said it was totally quiet and so big that it filled the entire 
windshield now at this point Janet's cousin Barb started to freak out she started screaming and she 
said they're going to get us I know they're going to get us because they know that we've seen them 
because they can see us so she's totally freaking out meanwhile this object hovered for about five 
seconds and then shot off to the Northeast the two women raced home they arrived home at 11 20 and 
both Drew sketches of what they had seen and Janet actually began dreaming about this incident this 
is a sign that could be more than just a sighting and she thinks so because as she says I'd almost 
like to go under hypnosis because I have a feeling that there's something here I don't remember 
it's all very hard to believe you get to question yourself almost 
now Janet later learned and here's the Alfalfa connection that a rancher in the area saw a UFO 
hovering over the power lines in his Alfalfa field and he also found a circular burned spot in his 
field and this spot was so intense that it would not grow any Alfalfa and remain there for a year 
more evidence of ETS and their interest in alfalfa now here's a weird and slightly different case 
this occurred in October 1980 this is near Orbisonia Pennsylvania in Huntington County 
now a witness was out picking Alfalfa in a field to feed her rabbits this was something she did 
regularly when she saw this huge object which she says was as big as a house actually fly 
directly over her and off into the distance she ran back into her truck and returned 
home with the Alfalfa she had collected and that's when she noticed something strange 
according to one of the relatives who actually reported this incident to investigators 
and I'll quote a strange thing happened when the couple arrived home they placed the Alfalfa 
in the rabbit's cages but the rabbits did not eat the Alfalfa in fact they would not even go 
near the alfalfa investigators speculated that some sort of energy field from the UFO may have 
affected the Alfalfa in some way so this case is important also because there was a huge number of 
reports from people all over that area at that time it's not just that one case now this next 
case became extremely well known as a UFO landing site that was very well verified this occurred in 
transom Provence in France on January 8 1981. a retired Stone Mason by the name of Renato Nikolai 
watched as a UFO landed in the wild Alfalfa Fields right next to his house and as he says 
it came down lightly on the ground near my house I approached it and clearly saw the craft it was 
a flat circular object bulging slightly above and below about six feet in height and seven and 
a half feet in diameter it was a dull gray like lead it was round and I could see four portholes 
so Renato walked towards this object when it suddenly took off making a loud whistling sound 
and this is when he saw the ground where the object had landed showed a circular depression 
almost three-fourths of an inch into the ground so it was quite heavy and two skid marks so he 
reported his uh sighting of this landed object and scientists arrived to analyze the landing 
traces and take samples and they concluded after much analysis that this site had been exposed to 
strong mechanical pressure and heat so this object they estimate weighed some thousands of pounds and 
the heat Source had to be at least 1 100 degrees Fahrenheit so not something you could easily fake 
furthermore it took samples of the Alfalfa and the chlorophyll was reduced by some 50 percent 
so this is a very strange effect and one of the scientists Dr bunius said and I quote 
I examined the different pigments in the Alfalfa such as chlorophyll and xanthophile and these 
pigments had undergone very important changes near the site which diminished as the distance 
from the site increased so that's an important point the closer the vegetation was to this 
object the more it was affected and as the doctor says the vegetation at the site was dried but 
not burnt or carbonized we have acknowledged the facts but we make no statement about their cause 
we don't see any confirmation of the existence of flying saucers we don't give any explanation 
that's all so he's just being careful objective and scientific but what caused this Landing Trace 
clearly it was the object seen by Renato Nikolai and this is considered by UFO investigators to 
be one of the best landing traces in modern ufology it's a very very interesting case 
and here's another January 13 1981 this occurred in Culpepper County Virginia 
there were numerous Witnesses in this very rural area of Culpepper County who 
saw a UFO at a very low level one of the witnesses was Ronnie Norman and he says 
there was just a bunch of damn lights that flooded down I've never seen anything like it 
another witness was Wanda Dees she says they were like big red glowing torches they glowed out there 
for a while then everything went black for about 45 minutes or an hour when they came back on again 
then it went up came back down once again went up again and disappeared 
a third witness is Robert Lane and he says they look like balls of floating fire there was no 
real pattern to them but they stayed in one area as it glided down you could see all the 
trees lighting up over there and when it left it didn't really take off it just sort of disappeared 
so no surprise that these lights were seen over a huge sprawling field of alfalfa near route 522. 
and as it turns out there's some evidence that this object actually landed because 
another witness John de Vivi found a round burnt patch on the ground about 14 feet in diameter 
now some Skeptics tried to explain this away as flares but the witnesses who saw these objects 
disagree particularly Wanda D's who saw these objects moving up and down and up and down which 
flares can't do and they're not going to leave a burned patch on the ground 14 feet in diameter 
it's an interesting case and here hands down is my favorite case of this bunch uh this one 
involves uh landing and humanoid and physical traces it's really interesting this occurred in 
principatal Italy on October 9 1984. now this was investigated by a UFO researcher by the name of 
Umberto telerico and the main witness is a 57 year old farmer by the name of Giuseppe cocozo 
and he was checking his Alfalfa field early in the morning and was actually going to get 
some food for his cow when he saw a strange shark figure very short about three feet tall 
and it looked weird it was wearing a Dark Helmet this figure had a backpack on it with 
tubes reaching up to the helmet and according to Giuseppe the body of this figure looked like it 
was covered with long dark brown hair and freaked him out as Giuseppe says I stood there looking at 
him for a bit and thinking for I have never seen anybody who looked like that so what's interesting 
about this is that this figure was holding this weird device a sort of t-shaped object with two 
points facing to the ground kind of like a rake but definitely not a rake so Giuseppe was quite 
frightened by this figure's strange appearance and at first the figure did not see him so 
Giuseppe coughed to kind of get its attention and it worked the figure turned and looked at Giuseppe 
at this point he Giuseppe could see the guy's face or where the face should be in fact what he saw 
was a silvery visor on this helmet where the eyes would be so at this point he realizes this is not 
a normal person and he decided to sort of back off and as he's kind of walking away but keeping 
his eye on this figure he watched as this figure began to move into some bushes and this is when 
he noticed that this figure had what looked like Flames being emitted from the side of his torso 
and shortly later Giuseppe watches this quote strange craft it was Square shaped actually 
Rose upward darted around landed again further off in the fields then took off 
so he's totally freaked out at this point he runs to his house and gets his gun and returns 
to the scene and this is when he found strange imprints in the ground spaced at regular intervals 
these were apparently Footprints but not normal Footprints as Giuseppe says I found Footprints no 
not Footprints but rather sort of hoof marks so queer truly very queer little hoof marks 
so he follows these tracks and this is when he comes upon an area of crushed grass apparently 
where this craft had landed he called the police who came to investigate and they actually called 
the Italian Air Force who expressed great interest in this case and in fact soil samples were taken 
it did not show any unusual radio activity though the landing spot itself was emitting heat long 
after this object had gone away so this case is also verified by Giuseppe's wife she said that 
neither of them had put much belief in UFOs but when Giuseppe came back into the farm she could 
see that he had been badly frightened now news of this Landing became very well known in the area 
and soon more than a thousand people came to see these holes in the ground created by this craft 
and Giuseppe reports you know that he had a lot of farm animals rabbits chickens turkey geese 
cattle cats and dogs none of them showed any reaction but this is a very interesting case 
of a UFO again Landing in an alfalfa field it's a humanoid a very unusual humanoid and 
some really excellent Landing traces it's quite an unusual case and like I said there's so many 
here's another one which occurred four years later and this is in August 1988 in Elmwood Wisconsin 
that had been a flurry of sightings in Elmwood when Charles and Evelyn Hutchins 
who lived near the intersections of Highways P and D this is in Southwest Dunn County 
they found strange circles in their Alpha fields so Charles Hutchins says and I quote I don't know 
what to make of them Farmers from around here who have farmed this land for a long time have 
never seen anything like this before I don't know what we're dealing with I don't have any idea it's 
pretty strange there doesn't appear to be any kind of pattern to them who knows how they got there 
so these circles and Rings were of different sizes but the width the width of the markings average 
about 10 to 12 inches of the Rings so there was some speculation that uh the people who 
were reporting UFOs were actually seeing Air Force flares but certainly the witnesses don't think so 
and in fact one of the witnesses John dens said that he saw a huge oval-shaped object 
with bright lights on it and that it was so close it frightened his herd of dairy cows 
and another witness said that they saw lights moving over a very large area at extraordinary speed so these could not possibly be flares 
according to the report on this case samples of the Alfalfa were collected for analysis 
but there's no word at least in the article that I found on what the results of these studies were 
definitely an interesting case and here's another really interesting case which occurred in barata 
Nebraska this occurred on October 21st 1990 and the witness main witness is Charlie Kirkendall 
and he was cutting his Alfalfa in his Fields when he found two circles burned into his field 
both circles were an estimated 15 to 18 feet in diameter and the Alfalfa around 
the circles was still green and fresh as was the inside so this was just the outside Rings 
which were about 18 to 20 inches wide that were burned and these were absolute perfect circles 
so what's interesting is uh agricultural expert from the University of Nebraska came to analyze 
the Alfalfa and the soil his name is Gerald hop and his he says I don't think it's anything 
environmental nothing that we know of now he later speculated that these Rings might be 
caused by Violet root rot but he couldn't explain how these would form perfect 360 degree rings and 
not damaging the vegetation inside or outside the Rings now later Charlie cookendall Kirkendall did 
find a third ring and this one measured about 12 feet in diameter and he had no explanation for the 
circles he didn't see anything but word certainly spread about them in fact his neighbor Bud Runyan 
said that a hunter told Bud's son Don that he'd actually seen an object with bright lights land 
some distance Northwest of kirkendall's farm and this was around the same time that these weird 
circles appeared and then Charlie kirkendahl learned that other neighbors including Gary 
Biermann and Chad Scholl had seen lights while working in their own Fields south of Charlie's 
Farm so there is a pretty well corroborated UFO connection here more than 100 people in this area 
came to see these circles and none could explain them none had seen anything like this before 
Charlie Kirkendall himself is not convinced by hops theory of a fungus but he stops short 
of saying aliens are responsible as he says I'm convinced that something hovered over that ground 
I don't think it lit but it burned that field I wish whatever did it would do it again and I 
could see it I'd give anything to see that Earth is a pebble of sand on a beach in the universe 
how do we know what's out there anyone who can explain it please feel free to do so I like 
that Earth is a pebble of sand on a beach in the universe so true but Charlie Kirkendall does admit 
that five years earlier his 22 year old son Mike did see a disc shaped object come within 500 feet 
of their Farmhouse lighting up the whole area before whizzing off towards the Missouri River 
a pretty interesting case and I've just got two more I'd like to cover 
this next one occurred on August 3rd 1992 in Saskatoon this is in Saskatchewan Canada 
and the main Witnesses Phil Phyllis Collins now she didn't see any UFOs but she wonders 
if UFOs were responsible for this strange circle of flattened Alfalfa that she found in her fields 
this circle was about nine feet wide and as Phyllis Collins says I haven't got a clue I don't 
know so they brought some people out to study this and the scientists his name is Herman Austin 
he's a Croc science professor at the University of Saskatoon and he flat out ruled out dust devils 
he's not quite convinced These Are UFOs but as he says some people say they are the work 
of UFOs I don't have an explanation I'd like to see one being formed it's very strange so he has 
seen a number of these in this area and says he's investigated several of them and still has no idea 
how they are being formed as Herman Austin says in his own words it's all a mystery until somebody 
sees something has a good photo or Witnesses a UFO or pranksters or something else causing them 
and now for the final case which occurred actually in Hungary the exact location is 
kiss zenis condoros and this occurred in August 23rd 2000. now I originally found this case in 
Albert rosali's amazing multi-volume books the humanoids Among Us but the original investigator 
of this particular case is a gentleman a researcher by the name of Christan Andre 
he's a quite well-known UFO researcher in Hungary and the witness is an anonymous Alfalfa farmer who 
is on his tractor in his field when he saw a short figure dressed in a tight-fitting red spacesuit 
and it was weird because this figure had what looked like short stubs for hands and the 
witness was quite intrigued by this figure being so short and dressed in this weird tight-fitting 
red space suit that he drove his tractor right up to the figure to get a closer look 
and this figure did not appear to be frightened at all the main witness could see that this figure was only two and a half to three feet tall the witness stops his tractor and get this this little 
figure actually walks around the tractor uh this really kind of freaked the main witness out and he 
drove off and returned With Friends the next day to look for evidence but they didn't find anything 
out of the ordinary nevertheless it's another very interesting case of a humanoid wandering 
around in these Alfalfa fields so weird pretty amazing isn't it cases from all over the world 
not only sightings but Landings and humanoids and yeah very clear from the huge number of cases that 
ETS do have an interest in Alfalfa I think they love it I think they're eating it just like we do 
and I think these cases also provide an enormous amount of evidence in support of 
ET and UFO reality that alone makes them important but I think what's most interesting about them is 
it shows that they're very much like us why else would they be showing an interest in Alfalfa we know it has medicinal properties we know it's a good food source for both humans and 
animals and I think these cases show that they know this too I love the fact that these have 
been occurring for decades upon decades and are occurring all over the world as we have 
seen across Europe across the United States Canada all the way down to South America 
so very widespread from a number of different sources and very well verified 
so that's the show for today I hope that you found it interesting I hope it provides 
some interesting insights into the nature of UFOs and extraterrestrials either way I want 
to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and like I always like to say 
keep searching for the truth keep asking questions and most important keep having fun.
