SEVEN UFO LANDING CASES
Sep 2, 2022

Summary:
Sep 2, 2022
While seeing a UFO is undeniably interesting, far more compelling are cases of UFO landings. In these cases, the extraterrestrial craft are observed from a short distance, virtually removing any chance of misperception. This video presents seven cases from across the United States involving dramatic UFO landings.

CASE ONE: UFO LANDING AT ELY. On June 25, 1964, two brothers were driving from Spring Valley to the town of Ely, Nevada. At some point during the trip, they came upon an object landed directly in the center of the road. George stopped the car and attempted to walk up to the object, causing a surprising reaction from the UFO occupants.

CASE TWO: THE UFO HOUSE. One evening in December 2012, an anonymous couple from Sierra Vista, Arizona stepped outside their home to do some stargazing. Looking at a fenced-in field next to their home, they were amazed to see what appeared to be a small strange-looking structure with only a few windows. It was odd because it hadn't been there earlier in the day. How had it appeared? Puzzled, they didn't think much of it until morning arrived, and they saw something they couldn't understand.

CASE THREE: LANDING IN LUKACHUKAI: One evening in mid-August 1982, three men were driving to the Lukachukai Rodeo in Arizona when they saw a start-like object swoop towards them from above. Later on during the drive, they saw that the object had apparently landed in a ravine alongside the road. They exited the car and observed the object. But as they drove to their location, they were soon to learn that they were not the only witnesses.

CASE FOUR: UFO LANDING IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. In mid-June of 1955, Ted Kittredge was drawn outside his home by the sound of his dogs barking. To his amazement, he saw that a gigantic gold-colored sphere had landed in his front yard. Even more incredible, standing next to it were three seven-foot-tall human-looking ETs who had a message they wanted to share. Todd was even more amazed when he learned that numerous other people in the area reported the same type of encounter.

CASE FIVE: THE OLD WISE ONES. Growing up on a 3000-acre ranch about fifty miles west of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Michael (pseudonym) experienced a series of UFO encounters, culminating in a UFO encounter during which he met a group of seven-foot-tall beings. Michael described them as "very gentle and loving" and says that they give him an important message and warning for all humanity.

CASE SIX: UFO LANDING AT LAS CRUCES. In the summer of 1952, Hilda McAfee and her mother were traveling along Highway 10 from Las Cruces to their home in Deming, New Mexico. Suddenly they saw a blinding blue light ahead of them in the road. Slowing down, they saw a large object landed in the road, and next to it stood two strange-looking humanoids. It was an encounter that would leave them both shaken, not only mentally, but physically.

CASE SEVEN: UFO LANDING IN CONKLIN. On July 16, 1964, Mrs. Travis was in her home in Conklin, New York, when her two sons, Edmund (age nine) and Randy (age seven), and their three friends announced that they had seen a spaceman, and needed to bring him a jar of water. When questioned about this, the children said a silvery object had landed in the field, and a short humanoid approached them. Questioned separately by the adults, the children stuck to their story.

These seven cases are just a few of the many, many UFO landing cases on record. If you would like to learn more about these cases and many others, check out my books, "UFOs over Arizona," "UFOs over Colorado," "UFOs over Nevada," "UFOs over New Mexico," and "UFOs over New York."

Introduction
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos on the paranormal 
today i'd like to talk about ufo landing cases sightings are certainly very interesting but far 
more interesting and compelling i think are cases in which the objects actually land this is usually 
involving very close up encounters so the chances of misperception are virtually zero and also it 
doesn't involve a lot of the controversies that surround onboard experiences and by that i mean 
missing time and the use of regressive hypnosis so today's episode i call seven ufo landing cases i'm 
gonna do various readings from my books that i've published on ufos over various states 
and i chose cases that i think are unique or provide a lot of information or credibility 
or are unusual in some way and provide some insights into the ufo phenomena 
so let's just get started in the first case i'd like to talk about i call ufo landing at ellie 
nevada on june 25 1964 rancher george w rock rogers and his brother bert were driving from 
UFO Landing at Ellie Nevada
their home in spring valley to the town of ellie nevada and at some point between the two towns 
they noticed a strange looking object ahead of them it was hovering about four feet high 
alongside the road and at first they could only see the top half of the object as the bottom half 
was obscured by the brush and they speculated that maybe a jeep had fallen off the road but as the 
two men drew closer to the object it suddenly rose up and then descended landing right in the center 
of the road they described the object as having a bulged curved pyramid-shaped top that tapered 
down to a two foot long slender pedestal which the object apparently used as a kind of landing gear 
this may have actually been a beam of light it's hard to say but they to them it looked 
like it was composed of some kind of shiny metal or plastic and this entire object spun rapidly but 
remained in the same location they said there was a strange red insignia on one side of the object 
but the witnesses were unable to read it because of the objects spinning motions so this has some 
similarities to the famous lonnie zamora socorro new mexico landing at any rate george rogers 
jumped out of the car and ran up to touch the object however as soon as he got close he made a 
loud humming noise and zoomed 10 feet up into the air landing back down 40 feet ahead on the highway 
and he ran forward again and tried to approach the object with the same result 
this object lifted up again and moved farther away and george rogers did the same thing another three 
times and on each occasion this object increased in noise and hopped further ahead on the highway 
as george later told ufo researchers it occurred to me that i was fooling around with something 
that i didn't know anything about bert was yelling for me to get away from that thing 
i decided that was pretty good advice so i went back and got into the car it was at that point 
that the object rose slowly and then zoomed away to the east over a ridge and off into 
the distance this case was researched by frank edwards the ufo researcher and was also published 
in the le record newspaper on july 1st of that year so it's a very interesting case where ufo 
lands in the middle of the road the second case i'd like to talk about i call the ufo house 
UFO House
and this took place in sierra vista arizona it's a very unusual case i love this case because it's 
so unusual it was around 9 45 p.m one december evening in 2012 when a lady and her husband who 
are anonymous stepped outside of their home in sierra vista arizona before bedtime to look at 
the stars and instead their attention was drawn to a field nearby their house and as one of the 
witnesses says and i quote we were only out there about a minute before we noticed what 
appeared to us to be a single unit mobile home or rectangular shaped house in the field across 
the street this field is totally fenced in and there has been nothing there for several years 
so the couple was completely mystified because they hadn't heard or seen anything and it was as 
if this house this strange looking house had just magically shown up as one of the witnesses says 
there appeared to be a door with the window on each side lights were on but the house or object 
appeared to be empty we just sat there discussing how odd it was that we never saw it being moved in 
or how quickly electricity seemed to be hooked up but shook it off and went to bed so the next 
morning the couple woke up and got an incredible shock this house was gone in fact there was no 
evidence that it had ever been there the field was still totally fenced in and as the witness says 
we don't know for sure what it was but it was very very odd to this day every time we drive by 
we always look at the fencing to see how someone could have pulled in a trailer and there is no 
way so it was two years after the incident they were still mystified that the couple 
decided to report their case to mufon and this is mufon case number 60151
they believe it could have been a ufo the third case i'd like to talk about 
UFO Landing at Lukachukai
also took place in arizona and i call this ufo landing at luka chukai 
it's a very interesting and unusual case which i think you'll find quite compelling 
this next case was also reported to mufon it's mufon case number nine three zero
and it was researched by mufon field investigator richard d seyfried this occurred in mid-august of 
1982 in the early morning hours at around 1 45 a.m the main witness chris that's a pseudonym 
was traveling with his father and his father's friends to the luka chukai rodeo 
this is about 10 miles north of town when they saw a star-like object moving through the sky 
and without warning the object approached them it came within a hundred feet when it suddenly 
sparkled and disappeared leaving only a hazy cloud and wondering if they had seen a meteor or 
something else unexplained they drove another five miles when they came upon a mysterious glowing 
light coming from inside a canyon that dropped off to the left of the road so they decided to 
investigate they drove to the top of a hill and pulled over to take a look and despite standing on 
top of the truck the source of the light was just out of sight until chris's father put him on top 
of his shoulders only then did chris see an actual object it appeared to be landed he couldn't be 
sure but he was intrigued he wanted to hike down the canyon but his father was nervous about hiking 
at night in such a rough area and meanwhile their friend had become frightened and retreated to the 
truck so they watched the globe for only a few minutes and then drove away but this is not the 
end of the story there's a very interesting end note once they reached the town they pulled into 
a convenience store and chris's father told the clerk you won't believe what i just saw 
the clerk listened and then provided some very interesting information he told them that an 
entire family had stopped by his store earlier that evening and were quote very frightened 
they told the clerk that a strange object had landed on their property and it scared them 
so bad that they fled their home and went to the convenience store to call the authorities 
so it seems pretty likely that that was the same object the fourth case i'd like to talk about i 
UFO Landing in the San Fernando Valley
chose for a couple of reasons one is because it took place really just a few miles from where 
i've lived for many years in the san fernando valley in california and i call this case ufo 
landing in the san fernando valley california and involved not only one landing but a series of 
landings involving several witnesses this series of landings was investigated by prominent southern 
california researcher itabel epperson and this involved an amazing series of contacts with tall 
human-like ets it took place in the summer of 1955 directly in the heart of the san fernando 
valley it was sometime in mid-june 1955 when ted kittredge a young electrician from van nuys told 
reporters that he was awakened in the middle of the night by the barking of his dogs exiting his 
home he was amazed to see a gigantic gold-colored sphere landed in his front yard and standing next 
to it were three seven foot tall human looking figures he says they were very friendly they had 
long flowing hair and spoke flawless english quote as if they had memorized thousands of 
conversations and were repeating the words on tape so cutridge was very much impressed and as he says 
i quote the three men approached me without hesitation and told me not to be frightened 
i was really scared in fact the whole thing seemed like a dream only i know it wasn't several other 
people in the valley had seen the same thing even talked with the men i just hope i never see it 
again that's all so they left him with a few messages and were gone and what's really 
interesting is that there were several other witnesses in fact it was only one month later 
on july 20th 1955 when three separate independent witnesses reported seeing a ufo and its occupants 
and this occurred in panorama city which is directly adjacent to van nuys and appears 
to be connected to todd ketrich's encounter and according to the report a huge ball shaped object 
landed in a field near the witness's home and the witnesses observed three beings approximately 
six to eight feet in height with long blonde hair and clothes clothed in tight green 
suits and two of the witnesses reported that these beings made gestures of friendship 
so this is described exactly like cottridge described what he saw so it appears that these 
were in fact the same ets the next case i'd like to talk about i call the old wise ones 
The Old Wise Ones
and this involves a series of encounters including face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials and 
of course landings and this took place in a very large ranch just west of colorado springs colorado 
and i think you'll find this one very interesting this case involves a gentleman i call michael 
that's a pseudonym he grew up on a 3 000 acre ranch about 50 miles west of colorado springs 
and for as long as he could remember there was something very strange about the ranch as michael 
says and i quote there was an area on the ranch that you could not go to horses would refuse to 
go into this area and if i forced the issue they would go crazy and start bucking i never 
could walk into that range of small mountains if i did a very strange overpowering fear would sweep 
over me until i turned around and crossed that invisible boundary and instantly it would go away 
so over the years using the horses michael soon learned exactly where the border of this area was 
and it never changed he was baffled by this mystery but soon learned what this area was 
hiding it was on christmas eve 1960 michael was 16 years old he woke up at 2 30 a.m to see a strange 
dark object descending toward the meadow behind his house it was so bright it was lighting up the 
entire valley where the ranch was located and even though it was 20 degrees below zero with 
three feet of snow outside michael couldn't resist taking a closer look as he says and i quote i 
stepped outside on the porch in my long johns and gazed up what i saw i'll never forget a massive 
black rectangular shaped object just floated over our meadow i ran back into the house 
jumped into my coats and snow boots and took off running across the meadow toward the craft 
so in a few moments michael stood directly under the craft he estimates it hovered about 300 feet 
high and that it was about 1500 feet long 500 feet wide and 300 feet thick as he says 
what was very strange about this was the entire time i was looking at it i felt safe and somehow 
knew that they were mining for minerals he stood under this object for as long as he could 
the object remained totally still and feeling the cold seeping into his clothes michael was forced 
to retreat inside so he now wondered at this point if the et's were somehow connected to the area of 
the ranch where none of the horses or cows would go as he says it was common knowledge about that 
location it was a family joke that we always knew where the cattle and the horses weren't when i was 
a kid i would take friends to the borderline and we would run into the area in an attempt to try 
and tease the aliens i found out in short order that they were not amused i began having terrible 
nightmares i knew it was them so i went back to the boundary line and i shouted to them that i 
was sorry and i wouldn't bother them again that night the nightmares ended and so did my trips to 
that area but it wasn't long before michael had a face-to-face encounter with these apparent aliens 
as he says and again i quote you might say i've grown up with the aliens 
i've seen them some look like us others the old wise ones are on the average seven feet tall with 
elongated skulls and blue translucent bodies they are trillions of years older than we are 
and are very gentle and loving i have had two of them appear before me from time to time 
to check in on me they watched me grow up as the only child on our huge very isolated ranch 
i could always feel them protecting me when i was alone in the forest 
they love us and consider us their children they have come back now to help us through what 
is coming they will soon introduce themselves to the world as in many other cases of contact 
michael says he has been given warnings of upcoming disasters as he says and i quote they 
have showed me what is coming a global nuclear war that will destroy nearly all of america 
europe russia and china michael says that another alien faction is controlling the new world order 
in 1989 he says he traveled to venezuela where he had another encounter with the blue beings and 
they told him that there is an underground city beneath the jungles of venezuela inhabited by a 
group of aliens who are preparing to help humanity survive the upcoming disasters they told him the 
city will be a center of growth and knowledge and that is safeguarded by a protective energetic dome 
which will keep it safe during the wars as he says tesla marconi and volcanelli were involved 
and i have personally met two high-ranking venezuelan officers who interface with the city 
the new world order knows full well about the city but they are powerless to do anything about it 
and michael says because of this city venezuela will be the target of growing aggression from 
the new world order and as he says and i quote if you want a good timeline watch very carefully what 
happens between venezuela and the new world order so i find this very interesting because recently 
venezuela has been having all kinds of unrest and political problems so make of that case 
what you will but i thought it was very interesting and michael reported his case to mufon 
UFO Landing at Las Cruces
the next case i'd like to talk about i call ufo landing at las cruces new mexico 
this is a somewhat famous case though i'm guessing a lot of you haven't heard of it 
and i think this is a case that's important enough that everyone should know about it and that's why 
i wanted to include it in this episode one evening in june or july of 1952 hilda mcafee who was then 
in her late 50s and her elderly mother were driving from las cruces to their home in deming 
new mexico they were about 23 miles east of deming on interstate 10 when they saw a blinding blue 
light ahead of them in their lane hilda slowed down and pulled around and alongside the object 
and as they drove by the women were shocked to see two strange looking figures standing directly 
underneath a brightly lit object the figures were five and a half feet tall muscular looking 
and wore identical bulky pale blue uniforms with helmets gloves wide belts and calf length boots 
they paid no attention to hilda and her mother as they drove by one had his back turned to them and 
appeared to be working on something while the other stood in a rigid stiff posture the woman 
also saw three black five-inch thick rods next to the two figures after they passed the object the 
woman looked behind them and were amazed to see that the object had extinguished its lights and 
they speculated that the lights had been turned on to prevent them from colliding into the object 
following this incident both women suffered some unusual symptoms including pains in their chest 
arms and bones and at first they kept their encounter a complete secret in fact 
it was many years later after the travis walton abduction on november 5 1975 in snowflake arizona 
that hilda mcafee decided to reveal her encounter because as it turns out hilda was the landlady of 
cheney rogers who was brother to mike rogers one of the witnesses to the travis walton abduction 
case and it was this connection that finally prompted her to go public with her own experience 
and the last case i'd like to talk about today i call ufo landing in conklin new york this 
UFO Landing in Catskill New York
involves a small group of young children all of who witnessed a landed ufo and an extraterrestrial 
it's quite an interesting case fairly well known within the ufo community i think you'll find it 
quite interesting on the afternoon of july 16 1964 miss travis was in her home in conklin new york 
while outside her two children edmund who is nine years old and randy who is seven years old 
and their three friends floyd moore billy dunlap and his brother gary dunlap were all playing 
in a nearby field surrounded by huckleberry bushes suddenly three of the boys rushed into 
miss travis's house and requested a large jar of water and miss travis asked why 
and they said quote we are taking water over to the space man and seeing that 
the children were excited and serious an adult was sent after the other two children 
and they were found walking home from the field and when asked they denied seeing any spaceman 
was clear to the adults however that they were lying and concealing the truth about what they saw 
so the adults separated the five children and questioned each of them about what they had seen 
and one by one they revealed an incredible story and in fact when they were cross-examined and 
threatened with punishment for lying they broke into tears but refused to retract their claims the 
boys said that they were playing in the field when they suddenly noticed a small human-looking man 
wearing a black suit and a black helmet the helmet had a transparent visor over the eyes 
antenna-like wires on top and it was decorated with unidentified symbols or letters and this 
little man kept making strange hollow noises which they said was similar to a kazoo and at 
this point the boys noticed a large object landed in the field they described it as shiny like a car 
bumper they said so apparently silvery metallic like chrome and this spaceman walked up to this 
silvery object hopped up on top of it and at this point one of the children asked the little man if 
he needed help or if he would like some water and this figure responded by falling backwards from 
the top of the vehicle and it was at this point the children the children ran to go get some water 
and when they returned to the spot this craft and the spacemen were gone however in the field this 
was verified by the adults there was an area of crushed grass and three large depressions in the 
soil where the craft had landed a very interesting multi-witness case so those are the seven cases 
Outro
i wanted to present to you today and as you can see they are each unique in their own way 
each providing some interesting insights into the nature of the ufo phenomenon they 
were taken from my books ufos over arizona euros over california new york colorado and nevada and 
i think each of these cases are just the tip of the iceberg the number of ufo landings is 
far more uh numerous than people realize there are hundreds upon hundreds of them so these 
seven cases here are again just the tip of the iceberg so i hope you've enjoyed this episode i 
truly appreciate you watching so thank you very much for that and until next time keep having fun
