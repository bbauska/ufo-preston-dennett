UFOS FAST & FURIOUS: UFO-CAR ENCOUNTERS
Apr 21, 2023

Summary:
Apr 21, 2023
Imagine you’re driving along a remote highway late at night when you see a glowing object ahead of you right above the road. As you approach, you can see that it’s actually a saucer-shaped craft, a UFO! Suddenly, the UFO swoops down towards your car and starts following you down the highway. It circles around your car, hovering right above it, on either side, coming closer and closer. Your radio becomes filled with static, your headlights dim, and the car engine begins to sputter. Then the UFO takes control of the car!

This may sound incredible, but it happens more often than you might think. In fact, there are hundreds of UFO-car chases on record, coming from all over the world. These are among the most dramatic of UFO encounters. They have been occurring since at least the 1950s up to the present day. For some reason, UFOs love to play cat-and-mouse games with unwary drivers who suddenly find themselves driving fast and furiously to outrun a UFO that chases them down the highway, sometimes for hours!

The question is why? What exactly is it about people driving cars down highways late at night that attracts so many UFOs? This video presents dozens of cases of UFO car chases, from the 1950s onward, and coming from all across the planet. Here are a few of them.

1952: Gene Povey and two others are driving through the remote Storms River Pass in south Africa. Coming around a corner, they see a UFO blocking the road. The UFO zooms toward the car, forcing the driver to swerve to avoid it. The interior of the car lights up as bright as day. The UFO darts off, but little do they know their encounter has only just begun.

1967: A bus-driver is hauling a load of titanium along the A32 Highway near Reading, England. Without warning the engine to his bus dies. He notices a large object hovering above the road ahead of him. He gets the engine started and moves forward when the engine dies again. The object is now much closer. Afterward, the man’s hands and fingers are numb and a persistent toothache disappears.

1970: Reidar Salvesen is driving late at night to Kristiansand, Norway when a UFO approaches and swoops down ahead of him. He stops the car to observe when the craft zooms forward and hovers right over the hood. He falls to the ground, the windshield shatters and the object lifts up. Afterwards, his vision is altered, his mouth and tongue are numb, and the skin on his hands is burned to the point of peeling.

1972: The Hall family is returning to their home in Thief River Falls, MN. Mr. Hall notices a light pacing their car. They use a flashlight to blink at the craft, and it starts blinking back at them! Then, the object zooms towards their car, sending down a beam of light on them. The radio quits, the engine starts coughing, and a powerful heat envelops the witnesses. Mrs. Hall, who had a bad cold, realizes that her cold is gone!

1978: Three truckers are driving along the I-70 near Indianapolis, IN when a brilliant blue-white light shines down from above, causing all three truck engines to sputter. The beam lasts for about five seconds, then disappears. But when one of the trucks calls out on the CB, “Hey, UFO, if you have your ears on, I want to go with you,” the beam of light returns. The incident is witnessed by more than 100 people!

1981: Linda Brown and two others are driving along the I-93 near Meredith, NH when they notice a UFO pacing their car. Scared, they exit the freeway and drive to a gas-station. The UFO follows and drops down to 100 feet right over the station, where it hovers in place. After ten minutes, Linda drives away, and the UFO continues to follow them.

1982: Frances Collins and Maggie Yeend are driving late at night along the remote South Coast Highway in Australia. Suddenly an object drops down from the sky right in front of their car and zooms towards them in a collision course. For the next hour, the object follows them down the highway, scaring the daylight out of them.

1984: Carolyn Green and her son Timothy are driving along Highway 85 in Seven Points, TX when a UFO appears overhead and begins to wreak havoc with their car. The lights of their car begin flashing on and off by themselves and the UFO appears to take control of the car, which is now driving by itself.

1985: Ezio Zuliani, his wife and son notice a strange light following their car as they travel to their home in Bergamo, Italy. The object follows them for three hours, getting closer and closer. When they pull into a gas station, the object drops down and hovers right above them, in full view of several witnesses. When they leave the station, the object still follows them!

These are just a small sampling of the many cases of UFO-car chases. It appears that the UFO occupants are intentionally chasing cars down highways to announce their presence and let people know they are real! It’s certainly an experience that the witnesses will never forget!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal I call this episode UFOs Fast and Furious UFO car encounters 
as you may know UFOs have a penchant for following cars down remote highways usually late at night 
there are literally hundreds of cases of this kind not only of UFO's following cars but hovering 
right over them circling around them causing the car engines to stall the electrical systems to 
fail there are many cases involving physiological effects as well and the question is why are they 
doing this and that's why I wanted to present this episode to you today to sort of take a deeper look 
at these UFO car chases and figure out what's going on here what is the intention behind this 
I have dozens of cases and I'd like to present them to you in a sort of chronological way these 
cases are coming from all over the world they reach back to the 1950s earlier I think but I'm 
the cases I'm going to present to you today reach from the 1950s through the 60s and 70s and up to 
the late 1980s and this should just be considered a small sampling of the actual number of cases 
because there are literally hundreds of these cases in the UFO literature 
and as I said I think they have something important to say about the ETS and frankly about us as well so let's just get started the first case I'd like to cover comes from researcher 
Cynthia Hind and it's actually quite a harrowing case this occurred late one evening in 1952 
Gene povey his sister and her friend were driving from George Cape Province to Port Elizabeth South 
Africa traffic was unusually light that evening when they were driving through the storms River 
Pass and coming around a corner they saw a bright light blocking the road Gene shouted out look out 
and he swerved the car towards the retaining wall to prevent them from driving off the cliff 
as he says I remember shouting to the girls hold on and duck when this bright light came straight 
at us it seemed to just skim over the Bonnet the hood lighting the interior of the car as bright 
as day it shook the vehicle and With An Almighty Roar was gone we just sat there too stunned to say 
a word and needless to say the only thing through our in our minds was to get the hell out of there 
so Jean said that he could actually feel the electricity coming from this object and all his hair on his body stood on end his car was now stalled and it took him quite a while to 
get it started he said he had to really battle at it and when he finally did they raced away 
as fast as they could they drove for many miles wondering about what had happened and they had 
just reached the ear area about 25 miles from the city of humansdorp When the UFO returned 
as Gene says in his own words guess what was traveling towards us taking up the whole width 
of the road and just skimming the road like a bat out of hell with no place to go we just 
had time to pull off the road and pray that it missed us well I can tell you try and get 
three people under the dashboard I know that I was Tangled Up with the clutch and brake pedals 
I do remember that just before diving for cover I saw that the thing seemed to change direction and 
come straight at us it zoomed over the vehicle missing by their proverbial hair breath and as 
before lighting up the interior of the car and climbed steeply up and disappeared into the sky 
this time they only heard a whooshing noise and this object was gone so this is a typical 
example of a UFO car chase and here's another one this next one occurred on April 5th 1967 when a 
gentleman a Justice of the piece was driving along Route 72 near John Johnstown Pennsylvania 
the witness's name is John R demler and he was driving along when his car engine 
started to sputter it happened first once then twice and then three times finally stopping 
and then his headlights dimmed out and went off it was then that John saw a 30-foot wide desk 
coming 30 feet high right over the road ahead of him and it flew right over his car he said and 
then stopped right alongside it at this point you could hear what sounded like an electric motor he 
saw a sparking coming off the craft and he also said he smelled a very strong and unpleasant odor 
something like sulfur or camphorated oil despite the object tilted and accelerated 
away at such speed that according to John he said his car quote seemed to be pulled to it 
his car rocked and then settled down with such force that it was actually thrown across the sea 
and the next day he still felt the after effects he was in a state of nervous shock he said his 
whole body sweated profusely and that portions of his skin peeled off of his hands and feet 
so this is a case that not only involves electromagnetic effects but physiological effects 
not to mention emotions many of these car cases are really quite dramatic certainly this next 
one is this next case occurred on October 26 1967 along the a32 highway in Reading England 
an anonymous bus driver was actually hauling a ton of machined titanium casings along the 
highway towards reading he had just passed the a30 intersection at hook in Hampshire when his 
electrical system mysteriously failed and the engine died so he got out of his vehicle opened 
the hood and examined it but saw nothing wrong he got back in it into the car and then saw at this 
point a dark object hovering motionless over the road ahead of him he really wasn't paying too much 
attention to it he was trying to get his vehicle started and it wouldn't start but after several 
tries it finally did and he began driving again but traveled only about 400 yards down the highway 
when the engine failed again so again he got out of the bus at this point he says he felt a 
strange pressure on his eardrums as if descending rapidly in altitude and he also smelled a powerful 
electric odor he inspected the engine and noticed nothing wrong he confirmed that this weird odor 
was not coming from his engine and looking up he now clearly saw this same object was now much 
closer he says about 50 to 100 feet straight ahead of him hovering right above the road he estimates 
it was about 60 feet wide and 30 feet tall with a dull metallic surface was totally silent and he 
watched it for several minutes when it moved horizontally away and off into the distance 
at this point he resumed his trip but he said he felt quite strange there was 
a numbness in his hands and feet and had a real difficult time controlling and moving his limbs 
and here's another weird thing he thought he would arrive 20 minutes late given that he was 
interrupted by this UFO but was surprised to find that he arrived actually 15 minutes early 
he dropped off his Freight and returned and got another surprise he found that he actually used 
three gallons more petrol on the return Journey than he did on the way there and this was strange 
because it was the exact same distance and actually on the return Journey he had a lighter load so I'm not sure how to explain that but there is a very strange Final End note to this case 
because at the time the witness was suffering from a bad toothache but following this experience his 
toothache completely disappeared so this is a case of a healing he does attribute this 
healing to the appearance of this UFO those not sure how it happened perhaps it's something to do 
with the field of energy coming from this object I don't know it's hard to say but it's another case 
involving not only electromagnetic effects but physiological effects and that weird smell again 
and here's another case moving forward to October 19 1970. this is a really dramatic 
case which occurred in Norway a man was driving on the road e 18 from Stavanger to christiansond 
in Norway and he had just passed the city of Holland the witness's name is reader salvation 
and he was driving at night when a bright light from his right and above Shone down 
on him was so brilliant it blinded him he could not see the road ahead of him 
and this thing swooped down and hovered over his car he estimates it was about 60 feet wide 
so quite large and as the witness says in his own words I opened the door and looked up I will 
never forget what I saw about 10 meters above an object round shiny and smooth was hovering 
which resembled descriptions I have seen of flying saucers it stopped there in the air 
without any motion or noise at all I stopped the motor and got out standing by the side of the car 
the object moved forward and stopped almost as though sliding in front of the car 
it was very close to him at this point and without warning reader's legs mysteriously collapsed under 
him he couldn't account for this he felt no pain he says he felt no fear it all happened so 
quickly but for some reason he just collapsed at the same moment his windshield shattered 
he quickly stood back up and washed this object lift straight up and hovered high in the sky 
for a few moments and then darted off at high speed he drove directly home and told his wife 
and he said that after the experience his mouth and tongue felt numb and for a week afterwards 
his eyes were sore and very sensitive to light the only other effect he noticed at first was 
a small cut on his hand where he tried to break his fall but he did notice that his 
hands seemed burned almost like sunburned and the day after the skin on his hands peeled off 
so that's just like the previous case now he had no interest in publicity but he did tell a friend 
who finked on him and informed a reporter and this made the case become quite well known 
and investigating the man's car it did discover the windshield was completely gone shattered 
but I also found a dull spot just on the roof above the windshield and also the clock in his 
car malfunctioned but later worked fine and as a reader the main witness wrote 
I think it's impossible that it was a non-manned vehicle stopped with Precision right over the 
car and slid a few meters so that I had an ideal position from which to view it 
the object was very beautiful it was pleasing to study its construction in my opinion a perfect one 
so yeah these are very close encounters so there's no possibility of misperception going on here 
and here's another case this one occurred also in England 
on May 25 1971 Eunice Rose was driving along the road between odd and stone and Hinckley in England 
she was in front of the belcher's bar Junction near Highway a447 when she saw a bright glow 
ahead of her on the highway now she didn't think anything of it until she turned right at the belcher's bar Junction and this is when her radio began to fade and then completely died away 
following this her headlights dimmed and her car began to lose power 
and this is when she now saw that this mysterious light was to her left 
she pressed down the accelerator but didn't seem to work the engine sputtered and the car came 
to a stop the engine was still running but it was sputtering and had no power 
and as the car interior began to fill with light she realized that this object which had been about 
a hundred feet away was now moving closer and as she watched and went directly over her car 
and as she said time seemed to stand still when it was right over her car all her hair stood on 
end and she watched it move off to the right and could now see that it was a glowing saucer 
shaped she estimates it was about 35 feet off the ground and once it got about 300 feet away 
her headlights and radio came back on followed by her car engine she had no real fear but she 
was quite nervous and still seeing this light moving along she decided to race Away Home 
she did find out later that there was another witness to UFOs in this area at that time but 
even more interesting was what happened when she returned home she told her family and her 
ten-year-old son was very intrigued because he said that right after she had left the house that 
evening he saw a light a strange light shining in his window and he assumed it was a car coming up 
their driveway but rushing to the window when he looked nothing was there so that could have 
been the UFO actually following her I don't know it's hard to say but they thought it was unusual 
in so many cases here's an interesting case from northern Sweden which occurred on the E4 Road near 
ajabin it was late at night on September 20 1971 when the main witness Sten Stewart Cedar noticed 
strange beams of vertical light shining down in front of them you first thought it might be the 
northern lights but it clearly wasn't and looking behind them he saw that these beams were actually 
encircling his car so he put the brakes on but as he says and I quote the car continued to move 
forward then everything became black around me completely blue black the Blackness seemed to be 
a dense floating mass of smoke that lay around me so that it was impossible to see anything 
so whatever this was it was so dense that his headlights couldn't pierce it at this point he felt an increased sense of atmospheric pressure just like that other guy did 
he put the car in first gear and at this point he came out of the Blackness he saw that he was about 
600 feet further ahead on the road but these weird light beams were still surrounding him 
and he could now see that this weird Black Mass was ahead of him and rising up from the ground 
I was quite some distance away about a half mile and he estimates it was about 30 feet 
wide and he watched it move up and off into the distance he hesitated to report this to 
anyone but interested to see if there were other Witnesses he finally decided he would 
he reported to the newspaper and discovered that there were in fact two others who had also reported the same sort of object in the same area he went back to the section of road 
but found no evidence of what had occurred it's a very strange case and here's another this next one 
occurred during a road trip from Tolstoy Manitoba in Canada to Thief River Falls in Minnesota 
it was a Saturday evening in August 1972 Mr Hall his wife and their four kids were traveling on 
vacation along Route 59 from Tolstoy to Thief River Falls when he noticed a very bright light 
now his wife who had a bad cold at the time didn't really look at it and just 
told him oh it's probably a radio tower he accepted that explanation but he watched 
the slide for about 10 minutes and realized it was pacing his car it was moving closer 
and they started to look at it in renewed interest and were discussing what it might be 
when it suddenly zoomed directly towards their car and as Mr Hall says in his own words 
it lit up the interior of the car brighter than daylight and all the children woke up 
I told my youngest Wayne to use the flashlight in Flash four times short flashes and immediately 
the object flashed back four times my wife then took the flashlight and sent a series of long 
flashes and short ones immediately thereafter the object did exactly the same this time coming even 
closer to the car at this time the car radio started to act up and the engine began to 
sputter and cough meanwhile the interior of the car grew very hot and the engine quit completely 
so the car at this point was slowing down by itself so Mr Hall pulled over all of them were 
quite scared especially his wife and children but Mr Hall said he was also very much intrigued 
and as he says when I got out of the car the UFO was directly overhead it was very 
bright and I felt a kind of prickly sensation all over my body like small electric shocks 
so he opened the car hood and instructed his wife to start the engine the engine didn't turn over but Sparks were jumping from the spark plugs across the coil to the side of the car 
as Mr Hall says I am a Master Mechanic and believe me I have never seen anything like this in my life 
so this was a very unusual electromagnetic effect at this point another vehicle began 
to approach and as it drew near Mr Hall tried to flag them down but at the same 
time this object darts quickly up until it's a tiny little point in the scar in the sky 
and it looked just like a star the other car refused to stop just zoomed right past them 
at this point Mr Hall's wife was able to start the car which ran normally so Mr hall closed the hood 
got back in and they took off at which point the UFO dropped down again and began to Pace 
them again as Mr Hall says my wife flashed our flashlight at the object again and we received 
the same signal back so they stopped the car again at which point they could now see that 
this object was a large disc and as they watched something incredible happened this 
large disc immediately released three smaller discs which started off in opposite directions 
large disc then wobbled and then darted away in two seconds and was gone so this was quite 
a long event as Mr Hall says we washed the object for two hours and we were never harmed in any way 
the object just just stayed still in the night sky I much describe my feelings as I stood there 
looking at the Magnificent machine that I am sure must have traveled from another world 
and who knows how far after we were again on our way my wife who was most of the time very quiet 
suddenly said that her cold was completely gone and that she felt really good so what an amazing 
case not only are there electromagnetic effects but multiple physiological effects uh his he felt 
these sort of electric shocks and she had a bad cold which disappeared immediately following this 
encounter so this is another case of a UFO healing and all of them saw it it's a really amazing case 
here's another case this is in 1976 and it occurred occurred in Murray France 
the main witness is Monsieur Cyrus and he was driving at night when he saw a dark 
object glinting in the Moonlight and it was just above the road directly ahead of him 
and right after he noticed it the object lit up and glided smoothly directly towards his car and 
then tilted to show its Underside towards him and in fact it went directly over the hood of his car 
right over it about two to three feet up and blazed it with a brilliant light 
so this was very much obviously intentional the subject then shot straight up until it became a 
star-like object and what's really interesting is there was another driver about 450 feet 
away and he watched this whole thing happen he actually thought the witness's car had exploded 
and so he drove up and helped Mr Cyrus get out of his car and they watched this object pulsated 
sent on a beam of light on to Mr Cyrus's car he was in a complete shock and drove home in a daze 
he told his wife and fell instantly to sleep which he says is quite unusual for him 
and when he woke in the morning he noticed that he had some vision problems he had 
black spots in front of his eyes though this cleared up after two days and concerned he 
made a report to the police and it was then that he learned that there were two additional Witnesses besides the other driver who had watched the whole thing happen
these cases are coming from all over the world here's a case which occurred in mid-December 
1976 to two ambulance drivers from White Horse this is in the Yukon Canada area Tom Banks and 
Kenneth shofield were traveling along the Alaska highway to pick up a patient and transport him 
to Whitefield General Hospital without warning while they're on the Alaska Highway a glowing 
object dropped down from the sky and began to Pace their ambulance they radioed police to say 
that they were being followed because this object was following them this UFO came very close at 
one point and their electrical system began to malfunction including the ambulance siren lights 
after fiddling with it for a while they finally got it to work at which point the UFO seemed to 
be attracted to it and came swooping down over them buzzing the ambulance by only a few feet 
and his ambulance driver Kenneth shofield says we saw what we thought at first was a bright star it 
seemed stationary then all of a sudden it was right down over our area in no time and as he 
said it moved quote like nothing we had witnessed before that followed them they said for about 20 
minutes would dart back and forth come first to the left and then the right it was at very low 
altitude and little did they know other Witnesses were seeing UFOs in that area at the same time 
and further investigation revealed that only months earlier at least three truck drivers 
driving along the same area of Highway along the Alaska Highway heading for white horse 
so that they were followed by a UFO for several miles and in fact some of them would pull into the 
waste way scale station and this object was also seen by the gentleman who worked there Bill Bowers 
so apparently there's something about this stretch of highway that is attracting UFOs
here's another really interesting case which occurred in Galva Iowa 
while driving to his home in Galva Iowa on the evening of April 13 1977. 
Kevin King who at that time was a sophomore in high school was driving to his home just east 
of Galva he came over a hill and saw four colored lights over the road about 300 feet ahead of him 
and I'll just let Kevin describe in his own words what happened as he says just after I noticed it 
it changed directions and started heading right for me when I first saw it was going north 
and the lights were on top then it flipped over and started coming towards me as it got closer 
it came lower and lower and started moving real slow you could see now that it was a 
disc shape and as it started to approach him he stopped his car and turned off the engine 
and as Kevin says I was too scared to get out of the car I just sat there it was as wide as the 
road and went about two feet over my head it was moving real slow like it was studying something 
so Kevin said it was close enough that he if he had stood on his car he could have easily 
touched it and he watched him move off to a Grove of trees and then Dart off little did 
he know that there were other Witnesses Deb Bush pictured here and at least two others also saw it 
saying that it was just above the Treetops so low that they actually thought it might crash 
so reporters interviewed the witnesses and actually called Offutt Air Force Base in 
Nebraska who denied any knowledge of the case but Lieutenant havelka told reporters 
and this is interesting quote if a UFO had been spotted in your area it would be listed 
as classified information and you wouldn't have any need to know anyway more evidence of 
a cover-up in my opinion and here's another case this one occurred near thaxted England 
was on August 9 1977 Mike Stevens a postman and part-time musician was driving along on the a-130 
road just past the town of thaxted when he noticed an unusual red orange glow alongside the road 
and as he approached he realized that this was unusual and he pulled over and saw two 
objects about one thousand feet away one was slightly closer than the other and they were 
hovering about 50 feet above the ground one brightened and dimmed the close one and the 
other one seemed to move up slightly at this point the closer object began to move towards him 
at this point he realized that the objects were quite strange he was the only one on the road this 
was a quite remote area and it was clear to him that these objects were showing an interest in him 
so he became concerned about that and got back into his car and intended to speed off however 
when he pressed on the accelerator the car would not accelerate and he said even when 
he put the accelerator all the way down to the floor the car would not go any faster 
and this strange effect remained for about 400 yards when suddenly the engine kicked in the 
car surged forward at high speed he nearly ran off the road he jammed on the brakes 
and then quickly drove off and went to the police to report his sighting 
and here's where it gets really interesting UFO investigators heard about this case and 
they decided to inspect his car and his car revealed some very strange magnetic anomalies 
they got another identical car same make and model and used it as a control sample 
and using a compass they made very different magnetic readings as you can see here 
Mike's car was clearly affected in some way by the close proximity of this object 
it's a very interesting case and here's another one this one took place near canon in Vermont 
and this was on the evening of August 4 1977.
the main witness is Pauline pair age 23 and her mother Miss Irving Matthew pictured here and they 
were driving home after shopping when they said a UFO dropped down just a few feet over their car 
and I'll just quote Pauline here because it's very interesting what she says she says it was brighter than other stars in the sky as it grew closer it grew brighter until it 
was above us was round a saucer shaped and a bright orange glow from lights underneath it 
lit up the whole Road we were terrified it was going to land on top of the car 
although I told my mother to close the windows on her side of the car I had to roll down mine to see 
if it was still there because it made no sound and there it was about the size of a car just above us 
zigzagging along with us along this narrow Winding Road we were so scared I told my mother to close 
her window and lock her door and I put my foot on the gas pedal but as the car turned and twisted 
so did the thing flying low over the trees turning them orange with its glow as it kept pace with us 
so it followed them for about 20 minutes until they reached the town of Cannon 
and as Pauline says it suddenly swerved away from us and was gone in seconds the orange Globe 
brightened up the woods then vanished so Pauline told several people around her most of who laughed 
at her and didn't believe her but she did receive multiple letters later from people who heard about 
the incident and said that they had seen the same UFO in the same area at the same time 
so it's a very interesting case and like many of these involve outside Witnesses the 
and here's a really interesting case this comes from a reporter by the name of Gregory M Cannon 
and as he says UFOs seem to love buzzing cars trucks too as the following case illustrates 
so yeah he's right about that it was around 2 A.M on March 5 1978. when a trucker was traveling on 
the Outback highway from Lee Creek to Hawker in Australia and without warning the trucker blew a 
tire and as he was changing the tire he had this weird Eerie feeling that he was being watched and 
he looked around him but there was nobody there that he could see he finished fixing the tire got 
back on the road and as he started driving that's when he saw this blue green light in front of him 
he first thought it might be a reflection off a railroad sign until he flipped on his high beams 
and he could see this object which also flipped on red lights and darted to the right 
at this point he thought it was gone but 30 seconds later it dropped down right in front of 
his car about 15 to 20 feet above the road and as he says it started to lower itself toward the road 
and when it was about five feet off the ground I switched on to high beams so when he switched on 
his bright headlights the object shot straight up but seconds later it dropped down again 
as the driver says it came back very soon afterwards but would not come below 20 feet above 
the road and it always kept 150 to 200 feet ahead of me regardless of what speed I was traveling 
I tried time after time to catch it but the result was always the same 
so we did this for about 15 minutes and finally flagged down another trucker to show him the light but right before he could point it out to the other trucker 
this object flicked off its lights and was gone so that's a pattern we've seen in a few other cases 
here's another case this one is really dramatic this occurred just outside of Indianapolis Indiana 
on Highway 465. one mile east of Highway 465 on Interstate 70 East it was the evening of March 
29 1978 there were three truckers two 18-wheelers and a third Super Cab truck they were all talking 
to each other on CBS as they traveled along interstate 70. and they were on the lookout 
for cops when suddenly a mysterious and huge beam of blue light Shone down on all three 
trucks from above same moment all their Seabees failed and the truck engines started to sputter 
now this was at night but the highway was quite crowded and in fact an estimated 50 
cars uh and a hundred people stopped on the freeway and watched this whole thing happen 
this was quite brief it lasted for about five seconds this beam of light and then it blinked out 
at which point the trucks began working and so did the Seabees at this point the rear trucker got on 
his CV and started talking to the UFO and said hey UFO if you have your ears on I want to go with you 
and this was immediately when the same bright blue light came down again and again engulfed 
all three Truckers the trucks were forcibly slowed down to about five to ten miles per hour 
Witnesses in the area saw the trucks actually jerking and jumping so this case became quite well known it was investigated by mufan researcher Charles Tucker 
and one of the truckers said that when the beam hit him he felt this incredible feeling and as this trucker says it is the most peaceful State I have ever experienced 
I did not believe in this crazy stuff before but I certainly do now I drive about 130 000 
miles a year I do not drink or use drugs I have never experienced anything like this in my life 
he says the incident affected him profoundly and he thinks about it constantly and he also noticed another strange effect as he says my clock is now losing about an hour a day 
he wanted to get the names of the other truckers but as he says I was too scared 
one of the witnesses who saw this happening from a car so this beam of light quote looked like a big 
bright blue lampshade over the three trucks now no actual UFO was ever seen But what I find most 
interesting about this case other than the fact that it did affect the vehicle's electronically 
was one of the truckers describing this beam of light and calling it the most peaceful State he 
has ever experienced that's something I've heard before there's something about these beams of light that can be very tranquilizing certainly an interesting case and there are so 
many here's another quite interesting one which occurred on Log Cabin Road in Berea Kentucky 
was November 27 1978. and Faye Lee leisure was had just purchased a new car she wanted 
to show her friend so she her brothers Philip and Michael and their Uncle Theo 
van Winkle gotten the new car and drove a short distance down Log Cabin Road to their friends 
I was on the way home that night they noticed a weird light following them and as Philip says 
it kept following us right over us while we were coming down the lane they described this 
object like two bowls put together rim to rim this brand new car at this point stalled several times 
the object followed them all the way home they exited the car and went to their porch and watched this object while one of them dashed inside and called their neighbor Becky Allen 
she arrived shortly later and all of them watched as this object circled around the house several times was totally silent and as their neighbor Becky Allen says 
we don't know what it was but we just want to be left alone we've never been so scared in our lives 
so I don't know I think that would find that very interesting hasn't happened to me so I can't say how I would react but yeah a lot of these Witnesses get quite frightened by these 
encounters I think because they're so close and it's clear that these UFOs are following them 
and have an interest in them and again all over the world here's a really dramatic case which 
occurred in the large city of Bello Horizonte this is just North of Rio De Janeiro in Brazil 
good Witnesses in this case it was 2 20 a.m on October 18 1979 when military 
police Sergeant Dion Martin D'Souza and three other officers Manuel Braza 
Geraldo Correa and Zhao Florentino were all parked in the deserted section of the city 
and suddenly this object came down over their car about 300 feet away 
Dion says the light was as bright as an electric Arc and as he says and I quote I 
tried to get out of the car but I felt a kind of half paralyzed sensation then the car trembled 
Shook and started to rock a little back and forth we tried to drive away but the engine would not 
start and the radio went completely out too we couldn't understand what was happening to us 
the UFO darted away at which point the car did start they called Police Headquarters who 
ordered them to follow this object so they chased it and they caught up with it and at 
that point they said that they felt they were actually being controlled by the UFO 
as Dion says the four of us felt we were really in trouble we felt we were under control of the UFO 
the car Shook and stalled and the radio went out and we experienced those paralyzing Sensations 
again so that went on just a short few moments at which point the object moved away and as it left 
the entire city lights of Bella Horizonte blinked out once and then a power of failure Struck One of 
the city districts and there were other Witnesses about a half mile away another officer Captain 
nairo de assis Barbosa and two others watched as this UFO darted up in the air so this is another 
case showing Amazing electromagnetic effects and apparently a power failure 
moving along to December 16 1978. Esther Drew age 37 her daughter Pam and three others George 
Nicholson and his young kids Robin and Bobby were driving along on Old Creek Road in Brownsville 
Indiana when they noticed that their car motor kept turning off and on by itself 
Now esther was driving and she said something is wrong with the car she told that to George the 
other adult and he blamed her but at this point the radio went dead and the car came to a complete 
stop and it was then that this UFO appeared right in front of them and as Pam the daughter says 
it came over the top of the trees real slow I thought it was going to stop 
this object was quite low is about 10 feet above the ground and the size they said of 
a small airplane that two lights in front and two on the bottom and the object looked metallic 
and as they watched it moved right in front of the car they felt it was almost as if it was inspecting the car itself George Nicholson jumped out of the car while everyone else stayed 
seated and as Pam says it was like nothing we ever saw I thought it was going to stop 
but this object didn't stop it kept moving it went over a cornfield and then took off 
with a whooshing sound at that moment the engine and radio came back on the witnesses 
continued to Brownsville without incident but on the way back the UFO appeared again 
this point Esther was so upset she told said she did not want didn't want to drive 
so she told George Nicholson to drive and she said she didn't want to look out the window that's how 
upset she was it was then while passing Richmond High School that her daughter Pam reported seeing 
at least three other objects and again the car engine started to fail and this time the objects 
followed them as Pam says I could swear they were actually following us they made it to their home 
at 818 North 15th Street in Richmond and ran into the house they didn't want to see the UFO 
anymore at this point they were too afraid to look outside so they didn't see how this object left 
so you can see that this does affect the witnesses quite profoundly 
here's another case which occurred in Houston County Alabama it was the first week of March 
1981 a couple from Wiregrass in Alabama were returning from a picnic in the afternoon 
when the husband first noticed a UFO following their car alongside the road at Treetop level 
it quickly darted off and was gone and he thought that was the end of it but then he noticed his wife sitting in a trance-like state staring out the right side of the car 
and he kept nudging her to see what was wrong she just turned and looked at him in fear didn't say 
a word but stared back outside the right window so he stopped the car and leaned over and was 
shocked to see this same UFO now hovering a mere 15 to 20 feet away from the right passenger side 
and as he says I was stunned it was like nothing I had ever seen 
I remember saying to my wife it's really a UFO suddenly I was as stunned as she 
so they got quite a fright and took off he says that a dangerously high speed and no surprise the 
UFO followed as the wife says the faster we went the faster it went but the most amazing thing to 
me was that the thing didn't make any noise at all it just kind of hovered there without any sound 
they were on a small dirt road there was only one way out and they watched this UFO darted ahead 
and disappeared around the corner ahead of them and as the husband said we thought the thing had 
finally decided to leave but when we rounded that turn there it sat I thought my wife was 
going to faint she just turned pale the object was now only two feet off the road blocking the road 
so they watched it in shock for about three to four minutes at which point it lifted up to Treetop level darted right towards their car buzzing it and then vanished into the distance 
as the woman says I'd always heard tales about so-called UFOs but I never really 
believed any of them needless to say she believes them now 
here's another amazing Fast and Furious UFO car chase which occurred near Meredith New Hampshire 
this was in mid November 1981. Linda Brown her son Jeremy and her friend were driving along 
Interstate 93 near Meredith New Hampshire when a UFO began to Pace their car and it followed their 
car down the highway darting back and forth they pulled over at Exit 23 pictured here to take a 
closer look the object obliged and dropped down and as Linda said we were very frightened she 
said this object was so big and so close that actually blocked the street lights and as she says you could lean forward on the front seat of the car and see it plainly through the windshield 
it had two legs protruding from the bottom and was silent so frightened she dropped veneers 
service station the object followed them and parked right above the service station about a hundred feet high she ran inside and told the owner to come and look out the UFO 
now the owner's name was John Davis he's the owner of the new Hampton Sunoco service station 
I believe this one pictured here is the same one so I can't be sure of that at any rate John and a 
small group of people at the station watch this object for about eight minutes and as John says 
in his own words I was getting ready to close when this car came into the garage parking lot 
and these woman got out of the car shouting and hollering and waving their hands I thought they 
had car trouble they said look the UFO over your garage I said what the heck is that I don't know 
what it was he says it looked just like one of those flying saucers or spaceships all silvery 
with fluorescent lights on the sides pulsating not blinking just throbbing sitting there 
so Linda told him that it had followed them down the highway at this point this object 
according to John was about 40 feet across and 100 feet high and as he says I'm not 
crazy I don't believe in UFOs and if I hadn't seen it with my eyes I wouldn't believe it 
so this object stayed for about eight minutes and then appeared to drift off 
this point Linda Brown her friend and son left the station continued their drive and while 
heading down Route 104 towards Meredith Center Road the object no surprise reappeared at this 
point Linda's friend and son said it appeared to be shooting down what looked like Blue Balls of 
Fire from underneath it finally it did disappear but it left them all quite Shook Up Linda said 
that if she ever saw it again she would not report it as everyone she had told teased her about it 
here's another case this one occurred in Cone North Yorkshire England 
this was investigated by Mark and Graham birdsaw well-known UFO researchers a family of four and 
their dog decided to go shopping they left the town of Carlton where they lived and as 
they drove two UFOs one bright red and the other bright green both about the size of a football 
swooped down on either side of their car and began to Pace it and these were real close 
up they said they were right alongside the car at window height they were absolutely shocked 
the two kids in the back began crying and their dog was also affected he cowered under the seat 
the wife screamed at her husband to turn around and head back home which he did but these objects 
followed them it was only for a short distance and then these objects darted off but this experience 
brightened them so badly that they now refused to drive that road anymore and they take the long way 
around to get into town and it was only a day or two later on March 4 1982 and another witness a 
businesswoman was driving from Lancashire to North Lancashire on the a65 road when she had a nearly 
identical experience two small lights one red and one blue she said swooped down and began to 
follow behind her car and the next thing she knew a white beam of light from above engulfed her car 
and 30 feet around it actually she says her car engine revved up the light remained over her car 
for a full mile until another truck appeared at which point the object darted away upon reaching 
her destination she did realize she was missing a half hour of time and later did undergo hypnosis 
which revealed a more extensive encounter so yeah at least a few of these cases might involve actual 
onboard contact but most know just seemed to be these UFOs following cars down the highway 
and again all over the world here's the one which occurred this is such an interesting case 
along the South Coast Highway when two women were traveling towards the city of Esperance 
in Australia this is in early April of 1982 the two women Francis Collins and Maggie yend were 
traveling down the South Coast Highway at around 4 A.M and they had just reached this little town 
on the highway called mongolin up it's really the only sign of civilization along this really 
remote Highway so they go past this town and this is when this brilliantly lit object dropped down 
out of the sky and began to Pace their car and as they do in these cases this object went from side 
to side sometimes getting as close as 600 feet to their car they said this object was about 
the size of a helicopter but as they watched it would change color from red and orange to Green 
and when it started around it would change color as well I said it would go up way up high and 
become a star-like object and then drop down again so when this first appeared Maggie who is driving 
screamed waking up her friend Francis and screamed there's a UFO coming at us 
and this is when Francis woke up and saw it and she says when I opened my eyes and looked 
out the windshield my heart leaped up into my throat down the road and coming straight at us 
was a huge blinking white light was well above the roadway so we knew it wasn't just another vehicle 
she said that at one point this object hovered right in front of them and as Francis says 
I thought it was going to run into us I thought it was going to kill us I remember saying to 
myself oh dear God it's going to hit us head on and wants to kill us and we're going to die 
but when was only a few feet away it lifted up and just hovered over our van 
then it lagged back a few feet and followed us so here we see this very strong fear reaction 
and it didn't help when this object continued to follow them and it followed them for a long time about 50 miles 5-0 and as one of the witnesses says it 
made absolutely no sound and it followed us almost until we reached Esperance and when they finally 
reached their destination they went directly to the home of the local police officer Bob Corden 
and he was amazed to see how agitated the two witnesses were he saw a Ben that one of their 
tires was actually shredded they'd been driving on a flat tire and looking up this object was still 
there hovering over the Esperance Bay in full View numerous other Witnesses in the area did see this 
or later researchers talked to two kangaroo Hunters a truck driver and several other 
motorists on the same Highway who saw this and Francis and Maggie the main Witnesses discovered 
a long history of sightings in that area and this part is really interesting they learned that just 
one year earlier a man from Queensland was driving along that same stretch of road and disappeared 
his car was found by the side of the road in perfect working order but he was never seen again 
George Hume of the Perth UFO Research Center said that the sightings by Collins 
and yinged and others was one of the best documented in this area in recent years 
so this was of course coming to the attention of UFO researchers and in fact in 1982 
there were numerous incidents of car accidents being linked to UFO crashes 
researcher J Allen heineck was asked specifically about it and he acknowledged the sudden uptick of cases but he refused to speculate on the cause 
Harold Gerson of mufon said that most of the cases that he was researching came from the Midwest 
and as he says most are probably the result of fear and or surprise on the part of the drivers 
it's not surprising that a driver would lose control of his car when he suddenly sees a UFO 
now Leonard Falcone of the California Institute of Technology and a member of the organization 
UFO watch in San Francisco specifically cited two cases of this kind one involved two brothers in 
Missouri who set a UFO passed over their car pinned him to the seats and caused 
their car to zoom off out of control and into a ditch as though someone else were driving it 
and a second case occurred in Menasha Wisconsin to two police officers who said they were struck by 
a beam of light from a UFO which caused their squad cars to freeze and run off into a ditch 
and according to Leonard Falcone so far as I know no one has been killed or seriously 
injured in any of the accidents so yeah this is far more common I think than most people realize 
and moving along into the 80s here's a case from the Latrobe Dairy area of Pennsylvania 
it was around midnight on August 30 1983 an anonymous gentleman's drug was driving 
along Route 217 at the Kingston Hill cut off pictured here when he saw a series of Bright 
Lights 40 feet over his vehicle you could hear a high-pitched sound coming from above and looking 
up you saw a Battleship Gray saucer he said it had Amber lights around the perimeter and 
what appeared to be a door in the center and this is a drawing here of this object 
you drove off in fear but the object moved with him staying above and the front of his vehicle 
the whole time he tried to outrun it but it stayed with him sometimes following sometimes appearing 
in front and he eventually reported it to the newspaper and learned that many other people 
in the area had apparently seen the same type of craft he saw around the same time in the same area
here's another case which lasted four hours this is in Melbourne Australia that occurred 
in mid-september 1983 when civilian Aviation authorities in Melbourne notified police of 
an unidentified object on their radar screens two officers were sent out in a patrol car to 
investigate and were amazed to actually see this UFO hovering over a freeway leading into Melbourne 
and they chased this object to a shopping center where it stopped and hovered 300 feet overhead 
they turned on their spotlights at which point the craft disappeared another patrol car with 
two additional officers was sent out and for the next six hours this UFO played kind of 
hide and seek and cat and mouse with these four officers hovering at times only 100 feet overhead 
this was shortly after the Frederick valentic case in Australia where a pilot disappeared 
officer Peter Ferguson was knew about The valentic Disappearance and it unnerved him 
as he says I believe in God and I was doing some heavy praying all I could think of 
was the thought of being abducted by space aliens and never seeing my family again 
officer Ray Ellens said it was very hard to keep our minds on chasing the UFO because of 
the thought of what happened to valentic but once we calmed down we actually got pretty annoyed was 
just too quick for us at one state it landed with its lights off we got to within 300 feet of it and 
thought we got it this time but the next thing we knew it was back in the air and behind us again 
officer Paul Hickman says the UFO was obviously playing Fun and Games with us when we first 
spotted it we got a spotlight on the strange object in the sky which showed it was Gray about 300 feet long and 20 feet wide shaped like a cigar 
I've never seen anything like it before it was awesome and I must admit frightening 
okay I've got just a few other cases I'd like to present to you and this next case occurred 
just outside of Seven Points Texas this was in June of 1984 a mother and son Carolyn 
Greene and her son Timothy were driving along Highway 85 six miles west of Seven Points Texas 
when a UFO appeared overhead and began to wreak havoc with her car as Carolyn says I was driving 
along at about 55 miles per hour when all of a sudden my lights began flashing on and off 
when something pulled me off the road literally took control of the steering wheel the car was 
suddenly driving itself I tried to turn around but I couldn't only then did they see a strange 
lighted object above their car and as Carolyn says the light came into the car and lit it up 
my hair stood on end and my son was frightened I told him I didn't know what it was 
finally after a few short moments the UFO released control of the car and Caroline sped away as fast as she could reaching speeds of about 75 miles per hour 
it was then the police officer actually pulled her over for speeding Colonel explained to the officer 
that she was trying to escape a UFO the officer did not believe her and gave her a ticket and 
as Caroline says I'll be happy to pay the ticket but what's important to me is that people believe 
I am telling the truth so here's another case which occurred in the city of Waycross Georgia 
this was in August of 1984. the two witnesses Danny Thrift and Janet Curry were driving to 
his grandmother's house along Swamp Road this is just a little Rural Road when they 
saw a glowing object hovering at Treetop level alongside the road 
Danny at first thought it was a plane but as they got closer he saw that it was unlike anything he'd 
ever seen and as he says in his own words it started moving fast and it changed Direction 
all of a sudden it was coming right for me heading right towards the car it scared me 
so bad I started to cry so this object object hovered right over their car engulfing it in light 
and as he says I was trying to speed away and it kept up with me it got right over the car 
and glided over us I felt I was in danger it lit up the whole inside of the car I've never seen 
anything like it I've never been so frightened in my life so it followed their car for a short 
distance and it sent both the witnesses into complete hysterics suddenly without warning it 
was God they reached Danny's grandmother's house and immediately called the police 
a deputy went out in his Cruiser to investigate and returned to say that he too was pursued by 
the UFO which came so close to his Cruiser and nearly hit his car and they later learned that 
at least six other people saw apparently the same UFO that same night in that area an amazing case
here's a case which occurred in mid-February in 1985 it was late at night 
when an unidentified woman was driving along the a392 highway near Mount Joy in England 
when she saw a hundred foot long oval-shaped object alongside the road and as she says 
although brilliant it did not radiate light it was so powerful that it obscured my vision 
of the road however close to the Hedge then seemed to shrink when Pitch Black and moved from side to 
side across the road it shrank down to a few feet changing from yellow to Green then red and finally 
purple before disappearing then as she says quite suddenly the light appeared on my right further 
down the road and followed the same pattern of changing color and size before disappearing 
this happened six or seven times over a stretch of a half mile 
so she slowed her car down to a craw about 20 miles per hour and as she says 
I was getting mesmerized I was in such a panic that I turned off my root into the Minor Road 
just to get away from it she reported to the police who tried to explain it away 
as a weather balloon or a reflection off of her windshield but as she says I know it was not that 
she refused to drive back unless her husband came and accompanied her and she wanted to wait 
until there were other vehicles along with him because as she says I was absolutely petrified 
had not drunk any alcohol before I left for work and I do not take hallucinatory drugs 
she refused to be identified saying people will only think I'm in that case but I am not 
all right just three more cases and I think we'll have a really good idea of what's going on here 
was late September 1985. this case occurred in bag shot in near Heath Surrey when David McMurray his 
wife and their children Katie and Paul were driving from bag shot to farnsboro Hampshire 
in England this was late September 1985 and as they're driving along our UFO dropped from the 
sky and hovered directly in front of their car and I'll just quote Dave McMurray directly as he says 
I saw something hovering above the road in front of us I could not believe my eyes was 
a huge saucer-like craft about 50 feet long with brilliant lights coming from portholes around the 
center then it suddenly took off but the encounter wasn't over yet a second craft or perhaps the 
same one reappeared and began to follow them from behind they kept driving and after some 
moments this UFO disappeared but the effects of the encounter endured for days afterwards 
as David says the whole family was weak and trembling for days afterwards 
and as his wife Susan says I saw the two things with my own eyes was an incredible experience and 
when David tried to start his car the battery was drained and as we have seen in many of these cases 
there were other Witnesses they later learned that at least one other witness saw the UFO in 
the same area in her case it hovered near her home for about five minutes before taking off
all right here's another case October 1985 and this one occurred just north of Venice Italy 
it's quite a dramatic case and his wife Elizabeth and their four-year-old son Anthony 
were traveling just north of Venice along the highway when they noticed a bright light trailing 
lurkar above and behind them and as it came lower I could see that this object was apparently cone 
shaped and it followed them a long time first one hour and then two and then three hours and 
when he sped up it would speed up when he slowed down it would slow down and after hours of this 
he pulled into a gas station at which point this craft actually stopped right overhead 
and as Ezio the main witness says was then that we got really scared the thing just stopped and 
hovered silently over the station [Music] now researchers did actually talk to this gas station 
attendant his name is Walter piccioni and as he says the whole area above the station was 
lit up like a football field with colored lights it was amazing because there was no sound at all 
in the middle of this massive circle of Lights there was this menacing craft it was like a dream 
so Ezio and his family continued their drive and no surprise this object continued to follow them until they reached their destination in Bergamo 
and as asio says we were hunted down by a UFO finally this object did Dart off they 
were still in their car and this is when Ezio noticed that the car was affected he 
says I felt the car lurched forward as if suddenly released and the thing was gone 
one final case it was May 15 1987. this is near Springfield Kentucky four women had just left 
church after playing bingo one evening and we're heading down Highway 55 in Springfield Kentucky 
and they were heading towards Lebanon Kentucky the four Witnesses Wanda Mathis her sister Anita Adams 
and their friends Bertha Porter and Margaret Riley all noticed a small orb of light swooped down and 
paced their car right outside the driver's window this was just a tiny little light and it was quite 
close to them right next to their car Anita Adams was driving and as she says This little light came 
out of nowhere and appeared beside my window and I said y'all look that little light's following us 
was then that she realized that she was no longer in control of the car and as her sister says 
the car stayed on the road even though she wasn't looking where she was driving 
all four women felt almost hypnotized at this point and as Wanda says I know one thing we were 
driving and driving but we weren't getting any closer to Lebanon than we were when we started out 
at one point this orb-like object moved from the left side of the car dipped down 
and resumed position on the right side and as Margaret says when it came over to the right 
side of the car we saw this big shiny thing in the sky was just like it was hanging there up 
in the sky on the right side of the car it was no star there's never been a star that big and bright 
and as they watched this smaller orb zoomed up into the larger light and then this larger 
craft zoomed down towards their car and one just screamed out it's coming after us and as 
Anita says I put my foot on the gas and that's the first time I had control of the car again 
and I went all over the road first to the left and back to the right but whatever had let us go then 
the woman were shaking and crying when they finally walked into the Lebanon Police Station to report what happened and as police dispatcher Betty Washington says 
they were shaking and carrying on something really scared them I don't know what they saw 
but they believed they saw something all right as you can see there are no shortage of cases 
of this kind and many of them are quite dramatic and as I said in the beginning of this episode 
I do think they have some important insights into EET behavior and into our own behavior 
it's amazing to me how many people experience extreme fear during these encounters even 
though nothing bad is really happening to them I think these cases show how steeped in fear our 
society is and how a confrontation with the unknown can be quite traumatic but as far as 
the ETS like why are they doing this this is so bizarre I did do a previous episode where UFOs 
come down and actually lift cars up into the sky those are called car lift cases 
there aren't as many of those as there are of UFOs chasing cars down highways 
so why are they doing this I'm speculating here but I suspect that the reason is part 
of a publicity campaign in which UFOs are announcing their presence to small groups of 
people individually or in couples and sometimes large groups as we see with cases involving 
schoolyards perhaps or drive in movie theaters I did an episode about that sporting events concerts 
we see this all the time these are displays so I suspect that's what's going on here that UFOs 
are intentionally showing themselves as a way of announcing their presence and saying hello 
and just making it very clear to the people on the highway that UFOs are real 
and I think another aspect of this is that people driving down a highway late at night offer the 
et's an opportunity to fulfill this agenda because this is absolutely a pattern UFO cases are evenly 
divided between men and women that happen all over the world almost anybody can have an encounter but 
there are a huge huge number of cases involving UFO car chases so I think to an extent the ETS 
are using this as an opportunity to announce their presence I think there's also a little bit of a 
playful aspect here where the UFO occupants are having a little bit of fun not unintentionally 
mean or malicious way but just sort of in a almost practical joking way or just having 
a little fun announcing their presence to people in a way that leaves no doubt that UFOs are real 
again speculation but given the huge number of Encounters of this kind I think that's 
exactly what's going on here it's just a simple introduction a way to say hello we are here we 
are real so that's my episode for today I hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you 
very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep looking for 
answers keep searching for the truth and most important keep having fun till next time bye.
