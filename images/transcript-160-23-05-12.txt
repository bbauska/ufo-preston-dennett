PHANTASMAGORICAL! TWELVE WEIRD & FREAKY UFO CASES
May 12, 2023

Summary:
May 12, 2023
If there is one word that sums up the UFO experience, it’s “phantasmagorical.” Whether a sighting, a landing, a face-to-face encounter, an onboard experience, or even a UFO crash/retrieval -- all of them contain levels of weirdness and high strangeness that are a consistent feature of UFO cases. The variety of UFO experiences are truly astonishing. They can be funny, bizarre, scary, traumatizing, enlightening, healing and more.

This video presents twelve cases which show just how truly weird and freaky the UFO experience can be. These cases come from across the United States and the world. Most involve multiple witnesses and varying kinds of physical evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. Each provides another piece of the puzzle towards solving the UFO mystery.

CASE 1: ET LEADS MAN TO WATER. In 1970, Wyoming rancher Pat McGuire became the laughing-stock of his community when he purchased a 6500-acre ranch in arid desert land and said he was going to grow crops there, something nobody else had done. But Pat had a secret, he was in contact with ETs, and they told him exactly where to dig his well.

CASE 2: ALIEN FISHERMEN. On Nov 2, 1972, Monsieur Vuillien of Doucier, France was shocked when a UFO drops down and hovers a mere 20 feet over his fish ponds where he’s raising 50,000 trout. Then the object begins to move closer, so he retrieves his gun and gets ready for a confrontation.

CASE 3: THE UFO & THE WASHING-MACHINE. The year of 1978 was a busy one for Evelyn Whiteway of Parson Cross, England. After two sightings earlier in the year, Evelyn had a third one. But this time it hovers over her house and causes a bizarre effect on her washing machine. And after that, the UFOs return!

CASE 4: THE ALIEN CHOCOLATE BAR. On the morning of Feb 28, 1974, a factory worker from Origney-En-Thierache, France is driving his moped to work when a UFO lands next to him, and out step two figures dressed in spacesuits. They stop his moped and hand him what looks like a chocolate bar, motioning for him to eat it. He is unable to resist and puts it in his mouth.

CASE 5: PAPERBOY SEES A UFO CRASH. On Feb 17, 1979, while delivering papers near his home in Tucson, AZ, 10-year-old Warren Weisman sees a small glowing object crash to the ground in front of him, damaging a car and mailbox. As he’s inspecting the weird metallic-looking object, a man-in-black shows up and suggests that he leave the area.

CASE 6: A UFO MAKES A FAMILY DIZZY. On Mar 11, 1979, while driving along Ware Road in Hertford, England, Alice Ball and her family stop the car to observe a glowing UFO. As it moves over the car, they experience several very strange physical effects.

CASE 7: THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE FROM A UFO. While walking his dog on the evening of Nov 21, 1980, near his home in Burneside, England, Mario Luisi comes upon a landed UFO. Out step two of the most beautiful people he has ever seen. And they want to talk to him.

CASE 8: A BOY SHOOTS AN ALIEN. On Mar 11, 1981, Cathy Gilpin and her 19-year-old son Arlin of Casey County, KY are drawn outside by a strange noise. Seeing a glowing object, they go to investigate. Cathy drives towards it, and feels a strange force pulling her to the object. She flees the scene, but Arlin goes outside with a gun and comes face-to-face with a 7-foot creature.

CASE 9: A UFO ROADBLOCK. Late at night in Feb 1983, Ante Jonsson was returning to his home in Tyngsrud, Sweden and saw what looked like a child on the road. Looking up, he saw a huge UFO. It darted away. Ante went home to get his camera and returned to the scene. The UFO was gone, but then it landed in the road. ETs came out and surrounded his car. 

CASE 10: UFOS SUCK WATER FROM POOLS. In Jan 1984, many residents of Olavarria, Argentina observe a UFO hover over their swimming pools and suck the water right out of them. And this isn’t the first time this has happened.

CASE 11: A UFO MADE HIM PSYCHIC. In 1988, Stuart (a teacher in Mutare, Africa) was walking through a field when a UFO hovered low overhead. Time seemed to move in slow-motion as he fled the scene. After the sighting: he started predicting the future.

CASE 12: PINEAPPLE PINCHING ALIENS. In the late 1980s, pineapple farmer Harry Roy heard a loud thumping noise coming from his pineapple fields in Caloundra, Australia. Going to investigate, he saw something that they couldn’t believe or understand. They had just planted 15,000 pineapple plants. Every single one of them were gone. 

As these cases show, just when you think you’ve heard everything about UFOs, another case comes along and makes you realize that we still have much to learn about UFOs and the ETs visiting our planet. They show that not only are we NOT alone in this universe, but that extraterrestrials are intervening on many levels. There are too many cases to ignore. The truth is coming out!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and 
the Paranormal today's episode is called phantasmagorical 12 weird and freaky UFO cases 
I love the cases that are really unusual ones that have unique elements and these 
are the cases I chose today I think these are cases you probably haven't heard before 
and they cover the entire spectrum of UFO contact and by that I mean we have sightings Landings 
face-to-face contact people being taken on board UFOs and even a case of an apparent UFO crash 
so these cases come from all over the world they span decades some of these are multiple 
witness cases some contain some really profound evidence so yeah I think each of these has some 
really valuable insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon I don't really like that word this 
is just something that happens we are not alone in this universe as these cases I think show 
and yeah these are just so so weird weird effects weird events and cases that really make you go 
hmm what is going on here so I have 12 cases well really a Baker's Dozen 13 one is quite short and I 
just had to include it because it is so weird and I think you'll find these all quite interesting I 
certainly hope so got a lot of information I want to share with you today so let's just get started 
and I call the first case a UFO leads a man to water this case actually caused quite a 
sensation when it came out and yet sort of faded from the headlines and I don't 
think a lot of people know about it and that's why I wanted to include it today
this is definitely one of the weirdest UFO encounters on record and this is the story of a 
Rancher from the Tiny Tiny Town of Basler Wyoming who was Guided by ETS to dig a well in the middle 
of the high deserts of Wyoming the main witness's name is Pat McGuire and he kind of became the 
laughing stock of his community when in 1970 he purchased what everyone thought was a worthless 
piece of land a 6500 acre ranch on the high arid Plains of Wyoming this is more than seven thousand 
feet above sea level and he told everyone that he would dig a well to grow cash crops in the 
area which was something nobody else had been able to do but he ignored all the Skeptics and 
as he says the aliens told me to drill the well and they would bring the water to me 
so Engineers had been to this area before tried and failed to locate water 
and when Pat McGuire decided he was going to have a will drilled drilled he brought out several 
drilling companies and they flat out refused to dig the well calling it a waste of time but Pat 
knew that the there was water there I mean the ETS had told him this so he ended up drilling the well 
himself which took quite a bit of effort and and you know trying to find a way to do it himself 
and he did it and boy were was everyone shocked when his well actually struck water at 350 feet 
now at first this wasn't enough to irrigate a whole lot of land the entire Ranch it was just a few years later when this well tapped apparently an underground river 
and he was able to irrigate 1400 Acres of malt barley and this was no small well it 
became one of the biggest in the state and produced at one point eight thousand gallons of pure fresh cold water daily or even hourly according to a couple of the reports 
and when he did this other ranchers were amazed and they tried and failed to duplicate what he had 
done so this was really interesting and Pat's case became really well known when UFOs started showing 
up over and over again throughout the 1970s he had a lot of encounters and not just sightings but 
being taken on board and in fact he had missing time enough times that he sought up the help of 
Leo sprinkle a well-known UFO researcher one of the first to hypnotize people and he hypnotized 
Pat McGuire to help him recall his encounters and of course Leo sprinkle came away convinced 
as Leo says in his own words before neighbors thought Pat was a little strange because he 
was going to dig that well and because he could see all these flying saucers now he's 
a little strange only because he sees the flying saucers anybody can go out there and see the well 
I believe Pat is credible there is no specific factor that would indicate that he is lying 
and yeah I agree with that because you can call him a liar but you'd be calling his entire family 
his neighbors and even news people a liar because a lot of people have gone to this Ranch and seen 
UFOs that's not the only one his wife Wanda and their eight children seven girls and one boy 
have all seen them so have Ranch residents Dan and Ruth Grover who went and lived on the ranch 
and as Pat McGuire says in his own words I've seen as many as seven spaceships at one time with two 
of them sitting on the ground less than a half mile from my house and the other five hovering 
above them they are getting more and more casual about letting us observe them in fact they want 
to be seen and he says the UFOs appeared on an almost nightly basis throughout the entire 1970s 
and other family members have gone on record with their own sightings his son Patrick JR says 
the UFOs used to be pretty exciting especially the first time you see one up close after that it's kind of like going to school not such a big deal after the first day 
and Pat McGuire is absolutely convinced that these are friendly 
et's not only does he credit them with locating his well he says and I quote they haven't hurt me 
and they certainly could have there's no sense in being afraid of something you can't control 
so Pat says that not only has he been inside the UFOs but that all the members of his immediate 
family have also been taken on board they've talked to him quite a bit they've showed him all 
kinds of things they've warned him about our war like ways and again he's not the only one saying 
this Dan and Ruth Grover when they moved onto the ranch they were very skeptical at first but then 
they became Believers as Ruth says when one of the things lands in the field in front of the 
house or hovers directly overhead it's hard to ignore so at first yeah Pat and his family 
were a bit frightened by the appearance of these craft which were quite big some as big as 300 feet 
wide and 60 feet tall but it happened so often that they became used to it it became normal 
one time he did see a UFO pick up a young calf he was watching it through his rifle scope and 
was actually about to press the trigger and shoot his rifle at that exact moment he became paralyzed 
moments later a six foot tall figure wearing a black skin-tight jumpsuit appeared next to him 
and this was to be the first of many face-to-face encounters and the ETS told 
him that they had picked up the cow because they were testing the levels of radioactivity 
in our food source caused by us humans and our incessant testing of nuclear weapons 
so many visitors to the ranch also saw UFOs including UFO researchers news people and 
more one of the newsmen who showed up was Dr Richard Flack who along with reporter Greg Bean 
and photojournalist Richard forsh they visited the ranch in 1980 and saw as Richard says quote 
a strange object blinking in the sky and gyrating in impossible patterns up and down and sideways as 
though putting on a show for us Greg Bean confirms this testimony and says that the 
objects moved quote straight up and down in the air perhaps several hundred feet at a time soon it 
stopped its up and down motion and began to rock back and forth performing a sort of cosmic dance 
so these UFOs put on a show for the media for the news people lasting about 10 minutes and 
convince all three of them that Pat McGuire was telling the truth about his UFO encounters Richard 
forsh the the photojournalist tried real hard to capture pictures but these objects were moving 
far too fast and he wasn't able to but many many people visited this Ranch again he became quite 
well known and one witness in fact did report his sighting at Pat McGuire's Ranch to move on 
he was with Pat driving near the ranch when three star-like objects appeared and he shouted out to 
Pat look at those stars and as he says I'd no sooner said that when the center object 
descended at an incredible rate of speed and came straight for our windshield at that point 
he screamed out it's going to ram us but of course it didn't and as he says as soon as I 
said that the object stopped and descended slowly to the pavement less than 100 feet from our truck 
we were stopped by that time on the side of the road all traffic on Interstate 80 stopped and 
all headlights went out this was that night the object that had landed on the highway in front 
of us was as big as a house so he was gonna jump out of the car and run towards it but Pat said no 
no wait wait till they invite us and the next thing he remembers is this object disappeared 
but he thinks that perhaps he was taken on board because after that he started having 
very vivid dreams of being inside this object so again Pat did go under hypnosis and he recalled 
many times being in a round room and sitting in a chair he describes the ETS he says the aliens 
are six feet tall slender but muscular with large eyes and short nose thin lips and no hair 
they are dressed in all black their heads are bigger than ours they didn't lift their 
feet as they walked they shuffled along their skin was real white and they all looked alike 
so Pat McGuire became very well known he spoke at conferences and again many people visited 
the ranch in fact in 1982 he ran for governor of Wyoming but lost the primary to Governor Ed 
herschler and then kind of faded away and no one knows exactly what happened but looking it up the 
last report I found the Maguires had gotten into divorce the state foreclosed on this property and 
the ranch is no longer active in fact the town of Basler is considered to be pretty much a ghost 
town the second case I'd like to present today is a real fish story a fish UFO story I call it alien 
fishermen and I wanted to include it because I think it shows how ETS are interested not only 
in humans and our planet but really every aspect of our planet and that includes all the life on 
it animals of all kinds as this case shows I think you'll find it quite unique so alien 
fishermen yeah this case took place on November 2nd 1972 near the village of d'ussier France 
and the main witness is Monsieur V Yen and he was working on his Fish Farm located along Highway 
d-326 near the Harrison River he was Raising approximately 50 000 trout there on his fish farm 
and one day he looks up and he sees these strange curls of what he thinks it was vapor in the sky 
and it's leading down sort of a step down pattern to his property and he's following this with his 
eyes this sort of glinting stuff and this is when he's astonished to see a quote magnificent saucer 
and it's hovering about 150 feet away right over his trout pools and it's only about 20 feet high 
now he had not believed in UFOs prior to this so he was completely shocked and he did draw a sketch 
of this object for investigators which you can see here superimposed over a photograph of the exact 
location of this sighting he says this disc was almost 90 feet wide and 10 feet thick it looked 
like shiny metallic aluminum with a clear Coppola on top with polished smooth and totally silent 
so Monsieur wyan had the feeling as he's watching this thing that someone was inside it and was 
watching him though he couldn't really see anyone and it hung there for a full five minutes which as 
the witness says that's a long long time you know and I agree that is a long time when an 
object is hovering that close to you so all kinds of emotions ran through him he was frightened he 
was perplexed he was awestruck he says he was almost paralyzed to the spa and when this craft 
remained there for minute after minute he began to wonder if he was about to be taken by them 
and then it seemed like he was because after five long minutes this craft began to rock and began to 
move closer to him this completely freaked him out he leapt to his car which was right there 
and pulled out his gun and as he says I loaded it with three cartridges of Buckshot and waited 
so when he did that the craft immediately stopped and moved back about 150 feet 
remains still hovering very low for just a few moments and then shot up vertically 
and according to the witness in the space of three seconds it was hovering he estimates about 30 
000 feet high the height of a commercial jet and it remained there for another three minutes so 
yeah a very unusual case which does show I think ETS checking up on the health of his fish perhaps 
and speculating but I don't know investigators found no physical evidence of radioactivity or 
magnetism nor were any fish missing as far as they could tell but a truly unusual case 
there you go a very strange case indeed and here's another the third case I'd like to present to you 
today I call the UFO and the washing machine and you'll see why I title it that UFOs often do have 
strange effects and this case is a real doozy in that regard it's quite brief but I thought 
definitely worth mentioning because I don't think I've ever heard a case quite like this one
this very briefcase took place in Parson cross England and the main witness is Evelyn whiteway 
this occurred in September 1978 and it's so weird I had to include it at the time Evelyn lived on 
deerland Avenue and she saw this UFO and she says in her own words I've never seen anything like it 
what I saw was a long object like an airplane without any Wings it was about the length of two 
buses and was a silver color was traveling towards grenicide but made no noise at all 
and here's where strange went to just very freaky and weird as Evelyn says as it traveled over our 
house the washing machine went berserk water and blankets in it started spilling all over the floor 
and there was a terrible mess to clean up so that is definitely weird and another weird thing about 
this case is this turned out to be the third of three sightings that same year Well actually 
four so ETS were showing themselves to her in a very profound way over and over again which 
is absolutely strange her first sighting occurred in January of 1978 when she saw a glowing object 
covered with lights over a nearby nearby park and as she said it had hundreds of different colored 
lights all around and it was flying very low so pretty close close enough to not misperceive 
it was a few months later in August she saw a bright orangish red plate shaped object 
and she said this one had green and red lights all around the circumference so not a plane and 
yeah a plate shaped object then of course came the washing machine in counter in September but 
things weren't over yet after that in late October she saw a plane and then looking below the plane 
she saw a cigar-shaped object scooting right beneath it so this was enough for Evelyn she 
contacted the British UFO society and it ended up purchasing a UFO detector and as she says it's as 
big as a suitcase and has a big needle which moves when a UFO is in the area when it gets 
closer an alarm goes off so no word on whether or not this UFO detector worked but it's not the only 
UFO detector on the market these UFOs do give off apparently magnetic fields around them so it's a 
pretty simple design and I think an effective way of knowing when a UFO is in the area so in 
some ways I think that case is should come as no surprise we know UFOs do affect electromagnetic 
machines but that's the first one I've ever heard of a UFO affecting a washing machine 
and if you think that's that case is weird well this next one is probably one of the weirdest I've 
ever heard I don't know of another case quite like it and I call this one the alien chocolate bar 
and yeah I know how that sounds this is a pretty well verified case with Landing traces 
multiple supporting Witnesses uh really unusual case from France so let's get started on this one 
this very weird case took place on February 28 1974 and orenyi on the Arash in France this was 
very early in the morning 5 35 a.m and the main witness was a 59 year old factory worker who wants 
to remain anonymous and he was riding his moped along What's called the departmental highway in 
a rural area on his way to work and he was just crossing over a bridge as you can see here which 
spans the small River Thon without warning his moped came to a complete stop and he found himself 
confronted by two figures each about five feet tall dressed in what looked like space suits with 
square helmets visors and thick gloves so he saw them and at that moment he looked to his side and 
along the side of the road about a hundred feet away landed in the field he saw quote lure machine 
and he described it as a black saucer-shaped object a craft no more than six feet high so quite 
small at this point the two figures grabbed the handlebars of his moped and seemed to be looking 
at him through their visors he couldn't see their faces and they began to gesture indicating he 
thought that they wanted him to eat something they kind of looked at each other and then the 
one on the right pulled out from behind him what looked like a quote a piece of chocolate 
and actually handed it over to the witness motioning him to eat it 
and the witness did he was not sure why he did it but he took this offering put 
it in his mouth and ate it and he said it was soft and textured like chocolate but tasteless 
and the beings waited patiently while he ate and swallowed this substance they then stepped aside 
allowing him to depart which he did as fast as he could he was quite frightened and as he 
left he thought to himself I'm well out of that so yeah he was glad it was over he continued to 
work but he says he did not work very well that day it was quite distracted he noticed 
no physical effects from this weird ET food he did tell his family and friends and Neighbors 
when he got home what happened and some of them went to the site and they did find a circle of 
crushed grass right where he said he had seen this saucer land in the field now this case was 
investigated by Jean-Marie bijorn and he said that the witness was so traumatized by this encounter 
that he was quite depressed and very reluctant to speak with investigators but did provide his 
testimony and this is when investigators learned that there were in fact five five 
other sightings in the same area over the next two weeks including weird unexplained lights and 
what one witness described as a glowing craft so that's pretty good corroboration or confirmation 
that uh this was in fact a true encounter there are many cases of people being fed 
from UFOs in fact Joshua Cutchins wrote a whole book about this so it's not as unusual as it might 
seem but I again have never heard a case quite like that and here's another case which is really 
unique this comp case comes from the files of apro the aerial phenomenon research organization 
who were really the investigators of this case and I call this one a paper boy sees a UFO crash 
this one took place in Tucson several decades ago but I think it's relevant because it shows some 
really interesting aspects of UFO encounters that do turn up again and again but also some 
absolutely unique features I like this one because again it's well verified other people saw this it 
wasn't just one witness had some very unusual physical effects physical evidence and I think 
it's got a lot to say about the UFO phenomenon so this case again is from Tucson Arizona and 
it shows how weird UFO encounters can get was around 5 6 a.m on February 17 1979 when 10 year 
old Warren Weissman he's a fifth grader and he was delivering papers on winstell Boulevard when he 
saw what he first thought was a shooting star in the sky that is until this came in for a landing 
and according to Warren it was traveling at a great speed and landed about a block away 
smashed the back of a white Volkswagen throwing off its rear wheel rolled off 
the car knocked over a mailbox on a post it was still smoking when I went over to it 
so he saw this happen and he described this object as about the size of a microwave oven 
was black shiny in appearance but had little what he's decided were lava like holes in its surface 
and in fact it hit the ground so hard it gouged a hole in the earth one foot deep so he reached 
down and picked up a small chip from this object which had apparently broken off of it and slipped it in his pocket and continued to inspect this larger object and that's when a car drove up 
and it got weird here as Warren says a skinny man in a brown suit and white shirt got out of the car 
he was an FBI type and this man spoke to Warren and said why don't you go ahead and deliver the 
rest of the papers so it's clearly trying to get him off the scene of this incident 
and the man did seem threatening and Warren was in fact afraid that he might actually pull out a gun 
and at that same moment a police car was pulling up so Warren fled the scene and after delivering 
the papers went home to tell his parents and to verify his story he checked his pocket to show 
the piece that of the object that he had retrieved but weirdly it was gone from his pocket and as he 
says I don't know what happened to it but I don't have any holes in my pocket so his parents were 
impressed they could tell he wasn't lying so 20 minutes after it occurred they estimate the three 
of them returned to the scene and got another shock because it had been cleaned up as Warren 
says all we found was the tire and broken mailbox to them it looked like the area had been swept 
up with a street sweeper and in fact the hole created by the object had already been filled in 
now this did capture the attention of researchers of Afro Coral Lorenzen and Jim Lorenzen 
and they did some research they sent out one of their investigators and they learned that a lady 
by the name of Margaret Pierce lived at the house with the destroyed mailbox but they did not see 
how this mailbox was destroyed and when they went out there they assumed a car had hit it so they 
did say that their dogs were barking up a storm at the time of this incident and further research did 
reveal other Witnesses there were three counselors who patrolled the area where children do deliver 
newspapers and they actually watched this object fall out of the sky they did not see it land 
so there was some speculation that this could have been a meteor so they brought in a meteor expert 
she's very well known in this field her name is Elizabeth Romer and she was consulted and 
she said no this does not sound like a meteor so you can take that for what it's worth but 
Coral Lorenzen was impressed by the case she said it is strange and particularly because of 
the Man in Black aspect of it so they did send an investigator who was ultimately unable to conclude 
make any solid conclusions as to what this object was but it wasn't over yet they were so impressed 
by this case that they decided that it might be a good idea if Warren was sent to a psychologist 
therapist to hypnotize him and they did they hypnotize him twice to elicit further details 
and they got some very interesting details as the therapist says I don't think he lied about anything I think what he said is worth checking out and under trance Warren did recall 
that the car he saw with the man getting out of it had New Jersey plates which is quite unusual 
and he said that when he approached this little object it was actually making a low humming noise 
so that couldn't be a meteor they don't make noise not when they're already in the ground and he says 
another weird effect that when he actually tried to touch this object a weird force field repelled 
his hand so this appears to be some sort of mechanical object in fact the apro investigator 
brought in a radiation detector and found that one side of the mailbox pole that had been struck down 
and a four foot circle under it showed about five times the radiation of the surrounding area 
but whatever this object was the evidence had been cleaned up enough that the results of the 
investigation were inconclusive so whether that was a UFO a meteor or something else you can make 
up your own minds about it but I thought it was worth including because it's definitely unusual 
and so is this next case which I call a UFO makes a family dizzy 
UFOs are known to have all kinds of physiological effects on a witness affect them physically 
and this is certainly true in this case this UFO not only made this family dizzy there 
were some other really weird physical effects which is why I wanted to include it in this 
presentation today so this next very weird case took place on March 17 1979 near Hertford England 
the main witness is Alice ball her husband daughter and son-in-law they were driving along 
where Road pictured here on the evening of March 17. several other cars were on the road around 
them and they were right near the A-10 bypass when the headlights on their car began to grow 
dim and the music on their cassette player faded and it was just at that moment that Alice saw a 
large glowing yellow ball of light they in about 10 or 15 other cars around them stopped to watch 
several of them were rolling down their Windows to get a closer look and this ball of Light which was 
quite large hovered for at least five minutes and it moved close enough that they saw other details 
Alice and her family could now see four red lights two on top and two on the bottom and what appeared 
to be four legs again two on top and two on the bottom and this object was clearly rotating or 
spinning and as Alice says it was quite large my husband slammed on the brakes so we could watch it 
and it was kind of hovering pretty close to them and as they watched a weird Haze began to form 
around it this place started coming closer and lower and then it moved directly over their car 
it was at this moment that Alice and her daughter reported some very strange sensations of feeling 
unwell a heaviness on their bodies their Vision became all Misty and blurred they saw spots of 
colors in front of their eyes and as Alice says as the strange object passed over our car my daughter 
and I felt sick and very heavy suddenly we all had blurred vision with colors before our eyes 
so they describe this to UFO researcher Anthony Steele and he was quite impressed and as he says 
the sensations the family experienced as the object passed over their car was probably caused 
by electromagnetic energy similar to the heaviness that is felt before and during thunderstorms 
all I know is these Witnesses are awfully shook up yeah a short case but as you can see quite strange 
and the next case I call beautiful people from a UFO there are so many accounts of Grays and 
praying mantis of course human looking ETS too and that's what is happening in this case which 
is quite unusual not only in terms of the ETS being described as incredibly beautiful the 
most beautiful people this witness has ever seen but also some other really unusual effects it's a 
UFO landing case with humanoids which took place in England and is pretty well verified it was a 
wet and windy night on November 21st 1980 in the village of Burnside this is in Cumbria England 
when Mario luisi a factory worker at the nearby Paper Factory croppers paper mill 
was walking his dogs in the fields near near his home in Hall Park 
so you can see Hall Park here it's right next to croppers Paper Mill and he was carrying a 
flashlight this was at night and he was looking for some fishing tackle that he had left behind 
near the banks of the river next to the paper mill and this is when he heard a weird sound 
and saw something walking in the shadows around what looked like a structure that he thought 
at first was a sheep shelter perhaps they thought maybe the figure was a cow but it wasn't because 
he shined his flashlight on it and got a real shock as Mario says I saw something that I thought 
must be a cow at first I swung around and Shone my torch which is the British word for flashlight 
shown my torch and a light flashed back melting it then I saw the craft about 16 feet long and 
eight feet deep dark colored with a blunt nose and sort of glass windows hovering off the ground 
so we instantly realized this was not normal this was a UFO you saw a strange symbol on the 
side of the craft but it was the people standing nearby that immediately caught his attention as 
he says in his own words a man and a woman stood next to it they were the most beautiful people I 
have ever seen their hair was light colored in a helmet style down past their shoulders 
they wore skin tight suits and she had a cloak over hers there were about five feet six inches 
tall their features were out of this world they had very pale skin as though they were 
ill or something I wanted to run but I couldn't I didn't believe it was happening to me but it was 
so an incredible part of this case is that Mario's flashlight was apparently disabled by the 
ETS and later he would discover that the glass was shattered and the reflector warped but for 
the next two or three minutes Mario spoke with the female E.T she's the 
one who did all the talking and she was the one who was holding a slim flashlight-like 
device in her hand which had apparently been used to disable Mario's flashlight 
she told Mara that they would not harm him that their mission was peaceful they warned him not to 
reveal the strange symbol that he saw on the side of the craft so this was a very short conversation 
Mario to this day has never talked about the symbol on the craft but as Mario says they got 
back into the ship up some full downstairs and it shot straight up in the sky in a red glow 
so Mario ran straight home and told his wife and a neighbor and his wife Judith confirmed 
Mario's story to investigators and she says he never gets scared but he was that night 
so Mario later learned that there was in fact another woman in the village who reported seeing 
a UFO in the same field but she refused to go public she was too frightened of ridicule 
but Mario went to the police and told them what happened this was also confirmed by investigators 
and the police said Mr luizi did report this to us and we sent a man out he found nothing so 
that's the end of the matter as far as we are concerned but they did add and I quote we did 
have one or two reported sightings in the crook area about two years ago but nothing recently 
so Mario offered his flashlight to the investigators to study and an analysis by 
experts showed exposure to a high heat Source but they thought it could have been done naturally or 
by Earth means by a blow torch so that was not really conclusive but nevertheless interesting 
following the experience Mario was so shook up he didn't venture out of his house unnecessarily for several weeks and he did go public despite ridicule as he says 
I know I'll be the laughing stock of the village for this but I'm not bothered because I know what 
I saw I'm not looking for any sympathy or anything before I might not have believed it myself 
I always believed in UFOs but never had any experience of them I know it's far-fetched but how 
do you explain the torch meaning the flashlight so in support of Mario's case only a few days 
later there was another Witness by the name of Miss critchley who had no idea about Mario's 
encounter which had been published in newspapers but she says she saw a very similar looking object 
she described it the same way only six miles from where Mario had his encounter and as she 
says describing her sighting at first there was a bright light about a mile away it darted right 
then left we are used to aircraft on the Fells but I stopped because I could see it wasn't anything 
like that in just a few seconds it was near the car hovering it was Squat and sort of grayish with 
a bright light on on the front and short Wings jutting back in a flash it was gone but I couldn't 
see where too I don't know if I believe in UFOs I've never thought about it before but I know what 
I saw I would like to talk to someone who knows about these things I'm not frightened just puzzled 
I think you'll agree that was a very strange case yeah all of these are just weird and freaky 
cases that's absolutely true with this next case which took place in Kentucky and I call this case 
a boy shoots an alien and yeah that's exactly what happened in this case and the results of 
this are really unusual this is a multiple witness case a lot of really strange effects 
I don't think people really even know about this case as far as I know it's never been written up in any books but I've gotten multiple sources for it this did hit the local newspapers in Kentucky 
and really an extraordinary case in on many levels which is why I wanted to include it today 
it's just so weird it was March 11 1981 in Casey County Kentucky when Kathy Gilpin and her 19 year 
old son Arlen were in their home near Chestnut flat Ridge this is a very rural area when they 
heard a strange whining sign sound outside kind of like a drill and as Arlen says it wasn't real loud 
at first but it kept getting louder and louder so they looked out the window and this is when they 
saw a large glowing ball of orange light coming downward into the woods right on their property 
so Kathy at first thought that a car might have driven off the roads so she got into her car to drive closer while Ireland stayed inside and made a phone 
call to his uncle and Aunt who lived nearby their names are curl and Candy Weddington 
so Kathy Gilpin was now in her car driving up towards this object 
and as she began to get close to it it would move away each time she got close so at this 
point she realized it wasn't a car or anything she could recognize and she became quite frightened 
but weirdly found that she was strangely compelled to follow it she did not want to but something 
was compelling her as she says I got this weird feeling that it was pulling me to it I thought 
there ain't no way I'm going any further I managed to get the car turned around and said Lord please 
let me get back home without wrapping this car around a tree so she was able to break free from 
this weird trance or this farce turned the car around and returned home so meanwhile Arlen after 
calling his relatives grabbed his pistol and hiked outside to investigate and as he trudged across 
the fields towards the woods he saw two glowing eyes right in front of him as he says was like 
there wasn't anything else there but there was the eyes were above me and it wasn't a human figure 
it seemed like a big giant ape but I couldn't tell I'm six foot one and it was much bigger more than 
seven feet I shot at it and it just disappeared I'd say it was something from outer space I don't 
know of anything on Earth that I could shoot at from that close and it could just disappear 
so that really frightened him and he went back to the house and as he's going back to 
the house suddenly the creature appears behind him so he raises his pistol to try and shoot 
it again but at this point he found that he was unable to do so as he says this time when I saw 
it it didn't scare me as much as it did the first time I could hear something like it was trying to talk but I couldn't make nothing out of it it kept getting closer I kept trying and 
trying to pull the trigger but I couldn't pull the trigger it seemed like it wouldn't let me 
so now Panic stricken he ran back to the house he was babbling wildly about what he had just 
seen what had just happened and that's when his mom and relatives noticed a very strange thing 
Arlen's hands were completely covered with this weird green substance and as candy webington says 
it looked like a powder was covering them but it wasn't a powder it wouldn't rub or wash off 
so Arlen was still quite afraid he was talking a mile a minute and they took his gun away from 
him tried to calm down make some coffee and suddenly Arlen stood up as if in a trance and 
walked out the door and stood at the end of the walkway and the creature was back the others in 
the house watched from the window as Arlen stood face to face with this creature and apparently 
they started a conversation so I'll just let Arlen describing his own words what happened as he says 
I got this feeling while I was in the house that I had to go outside the glowing eyes kept getting closer and closer I couldn't move it was waiting for me it seemed 
like I was trying to talk to me but I couldn't understand it it was making electronic sounds I still couldn't make out its shape in the dark then it just touched me on the cheek it was like 
a shock like when you bump into an electrified fence only it went from my cheek down through 
my whole body I was afraid it seemed like when it touched me was letting me know that it could 
do whatever it wanted to and I couldn't stop it it had a power over my mind that really freaked 
me out I was torn up at this point the creature disappeared and Arlen stumbled back into the house 
and this is when his mom uncle and Aunt could now see a strange purple mark on Arlen's cheek exactly 
where this creature had touched him in fact the right side of his face was all puffy and red 
so Ireland's father returned home around this time and he saw the burn mark he saw 
Arlen's green hands and as his father says his hands didn't look green they were green 
and Ireland was wild when I got there he was scared to death absolutely terrified 
so other than his green hands and the burn on his cheek Arlen noticed no other physical effects but 
he was very much mentally and emotionally shaken by what he saw as he says I don't 
know what it was there was a form there but I can't describe it it didn't seem to want to 
hurt anyone but I would never try to follow one again I just think it must be from another planet 
what I saw doesn't actually scare me but it doesn't make me feel too good either I don't think I want to get that close to it again I haven't any idea what it was it wasn't anything 
of human form and I have this feeling that it's going to come back it may not come back here 
but it'll come somewhere and his mother Kathy agrees this was very unusual and as she says I 
know one thing I'm not going to be as Brave and follow it the next time if there is a next time 
I do know it had a sensation over my mind and body something was trying to pull me to that light 
so strange I call this next case a UFO roadblock this is a well-known behavior of UFOs if they want 
to take someone on board a UFO will often land in the middle of the road making it impossible to 
pass this is what happened with Betty and Barney Hill and that's what happened in this case though 
it's got a number of really unusual elements to it this case turned out to be extraordinarily 
complex it was the first of many contacts where the gentleman was taken on board and 
later visited with the ETS who took him to their Planet it's a really unusual case from Sweden and 
I think might be one of Sweden's most famous cases though I doubt any of you have heard it before I 
may be wrong but we will see because I I mean I had to include this case it is just so unusual 
and again pretty well verified it's very strange and quite extensive case took place in February 
1983 not far from tingsrid Sweden this was an icy cold night and the primary witness is a 41 
year old government employee by the name of ante Johnson he was driving along Highway 30 when he 
encountered a UFO now prior to seeing this UFO he didn't sing a lot of deer and moose crossing the 
road when suddenly he saw what he first thought was a small child standing alongside the road 
and then he was distracted because looking up he saw a giant object which kind of looked like the 
shape of a submarine but it was floating above the highway and obviously wasn't a submarine and 
I'll just let ante describe this in his own words as he says I was driving home at about 1am when I 
saw a monster UFO before me I thought at first it might have been a plane a helicopter or some other 
large object but it wasn't was much too large for anything like that it was 200 to 250 feet across 
and between 15 and 30 feet high and hovered about 30 feet off the ground over the road ahead of me 
so this was in most respects a classic metallic saucer had no markings except for a pulsating red 
light on top and he saw it really for only a few moments when it suddenly vanished so he was very 
impressed by this the small figure was no longer there so he was amazed and decided to take action 
and this would be a decision that would affect him profoundly for the rest of his life as he says I 
drove home got my camera and drove back to the place I thought I might get a lucky picture of it 
so the UFO wasn't there and he started driving up and down Highway 30 in the same area looking 
for it went to his amazement it reappeared on the highway right in front of his car landed on 
the highway itself in fact he had to slam on his brakes and he skidded to a stop only a few feet 
from the craft at this point his engine failed and shut off as ante says I was scared stiff I 
felt something strange come over me and I knew I just had to get out of that place Come What May 
there was no way to get around the UFO it was huge so at this point ante is 
trying frantically to start his car a Volvo and race away but no surprise the engine wouldn't 
start and as he's struggling to get the engine started a door opened up in the craft in front 
of him and about eight short humanoid figures emerged walked up to his car and surrounded it 
they opened the door and tried to pull him out so ante at this point completely forgot his camera he 
was overwhelmed with beer as he says when I opened the door a creature grabbed me and almost lifted 
me out I just screamed I felt something pull me out of the car just like I was a doll I cried 
out and kicked and struggled I struck one in the skull it fell down to the ground and didn't move 
so at this point more came out of the craft and pulled him out and he says I got terrified of course but for some reason I stopped resisting I managed to get free and 
fled for my life I hid in a deserted house off the road but more of them came after me 
so he is very frightened at this point the ETS are coming to get him and this is when another 
truck appeared on the highway and according to the police report on this incident the truck 
was being driven by a gentleman by the name of bent Johansson he's a professional truck driver 
and he saw this saucer and so he actually drove away and immediately called the police to report 
this landed saucer now ante is watching all this happen from his Vantage and as ante says 
the driver didn't stop perhaps he didn't dare it was probably what saved my life I ran back 
out onto the highway and I saw the timber truck slow down at the spot where I'd left my car my legs couldn't Carry Me fighting against the E.T and taking all my strength 
so he he did manage to make it into his car but collapsed the police arrived shortly later there 
was of course no sign of the saucer but they found ante collapsed in his car and they wrote up a 
report on the case saying and I quote we have tried to pick holes in his account but failed 
so he was immediately taken to a mental hospital for psychiatric tests he said it was horrible and 
following this Swedish military officials heard about his case and interviewed him extensively now 
he wanted to keep it secret but they did release a report in November of 1984 and he went public 
and he says it's etched in my mind what I saw was so incredible I have problems believing it myself 
but I know I saw and experienced it all and this was just the first of many many encounters it was 
two or three weeks after the experience he's had a very strong compulsion to go outside as he says 
something tells me to go out I had no plans to go out at all got stronger and stronger and of course 
I went out and he's walking around wondering what the heck he's doing when he saw a strange man 
sitting standing under a Street Lamp and he wanted to walk away from him and in fact he tried but 
couldn't and felt compelled to follow this figure he says this figure actually floated and went down 
a forest path and that's when he saw the UFO again and he says I got to see this craft again I was 
still a little scared but not like the first time he watches this figure disappeared Under The Craft 
a beam of light came out of the craft and came towards him and he says I'm a little scared I'm 
completely awake and I look down and I'm getting higher and higher so he was floated up over the 
streets uh well actually what he remembered was being taken up and apparently into this craft 
and then was let down on the lawn of his house and as he says I would have been scared to death 
but I never was and he started to recall all kinds of things he said the ETS took 
him to a lake about 27 miles from his home and spoke to him there before taking him back home 
about this time he started dreaming of being taken to other planets the ETS were very much concerned 
about nuclear war and US destroying ourselves uh he started to see a wide variety of ETS he'd be 
in his home when this weird sort of paralyzing force would come over his body the next thing he knew he'd be inside his craft he saw another round-eyed E.T who gave him something to drink 
and he said it was something like a mug with something floating in it it looks like heavily diluted milk slightly grayish his hands looks like mine with the difference that there are no 
fingers visible and wanted me to drink I hesitated but he insisted so I do as he pleased it was not 
very tasty a little insipid but still Swedish he asked what it was but didn't get a response and 
yeah his case just snowballed from there he had many many encounters he came to the attention of 
investigators it's a very complex story in fact he did co-write a book about his experiences 
unfortunately he passed away only a few years ago but in Sweden it's a pretty well known case 
here I don't think people know about it at all yeah that's probably one of the more extensive 
cases in this presentation I certainly couldn't include all the details uh there is a book on 
this case and uh I think it has been translated to English on some websites I certainly did find that 
but once I realized how extensive that case was I realized I'm not going to be able to cover it in 
just one episode but I presented a good portion of it and I think you'll agree that is weird 
and so is this next case which I call UFO sucks water from a pool and this is a well-known again 
behavior of UFOs they do seem to be very attracted to water there's a number of cases where they do 
take water out of reservoirs and lakes rivers oceans but I hadn't heard of them taking water 
out of pools and I found one case and then after doing a search I found another both these cases 
synchronistically took place in Argentina and again our pretty well verified and really unusual 
I know the people who had this happen to them were absolutely Blown Away by it so that's why 
I included it in this presentation today now this very weird case took place in the town of olavaria 
in Argentina in January of 1984 when apparently numerous residents of the Town saw a UFO come down 
and start sucking water out of multiple swimming pools there's only one source for this case so 
it's not fully verified but certainly a lot of Witnesses are quoted in the newspaper article 
one of them is an electrician by the name of Carlos Borelli who says he was awakened at 
3 AM by bright lights and going outside saw an object sucking water from a pool 
as he says I saw a huge long oval object literally parked about 100 feet above the yard 
the object was twice the size of a blimp and had a ring of colored lights around it which flashed 
on and off red yellow orange and green all of a sudden a beam of bright light shot down from the 
object and the water from the pool rushed up through the light so fast it appeared it was 
being sucked up a drinking straw suddenly the object shot off at an incredible speed in less 
than three seconds it was gone the whole event took 10 or 11 seconds I've never seen anything 
like it I thought I might have been dreaming but going out to the pool I saw it was empty 
so that's not the only pool that was emptied Jose Vega was the manager of a bank in the area and he 
said the pool at the employees Club was also drained as he says in his own words our club 
was visited by a flying saucer which emptied our swimming pool more than 10 000 gallons disappeared 
another witness was apparently a police Sergeant by the name of Carlos Palacios 
and he said and I quote there was no noise and I even verified it by checking the pool it was empty 
I couldn't believe my eyes but as incredible as it sounds it was not science fiction so a lot of 
people saw this including two army soldiers and a priest pictured here father Romeo mussarango 
and of course the police knew all about this being Witnesses and assistant police chief Juan 
Carlo longobardi says more than 20 Witnesses of High Caliber saw the incredible lights in the sky 
that and the Mysterious extraction of water from swimming pools points to what we recognize as fact olivaria has been visited by UFOs 
apparently this is not the only case of UFOs visiting Argentina and sucking water out of pools 
it was a very interesting case in the tiny little isolated Town known as justiniana 
Posse this is again in Argentina where 60 000 leaders disappeared Without a Trace 
from the pool at the hotel Macau this is a very interesting case while no UFO was seen 
the owner of the hotel Lilo Garcia informed the local media 
and uh what happened was when Lucille chiati went to clean the pool he found there was no water 
and as Lilo says he called me and said what did you do there's no water in the pool 
Lilo replied yeah right there's no water and Lucille said no no come on over 
so Lilo says I went and it was dry there wasn't a drop of water you could look around and there 
was no water I don't understand because when we drain the pool to clean it such an amount 
of water takes a day and a half to drain we flood the patio and the water runs down the street all 
the way to the canal but this time there was nothing not a single drop of water anywhere
was responsible for the pool's maintenance and he inspected it swept it and ascertained it 
there were no cracks the pool was not broken but this is a big pool 60 000 liters and uh just gone 
they said it takes six trucks of water to fill this pool so anyone needing to steal the water 
would it need at least that many trucks it says it takes half a day to do the job at a minimum 
and there was no trace of any water anywhere and as Lilo says the owner of the hotel Markell 
if they dumped it on the patio or anywhere nearby there would be a pond I don't understand 
pool was dry enough to paint it we laughed with Lucille and couldn't understand what was happening 
so yeah the pool had no cracks it's never leaked and as one of the witnesses says 
I have no opinion this is a mystery for history to resolve so yeah sixty thousand leaders gone 
and no trace of it what no UFO has seen but where did the water go that's the question 
so if all the water disappears from your pool now you know how it might have happened perhaps 
ETS did it so it's not clear exactly what they're using the water for drinking cleaning powering 
their craft still lots of room for research here but it's absolutely a very weird case and 
so is this next one which I call a UFO made him psychic and this is a well-known side effect of 
UFO Encounters this is a very unusual case for a lot of reasons or some weird animal effects 
some weird spiritual psychic effects and not only that physiological effects I mean this witness had 
something happen to him that was so profound and unusual I've never heard anything like it 
this is a case from Africa actually researched by Cynthia Hind an African researcher and I 
think you'll find it very unusual and certainly interesting all right this is the second to last 
case that I'm presenting today and it definitely qualifies as weird took place in 1988 to a school 
teacher by the name of Stuart his last name is not given this occurred in mutare in Zimbabwe Africa 
Stewart had just left the General Hospital and was walking down nearby Pasteur Drive 
and as he's walking down this uh little Street he decides to take a shortcut through the field and this is when he encountered a very large and unusual looking UFO and as Stewart 
says in his own words I saw this thing the object was making a very high pitched noise 
was about 100 meters up in the air a bluish gray with a rugby ball shape with spikes on the side 
when I looked at it I could not move or speak the whole area seemed to be silent it was quite 
frightening there were green blue and a sort of orangey red lights around it which were flashing 
I seemed to be stuck to the ground for a long time so he actually did see a little girl on the 
porch nearby and called out to her look a UFO but she made no reaction and didn't even seem 
to hear him which he found quite puzzling because this was a big object very visible 
and he was frightened and the craft started making a louder noise and he attempted to flee and he 
experienced something very strange as he says I began to run with much effort and it seemed to 
be in slow motion the object just hovered almost above me I could not move for a while and when 
I did it was in slow motion yet the strides I took were abnormally long and Swift and smooth 
I ran to the field where the horses were and I stopped again the horses did not move at all 
and it seemed this was for a very long time they just stood there with their heads up so yeah there 
were horses in the area who are apparently paralyzed when this UFO appeared overhead 
and as this object the sound of it increases and it's moving upwards then the horses started moving 
and not only moving I mean they went crazy as Stuart says the horses ran in all directions 
I could also feel myself running and sweating it was a very strange feeling I ran and ran the 
object flew higher up and shot across the sky I stopped and watched it I arrived home and banged 
at the door so he's frantic at this point his wife and children and his younger brother all came out 
in time to see the lights of the UFO disappearing into the distance they did not get a close look 
at it though but they certainly believed him because they saw it himself themselves and Stewart called the local newspaper they showed no interest suspected a hoax his family 
again believed him but when he told his friends they really questioned him and Stuart learned 
the hard way that people do receive disbelief skepticism and ridicule but it frightened him 
badly enough that he refused to set foot in this field for years afterwards and it was immediately 
following this event that there were several strange after effects very strange after effects 
first he began to have very vivid dreams of seeing himself actually floating across this field as 
he says when I wake up I feel as if I really did float so looks like this may have been more than 
just a sighting and the reason I think that is because there were more weird effects as we'll see 
next he started having really amazing and somewhat disturbing for him premonitions as he says 
strange things began to happen I could foretell different happenings even death and accidents 
I kept this only between myself and my wife as she knew what I was going through 
but he had several instances where he would sense danger was near and would leave the area only 
to find out that a fight broke out someone had been stabbed or beaten up these sort of things 
and as he says this has happened so many times during February and March I told my 
wife that there was going to be a death for sure a cousin of mine was killed in Harare 
his head was crushed in an accident and another two people died of natural causes 
I could see or feel all of them even when my father passed away in 1993 I knew it I felt it 
so yeah this encounter made him profoundly psychic he was having constant premonitions 
and he had never been a drinker but following this he did start consuming alcohol and another weird effect as he says I also became highly sexually active and it is a problem for me 
and things weren't over yet the worst after effect for him was a strange fungal ear infection which 
persisted despite numerous Medical Treatments and he says it seems to be connected to his 
premonitions as his ear would itch before bad things would happen and he later wondered if 
perhaps an implant was placed in his ear but it was years later in 1995 he went to his doctor for 
some heart issues and his doctor said something very strange he said have you been in an accident 
and Stewart said no why the doctor said well this is very strange you are missing a rib and 
it looks like it's been surgically cut off from your spine and again asthma if he had had surgery 
or an accident of course Stewart denied this he hadn't had any surgery there was no accident 
and they wondered if perhaps this has been done when he or that he was born without a rib 
but the doctor said no that couldn't be the case because all your other ribs looked normal and if that was the case they would have grown slightly differently and the fact is he had previous x-rays 
which did not show this missing rib Stuart did not tell his doctor about his UFO encounter but 
finding that out absolutely freaked him out and as he says I want to find out if something really 
happened to me on that day I have this fear of the whole incident over me all the time 
I just don't know what is all about or what I should do so yeah he thinks he was probably 
taken another weird thing was he largely forgot about the whole encounter after it occurred then 
he would remember it and then he would forget it again and remember it so there was that weird Amnesia aspect as well a weird case for sure and now we get to our final case for today 
which I call pineapple pinching aliens UFOs are known for picking plants and flowers and taking 
animals on board and that's what happened in this case though it involves pineapples it's 
a really unusual case with some very strange elements to it quite a bit of verification 
and apparently it's not unique because there's a couple of cases of ETS taking pineapples
this next and last truly weird case occurred sometime in the late 1980s that's an approximation 
the exact date is not given but it occurred at the Roy farms in kalundra in Queensland Australia 
the main witness is Harry Roy age 73 owner of the farm and apparently a contact d 
now this case comes from long time UFO researcher John Pinckney who's written some books on this 
and John interviewed Harry Roy and as Harry says regarding this weirdly weird UFO incident 
I was working near the homestead one afternoon when the Earth was shaken by a series of huge 
thumps thinking there must have been an earthquake I hurried over to my brother Gordon's house to 
ensure he was okay he had heard the noises too and said he was sure they had come from the back of 
the farm we went down there with a local teacher and discovered that 15 000 pineapple tops we had 
readied for planting had vanished there was no Road into that part of the property and not even 
a helicopter could have entered undetected I'm in no doubt that a UFO pinched those pineapples 
for years they've been taking whatever they like from the farms around here on several occasions 
they even drained water from dams so yeah very unusual there are many cases in the literature 
of UFOs picking plants and flowers and sucking water but I don't know that there's any other 
case where they've taken 15 000 pineapples but there's quite a bit of confirmation from this 
case not only from you know these two witnesses but many people in the area have been seeing UFOs 
in fact so many that there's speculation that there might be a UFO base in the nearby Glass 
House mountains because UFOs were often seen in that area and in a few cases even photographed 
now Roy says that this was not his only encounter way back in 1920 when he was 
six years old a huge silver object hovered over their Orchards and he says as he grew up on the 
farm he often Came Upon 36 36 foot wide Circles of scorched Earth in the fields around his home 
and one evening as an adult he woke up to see an entity in his bedroom as he says I awoke to 
find a man wearing a silver suit standing beside the bed I just lay there staring unable to move 
or call out to my wife Irene the man ran his hands through my hair then went into the children's room 
I was powerless to stop him I'm pretty sure I've had other contact I can't remember 
so he says this because he's had missing time incidents with some people around him 
and he also starts to get a weird feeling when UFOs show up and as he says in his own words 
they seem to have made mental contact with a lot of us up here 
so yeah that's a case of UFOs stealing 15 000 pineapples or pineapple tops and this might not be 
the only time they've done that because there was another case which is unrelated in that it's in 
a different time in a different area it occurred years earlier on June 25 1968 on Honolulu Hawaii 
and uh the main witness did report his encounter as he says it was a night that was extremely dark 
my friend Mark and I were playing army and I rolled underneath a parked car and rolled back out and we both saw a bright object in the sky it was completely silent and we both watched 
this object until it went straight up over the pineapple fields that night we called the tower 
at Pearl City and reported it and they said we were not the only ones to have reported it 
so whether or not it actually was interested in the pineapple fields as a matter of some speculation but it's certainly interesting and his father went to look for evidence but never 
found any sign of a landing but as the witness says I still remember it vividly well that's the 
show for today I hope hope you've enjoyed these 12 well 13 cases that I've presented to you and 
as you can see they're all unique they come from all over the world they cover the entire gamut 
of UFO encounters sightings Landings face-to-face encounters onboard encounters and one perhaps UFO 
crash all really unusual all providing interesting and unique insights into the nature of UFO contact 
I hope you've learned something and that these are cases you haven't heard before because that is really my goal I think this these cases here are enough to give you a pretty good 
basic understanding of the UFO phenomena and show how weird and unusual it can be so I want to thank 
you very much for watching I truly appreciate it there's always something new to learn about UFOs 
and ETS and I think it's important that everyone knows about these cases that we are not alone on 
this planet that we are being visited regularly that these kinds of cases are far far more common 
than people realize said it many times most people do not report their encounters so I hope this 
encourages more and more people to step forth and have find the courage to talk openly about their 
UFO encounters So yeah thank you again I really appreciate you watching and until next time keep 
searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye.
