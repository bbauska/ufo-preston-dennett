TEN SHOCKING CASES OF UFO HEALINGS
Mar 3, 2023

Summary:
Mar 3, 2023
Cases of UFO Healings are not new. They have been occurring for more than 100 years. Most major researchers have multiple cases, and they are reported by all kinds of people from all over the world. There are more than 300 documented cases, and they are recognized as a regular feature of UFO contact.

This video presents ten shocking cases of UFO healings. Each case contains surprising and unique elements that offer profound insights into the aliens and their agenda on our planet.

Marla (pseudonym) from Marysville, WA had suffered for years from kidney disease, and developed a large gallstone which necessitated the surgical removal of her gallbladder. In Jan 2015, following a visit by short, large-headed entities in her bedroom, Marla awoke to find a strange surgical scar on her abdomen. It was deep, but pain-free, had no blood, and healed with incredible speed. When she went to doctors, they were shocked to find that her gallstone had been removed, but her gallbladder was still there!

Maria M. Rivera of Aguada, Puerto Rico was suffering from cancer all through her body when (in 2006) she and her family had a UFO sighting followed by many visits by gray ETs. Then Maria was taken onboard a craft and underwent a painful operation. Afterward, she went to the doctor and was shocked to discover that the cancer was now gone.

On Jul 19, 1988, Diane and Phyllis (mother and daughter) drove to their home in Johannesburg, South Africa and were stopped by a human-looking female who guided them onto a craft. From age 13, Diane had suffered from chronic jaundice. The ETs healed her and gave them both warnings about huge environmental catastrophes soon to strike our planet. 

In 1986, Richard T., paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, was enjoying an evening on the beach in La Jolla, CA when a huge torpedo-shaped craft hovered overhead. Richard was taken into the craft, wheelchair and all. Onboard, he saw several short humanoids and then blacked out. Over the next few days, Richard’s paralysis disappeared. He was healed.

On Aug 30, 1979, Jean Cyr (a retired Canada Army officer) and his family were drawn outside of their home in St. Eustache, Quebec by an odd humming sound. They saw a glowing metallic disc rise from the fields near their home. This began a series of encounters which was witnessed by many of their neighbors and local airport officials. Jean began waking up with unexplained marks on his body. After several encounters, Jean, who had severe multiple sclerosis, was healed.

In the mid-1930s, a 13-year-old boy suffering from tuberculosis found himself on his deathbed. Then he had a “dream” that he was taken into a weird craft and healed by strange-looking figures. With no idea of aliens or UFOs, he couldn’t explain what happened. He only knew that he had somehow been healed. It wasn’t until the 1950s, that he heard about UFOs and aliens that he understood his experience.

In Mar 1977, Carmina of San Juan, Puerto Rico was confronted by a strange human-looking gentleman who had somehow managed to get past the guards in her secured office building. The man informed her that he was an ET, and that Carmina’s daughter should continue her UFO research with investigator, Jorge Martin, and that Martin himself was being spied on by US intelligence officers. Carmina, who had been diagnosed with a cyst in her breast, received the shocking news that her cyst had miraculously disappeared.

Richard Rylka, a well-known New Jersey UFO contactee, had developed a large tumor on his forehead. While in Atlantic City, he was visited by human-looking ETs who took him onboard a healed his tumor. Rylka, whose tumor had been seen by all his friends and family, was cured. 

In 1979, Faina Maksimovna was facing surgery to remove a tumor on her thyroid. Frightened of surgery, Faina prayed to God. To her shock, that evening she was visited by three human-looking figures who proceeded to enact a healing on her. When Faina later went to see her doctors, they were baffled and amazed to see that her tumor was gone.

In Dec 1989, Mae, a 60-year-old waitress from Mississippi was being forced to retired due to severe arthritis. Driving home, a UFO dropped down over her car and pulled her onboard. Mae found herself surrounded by several figures who placed a “kind of rod” over her body. The next morning, her pain was gone. She was healed.

These ten cases show that people from all walks of life are being healed by many different types of ETs. They show that healing is one of the primary ET agendas, and that ETs have the ability to heal almost any kind of illness, condition or disease.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today I'm going to be talking about UFO healing cases in fact the title of this episode is called 
10 shocking cases of UFO healings as you may know I have done a lot of research into these types of 
cases I think they have quite a bit to say about extraterrestrials how advanced they are and their 
agenda on our planet and these cases here are particularly unusual they cover a wide variety 
of healings conditions and as I said I think they really have some really profound insights into 
extraterrestrials and why they're here these cases come from all over the world they've occurred to 
all kinds of people most major researchers have these types of cases and they're just 
not receiving the attention they deserve they show that UFO contact is often very benevolent 
so that's why I really wanted to do this episode for you today and as I mentioned these cases are 
quite unusual I have 10 of them and I think you'll find them quite interesting I certainly hope so so 
let's just get started the first case I'd like to talk about today occurred in Marysville Washington 
I call the main witness Marla that's a pseudonym but she had a very interesting healing involving 
her gallbladder now Marla and her family had been seeing UFOs many times outside their home 
in Marysville but it was in January of 2015 when Marla had gone to bed and heard someone 
banging around in the kitchen she assumed her oldest daughter was cooking and thought nothing 
of it but as she lay back down events became very strange as Marla says in her own words suddenly I 
heard a loud high-pitched ring it was disorienting my bedroom door opened and I saw three beings walk 
into my room I couldn't make out what they looked like light bathed behind them so they 
looked dark it was hard to make out the detail Marla says that these figures were short Stout 
with large heads and a short neck and as she says as soon as I saw them I sat up and tried to speak 
they walked to the foot of my bed and then one touched my foot and Bam I was out like a light 
now this case was researched by a mufan field investigator by the name of Mark 
krubsack he's also the state section director for California so it's a well-verified case at 
any rate Marla woke up the next morning to one of the most shocking sites of her life she worked in the medical field she was familiar with surgery and surgical procedures at the time 
of her visitation she was suffering from kidney disease and gallstones she was in fact due to have surgery to remove her gallbladder in one week and as Marla says 
the next day the very moment I woke up I exhaled what tasted like gas it was a familiar feeling and 
tasted like I had just woken up from surgery and had been put to sleep with an anesthesia 
I was groggy so I tried to sit up in bed and felt a sharp pain in my abdominal area I looked under 
my shirt and I indeed had an incision this was like no incision I had seen before first it was 
very straight as an arrow and was very clean the skin looked void of blood at the incision 
and second no Betadine or other substances were used to prep a patient's skin to prevent infection 
third it was glued together no stitches or Staples not only did it not have any dried 
blood or cautery marks but most of all the odd thing was it could be pulled apart and still 
no blood and when you let go it sealed right back together until you pulled it apart again 
so understandably Marla freaked out she opened the incision two inches deep but became frightened and 
closed it back up again she showed it to her family who were equally baffled and alarmed 
and at the time of the incident everyone had been in bed though a few of them had also heard 
the strange banging in the kitchen and when they inspected the kitchen there was nothing Disturbed 
so Marla told nobody but her family what happened as she says as someone who worked in nursing and 
surgery for years I knew I couldn't talk to my doctor about it without being labeled crazy 
and the surprises were still coming as Marla says in her own words a few days after this 
happened the incision rapidly healed far faster than any I have had before 
most of the time my incisions took well over a month to heal due to my bad kidney disease 
now it was one week before this incident that Marla was scheduled to have another pre-surgery ultrasound and exam for her gallbladder removal surgery 
and by this time the mysterious incision on her abdomen was gone she went to the doctors 
to get her ultrasound and this is when she got a huge surprise as Marla says in her own words 
when they did the ultrasound the stone that was as large as my gallbladder was completely gone this 
Stone I had was far too large for me to pass and it had to be removed along with my gallbladder but 
when I got the ultrasound the stone was gone yet my gallbladder remained this baffled the doctors 
a gallstone surgery has to include removing the gallbladder yet mine was intact Sans Stone 
so Marla has no idea why this happened to her and unfortunately the ultimate results were not 
good because one year following the incident she had a new and larger gallstone and had to have it 
surgically removed so while she believes the ETS healed her it was only temporary 
and as Marla says she wasn't happy about this as she says this event changed my life in a bad way 
even though I am thankful to whoever helped heal my body from a bad Stone it scares me that I have 
no idea who it was or why they took me to do such a thing this has made me fear who could remove me 
from my home perform a surgery on me and put me back without anyone being the wiser also to 
not know who did this to me our own government or some non-human has made it quite hard on me I want 
answers yet have no way to ever find out who did this so she began suffering from anxieties and was 
afraid to reach out to support from the medical community or fear of being labeled deluded luckily 
her family was very supportive then a few months later in the summer of 2015 it happened again 
and on this occasion Marla woke up to find a clean precise surgical scar across her sternum area 
and as before it healed very rapidly as Marla says I still have both scars I need answers but 
most of all I want people to know that life is not exactly what we think it is when someone else can 
remove you from your home and you have no memory of what happened no power to stop it it's scary 
yet I know people need to know it does happen so Marla finally did reach out to mufan to report 
her experience and as she says I am willing to provide medical records and proof of my gallstone 
being there and disappearing I also would do a polygraph to prove that I am being honest 
so yeah I agree with her this is something that people do need to know about it's an interesting 
case because this is the kind of surgery that we can't do and yet the ETS did it and it's also 
interesting because the Cure wasn't permanent it's an interesting case on many levels and 
here's another case which is very interesting involving a cure for cancer this occurred in 
the city of Aguada this is in Northwest Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has a huge number of encounters 
and the main witness in this case is Maria M Rivera her case has been reported in a number 
of cases she's been quite vocal about it starting in 2005 Maria and her family who are all devout 
Christians were repeatedly visited by gray ETS in their home in Aguada the first encounter that 
they're aware of occurred on November 10 2005 when she and her daughter saw a huge silver disc with 
portholes move over the house and apparently descend into the rainforest behind their home 
it was just a few months later on April 28 2006 Maria was in the backyard when her dog suddenly 
became paralyzed and a gray ET emerged from the forest and began to communicate with her 
telepathically and at this point the entire family experienced a period of missing time so following 
this encounter the visitations began to occur every couple of months or so usually involving 
Grays outside or inside their home once she saw a gray peering in through the front door window 
so after a half dozen or more of these visitations Maria experienced a full-blown on-board experience 
on November 3rd 2007 she woke up to find her bed surrounded by gray ETS she was 
rendered unconscious but woke up shortly later to find herself in a strange room lying on what 
she believes is a steal or a metallic table still surrounded by the grays she was unable 
to move as the ETS placed a round metallic suction cup like instrument on her abdomen 
as Maria says it felt as if my flesh was being stretched and my inside was being sucked out like 
a powerful vacuum I was in excruciating pain when they did that but I was unable to scream or move 
now at this time Maria was actually suffering from ovarian cancer which had spread throughout 
her body she had undergone operations in New York City to have these malignancies removed 
from her intestines and her breast but the cancer kept returning currently she was suffering from 
constant stomach pains and had traces of blood in her stool and urine and her doctors had tested 
her and told her that the cancer had spread again and that she needed another operation 
so this was when this encounter occurred and as Maria says in her own words after the encounter 
with these creatures on April 28 2006 I returned to New York several tests were performed and 
no cancer was detected the pain and bleeding had stopped I truly feel that these creatures cured me 
now despite her cure Maria was not quite ready to embrace the grays 
as she says it could be benevolent and compassionate creatures but I'm afraid of them 
they do not have my permission to do with my body whatever they please although I believe they had cured me I am not their guinea pig I think it is fair to 
say that those beings have tagged branded and are actively tracking abductees like myself 
they're quite awful creatures and have no regard for Humanity in animals living on Earth 
to them we're just a science project I could be wrong but I think the creatures cured my cancer 
because they need a healthy specimen for their experiments so this just goes to show how deeply 
afraid people are and even though these et's are curing people and doing a wonderful service people 
don't always react in ways you would think Maria says that during her operation in which she was 
healed she managed to communicate briefly with the ETS and called them Martians they 
informed her that they don't like to be called martians and preferred to be called creatures 
so this is an interesting case yes she did feel pain during this operation which is true for a 
lot of the cancer cures that I've covered in other cases but they healed her where doctors couldn't 
and I understand you know people are free to have their own interpretations to what's going on here 
but they did heal her and she is thankful she just has a lot of fear surrounding this 
and this is one of the reasons I want to do these episodes to inform people because fear really just 
comes from the unknown now here's another case involving a cure of jaundice and this occurred 
in Johannesburg South Africa on July 1988. Diane and her daughter Phyllis who was 34 years old 
we're driving to their home in Johannesburg when a bright light descended over their car 
they felt a presence and suddenly they saw a five foot tall woman with a tan complexion 
so the woman guided them into a craft and introduced herself as melila that's her name 
and said that she meant no harm next thing Diane and Phyllis know they find themselves completely 
trusting and they allowed malila to put them on a table for medical examination and tests 
and he said there were several other people in The Craft at some point Phyllis the daughter 
heard her mother gasp in pain during the exam and she said you're not doing that to me 
and malila replied if there's trouble we can't help you unless you allow it 
so at the time of this incident Diane the mother was suffering from hemolytic jaundice 
and the being asked her what do your medical people call your condition 
and Diane told the ETS about her jaundice which she had had chronically since age 12. 
so they apparently did a healing and they not only healed her they gave her many prophecies about 
disasters that would affect the entire world in the future and this case was investigated 
by renowned researcher Cynthia Hind and a Cynthia hind writes since the abduction her 
illness has apparently cleared up and she has never needed medical attention since 
she has been absolutely well prior to that nobody had been able to find a cure for her condition 
so yeah overall a very benevolent encounter and once again we see ETS healing conditions that 
Earth doctors simply cannot do and here's another example of this same sort of thing 
this next case occurred in 1986 to a gentleman from La Jolla California 
and this case was investigated by researcher Brad Steiger the main witness we only know his first 
name Richard and the first initial of his last name which is T so the main witness Richard T 
was actually wheelchair-bound he's partially paralyzed and one evening while enjoying uh 
an evening on the beach Richard was shocked to see a 100 foot long torpedo-shaped object a craft 
hovering above him and the next thing he knew he was falling into a kind of trance and felt himself 
being lifted up into the craft while still in his wheelchair he says he had no fear as he 
was examined by quote smallish humanoids with large heads and enormously large slanted eyes 
so he doesn't have a whole lot of recall of what happened but the next thing he knew he 
found himself seated in the front seat of his van with his wheelchair tucked away in the back 
and the most fantastic part of this whole experience the most shocking apart was of course the after effect because according to Brad Steiger and I quote amazingly over the next few weeks his 
condition began to reverse itself until he was finally able to walk again with the help of a cane 
so yeah there you go the ETS cured a gentleman of paralysis it's amazing what 
they can do and here is another really good example of their amazing abilities to heal 
this next case occurred in Saint Eustis Quebec 
and this occurred on August 30th 1979 to a retired Canadian Army officer by the name of Jean Sear 
now this case was investigated by well-known researcher Wendell Stevens 
and how this case began was the family was drawn outside by a strange humming noise 
and what's outside we saw a large glowing metallic disc rise from the fields behind their house 
hover over their home and send down beams of light so they lived not far from the Mirabelle 
airport the Montreal Airport so they called the nearby Mirabelle control tower in the Montreal 
International Airport who confirmed to him that they could actually see the UFO so this is great 
confirmation and in fact the tower controller vectored in a plane but the UFO winked out as 
soon as the plane came close and came back when the plane left and another attempt provoked the 
same response and meanwhile the neighbors of the Sears also saw this object and called the police 
and five hours later the UFO left and they found strange circular marks in the fields where this 
object had apparently landed so this is a lot of confirmation Mr sear and his family were 
extensively interviewed by various UFO groups meanwhile over the next few weeks they began 
to have more sightings and during one sighting this object was again observed hovering very 
low over their house fact uh Gene Seer was able to get an audio recording of the UFO also many 
other people in the area reported seeing this object so this case has many fascinating aspects 
but important here is the apparent cure because at the time Jean sear was suffering badly from 
multiple sclerosis and in fact had to go to the hospital for treatment every two weeks he was a 
virtually paralyzed from the disease he spent most of his time in a wheelchair however following this 
series of encounters he began to notice strange marks on his body that he couldn't explain 
so it was clear that he was having personal experiences and nor could he explain something 
else his multiple sclerosis disappeared it was suddenly cured and as Wendell Stevens writes all 
symptoms of the disease have gone and he hasn't had a stroke since it's amazing and here's another 
really shocking case I love this case because it's one of the earliest on record it occurred in 
the mid 1930s in this case comes from a journalist and UFO researcher by the name of Sarah Overstreet 
she does not give the gentleman's name because apparently he's quite well known he's a famous 
broadcaster and he says that he contracted tuberculosis when he was 13 years old this 
is apparently in the Missouri area at that time of course there were no such things as vaccinations 
or inoculations or even antibiotics and diseases like tuberculosis could not be controlled 
and as the broadcaster says I got sicker and sicker and the doctors thought I would die 
so he's pretty much on his deathbed when he has this quote dream in which he was taken on board 
a spacecraft and cured of his disease and as he says in his own words in the dream which he puts 
in quotes he says a spaceship took me aboard and placed me on a table within a glass bubble 
the creatures did medical procedures on me and I was made to understand that now I would be 
well and for that the rest of my life I would be healthier and stronger than normal humans 
and when the doctor saw me a few days after the dream they found no trace of the tuberculosis 
so at the time he really didn't know about ETS and UFOs so he was skeptical he didn't 
know quite how to interpret this in fact those the in those days there were really no stories about 
ETS and it wouldn't be until decades later really until the 1950s when such 
stories began to be reported in the media and he realized what had happened to him as he says 
I began to hear other people recount to incidents of being taken on board alien craft 
and their descriptions are much the same as mine right down to the way the creatures looked 
and incidentally he says that in the late 1980s he was in his car when it was hit by a train totally 
destroying it he was of course inside the car at the time and didn't receive a scratch and it 
is his firm belief that the ETS once again saved his life and reportedly the railroad investigators 
also believe that the accident should have been fatal so yeah that's an amazing case for a number 
of different reasons I wonder why they healed him perhaps because he was doing good work as a 
broadcaster hard to say but it's also interesting that he had this follow-up incident with the train 
yeah definitely an interesting case and here is another that is equally interesting 
and this case was investigated by researcher Jorge Martine and it's quite unusual the main witness 
is a flight attendant by the name of Carmina and I do believe that is a pseudonym however either 
way on March 27 1977 Carmina was involved in the world's most deadly aviation accident on record 
this occurred at Tenerife on the Canary Islands and more than 583 people were killed when two 
Jets collided on the runway Carmina was one of few miraculous survivors so that was an unusual 
experience and Carmina was soon to find herself the recipient of an equally astonishing experience 
it was 20 years later in March of 1997 when Carmina who is was not or then a clinical 
psychologist she was working as an insurance broker specializing in medical malpractice cases 
and she was working alone in her office in a tall building in Downtown San Juan in Puerto Rico 
this was a secure building so Carmina was startled when somebody knocked on her door 
and she was surprised to see a strange smartly Dressed Man you he looked a little different 
he was over six feet tall he had a very tanned complexion and brown hair and he looked normal 
enough except for a few weird details as Carmina says he had extra extraordinarily 
long fingers and had no apparent body hair and his eyes were extremely large and lilac colored 
so she was somewhat stunned by his appearance and she became even more shocked when the man began 
to speak about her daughter who was a TV reporter doing a special on UFOs and this man said that he 
had come to deliver a message that Carmina should tell her daughter to continue her investigations 
and that UFO researcher Jorge Martine who carmina's daughter was working with was being 
observed by American Intelligence Officers the man then revealed many true details about carmina's 
life that he should not be able to know so it was clear there was something very profound going on 
Carmina listen to this man as he spoke about other subjects she then asked him about himself and his 
background and he was very evasive but as Carmina says it seemed to me he wasn't human and he 
implied that he himself was an alien collaborating with the U.S government so there's definitely some 
questions there but finally the man finished speaking and he walked from her office and 
she was baffled because he seemed to disappear he didn't take the elevator the stairs were guarded 
by security Personnel everyone had to sign in and out but her nameless visitor had somehow vanished 
now this case was also covered by Timothy good a very prominent researcher and as he writes 
whatever his origin and nature carmina's office visitor seemed to have been a benefit to her 
at the time of her encounter she had a large cyst on her left breast 
later X-rays showed no sign of it so that's bizarre and uh not sure how that happened 
but she attributes it to this visitor very interesting here is yet another shocking case 
just got a few more I'd like to cover and this one occurred in New Jersey Atlantic City New Jersey 
to a gentleman by the name of Richard rilca Richard rilka has had UFO contacts his whole 
life in fact he's had a number of healings I'll just cover one here 
it was in the mid 1980s when Richard developed a tumor on the right side of his forehead and 
he was told by doctors that his tumor was related to a leukemia type condition from his childhood 
fact he'd already had several B9 tumors surgically removed from his body yet the tumors kept 
returning and Richard rilka his E.T contacts were human looking and they advised him not to have any 
more surgery however these tumors kept reappearing so Richard was forced to have another operation 
and it was during his stay at a convention in Atlantic City New Jersey 
Richard wilco's alien friends who are we have their names Quran and nepos they appeared 
and actually removed one particularly bothersome tumor leaving no traces of it 
and that seemed to solve the problem until years later when another tumor appeared on Richard's 
forehead and this one grew quickly it soon became inches wide and was showing no signs of healing 
and Richard's friends and family began to express concern about it that it was affecting his health 
and of course by Richard himself was concerned and by 1989 it was quite prominent and then on July 5 
1989 Richard says he received received a house visit by one of his human looking E.T friends 
they told him that they were aware of this tumor and had been searching for a method to remove it 
took him on board a craft and told him they were going to test a new healing device on him they 
placed a small handheld instrument that emitted a beam of light Richard was placed in an unconscious 
State and he says he felt no physical sensation at all and when he awoke the aliens told him that his 
tumor was gone and he was instantly quote beamed back into his bedroom so as soon as he found 
himself back in the house he dashed to the mirror and saw that the ETS were right his tumor was gone 
so what's interesting about this case is that Richard knew a lot of people and he says that 
nearly a hundred people had seen this tumor so when it disappeared it amazed all of them and 
they all verified the Cure Richard states that many of the people that he knew were very much 
surprised in making comments like my God they're not all bad are they no of course they're not 
um they're healing a lot of people far more than the cases uh that we know about I think 
and here's another really amazing case this one I like because it occurred to a lady by the name of 
Faina maximovna and this is in symphol Crimea in Ukraine so this was in 1979 and feigna was 
suffering from a painful inflammation of her thyroid which was caused by an apparent tumor she 
was seriously ill and her doctors had scheduled her for surgery but she was afraid of undergoing 
surgery and was really worried that she might not survive it and it was one evening shortly before 
her scheduled surgery that she decided to pray to God to save her and after praying she fell asleep 
now this case was reported by Albert Rosales in his excellent multi-volume series humanoids Among 
Us I was in the middle of the night when feyna was woken up by a bright light hovering right 
outside her balcony she looked outside and saw a disc shaped object covered with colored lights 
suddenly an opening in the disc appeared a ladder-like device came down followed 
by three very tall human looking figures dressed in shimmery silver suits and using telepathy the 
being spoke to her they said you will not be operated on we will cure you without surgery 
feyna says that one of them held a large bottle filled with red liquid a thin hose was connected 
to the neck of the bottle and one of the beings placed the other end of the hose on her neck 
she says she felt a little sting and fell asleep and the next morning she woke up and 
it was her mother actually who noticed a mark on her daughter's neck and actually woke her up 
and this is when fena discovered that her swelling and pain were gone 
she went to Kiev to visit her doctors who were very much surprised and confused because 
medical tests showed that her thyroid tumor had apparently dissolved and following this incident 
she continued to enjoy excellent Health all the way into old age and as Alberto Rosales writes 
apparently the mysterious guests not only cured Faina but awarded her with very strong immunity 
in 2004 she was 80 years of age and looked 20 years younger so I like this case for a number 
of reasons she reports that her healing occurred right before surgery that's a pattern we do see 
a lot it's also interesting is she asked for a healing and received it and also enjoyed 
excellent health for many years afterwards this is a pattern we see in a lot of cases 
and now just one final case I'd like to share which I think is really interesting and this 
occurred in at a truck stop in Mississippi it's undisclosed this case does come from Brad Steiger 
and this occurred at 4 00 am on December 15 1989 to a waitress her name is May she was 
about 60 years old and was heading home from her truck stop from the truck stop 
when a bright light hovered over her car and the next thing she knows it's 6 A.M 
she found herself waking up with her car parked alongside the road and she had flashbacks memories of being in a strange quote doctors examining room 
in fact she remembered several figures standing around her while a quote Dr stood 
next to her and as she says passed some kind of Rod over my body again and again 
so this really perplexed her and she was even more shocked by the after effects because at this time 
she was suffering from severe arthritis she had for several years fact her condition had recently 
worsened to the point that she was about to retire despite having no benefits she says the arthritis 
was present in her wrist knee and finger joints but after this encounter she discovered that her 
arthritis was completely gone she felt no pain and it allowed her to continue her employment 
it's an interesting case why would ETS cure a 60 year old waitress apparently 
it was out of altruistic you know reasons certainly that's what the witness feels like 
there you go those are the 10 cases I wanted to cover for you today they do all appear in my book 
the healing power of UFOs 300 true accounts of people healed by extraterrestrials 
and I think you'll agree that they do show how truly Advanced 
ETS are with their ability to heal what we consider to be chronic conditions 
diseases and conditions that we simply cannot heal and we can treat them but we cannot cure them 
and it also shows that they are people very much like us they're not always perfect 
and it shows how people can react to healings in many different ways 
so yeah these cases do have a lot to say about the UFO phenomenon and that's again why I 
really wanted to report on these cases hope you've enjoyed this episode today I really appreciate you 
watching and there's always more to learn about UFOs so thanks once again and until next time 
keep looking for answers keep searching for the truth and most important keep having fun bye now
