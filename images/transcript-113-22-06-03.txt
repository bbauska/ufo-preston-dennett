INTERVIEW WITH A FULLY CONSCIOUS UFO CONTACT PART I: THE AWAKENING
Jun 3, 2022

Summary:
Jun 3, 2022
Late one evening in January of 1973, fourteen-year-old Dolly Safran (who lived near the Everglades in Florida) looked outside her window to observe more than fifty star-like objects swarming overhead. As they began to dart off in different directions, one of these objects dropped down and hovered at treetop level behind her house.

The object now revealed itself to be a solid metallic craft, with portholes. And through the portholes, Dolly was shocked to see two short, gray-skinned figures with large dark eyes and huge black heads. Aliens, she realized, and they were looking right at her! She turned to dive under her bed. At that moment, her room exploded in brilliant blue light.

The next thing Dolly knew, hours had passed and morning had arrived. Dolly found herself on the floor of her room, dressed in someone else's pajamas, which were on inside out and backwards. She had been taken, she realized. It had happened again.

Throughout her young life, this sort of thing had happened several times. But this time, she resolved to remember. And when the radio came on and said that there had been other witnesses, Dolly got the confirmation she needed. She wasn't crazy. She really was seeing UFOs. 

She sat down in the bathroom and began to concentrate, meditate, focus. And all at once, the wall of amnesia started to crumble and memories of being taken onboard the craft flooded into her mind. 

Dolly had to go to school that day, and she received further confirmation when her best friend also reported seeing a UFO on the same night. By the end of the day, Dolly remembered everything that had happened to her that night. And not only did she remember that night, she was able to recall the many other times she had been taken, going all the way back to her first contact event when she was only ten months old and she floated right out of her crib.

Suddenly, all those weird events of missing time made sense. Dolly recalled many other instances of contact. She recalled the time at age two where he was missing for two hours and was found six miles away from her home. She had been taken.

She remembered an incident at age six when a craft came down and took her from the front yard of her home. She recalled many other instances too.

But her experience at age fourteen changed everything. She recalled being taken onboard the craft and meeting short little grays, and a much taller gray she called "Momma." She was given a tour of the craft. The craft itself was a living being, and Dolly recalled meeting him many times. She called him "Tlera." 

During this onboard experience, Dolly was taken to the control room, which the ETs called "the place of movement." She was instructed to sit in the pilot seat and to her amazement and delight, the craft left Earth and they traveled to Saturn. After exploring Saturn's rings and many moons, they traveled to Earth's moon, actually landing upon its surface.

Dolly had a long conversation with the ETs, and they offered her the opportunity to learn from them and work alongside them. She was given the freedom to choose any subject she wanted to explore. "Can I learn how to fly the craft?" Dolly asked. 

The ETs agreed. And so began Dolly's lifelong experiences as a fully conscious UFO contactee. She soon began having fantastic adventures including visiting large motherships filled with plants and animals, traveling to other planets and star-systems and meeting with a wide variety of ETs. It was a fantastic adventure that is still going on to this day.

This video presents Dolly's story up to age fourteen, including many of her childhood experiences, and her incredible awakening at age fourteen where she was taken onboard the craft and then traveled across the solar system, starting a lifetime of fully conscious contact.

Dolly's story of extraterrestrial contact is one of the most extensive and profound cases on record. If you would like to explore more about her many UFO encounters, you can read about them in my new book, "Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
I've got a very special show for you today today I'm going to be talking about my new book symmetry which is all about a fully conscious 
contact tee by the name of dolly saffron who you see right here say hi dolly hello 
so uh dolly uh some of you may have read the book already it's an amazing story about her lifelong 
experiences with gray's and other et's and all the things she's learned and experienced 
and today is just going to be a kind of introduction to her experiences 
and I'd like to cover basically her experiences from when she well 10 months about all the way up 
to age 14 in particular experience at age 14 when she fully woke up to what was happening to her 
so that's going to be what we're going to talk about today I think it's really an amazing and 
important case and I'm so happy that dolly has agreed to come on to the show today 
so let's just start by introducing dolly and having her to tell a little bit about herself 
and where she was born so far so that's okay dolly yes take it away tell us just 
a little bit of background um I was born in georgia uh just outside of fort benning 
um I was here for two weeks and then my parents put me in the back seat of the car in a pram uh 
that comes off the wheels you know like an english pram and we didn't have seat belts they just put me back there and we drove to miami uh we ended up on they had a rented apartment on biscayne 
boulevard and that was my first home after I was two weeks old um my life is uh was very uh 
adventurous and I moved to a lot of different places I've lived on a dairy farm I've lived 
in coconut grove next to a warlock I've uh lived in a place called westwood lakes 
and we lived on a lake which was driving my parents crazy uh we ended up going to 
um wisconsin for a short time and then coming back to florida that's how we did the dairy farm 
on my grandparents then we moved all the way out to the everglades and we had a ranch and uh 
had cows and a couple of them and uh brahma uh mostly just spent my life uh doing chores and 
playing with animals we had dogs and uh uh when we started getting the big dogs I had cats when 
i was really really small but then once we got the big dogs the cats didn't stay with us they stayed 
outside barns no more house um uh my parents were busy doing uh things like my dad was working all 
the time and uh my mom was uh into the saint bernard club of south florida they she and my 
dad started it so I used to go to dog shows and I was a junior handler and then a senior handler I 
did girl scouts and all that kind of stuff I just grew up very cool yeah all right so now you had 
your mom your dad your little brother living in the florida everglades and uh like many contactees 
you have an amazing memory uh so that is something I've heard before and uh yeah I'd just like to 
start with your first real conscious recall I think was that 10 months yeah you're in your crib 
yes we were still living in the apartment on uh biscayne boulevard and I had uh I saw a big 
light come through the window I'm supposed to be sleeping and I'm staring at it thinking what is that and uh all of a sudden I start levitating in my crib and when I got up to about the top 
bar I thought oh my god where am I going now and I flipped over I wasn't I wouldn't have anything to 
do with it I tried to go back down I'm grabbing the bars and that's the last thing I remember 
i blanked out my memory of that moment ends right there yeah that's when you started sticking your 
leg out of the crib bars yes that was not going to happen to me again I decided that's right 
10 months old and I knew that if I stuck my leg to that that's what I thought uh I would not levitate that's so cute and your parents actually took a picture of it yes they did yes they did it 
was just comical sometimes they'd see me with both legs hanging all the way out you know just my body 
be sideways in the crib and I'd be hanging all the way up my legs you know okay at age two you had an 
experience where you disappeared from the house yeah uh leading yeah leading up to that I knew 
i had my first tinkling that something was going on when I found out my mom was pregnant and that's about when it happened the first time she was just just pregnant and uh I disappeared um 
i I have a sketchy memory of how I got out I i was in my bedroom and I was coloring okay uh supposed 
to be taking a nap but I was coloring and the next thing I know I'm going levitating and I'm 
going through my roof no preamble no nothing I'm going through the roof and something's got me by 
the hands okay um I end up in a craft and they're they're like messing with my memory at that point 
okay they're trying to calm me down because I was a hellion and if I didn't like you you knew it instantly okay and they calmed me down because I had had tonsils out just before my second birthday 
and uh you know yeah somewhere around there I was I was young and uh when I was in the hospital 
my dad said if I was a good girl he'd give me a big red balloon and he did it was ginormous it was almost bigger than me and they tied it to the foot of my bed 
and I had that balloon for a whole week okay um I love red balloons so while I was on board 
they all promised me promised me a red balloon that I would get one if I cooperated 
well okay fine yeah I'll cooperate and uh it's all blurry to me you know things happen very rapidly 
and then they took me back I thought I was going home and uh nope I came out behind this store 
it was grass all around and stuff like that back in those days there's hardly any buildings florida was very sparse you know and this little utotem store was like all by itself on a part of the road 
and uh when they let me out they said bye bye go get your balloon it's in there 
and I I'm walking around the store in the grass and I walk up on the let you know the 
concrete part and I'm looking in the door okay in the glass like this 
and the guy saw me and he's like looking around now I'm wearing underwear no shoes no nothing he's like where the hell you know what's going on and when he realized that I was wanting in 
and I was starting to get upset I cried he opened the door and he's like who are you 
and I said my name is dolly he said why are you where is your mama and I said I don't know and 
he said how did you get here and I'm like I want a red balloon I mean I immediately went to the red 
balloon where's my red balloon you're supposed to know I'm supposed to get this red balloon 
he put me he put me on the counter top and he gave me a little cup full of uh blue uh liquidy you know like an icy it was it icy I don't think it was blue I want to think it's 
blue I don't think it's blue it I think it was sprite okay it was a blue cup and it looked blue 
and uh I took a sip and I didn't like it because it was too bubbly and uh I'm really freaking out 
and he decided to call the cops and that's when the cops got notified where I was because they 
were already looking for me my mother was already hysterical and called you know the police herself 
and for two hours they were looking at for me so I guess in my mind I was gone about that amount of time okay with them because in my mind I was there they promised me the red balloon they 
talked to me or did stuff and then they dropped me down uh but it didn't feel like you know 
uh so yeah you were missing for like two hours or something and you're probably yeah a little over crazy yeah so I guess yeah that happened yeah um more times after that and your parents put 
locks on the doors and the windows bought a guard dog yeah hiding still still didn't help you kept 
disappearing yeah um but at this point you weren't thinking ufos or ets I had no clue yeah there was 
i was dreaming all this stuff somehow okay that's what I thought um I would uh my mom I love my mom 
okay but back in those days we could run around and do anything I mean you could disappear you know in the front yard or you could go down the street if I had a friend and stuff like that 
and uh how it happened is there was a vacant lot next to our house where we lived in westwood lakes 
and had lots of trees on it and stuff and I made it like a little um nest and they would grab me 
there when I was outside uh so I was going with them that way I just thought I was dreaming I 
mean one minute I would be there and then I'd be somewhere else and then I'd be back and I just never thought about it that's westwood lakes then in the everglades uh they would come at night 
you know uh sometimes I see grace coming in and I think okay you know okay and uh but I didn't they 
were covering my memories in other words they were shocking me short I was trying so hard to remember but I couldn't it just and then when I started talking to my mom about it she really 
thought I was dreaming you know I mean I'm the kid that talked about king kong coming to get me and flying and doing all this kind of stuff and she just said you're dreaming you're dreaming okay
so you also had you know while all this is going on you're also having you know precognition talking about things that are going to happen yes you had an instance with telekinesis 
yes can you describe that briefly okay I was a teenager I was about 12. and my dad used to 
take me to the university of miami all the time he was uh doing some restoration work yeah actually 
I'm talking about the time with the where you were at home and the hat boxes I think it was 
oh that one okay um I was young I was about I don't know four uh yeah I was four 
um my aunt barbara my uncle don and my cousins came over and uh my my aunt was mad at my cousin 
sharon who was older than me she was mentally [ __ ] okay and I got mad at her sharon ran in 
my room to hide with me and she came in screaming at her and uh it upset me I got really pissed off 
and uh my door to my closet in my bedroom flung open and all my mother's hat boxes which were 
in the top of it flew straight at her head and screaming and seeing it pandemonium you know they 
they ran they left okay it was all my it could take uh well that's you know that's that's what 
i wanted to mention because this is something that does turn up with a lot of contactees it's a wide variety of paranormal events so here you are you're you know seeing spirits you're having 
precognition telekinetic events you have an event involving levitation as well describe that real 
real quick I think you were like what two three years old yeah right after my uh brother was born 
and I was lonely and bored because she was taking care of him I was jealous of him at first and all 
i wanted to do was play hide and seek because my mom would always play hide and seek with me okay and I kept looking at the top of the closet and I decided that was the best spot in the house 
she would never find me there only I couldn't get up there no chair was tall enough no nothing and 
i would sit in the hallway and just stare at that door and think I want up there I went up there I went up there I'm gonna get up there I i was already playing around with the idea 
that I could fly and uh dang if I didn't do it I mean it felt like something suddenly 
i was being lifted up you know it's a strange feeling my body was following me I don't know 
how to describe that at that age okay but that's what it felt like my body was falling my head and 
i got up there and I threw the door open and I went in I shut the door and I started laughing my 
butt off because I thought it was funny and I hear dolly dolly where are you dolly and she went by 
that closet at least 50 times she looked under everything I know she did then she got mad come 
out right now oh my god I laughed harder okay I thought it was hysterical and one of those laughs 
she heard me and she looked up and she said you better not be up there and I'm thinking well I am 
and she's got a chair because she was too short even and she flung that door up and there I was 
i don't know if she was screaming at me or what or just screaming cuz because she went you know and she pulled me out and she's hanging onto the wall and slinking down 
to the floor off the chair she sat me down she sat on the floor with me and stared at me really 
wow see this is really really interesting because this is something other contact pieces have told 
me about even from a very young age levitating and of course I know you've had further instances of 
both telekinesis and uh levitation but uh really what I want to get into next because there's a lot 
and we could talk about just the paranormal stuff for hours but you had a a really profound 
experience where you uh age six I think it was right after you had gone to see the movie mary 
poppins with your family yeah you're out in the front yard watching the clouds playing under the 
ficus tree I was streaming and thinking about the movie actually and uh I was singing the songs I 
have an ended memory so I learned songs instantly and uh I was singing uh the song you know 
stay awake don't close your eyes that one and uh I love the music in that movie I did too
and all of a sudden I looked up and I'm looking at a particular cloud that looked like a bunny rabbit okay and the next thing I know I see this umbrella come over me it sort of like came from my right 
and moved over to the left over me and it was rotating and I'm trying to see the handle because 
if it's mary poppins umbrella it's got a parrot on the end of it okay you know remember the parrot 
and uh I'm looking for it I'm thinking where's the parrot who is this you know what's going on and it came down and I hear the music from the movie coming down with it 
and uh I'm like what the heck and then I black out and the next thing I know I wake up and um in this
place it was all different I mean it's not like you see when you're at home you know you got furniture 
and you got stucco or drywall or bricks or whatever I mean it was not it was not
from here okay and uh I'm looking at this woman that I'm sitting in her lap 
and I'm thinking god she's interesting as hell I started staring at her really hard 
she had no hair nowhere okay she didn't even have eyebrows okay uh she had the biggest eyes I've ever seen ever and they were blue-green and uh she's staring at 
me and I'm hearing I don't see her mouth move but I can hear her and she's saying hi dolly hi dolly 
you can call me mama I'm gonna take care of you while you're with me and she said can I can I can 
i have a hug and I'm like you know I'm thinking about that you know do I don't I and she went to 
grab me a little bit and I thought oh well what the hell I love hugs so I gave her a hug um I got to put my hand up and touch her face okay and I realized that her skin is not like mine 
it is uh different when you're hairless and you have no hair on your skin your hand doesn't go 
over your skin quite like it does because you have hairs on your body everywhere okay and it makes 
the transition over your skin smooth okay you kind of glide over your own hair she didn't have any 
and it it felt like leather okay not not thick heavy dried leather leather like you felt off a 
cow that was tanned but soft fluffy luffy liver leather and uh I was amazed and I kept trying to 
touch her face and she was holding my hands and I'm trying to touch her arms I'm like I became so 
into the fact that she was that different okay and I'm staring at her and that and she said
i want you to understand something and I'm on the stern at her and she's she says you're related to 
me we're related do you understand what that means and I'm trying to understand what she means and 
she put it in my head I'm related she's family to me she made it me quite understand that I'm family 
okay and she said I want to teach you something she said this is how we greet in our family 
and she we touched four heads and she inhaled when she did it and I was mimicking her so I inhaled 
too I inhaled and I realized oh my god I can smell her okay it was very very pleasant it made me feel 
good to smell her somehow and I realized after that for many years that I could smell her in a 
room over everybody else I knew her smell and I didn't realize how potent that was until I had 
my own child and realized that I could tell my child from everybody else by her smell as well 
i could smell the familial it's familial you know how a lion can smell its own cubs 
the father he knows these are my babies I can smell her genetics and it it struck me profoundly 
when I realized that years later that oh my god I was family I am family she is my family 
I'm related to her for real yeah that's definitely a thing I saw a show on nature where there was 
thousands of wildebeests and the mother had lost her baby and finally found her by smelling thousands upon thousands of them yeah amazing yeah it's amazing they had I guess it just freaked 
me out that's a talent I have I have an acute cute sense of smell okay I can smell anything 
uh she uh she was different from everybody on board because uh she she they were all wearing 
like suit you know skin suits and um she had on a gingham dress like little house on the prairie 
it was very pretty it was very colorful and I was touching it and fingering it was pure pure 
wool okay it wasn't anything artificial no cotton no nothing it was wool and uh 
i know the difference between animal hair and cotton and it was wool and uh she played with me 
we talked and uh she let me she let me look at her hands she's only got four fingers four toes she 
let me see her feet and we just sort of introduced each to ourselves to each other that way she saw 
my hands and uh she looked at my hair and she felt my hair and she told me I was pretty and 
you know it was just a bonding thing going on okay and then she said we have to part now you know 
you have to go back and she touched my forehead again smelled me and uh I don't remember anything 
after that until I woke up in my living room with my mother just walking around the corner 
this gets weird for me I think my mother saw the flash of light I think my mother knew something was going on in the living room and that's why she showed up like she did 
because she was very harried when when I saw her okay and she said how did you get in here and 
I'm looking at her now I know better you got a mother who's strict stern you know when she's 
upset and I just went I don't know what are you talking about you know what what what and 
I'm six years old don't ask me to explain and uh she used to go through the house and check on me 
after that my mother became overly overly overly overly uh worried about where I was and what I was 
doing uh she didn't let me I mean she protective oh my god okay that's totally understandable okay 
but so uh from that point on you've we're taking more you know during uh well outside daylight yeah 
and at night yep and uh time went on and I know you became more and more uh determined to figure 
out what's going on yeah trying to figure out whether you're going crazy trying to get dots 
here what's going on and we move up to age 14 and you're just really ready determined 
to figure out what this aspect of your life means right and so it's 1973 you're 14 years old 
and you're out in the backyard with the telescope watching stars and right I'm doing homework yeah 
and this is when I mean this is the big big event that I really wanted to this is really why I wanted to do this episode today because this is the big event that really woke you up to things 
so tell us what happened when you're looking through the you know you're tell well let me 
just start here well your dad comes out and says go to bed he didn't come out he was in the house 
all the jealousies were open we didn't have air conditioning then okay so the windows were 
all open and I could hear him where I was with the telescope was right behind their room okay 
and I heard him out the window go to bed like okay it's cool night so I packed my scope down 
and I went in my room and I changed my clothes got ready for bed got my drink of water you know the whole thing and uh I'm not going to sleep okay I'm a night I I'm up all the damn time 
so I just decided to keep looking at the stars it was so pretty that night no clouds no nothing 
beautiful beautiful you could see everything we had very low light pollution almost no light pollution I could see the milky way okay um orion was up and uh 
i love orion I've always loved orion I don't know why I just have uh and I'm sitting there and I'm looking up and I'm like wait a minute orion's got 
a lot of stars okay but there's wide spaces in between the different major star bodies of orion 
and I'm looking I'm like wait there's just way too many stars up here and I'm I'm looking at them I'm thinking what am I looking at you know and then they're moving and they all kind of
came into a clump and then they paired off in twos and then they went east west north and south okay 
they just dispersed two of the pair came down over where I lived one of them as it approached 
went east toward deadline mall kendall and then the other one came down over our property and over 
the back of our house it was changing colors that came down when it was up out of the app you know 
in space it was white okay but um and plasma look you know it was big fluffy looking as it came down 
through the atmosphere it started changing colors the first color it turned literally was a red 
reddish orange and then it got more yellow orange and then got more yellow and then it turned green 
and then it turned blue and then I saw the metallic of it uh I saw that it was metallic and 
ah we had trees behind my room and the prayer trees you know where the leaves if the wind 
touches them they fall down or if you blow on them or if you touch them they close up and uh 
they were the tree was just whipping in the wind and I'm like there's no wind what am I looking at 
and then I look at this craft and I'm thinking and I'm trying to remember it now okay because 
i know this is my only chance this is this is not insane to me I know that I'm seeing this 
i can almost smell the daggone thing and I know it's there I can see it it's swaying and 
it's dipping you know every so often so I start memorizing this craft and I went from the bottom 
to the top and when I got to the top there's ports okay they go like this not round but you 
know like that and then I realized I'm looking at the bottom of it and it's not perfectly round 
it's kind of not perfectly spade shaped but something like that akin to it okay and 
one of the times that it really dipped down I saw two creatures in the windows one in each window 
and they were staring at me and I had about three seconds of realization because I'm staring at 
them hard I mean hard because I was trying to memorize everything and I realized you know I 
don't know about this because they were different I mean they were really really really different they had huge heads huge and um I went no I'm not dealing with this and I turned and I was going to 
dive under my bed because my bed was right there okay and I made the pivot and I looked down and 
my whole room exploded in blue white light so bright I closed my eyes and I could see the 
light through my eyes like I was in a room with my eyes open um and that's I went totally black out 
blacked out okay I woke up a few hours later I was on my floor I was not wearing my clothes they were 
not properly you know they just were inside out back was the whole thing I was like oh my god 
i got mad I got mad I started crying because so this was someone else's pajamas yes yeah not mine 
I'm not even sure they were for a girl to be honest with you they were just pjs okay um so
i can hear my mother in the kitchen and I'm really upset and I know what you know I've I've got to go get ready for school so I went to the shower took a shower 
i stupidly threw them away in a garbage can in my room tied the bag up and uh 
by the time I was making it to the kitchen and throwing them away as I walked in the door because the camera was right there I realized that oh wait a minute these aren't my clothes 
you know and I started attaching to the fact that oh my god I had a real experience this is not a dream I have tangibility in my hand okay and I i ignored it because my mom I 
didn't want to go and grab him out because my mom was in the kitchen and he wanted to see me do it 
and she said make coffee so I made coffee you know it's my job to make coffee when I was around 
and I sat down and I was like okay I i gotta talk about this this is tangible I cannot 
you know who who else am I going to tell this to and uh so I said mom did you see anything 
last night did you see lights do you hear anything you know I was thinking about maybe they thought 
the trees were whipping around maybe they thought wind whatever and uh she says what are you talking 
about and uh I said you know like a ufo and after years of this with my mother there was no way you 
know she turned around pointed at me and she said no no and turned back around well I got really 
uh despondent angry freaked out and I immediately began thinking how the hell am I going to convince 
her that we need to have this conversation and it's real I was going to pull the clothes out of the can okay and show them to her uh we never got to that because the radio switched to 
the news from paul harvey and the first thing out of the guy's mouth was two dadeland police 
officers saw a ufo last night at 1 30 in the morning abouts and they described it perfectly 
this officer's uh statements where he read their statements okay and it was basically 
they saw them coming down they saw him pairing off two of them came down over them and one of the officers got razzed in his car twice they were very very freaked out okay I lost my stuff 
okay um I went berserko it's the only word for it I started crying I started screaming I 
i was like sweating I'd be my heart was pounding in my chest my there's a lump in my throat 
and I'm like mom mom this is real this is real you heard him on the radio you know and she whirled on me and she said that was a dream get out of the kitchen now 
uh I never argued with her when she got like that there was no point so I got up shaking angry freaking out going damn my dad was just walking in and he said he heard 
the whole thing he told me you know go calm down go meditate do something you're over the top you 
know you can't be like this you're never convinced like this never okay and so I thought okay 
so I went in the bathroom I turned the light out locked the door for privacy and sunk to the floor and I spent a good while in there uh just trying to go back over the whole thing it was real 
it was real okay and I replayed it from the minute I saw those stars and to the minute 
that light hit and when I got to where the light hit I was visualizing it in my mind I could see 
it and then suddenly I saw the beam it's an energy ribbon that comes down it's huge and uh it twists 
you know and I saw two being the two beings in the cockpit of that craft came down that ribbon 
and I was frozen I couldn't move I mean I kept trying to I was gonna like fling myself to the floor you know anything swing on them you know just anything and uh could not all right um so 
before we get into all of that let me just skip through a little bit here okay because um you 
went to school your best friend had seen a ufo that was further confirmation yes your teacher 
hooked you up to a biofeedback machine yes put you into uh I guess alpha waves or delta and he 
taught me how to do that yeah so that helped your memories along ended up going home from school 
that day leaving yeah pretty much recalled the whole thing right and uh so basically what I'd 
really like to hear because this is really what I want to get into is this whole uh experience at 
age 14 where you we call these grades coming into your room yeah you grab you you go up the beam and 
right what's what's that like what happened once you know they came into your room uh he 
came up to me and he took me by the hand he's so much shorter than me okay and he put his arm 
around me kind of sort of you put his arm up it touched his hand got to my waist he's way below 
me anyway I'm almost five foot seven at that age okay um damn near five foot eight and uh 
uh suddenly I'm moving with him somehow okay I think he levitated me somewhat I think that he 
he levitated me somehow because I don't remember walking across the floor I went with him though 
and he placed my hand with his hand above my hand onto the beam and poof everything changed uh 
i became weightless I saw light like we were left enveloped enveloped in light 
and we started going up and he was like pulling us along he was somehow it wasn't the you had to 
manipulate the beam somewhat to go higher and higher and higher okay but you had to stay in 
contact with it I guess because suddenly I'm going through the roof of my room 
uh when we got to the ceiling I cringed because I thought oh my god I'm going to hit my head 
never happened went right through it um I saw dust particles in the light I smelled something funny I i saw the rock our roof was a 
rock roof okay in florida there like that the little petally rocks on your roof and I saw 
the root the rocks on the roof going up through it and then I saw the tree and I'm thinking oh 
we went through the tree like it was nothing okay big pieces of bark went right through it uh 
went up and I I'm like looking around me and I realize that I'm up in mid-air and I look up 
and I saw the bottom of the craft but we went up the ribbon went up around the side of it and they 
had a door open and it's not a square door like this it's octane it's octagonish looking okay 
and uh the door was not there I mean you know you see you usually see a door go open close inward 
or outward right nothing there just the opening and when we got to it he shoved me in feet first 
okay and I landed on my keister on the floor and he came in and the other one came in right behind 
him and the door suddenly magically in my mind was back it was there okay it closed up you mean 
yeah and uh it did something weird all I know is that it was there okay I'm already in shock 
bad shock um I turn because I feel somebody over here and I look at this woman and my memory I 
instantly knew who she was I it's like every time I i realized that every time I went with 
them I would wake up and know who they are my memory would reconnect okay and it would be 
five minutes of holy crap you know and uh oh my god only this time was worse this was the 
worst time of it all because my memory went from that moment of seeing her and knowing who she was 
all the way back to the beginning of my life all the way back to the day I rode in the bloody car 
with my parents going to florida in my pram okay in the back seat I remembered everything it hit me 
so hard I had a migraine the day before or you know I get migraines every now and then when I was young uh they don't know why I outgrew them okay um but then I had a migraine a worse migraine 
and I'm staring at her and I'm thinking oh my god I'm so glad to see you she was glad to see me and 
i puked all over myself I had just enough time to grab my jamie shirt and puke right into it and I'm 
staring at her with puke everywhere and I'm sh I start shaking like I'm coming out of shock okay 
and they're like hold on don't move don't move and the two grays came back with paper 
stuff you know some towels whatever and uh wrapped it around my hands and my waist 
and like pushed it all up against me with the paper and took me to a decontamination room 
and uh made me strip they they put me in a uh you know a bath thing you know to rinse me off 
they gave me something to what hair I had I had really short air back then 
and then they put me in a a smaller room that had a shower like on it and it 
was spraying this light all over the place and I guess that was my first memory of 
actually being in the contamination being you know I knew what it was but it decontaminated 
me all the germs were gone once it got done with me uh they gave me a smock to wear you know like 
a little dress and it went down to my knees and I was feeling it and I realized that it it was um
substantial but not it was it it felt it felt like you could throw it away recycle it burn it real easy okay um
i realized that I was uh hot I expected to be cold but I was hot okay I felt hot almost to the 
point of sweating uh they came and got me and I went back to the room with mama and sat down 
and I'm still shaking I mean I'm still just involuntarily uh okay and she's like it's okay calm down it's okay you're you're awake and uh I was sending 
it to this voice and I knew who it was it was talata okay he says hey kiddo how are you doing how are you do you feel better now and completely no when you say talada who do you mean 
a ship he said he's an entity that embodies the craft and he actually becomes he's it's like his 
body once he indwells it and uh he runs every system on that craft he literally becomes it 
it's somewhat biological it's created that way and he can move it do all kinds of stuff I mean every
process that his consciousness is capable of doing ran that ship okay 
um so you remember you know hearing meeting him and hearing him and being with you yes 
I've known him since I was the same amount of time mama yeah all right absolutely and um 
he said uh are you okay and I'm like I'm nauseous I'm queasy I'm like freaking out because I 
realized I'm never gonna forget him and I started bawling my guts out at that point it I i mean I 
went through every emotion you could possibly have I mean every single one uh and they decided 
at that moment that I just needed to walk around you know just do something with myself other than 
sit there and be affected by it I need to move touch things look at things just get over myself 
so the grace said let's go for a walk and I walked the entire craft I saw everything every room I saw 
my quarters I saw my bed I saw my brush that I thought I lost okay I saw everything um 
i they got me some drink can you describe that a little I mean you went to your quarters which was 
yeah just describe your quarters and you know each room they took you in it's a it's a room 
and it has a bed uh like a little twin bed that fit me okay and there was an alcove on the wall 
the wall that part where the bed was the room was roundish okay it was like oblong around okay in 
other words the the bottom of the wall bent in slightly and then it went up like that okay um I 
don't know if my room was on the outside walls of the craft I kind of think it was and then that's 
what I was thinking and because I'm trying to draw a map in my head of everywhere I've been I'm like remembering everything now so I'm memorizing it's my habit to do that um my bed had a 
it was a solid mattress that's it with a base under it wasn't wood and it somehow let it was 
up in the air like it was attached somehow maybe it was levitating I don't know it was probably attached though because it didn't sway or move around okay and um it had a cover on it 
and had some pillows and it had another cover all folded up at the foot um
it had it had my brush I had a little side table um my mom used to buy fuller brushes I don't know 
if you know anything about those the little full brush man would come and my brush was teak wood was really thick and it was roundish you know like this and a little short handle and I love 
that brush I love the bristles in it and I i was devastated when I thought I lost it and there it was right there sitting on that nightstand I was like oh my god and uh I brushed my hair 
all right so so you went and saw other rooms as well yes I everything I saw where we eat I saw 
where I go to the bathroom in my room and I had my own little party place and I had my own little sink and uh I saw their quarters they let me look I went down to the in you know where 
it they have a nuclear engine in that thing and they have batteries in there that are huge um 
do you know what a disk pack looks like for a computer so yeah okay it's tall and round 
and it you know it has many layers to it those batteries were kind of sort of like that but not 
quite and they had they look like batteries okay and there was a top on it and it had a a green
tip on it and it had wires coming out of it and it was somehow connected to a central spire 
in the middle of the craft every craft has a central spire going through it a central uh I've heard that
it was cool as hell us uh we went back uh on the second level it's like where everybody goes to eat 
and they do things you know there's quarters there that's where my quarter was on the second level and the third level is where you fly okay it's the what you call the helm they call it the the 
place of movement that's how they think okay and they brought me back and they sat me down and I was doing better you know I kept what I drank down and everything I was like okay I'm better 
until I said let's go for a ride and I mean he said it just like that let's go for a ride you know and I was like okay because I knew what that meant we were gonna go somewhere I just 
had never been lit sit in the seat he told me sit in the seat and I'm like looking around going wait 
what and he said sit in the seat you know and he said I'm gonna let you fly I was shocked because 
i do know that everything's telepathic there that there's no joystick there's no you know when you 
fly on a small plane you know you got the rudder you know the two foot rudders and you got the 
the steering thing you know which isn't round it's like and I'm or even a joystick okay and I'm 
I'm thinking well and and I was like well okay you know whatever you say and he 
gave me a brief he handed me a controller that heard me think it connected to my mind 
and it translated my mind to his mind that was my first true psychic connection to another being 
and I had to get used to him for a few minutes before we left because um I was crawling around 
in his mind and he was in mine okay I could feel him breathe okay uh it took me a moment and uh 
he said okay we're gonna go now he said you're driving so this is the coordinates you know he 
gave me coordinates I was used to coordinates from flying airplanes okay and uh so I 
i associated it that way and I just pretended that I was in a in the plane of earth and ascension 
declination all that stuff I was like okay I can do this I can fly like that okay and uh 
so I went we went out and then he would he said okay you're going to do 30 degrees to the left 
you're going to course correct you're going to go uh 30 degrees higher 30 degrees I mean he was just course correcting me all the way through and I realized he told me we're going to saturn 
and uh half believing him until we saw it okay I mean he wouldn't lie to me I knew that but I 
always went into dead wide open shark because this is a planet that has more going on than you could 
possibly ever imagine it's got many many moons it's got rings and when you look at them you know 
when you look at pictures of saturn you think those rings are solid they are not okay some of 
them are ice some of them rocks some of them are dust some of them are I mean it's just all the way 
through the gamut of what those rings are made out of and there are distances between them and then some of the distances are very wide it says we're going to fly through one of them and he showed me 
which one it was he gave me directions to get through it we went very slowly we approached 
um I was getting an idea at that moment that we were skipping that was the first term I learned uh
that how they fly okay flying term and what it means to skiff is you're either flying in uh 
in a flat plane you know flat down if you skiff and you're coming up to a magnetic 
resistance okay you you have to skip up so that you ride it and you either go up or down on it or 
cross okay depending on the polarity and uh he was he was talking to me this is the positive 
you're gonna skip up this is a negative you're gonna skip down and we went down this way and then we went straight up right through that thing we we leveled off and then 
we went straight up through that ring in a second and we got above it you know I was like
I'm gonna do this again and he's like okay okay and then we went we went straight down 
i did that three or four times because I couldn't get enough okay that's what so you saw all these 
did you see the different rings because I I'm some are like fine dust some are eyes some are big holders right some are like yes huge oh my god and they're moving and they work you know 
anything in space you're in a vacuum it's weightless okay they don't just stationarily fly through they rotate and they undulate and the rings are going like this but you 
you can see the fluctuations in them okay you can see the ripples the current of it okay um 
are these rings like miles wide then yeah next to them yes they're miles freaking wide yeah they're 
huge the rings make the planet like three times bigger than it really you know what I'm saying it takes up that much space they'll weigh the hell out so some are probably hundreds of miles wide 
yes okay so we noticed where the moons were you showed me the moons 
and I was shocked to see one of the moons uh it looks like a beat up rock 
it's almost flat on one side okay like a square it looks like a square a dumpy square but a square 
and it's not going in the same direction as everybody else it's orbiting backwards the other 
way and we chased it for a while okay and and I'm like why is that and he explained to me that uh 
when monster pelted that is a remnant of one of the planets that was destroyed 
and became a moon of saturn and I was like oh that's just way too cold you know 
so did they explain what what where saturn's rings came from um they actually uh 
saturn is is a giant planet okay I got in it it already had taken on a ton of space dust 
and the way it revolves after that accident it started taking on its gravitational forces started 
taking on all that stuff and it just started revolving around it um there's some sort of uh 
pole thing with saturn as well where it repels it as well as attracts it and so the rings developed 
okay well interesting so a lot of those materials yeah they don't free fall all the way down to the surface of the planet it just accumulated because of the polarity on that planet going back 
and forth so a lot of that material is basically from prior planetary collisions and such yes okay 
all right very interesting so you traveled through the rings and visited some of the moons and yeah 
what happened after that we backed out uh from its orbit you know being around the rings uh you can't 
really you know it's funny when you're like we can orbit earth okay no problem uh saturn is a giant 
uh you gotta really be careful because you can either ascend it and go across this way you know 
or you can go around it but you have to go in the opposite direction that the rings are going or that presents a problem because they'll draw you in uh and you're in a field and it can slew 
through anything but this is such a big magnetic uh mishmash of magnetism that they don't chance at 
so we we backed out we stand in this you know I say standing it just means we're stationary 
uh looking at it and he's deciding uh what's coming next and he said let's go to the moon and uh he knew instantly he's gonna get a thrill out of me because yeah 
the moon I love the moon I've been studying the moon since I started astronomy you know okay wait 
now before you go there because this is amazing and I was so delighted to hear you talking about 
going to saturn because that's what jay gardner another contactee from west virginia told me 
this is what ray fowler described in one of his books I've heard other contactees say this and 
about to hear you say it in such detail you being you know fully conscious at this point 
is so amazing and many you know even more common is being taken to the moon 
which sounds you know phantasmagorical one of your favorite words uh but yeah okay just go on from 
there I thought everyone you know who's watching to know that this is this means a lot amazing 
is absolutely something I have heard before this is something other people have experienced yeah uh well I have a personal relationship with this moon okay my dad was already working for an 
accident and uh he was in the shuttle program and uh you know they get the booster rockets 
that fall away and come back to earth they reuse them he helped design what he did he was one of 
five architects who designed all the shoot packing plants for that and the types of shoots that they 
used and the gear that they were packed into in the cone for deployment these are not uh cloth 
uh shoots they're metal they're aluminum woven aluminum and uh I've spent many many many many 
days with my dad going back and forth while he's working on this project I love the moon I've been on the base a billion times I've been up in town where his office was a billion times I've seen 
oh my god you know we had a satellite dish when the moon landing was one of the first ones ever 
made and we were uh we were on download you know we're uplink okay all right to the so 
this was really special for you yes uh so we did the spirograph thing we went around it like this 
and then like that and then like that like in a figure eight okay wait let me just clarify 
here so you went from jupiter uh directly to the moon and started flying around it yes 
and he was giving me a look at all of it I got to observe the whole moon back side front side top 
bottom all of it um I realized uh that they do have a base on the back side of the moon 
they don't live there 24 7. okay a lot of people imagine that they do but they do not um they come and they go so what does it look like it's a long building 
and it has two levels that you can see one of them protrudes out farther than the others 
you know like like an observatory wing of it you know and uh it is um very cool looking and 
i don't know what I don't know why nobody ever saw it and then it dawned on me later that oh yes they 
did the astronauts got to go around the moon they saw the back side of the moon okay in in in the 
the module you know the flight module they saw it they knew it was there they were taking pictures of it I guarantee they were um oh yeah some of these have been leaked 
up there's a lot of photographs and stories about stuff on the moon yeah there are other prominences that I saw there were some artifacts of things that they had on the moon that were eons 
and sold that they no longer used okay um I saw the left the limb the lander okay I 
saw the flag I saw the when you said you saw were you like flying over it yes all right okay so are 
you looking I mean you're I'm assuming you're some you know 10 20 100 miles up no we were uh probably 
a thousand feet up oh wow we're very close to the bottom yeah we were skimming it okay uh
he didn't pause at all I mean we just did did the tour and then he found the place like if 
you're looking at the moon the rim that you see we're up on the rim okay and we've soft landed 
and uh I was shocked because the earth was in face in other words you know the phases of the 
moon well from the moon the earth has phases as well especially from that part of the moon 
and it was in uh it was a one-quarter face and it doesn't go up
ours kind of you know goes like this and then it works up the side sometimes depending on where we are this was the sideways phase okay 
and I went I was like oh my god you know it was like oh my god and uh this is when you 
are actually landed yes yeah they opened it all up I mean I had a 360 view of everything okay 
when you say they opened it up you mean they turned the walls transparent yes and I was looking at everything um it dawned on me because I saw patches of the moon that were 
kind of not all the same color uniform when you're in space or when you're outside yours 
your or close up I don't know how to explain this you see more color okay you can actually see the 
color of things and um there are some places on the moon that look burnt there's some places on 
the moon that kind of look um I live in georgia and we got georgia clay and it's kind of orangey 
you know brownish orange burnt orange like iron isn't it and there were places I saw an autonomy 
why why is it like that what happened okay at 14 I was smart enough to ask that question and he 
said the dust that lands on the moon and turns it white looking is from space that space dust accumulates there's no wind on the moon it can't blow it around it just accumulates moon does have 
some magnetism okay that's why it has the gravity you can jump up and down on it very low gravity 
but it attracts dust everything does okay and if it's electrically charged it's going to attract us 
and there's dust everywhere in space I thought that was so damn cool and it takes a long time 
for it to accumulate so I mean I realized how that moon had to be eons old as well 
um I know one of the moon landings they specifically landed next to one of these colored areas to check it out yeah yeah it's it's that's it's um I think
everything is related okay our our construct is related everything has the same elements just 
arranged differently okay and the moon has a lot of iron on it it has a lot of elements that earth has on it and they've made the decision here 
that the moon probably came from the earth okay I'm not so sure about that I'm not going to argue with anybody but I'm not so sure did the ut's tell you where it came from
they alluded to it and no it did not come from earth it was formed the same time our solar system 
was formed but it did not come from right all right now there are people I'm just going to throw this out there because there's a lot of talk about the moon and what it is uh when people say oh 
you know this is an artificial structure and it's hello no it's got a core it's got a magnetic core 
all right okay that's why that's why the magnetism that's why it has a small field that's uh 
it has a small atmosphere very small I mean minute but it's there okay it is a functioning uh 
yeah well the moon rocks are made largely of oxygen which sounds crazy but if you look it up you'll see that that's true
it's that it's the composition of the ore so just something I wanted to point out because there was 
so much talk about you know the moon and hipping no it's a solid object no no it's a solid it was 
made during the same time it came together the same time our solar system came together 
so this spot that you landed at didn't have anything I mean was there any pr reason why you 
landed at that particular spot uh they just wanted to give me a time to have a conversation and 
basically he had my full attention at that moment and uh like that yeah he wanted to talk to me 
about I'm coming of age you know I'm 14 years old um I'm should be thinking about what I'm going to 
do with my life what do I want to do with my life uh the realization of be becoming conscious and 
he talked to me about the fact that I was never gonna forget my memory was never going to be altered no more dreaming this is it you're on okay and he talked to me about the fact that um 
this meant that I had the opportunity I was being offered the opportunity to be working with them and I could choose which way I wanted to go with that what were my ideas 
on you know what did I want to do what were my interests you know he was feeling me out for it 
i think they already knew okay well they were explaining different things that you could do is that right yeah you just asked me like yeah I i when I was that age I wanted to be a marine 
biologist I wanted to be a zoologist wanted to be a nurse I wanted to be an astronaut I 
wanted to be pilot I mean just you know um he said well if you had if you could pick some one 
thing what would it be what would be your top thing and I immediately spit out I want to fly 
and he knew exactly what I meant I want to fly okay and everybody started smiling at me 
in their heads and uh he said of course you can fly and I was like it was like
you just won everything okay this is it this is the grand freaking prize okay oh my god and he 
said you're gonna have to be tested he said you know I can't promise you outright you still have 
to go through some you know I was checking to see that you're gonna do this and I'm like okay 
and I said how long will it take and he said it might take a few months you know and uh you 
going back and forth with us and stuff and so I fixed my face for that um it took until I was 
15. years old to be given the go you know right so going back to this experience and so you have 
this conversation you decide that you want to learn how to do piloting and then what happened 
uh everybody was really really happy everybody was grinning at me and stuff and saying oh good you know and uh they were ecstatic actually and mama was kind of proud you know she was sitting there
grinning from here to freaking air okay well what she calls errors and um
they said okay well you know this is going to be short night 
you need some sleep and he told me he said I am going to explain to you that tonight you must sleep you must sleep six hours and I think that they gave me a suggestion that 
i was gonna obey because I actually felt tired at that moment and they brought me back 
got into bed and I slept solid six hours when I woke up I just went there can we back up a 
second so you okay can you describe the process of you know leaving the moon and going back 
to your home um from tolada I'm transferred to the two-seater the one that picks me up okay 
uh because they were going to come right down to the house uh they can't tell I can't come that low 
to the ground he would fry the house with my you know radiation so they brought me back that way um 
via a beam of light or a ribbon like you're talking about same thing brought me out uh 
i came in one of them came down with me this time there weren't two there's just one and uh the ai 
grades are uh real just matter of fact you know okay bye and he went no no handshakes no hugs 
no love no nothing just okay you're good bye and they left and the room went dark and quiet and the 
house was quiet and I keep I always used to think that I'm waking everybody up but I wasn't I mean 
i never understood that they were being put into a type of stasis that they were all being 
held in uh unconsciousness what was going on so they didn't know what was going on 
the only thing that was really awake in the house were the animals and I don't know how they stayed awake you know um sometimes my dog was waiting for me okay uh I wasn't allowed to bring my dog 
until much later because I was too busy doing stuff um but she eventually started coming with 
me if I wanted to come all right well well that's really cool so this is how your experiences began 
from this point on yeah you pretty much became a fully conscious contactee yeah and uh I want 
to do more episodes with you to explore you know what it was like being taken to other planets and 
yeah some some really interesting episodes with you know time what I guess we'll call time travel 
uh and yeah all the different types of et's you saw but I kind of want to wrap this up because 
we've been going for about an hour okay I will tell you the last thing that I do remember after 
i woke up the very last thing was that I'm connected to tell other for life now I cannot 
be separated from him I'm mentally hooked to him I can call him at any time and I knew it 
when I became conscious okay yeah so from that point on age 14 you've taken 
you know regularly uh weekly twice a week just about yeah yeah literally 
yeah just taking on many many adventures which you know you describe in the book symmetry a true 
ufo adventure so I basically just wanted to give all the viewers here an introduction to the book 
introduction to dolly's experiences and this is how it all started age eight months being taken 
being taken repeatedly after that yeah yeah aged 10 months yeah and then seeing 
mom at age five or six okay and then you know regular encounters which we didn't really 
get into of you know night time being taken to apparently another planet well yes another planet 
lots of them yes but we'll get into that because I think that would be another really spectacular 
uh subject to do a deep dive into uh and that would take easily another hour or 
two easy yeah so yeah this is basically what I wanted to cover today so um unless you have any 
final closing thoughts I think this would be a good place to sort of wrap it up 
um well I kind of one of my wishes is that everybody learned how to use their abilities to 
wake up and those of you who are contactees um are going to experience a lot of what I experienced 
okay probably very similarly and all I can tell you is that even though it sounds like it was 
emotional and all that in the end it it's the greatest thing that ever happened to me I can't 
imagine not being this way at all it is it is almost above and beyond my experiences 
the joy of my existence because I know what my existence is I see it I feel it I hear it and I 
feel the love of it I don't explain that any other way you wide open to everything you're gifted 
from your own ability of what really is happening it's great very cool yeah 
i know you know there are a lot of contactees out there far more and I know the people watching this 
a lot of you for sure without experiences so yeah thanks dolly you're welcome I really appreciate 
you doing this interview and sharing your story with everyone I know it takes a lot of courage you know it's very emotional for you so thanks very much you're very very welcome thank you 
okay all right all right guys that's it for now hope you've enjoyed this episode I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it until next time keep looking for answers keep 
searching for the truth and most importantly like I like to say go ahead and always say it have fun
all right bye for now guys.
