Summary:
Dec 30, 2022
It is among the closest and rarest of UFO encounters. It almost never happens. But the fact is, on extremely rare occasions, people have collided with a UFO. Planes, trains and automobiles, and even boats -- all have crashed into UFOs. Vehicle accidents occur every day. But is a very short list of people who have crashed into an extraterrestrial craft. This video presents a comprehensive look at UFO collisions. And not only UFOs, but in a few cases, collisions with extraterrestrials.

PLANES: While there are literally thousands of cases involving UFOs seen from aircraft, there are a dozen cases in which planes have collided with UFOs.

Jul 1951: Pilot Fred Reagan is flying his Piper Cub over FL when it collides with a UFO.

Jul 22, 1955: Major Mervin Stevens is flying his C131-D aircraft when it collides with an unknown object over Pixley, CA.

Oct 1955: A pilot flying a B-47 aircraft collides with a UFO over Lovington, NM.

Jul 18, 1957: A USAF fighter jet strikes a 30-foot-wide disc over NM, killing the pilot and causing the UFO to crash.

Apr 1, 1957: A USAF C118 collides with an unknown object after taking off from McChord AFB in WA state.

May 2, 1974: Private pilot Carlos de los Santos Montiel is surrounded by three UFOs in his Piper Aztec over Mexico City, one of which strikes his plane.

June 1974: A Japanese AF pilot is flying an F-4 Phantom jet when he strikes a 40-foot-wide metallic disc.

Aug 25, 1974: A disabled UFO plunges to the ground outside of Coyame, Mexico, striking a plane and killing all people onboard.

Oct 23, 1992: Pilot Thomas J. Preziose is killed when his Cessna cargo plane is struck by an unknown object over Mobile, AL.

Jul 28, 1994: Captain Raymundo Cervantes is flying a DC-9 commercial jet over Mexico City when a UFO comes up from below and strikes the landing gear.

Jun 4, 2013: A Chinese passenger jet, a Boeing 757 takes off from Chengdu Airport in China and is struck on the nosecone by an unknown object at 26,000 feet.

Oct 2017. A Boeing 757 carrying the NBA basketball team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, en route from MN to IL is struck by an unknown object at 30,000 feet.

AUTOMOBILES: The most common type of UFO collision is with automobiles. Here are more than a dozen cases.

Feb 7, 1965: A salesman reports that a UFO forced him off the road and proceeded to smash into his car, destroying it almost completely.

Mar 30, 1966: Three passengers are driving over the Wade Road Overpass near Baytown, TX when a glowing object drops from the sky and strikes the roof of their car.

Mar 31, 1966: A man driving along Q Street in Ralston, NE is struck by a black object, leaving a 3-foot-wide dent on his hood and front fender.

Mar 28, 1967: David Morris is driving home from work in Munroe Falls, OH when he comes upon a landed UFO and occupants, and strikes one of the creatures as it crosses the road.

Jul 13, 1967: Two friends driving to Whitehouse, OH come upon a large disc blocking the road. Unable to stop, they collide into it, damaging their car.

Jul 17, 1967: Emma Funk of Millerton, NY calls the police after a black spherical object drops from the sky and strikes her windshield.

Aug 24, 1979, Deputy Sheriff Val Johnson of Stephen, MN strikes a glowing object which causes extensive damage to his police cruiser.

1984: Two U-Haul drivers from Bowling Green, KY suffer severe damage to the truck after being struck by some unknown object from above.

Sep 1, 1984: A family is driving south on Route 84 in AZ and strike a white-suited humanoid which crosses the road in front of them.

Nov 21, 1988: Three friends are driving in convoy in two vehicles through the desert of NM when a glowing silver orb strikes the side of their vehicle.

Jan 17, 1989: Three people are driving along Lucky Strike Road in NV and collide into a reptilian humanoid crossing the road in front of them.

Nov 27, 1998: A woman driving near Mt. Clemens, MI is struck by a glowing white orb the size of a basketball, leaving a strange residue on her car.

2000’s: An anonymous couple driving home from the Olive Garden collide with a floating black cube-shaped object.

May 2004: A woman driving along Lake Cook Road in Algonquin, IL is suddenly forced off the road by an invisible force.

And that’s not all. There is at least one case of a UFO striking a train, and another of a USO striking a boat. So many cases! These encounters show that UFOs are not infallible and that accidents do happen. And these are only the cases we know about. How many more have not been reported, or are being covered up by the military?

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today's episode is going to be a little bit different this one is called I crashed into 
a UFO Yes you heard correctly these are about cases in which people have 
had actual collisions with an unidentified flying object or an actual extraterrestrial 
I didn't expect expect to find as many cases as I actually did 
I found cases involving Planes Trains Automobiles and boats mostly planes and Automobiles I found 
about a dozen cases in which UFOs and planes have collided even more involving automobiles iPhone 
only one case involving a train and one case involving a boat I suspect there are more of all 
of these cases but statistically speaking these are quite rare very unusual encounters and it's 
really quite interesting what happens when someone collides directly into a UFO or extraterrestrial 
so let's just get started I'm breaking this down into the various categories of Planes 
Trains Automobiles and boats I'm going to start with planes then move to Automobiles and then 
cover the only cases I have involving one with a train and one with a ocean-going vessel a boat 
so starting with planes the earliest case that I could find involving a 
plane colliding into a UFO occurred in July of 1951 over Atlanta Georgia 
this occurred to a gentleman by the name of Fred Reagan who was cruising at 8 000 feet in his Piper 
Cub when he says a brilliantly lit lozenge shaped object collided with his plane tearing off the 
tail now this case comes from Gordon Creighton who is the editor of the Flying Saucer review 
and he wrote a report on this and according to Gordon Creighton the pilot Fred Reagan 
says that he was thrown clear of the wreckage and found himself in free fall 
a moments later he was pulled into a dark chamber and realized that he was inside the UFO apparently 
which had struck his plane and surrounding him were several three foot tall shiny figures with 
the appearance of get this huge stalks of metallic asparagus that's quite unusual I've never heard 
a case like that Fred Reagan fainted he says and when he woke up he found himself lying on a table 
and these figures apologized for striking his plane they spoke in English they said we are here 
only to observe your primitive civilization they also told him we have corrected an abnormality 
in your body called cancer we offer this as a slight reparation for the loss we have caused you 
so this is one of the earliest cases of a UFO healing now Fred Reagan again fainted at this 
point and when he regained Consciousness he found himself in a hospital and he was told by the 
personnel there that he had been found next to the wreckage of his plane and was apparently uninjured 
so the end note to this case came one year later with a press release which said and I quote Fred 
Reagan who made headlines last year when he had been a visitor aboard a flying saucer died today 
in the state Asylum for the insane cause of death was determined to be degeneration of the 
brain tissue due to a extreme Atomic radiation authorities are unable to offer an explanation 
so Gordon Creighton published this report in the 1969 issue of flying saucer review but the report 
was actually first uncovered by flying saucer review editor Derek Dempster back in 1951 but was 
not published at that time due to its fantastic nature Gordon Creighton tried to verify this 
report however as he says despite years of trying I have failed to find anyone who can or will throw 
any light upon the story for me or authenticate it it may be untrue but I do not think that it 
is it contains far too many elements which in this summer of 1969 seemed to me to possess the 
Ring of truth but which very understandably may not have seemed to possess it in 1951. 
so yeah the case remains controversial other investigators have tried to verify it and have 
been unsuccessful or even unable to identify the witness Fred Reagan and a few of them have gone 
on record with their belief that this case is not true however Gordon Creighton still stands by it 
and despite his own misgivings he writes we have heard too much since 1951 to be able to Simply 
dismiss it out of hand so yeah a controversial case but it's certainly not the only one 
for example this next case which occurred only four years later on July 22nd 1955 over Pixley 
this is outside of Bakersfield California this case is pretty well verified the main witness 
was an Air Force Major by the name of Mervin Stevens he was reportedly flying at sixteen 
thousand feet over Pixley and he told reporters that at 11 A.M on July 22nd 1955 the engine of his 
c-131d aircraft suddenly staggered and the entire plane was knocked to the right by a terrific blow 
he said and I quote it was as if we struck a brick wall at this point the plane went into 
an immediate uncontrolled vertical dive and both major Stevens the pilot and his co-pilot Charles 
Everett Stamper actually blacked out from the severe gravitational forces incredibly 
unfortunately Stevens regained Consciousness and managed to recover control of the aircraft 
he immediately radioed to Bakersfield Airport that he had been quote struck by a flying saucer 
he requested and of course received clearance for an emergency landing the plane landed with 
only one injured crewman the co-pilot Airman First Class Charles Stamper who was taken to Kern County 
Medical hospital and was then hospitalized at Hamilton Air Force Base he had injuries to his 
face and knee however an examination of the plane revealed that it was severely damaged the left 
elevator control surface was quote gone or smashed the plane's tail section was reportedly shattered 
so the Air Force was very interested in this and in fact a team from Edwards Air Force Base 
was dispatched to the scene to study the damage and an Air Force spokesman later 
told reporters that the playing quote looked like something Struck from above 
now later major Stevens was in fact silenced by his superiors and he refused to discuss 
the incident any further with reporters and the official Air Force explanation came when Captain 
Smith of Edwards Air Force Base information announced that the cause of the accident was 
mechanical malfunction however in support of the UFO explanation for this incident is 
the fact that several residents in the area also reported seeing UFOs at the time of the accident 
and in fact reports came in from San Joaquin Valley and from Fresno both neighboring areas 
one of the witnesses was Miss Ray Brown of Fresno and she reported that at 5 30 a.m 
that morning she observed a glowing green quote egg-shaped object further confirmation came from 
two other Witnesses Mr and Mrs Kenneth mcmullins of Pixley who said that they 
also observed an unknown object in the sky on that day all of these Witnesses reported their 
sightings only after hearing about this mysterious airplane crash so definitely quite interesting 
another case comes from John Keel he's quite well known in this field and that occurred 
in the same year 1955 only a few months later this was in October of 1955 when a pilot was in 
his B-47 over Lovington New Mexico when he says something collided with his plane and there was 
only one Survivor to this accident who said the plane struck some unknown solid aerial object so 
it wasn't verified exactly what this was but again there were Ground Witnesses another witness on the 
ground said that he saw quote a ball of fire which appeared near the plane just before the accident 
so again pretty good confirmation and here's yet another case two years later 
this one was uncovered by UFO researcher Anton and falav who says that on July 18 1957 a USAF fighter 
was flying between Clovis and Portales New Mexico when his plane was struck by a 30-foot wide Gray 
colored craft both the plane and apparently the UFO tumbled to the ground the pilot did 
not survive uh the UFO occupants were described as nordics and they were apparently also killed 
by an intense fire on board the craft though the craft itself still remained largely intact 
this craft was allegedly dismantled and shipped to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and then later moved to area 51. again this all comes from researcher Anton and philov 
and according to his Source the UFO struck the plane because it 
had been struck and disabled by a missile launched from nearby Cannon Air Force Base 
and he says was one of the first UFOs to be successfully downed by the U.S military he says 
that currently the craft is now being stored at an underground facility in White Sands New Mexico 
now again this case is coming from a third hand Source it's not well verified but what's 
very interesting that there were a huge rash of sightings on the days around this incident in fact 
the day prior on July 17 an Air Force plane rb-47 aircraft was followed for more than 700 miles 
for over an hour all the way from Mississippi to Oklahoma and that's just one of several cases in 
that area at that time so I think that does lend some Credence to this account but you can make up 
your own minds about it and if you don't believe it there's always another case coming along and in 
fact one occurred just a few years later this next one occurred on April 1st 1959 at 6 30 PM when 
an Air Force c118 cargo plane took off from the cord Air Force Base outside of Tacoma Washington 
This Plane had been flying Southward for about 19 minutes and was near Orting and to Nino Washington 
when an apparent Collision occurred causing the plane to catch fire and plummet to the ground 
researcher Bob Gribble the founder of new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center 
investigated the incident in depth he says he actually tried to approach the scene of the 
accident itself but was turned away by military personnel and the police he was however able to 
interview two eyewitnesses who told him that at the time of the crash they saw a quote UFO 
flying North the opposite direction of the sea-118 now I will say an insist an official 
investigation of the incident concluded that the plane had caught fire and that the people 
who believed they saw a UFO were actually seeing the stricken aircraft however Bob Gribble learned 
that the pilot a gentleman by the name of Robert L dimmick had actually called in a Mayday discret 
distress call saying quote we've hit something or something has hit us and surely before the 
aircraft hit the ground a final message came from the pilot saying only this is it so Bob 
Gribble talked to people who had been at the crash site and actually viewed the wreckage and 
they told him that the plane was smashed to Tiny bits and was shredded almost beyond the belief 
Gribble also received information that radar stations at McChord Air Force Base had been 
tracking UFOs immediately prior to the incident although when he talked to the public information 
officer at the base he refused to either confirm or deny this report so there were many other 
details that raised questions about this incident such as what appeared to be a clamp down in 
cover-up of any information about the crash quite an interesting case and there are many others 
one of the most interesting cases of this kind and quite dramatic occurred over Mexico City 
on May 2nd 1974. the main witness in this case is Private Pilot Carlos De Los Santos Montiel 
he was flying on route from Guerrero state to Mexico City in his Piper Aztec 24. 
without warning three objects appeared in close formation surrounding his plane 
now these objects were not huge he says they were about 10 feet or so in diameter they approached 
his plane two flew just below the tips of the Wings and the third was directly in front and 
Below his plane he heard and felt a noise and felt one of these craft actually scrape the under part 
of his plane causing his plane to jolt at this moment he realized that the aircraft and landing 
gear were frozen he was terrified and weeping he radioed the airport control tower and Mexico City 
and after calling on the radio the objects darted off Montiel made a safe landing 
his plane was apparently undamaged however Montiel was quite shook up quite traumatized 
he was examined and found to be healthy though he was again quite shaken up 
uh he wondered if perhaps these craft had come and surrounded his plane which was 
quite old in an attempt to keep it Aloft that's pure speculation he says but it's 
absolutely a well-verified case it got a lot of publicity people continue to talk about it today 
it's one of the more dramatic cases in which UFOs have actually shown up and collided with 
a plane this was more of a fender bender but definitely it made contact with this Piper Aztec 
and here's another case which was reported by a Canadian researcher Chris Rutkowski 
this occurred in June of 1974 a Japanese Air Force pilot was flying in F4 Phantom jet at 30 
000 feet when an unknown object began to approach at very high speed 
now the pilot and weapons officer on board the plane assumed that at first this was a Soviet 
aircraft and they immediately engaged their onboard weapons to lock onto the object but 
instead as the object came into visual range they saw that it was a metallic disc 40 feet wide with 
squarish openings along the side as they're locked on the weapon system the UFO increased its speed 
and according to the report headed directly for the plane striking it directly on the nose 
the two crew members immediately ejected while the pilot survived the weapons officer did not 
the Japanese government according to Rutkowski did not deny the incident but refused to acknowledge 
the presence of the UFO saying only that the accident was quote caused by a collision with 
an unknown object at thirty thousand feet so again these cases don't have a lot of information some 
of them uh and they're quite controversial but there's so many of them and here's another one 
this one occurred on August 25 1974. and this one became quite famous because apparently the plane 
and the UFO itself crashed to the ground this was investigated by researchers no Torres and 
Ruben yuriarty and they published the results of their investigation in their book Mexico's Roswell 
so again August 25 1974 was 1007 P.M and according to tour Torres and uriarty officials at the U.S 
air defense radar station tracked an unknown controlled object moving at about 2 000 miles per 
hour it was changing course and slowed down over the town of koyami this is about 40 miles south of 
the U.S border where it mysteriously disappeared from their radar scopes at this time the plane 
from El Paso was apparently struck by the object in both the plane and the UFO plummeted to the 
Earth this Collision was reportedly witnessed by local residents and when morning arrived many of 
the residents of the town of koyami were surprised to see soldiers from the Mexican Army in town 
they roped off the scene and recovered both the plane and the disk like craft 
meanwhile U.S authorities were reportedly monitoring the recovery from the aircraft overhead 
at some point during the recovery U.S authorities noticed that the trucks carrying the UFO and the 
plane had stopped and they were shocked to see that all the Mexican soldiers were 
transporting this craft had apparently died um the speculation is that they died of some 
unknown biological contamination or agent but according to Torres and uriarty U.S authorities 
scooped up the UFO with a helicopter and carried it back to the U.S and destroyed 
all the remaining evidence and for the next 25 years the incident was covered up 
a very controversial case but there's quite a bit of information about it another controversial case 
which has never been fully explained occurred over Mobile Alabama on October 23rd 1992. 
the main witness in this case is redemption by the name of Thomas J prezios and he was killed 
when his Cessna cargo plane crashed into a marsh his flight had only been a lot for 10 minutes when 
it went down NTSB investigators converged on the crash scene scene and the wreckage showed that the 
plane had apparently collided into something at about 3 000 feet elevation the plane was 
shattered in such a manner that it was clear to investigators there had been a head on collision 
now there were some unidentified quote red streaks which researchers were unable to account for 
other than that they did not come from the Pilot's plane the first the suspect of course was another 
plane however there were no other flights in the area except a DC-10 which was flying at 4 000 feet 
and it had no accident and showed no damage they speculated on the possibility of an uncataloged 
drug plane but rejected that as an analysis of the crash site showed only wreckage from one plane 
I was also considered the possibility of drones unmanned aerial vehicles 
but this was rejected when aeroportion officials from nearby Tyndall Air Force 
Base and Eglin Air Force Base in Florida denied testing any drones in that area at that time 
so NTSB investigators reported their findings and were surprised when their superiors released the 
cause of the crash as quote pilot error they did not believe that was the case they protested and 
so did the family of the pilot and the NTSB as a result was forced to reopen the case and this 
time the cause of the crash was labeled as quote collision with an unknown object and in fact an 
NTSB spokesman said and I quote I don't know of any other accident that we have in our files that 
states collision with an unknown object so whether or not this was with an actual UFO is hard to say 
but I think it does deserve a place on this list however this next case definitely was a UFO plane 
Collision and this occurred over Mexico City on July 28 1994. it's very well verified in fact the 
main witness Captain Raymundo Cervantes ruano has spoken about this publicly ruano had logged 17 000 
flying hours over a period of 40 years when this accident occurred and on this evening July 28 1994 
he experienced an encounter unlike anything he had ever experienced he was flying flight number 129 
at 5 000 feet on its Final Approach to the Mexico City Airport Captain Morano had just lowered 
the landing gear in preparation for a touchdown and shortly later he notified flight controller 
Enrique kolbeck that an unidentified object was ahead of their plane stationary in the sky 
and unable to avoid it the dc-9 actually collided directly with this UFO and Captain ruano believed 
that the collision with the UFO actually damaged his landing gear and he declared an emergency 
the entire airport was shut down as airport Personnel prepared for a possible crash 
thankfully the plane did land safely however in an inspection of the landing gear showed that there 
was a large unexplained gash in the front wheel Hydraulics that had apparently been caused by the 
collision with the UFO now Enrique colbeck who was in charge of this flight later told researchers 
that he had in fact received earlier calls about UFOs in the area but that there were no other 
known aircraft in that area at that time however only a few days later on August 8 1994 Aeromexico 
flight 304 had a near collision with an object described as 60 feet wide and it came so close 
to the plane's nose that the co-pilot shouted out to the captain Oh my God we are going to crash 
fortunately no such Collision occurred but upon Landing the pilots of flight 304 were told that 
theirs was the fifth UFO report that week a very interesting case and here's another interesting 
case and you can actually see the Damage Done to the plane in this case this occurred on 
June 4 2013 when a Chinese passenger jet took off from Chengdu airport in China 
it began its Journey towards Guangzhou at about 26 000 feet elevation there was a loud banging sound 
as the Boeing 757 struck an apparent quote foreign object directly on the nose cone of the jet 
the pilot radioed Chengdu airport and requested an emergency landing due to Mechanical failure 
and although the pilot couldn't see any damage from his vantage point in the cockpit the jet 
he said was hard to control now what the pilot actually struck remains a mystery they themselves 
have remained silent and this entire incident would probably have gone unnoticed if not for 
the fact that an inquisitive passenger snapped photos of the damage as he on boarded the plane 
and this photo shows a very large indentation on the left side of the nose cone this Dent is 
a few feet deep several feet wide scratches and scraped paintwork are evident in these photos 
and while the pilots failed to go public an air traffic controller allegedly reported 
that the time of the incident they had six unidentified Targets on their radar scopes 
after this incident the targets suddenly vanished so that's pretty good confirmation 
I will say that the China Daily News reported that the Collision was due to bird strikes 
and in fact there are some species of birds who have been seen flying at that elevation 26 
000 feet not many birds can do this vultures Condors geese and 
a few others can reach that height but not normally do they fly at such high altitudes 
and a further investigation reportedly ruled out bird strikes due to a quote lack of blood feathers 
or any other bird remains so what strike what what struck Air China flight ca4307
there has been some speculation it was a drone others believe it was a UFO and if you look at 
in other aircraft that have reportedly struck Birds it looks pretty consistent 
with the damage sustained to this Boeing 757. however whatever happened remains a mystery 
and another very similar incident occurred to another jet a Boeing 757 on in October of 2017. 
this is quite an interesting case this flight was on route from Minneapolis Minnesota to Chicago and 
was flying at about 30 000 feet during the night when an object suddenly smashed into the nose cone 
again leaving a huge dent which was not discovered until the plane landed what's interesting about 
this case is the passengers on the plane included the NBA basketball team the Oklahoma City Thunder 
and in fact team member Carmelo Anthony actually posted an image of the plane's damage on Twitter 
and he wrote on Twitter what possibly could we have hit in the sky at this time of night 
another team member Patrick Patterson joked that maybe they had quote accidentally hit Superman 
while flying so there was a lot of joking around this incident but it act absolutely happened Delta 
Airlines reported that there were no injuries and the damage was likely caused by a bird 
this created quite a lot of buzz on Twitter many disagreed with the bird explanation but as we have 
seen birds do fly at that height and while Birds may have been responsible for the damage on this 
particular flight or maybe not there are other incidents that were clearly not caused by birds 
those are all the cases I've found in which planes have collided with UFOs and statistically 
speaking you'd think there'd be quite a lot more because there are literally thousands of cases 
in which Pilots have seen UFOs sometimes at quite close proximity to these objects 
so I'm going to say that the chances of a plane actually colliding into a UFO are
0.01 percent I mean really low statistically insignificant uh I don't think that there's 
any real danger as was stated in the Congressional hearings uh no most cases UFOs easily fly circles 
literally around our own aircraft but on these rare occasions yeah they do collide and there are 
even more cases involving automobiles these are cases which have taken place all over 
the world various types of craft or sometimes what appears to be smaller probe like objects 
so I'm just going to take you through time and present to all these cases some very interesting 
cases in which people have collided into UFOs and extraterrestrials actually with their automobiles 
now a collision with a UFO is perhaps the rarest type of UFO encounter I think that there are more 
cases of UFO crash retrievals honestly been of UFO collisions but UFO car collision cases are 
quite numerous there's more than a dozen cases well over a dozen cases the earliest one I could 
find occurred on the evening of December 28 1954 near Chippewa Falls in Wisconsin 
three people were driving down the highway when a glowing red spherical object the size of a 
basketball zoomed down from above and headed straight for their car it happened so quickly 
that the driver was unable to avoid a collision this object struck the car first hitting the 
radio antenna and then the Chrome strip above the driver's window above the side window 
the impact produced a loud metallic clang sound indicating that this object was in fact metallic 
but after striking the vehicle the glowing object flew off into the darkness and what 
exactly struck the car was never identified another incident occurred about 11 years later 
this was researched by UFO investigator Brad Steiger and it's quite a harrowing event 
this occurred on February 7 1965 to a Salesman who is driving late at night along a highway through a 
desert in the southwestern United States I'll call this gentleman Carl and the incident began when 
Carl observed a brilliant object which was about 25 feet ahead of him floating above the highway 
and this object began to play a cat and mouse game with him for a few minutes and then came 
directly towards his vehicle and he felt it was an apparent attempt to force him off the road 
which it did Carl swerved off the road and into a ditch he jumped out of the car at which point this 
object he says rammed directly into his vehicle as Brad Steiger writes and I quote the UFO continued 
to strike the automobile until it had smashed the car into a tree and wrecked it Beyond repair 
so following this incident Carl had the car taken to a junkyard but shortly later the owner of the 
junkyard called him back and said he wanted the car removed from his junkyard immediately 
Carl asked why and the junkyard owner said after what happened last night I refused to I refused 
to have that car on my lot another junkyard owner wouldn't say why but Carl suspects that the UFO 
was probably involved so yeah that's a case from Brad Steiger and certainly very unusual 
there are many others one year later on March 30th 1966 a lady by the name of Donella Banning 
a hairdresser her mother and her employer were driving across the Wade Road overpass on 
Interstate 10 near Baytown Texas pictured here when a glowing object dropped from the sky and 
struck the roof of their car they didn't see how the object left but afterward an examination of 
the car revealed two five inch wide dents each spaced about 15 inches apart so this 
wasn't apparently debris from another car because this object took off and was never seen again 
and what's really interesting is another case occurred one day later on March 31st 1966 
19 year old Ray Lamarck was driving West on Q Street in Ralston Nebraska when an object 
appeared in front of him and struck his vehicle as Lamarck says and I quote it was a black looking 
object with what looked like Flames at the edges I first saw it when it just about hit 
the car coming in at a height of six feet the object then struck the hood of his car leaving 
a three foot wide dent on the hood and front fender again this object was never identified 
now one of the most interesting cases of all UFO car collisions occurred one year 
later almost to the day on March 28 1967 to a factory worker by the name of David Morris 
what makes this case so interesting is he did not crash into a UFO but instead into apparent 
extraterrestrials humanoid entities who had appeared next to a landed UFO 
now David Morris he's 20 years old at the time he was on his way home from his job at the lamb 
electric company in Kent Ohio his home is located in Monroe Falls this is just a short drive away 
as he's driving home along the road he says a thick fog settled over the area causing him to 
drive slower than normal was around 2 20 a.m when he noticed a weird orange glow ahead of him and 
to the left of the road he thought that perhaps a house was on fire however as he crested the hill 
he was amazed to see a quote wedge or cone-shaped object he said it was about 12 feet wide 25 feet 
tall and was apparently landed in a field of wheat about 75 feet away from the road or perhaps 
hovering maybe a few feet above the ground is that it glowed with a bright orange light and it 
almost looked transparent a ball-shaped object appeared to rest on the Apex of this object 
this point David felt no fear but he was curious as to what this object might be 
he estimates that he was traveling at about 30 miles per hour and he's studying this object as 
he's driving by trying to identify it and movement ahead of him on the road caught his attention 
and when he returned his gaze to the road he was shocked to see four or five short figures 
standing in the road about 45 feet ahead of him they were actually crossing the road 
he estimates that there were about three or four feet tall with large oversized heads and stocky 
bodies each of them were dressed in overalls and they each glowed with this same Eerie orange light 
they were darting back and forth across the road with abnormal speed David said much faster than 
a person and although his headlights illuminated them clearly they did not 
seem to notice him and instead appear to be very focused on moving back and forth across the road 
so as soon as he sees them he's slammed on the brakes unfortunately he was unable to 
stop in time and he heard a thump as the right front of his car Struck One of the figures 
he skidded another 10 feet before coming to a stop this is a metallic brassy odor filled the air 
but at any rate David grabbed the door and was about to jump out and see if 
he could help but he realized that whoever he had hit they weren't human 
fear swept through him and he thought to himself if I killed them they'll kill me 
so instead of getting out of the car he pressed down on the accelerator and fled the scene in fear 
he looked into his rear view mirror and saw one of the figures still standing in the road 
feeling cold and clammy he raced home sat in his living room he says for two hours just thinking 
about what had happened and trying to calm down he did call his friend and the next day they 
returned to the scene the only evidence they found were the skid marks from his vehicle however an 
inspection of his car revealed that the chrome trim was dented and scratched in three places 
so fearing ridicule David hesitated to call the police or report his encounter but he did find 
the contact a reporter from a local newspaper and when that's what he saw David had no answer 
only to say that it was quote unearthly and that I've never had an experience like this 
so this case was later investigated by UFO researchers who talked to David and verified 
this incident however David Morris was so unnerved by this experience that following this incident he 
refused to take that route home from his job ever again and he started taking the longer 
back way along Route 5 to Marsh Road and South to Monroe Falls Road a very interesting case 
you can actually hear his first hand testimony this was uh Tuesday morning I just got off work at two o'clock and there have been a 
thunderstorm earlier that night but uh it was over about an hour and a half earlier and I was coming 
down North River Road this was approximately 2 20 in the morning and uh I started up over a big 
hill there on the road and I saw this uh orange red glow in the sky uh something like a fire and 
I thought maybe lightning had struck a house earlier that night and the house was on fire 
and uh I slowed down immediately expecting to see fire trucks in this as I topped the hill 
but as I topped the hill I noticed uh off to the left hand side of the road and that 
would be the south side uh an orangish red object which appeared to be a cone shaped 
with a brown sphere on top it was about 25 feet tall and maybe 12 feet wide at 
the base and appeared to be hovering over the ground maybe two feet at the most if at all 
I just attracted my attention and I was staring at it and driving at the same time and just out 
of our normal habit I glanced back at the street and as I glanced back at the street I saw four 
maybe five there were four at least of these but what appeared to be people from this ship 
they were running back and forth across the street and I uh saw that 
they didn't uh recognize my presence there the headlights or the noise for my car or anything 
and they didn't stop running across in front of me and I slammed on my brakes because I saw I would hit them and as I slammed onto my brakes my car was skidding and I heard this loud thump 
and I maybe went eight to ten feet further after the impact with this uh 
object that I hid I immediately I started to get out of the car as just a first reaction when you 
hit something in the street that that I thought that that was all wrong to get out of the car 
so I sped away down the street and as I started away I looked in the rearview mirror to catch a 
glance and these objects had them stopped running or back and forth across the street and they were 
all standing there I couldn't see whether they were standing or the one that I've hit or not 
but they had stopped running across the street I got home and I just kind of sat in the living 
room for a couple hours and thought of a million or more different things that it could have been 
or what I could have done and then I uh just went to bed now I noticed on your automobile 
um that you have the uh there's a space on your grill where it is sort of spread apart a wee bit 
scratches and then one thing I noticed uh on the rim of your right headlight it is bended too now 
all of this occurred at this time there was no dents there before because uh after seeing your car I realize you keep it very well in good condition now was this before or were there 
any Goods before to verify that uh there was only the one little crease there in the Chrome piece 
the rest of them were all made by this whatever I get in the street and that on the rim of your 
headlight was made when you hit whatever you hit yes it was now um we were wondering before 
we came out and of course before we saw your automobile I didn't realize it set so high and 
I thought perhaps it might uh be that the object you had could have gone under the car would you 
explain why uh you don't feel this happened after I started down the street I didn't feel any thump 
or anything underneath the car or like I'd ran over it with the tire I either drove uh right 
over it or it went off to the side one way or the other there I couldn't say which it was 
now at this time as you heard and felt this from uh in the light of your headlight I think you said 
you could determined um uh some part of a figure yes it was I I saw a part of an arm oh maybe about 
four inches of the arm and the hand but uh there was no fingers on the hand only a thumb 
in other words you couldn't tell whether that could have been like a mitten or uh you know 
like encased uh a hand encased in a mitten or you just don't know it's just a quick fly is that 
right yes it was I couldn't say what it would be uh something that they had on their hand or their 
hand itself could you describe uh of course I know all of this happening in lack of Flash 
uh but would you describe the best your ability gave uh the impression you had of these figures 
uh yes they were oh maybe three and a half to four feet tall uh built stockley somewhat on the order 
of a [ __ ] uh with the short legs and uh the longer arm than normal and the heads were uh large 
they were very large out of proportion to the size body that they had this could have been a head 
covering but even if it would have been a head covering they would have to make this covering so it fit the head and that it would have been bigger and it wasn't around the head more oblong 
like a light bulb shape almost and there's so many another comes from two witnesses from Mommy Ohio 
this occurred on July 13 1967 when Robert Richardson and his friend Jerry Quay they 
were both 21 years old were driving from Maumee Ohio to White House this case was investigated by 
the Ariel phenomenon research organization and was published in the apro bulletin 
now the purpose of this road trip was to verify that the White House Quarry would be open for 
swimming on that weekend and these two young men were about halfway to their destination 
and coming around a corner in the road when they saw that the roadway ahead of them was completely blocked by a brilliant blue white light it was rectangular they say it was lying crosswise 
over the road and was about 22 feet long they estimate and eight feet high at the time their 
car was moving at 40 miles per hour and by the time they saw this object it was too late to stop 
now Robert Richardson did slam on the brakes and as they actually struck the object he closed his 
eyes to protect himself they both felt a thump and both were absolutely convinced 
they had physically struck this object but when they opened their eyes it was gone 
now an inspection of their car did reveal that the bumper and Hood were damaged and in fact 
the chrome plating of the bumper appeared to have been completely stripped off both men 
were so shook up that they drove directly to the nearest town of Waterville and called the police 
the police returned with two officers to the scene of the accident and other than the damage 
to the car the only other evidence found were skid monks on the road and two small pieces 
of metal where the object had apparently struck the road now apro of course heard 
about this case they dispatched one of their researchers Niles H Paquette to investigate 
and picat Paquette says he recovered the pieces of metal which he sent to afro for analysis 
unfortunately the results of this analysis were not published as far as I know and even more 
interesting was shortly after this event Niles Paquette says he was approached by two apparent 
government officials Men In Black if you will who questioned him about the physical evidence 
now Paquette was unable to determine the identity of these men and he was even 
more puzzled how they even knew about the case which had not been publicized at all
there's a weird timing to some of these cases because it was only three days later that the 
third UFO car collision of 1967 occurred in New York more specifically in Millerton New York 
on July 17 1967 A call came into the Millerton New York police station regarding a stalled 
automobile on route 22. patrolman Lewis Lindsay was dispatched to the scene and he found the car 
and inside the car he found Mrs Funk done and Confused and she told the officer that she had 
been traveling north on Route 22 at around 11 25 PM when her car radio became filled with static 
and at that moment a shiny black baseball-sized object swooped down out of the sky from above 
collided into her windshield and then appeared to bounce away now at the same time 
her car headlights mysteriously went out the car engine stalled and Miss Funk lost consciousness 
when she regained Consciousness she was Dazed and disoriented and her car she said was now 
facing in the opposite direction and was about one mile south of where the object had struck her car 
so this appears to be more than a sighting or even a collision but perhaps an onboard experience 
given that there was all the electromagnetic effects her car was in a different location 
and she blacked out so I would say that there was probably missing time here and in fact Mrs flunk's 
case found its way to a UFO organization called the aerial investigations and research to now a 
defunct UFO investigative group that was headed by a junction by the name of William Donovan 
but they recommended Miss Funk go under hypnotic regression or she did in fact it was televised and 
Miss Funk recalled that following the Collision aliens had approached her car struck her on the 
chest with a strange rod wasn't entirely clear if she was actually taken on board the UFO 
however at some point she recalled her car being turned around and this again was filmed and later televised during a news special on UFOs
probably the best known UFO Collision Case Of All Times occurred at around 1 40 a.m on August 
24 1979 to a deputy sheriff by the name of Val Johnson on that evening Val was on a routine 
Patrol outside of Stephen Minnesota and looking ahead of him on the road he observed a quote 
bright brilliant light heading toward him at very low elevation and as Val Johnson says and I quote 
the edges were very defined I thought perhaps at first that it could be an aircraft in trouble as 
it appeared to be a landing light from an aircraft he continued driving but suddenly 
at the same time this light zoomed directly towards him and before he had a chance to even 
evade this object it swooped down and struck his car in an apparent head-on collision and 
as Val Johnson says the inside of the car lit up I remember that it was a very dazzling appearance 
he immediately lost Consciousness and woke up about 40 minutes later to an incredible scene his 
car which had been heading south was now sideways in the road Facing East as it is pictured here and 
in fact his windshield was shattered but was still intact you can see the damage to the windshield 
one of the vehicle's headlights was broken there was a large dent on the hood of the car and as you 
can see the car antenna also was bent backwards and as Val Johnson says in his own words something 
did strike my vehicle something didn't want me there apparently or I can't put judgment on it 
I really don't know how to classify it I can't classify it as an attack perhaps it was a mistake 
he said this after the incident but immediately following this when he woke up he radioed for 
assistance and an officer asked what is your condition and Val Johnson replied 
I don't know something just hit my car I don't know how to explain it strange 
the other officer asked what's your condition are you okay he was still disoriented he said 
something attacked my car so another officer was immediately dispatched and following the Collision 
Val Johnson exited his car and saw that his tires had left skid marks along the road 
which were later measured at 99 feet in length so presumably he had slammed on the car brakes though 
he has no memory of this and he also saw that one of the red siren lights on his Cruiser was broken 
so he was quite shaken up but appeared at first to be uninjured but he quickly 
realized however that he was mistaken and by the time another officer arrived Val Johnson 
realized he was suffering from quote very sore eyes he was immediately transported to Warren 
hospital where a doctor diagnosed him with a quote mild case of welder's burn to my eyes 
I found that interesting because that does turn up in a number of UFO cases 
Val Johnson was treated with lotion and bandages on his eyes and after further examination he returned home however as he says my eyes were extremely painful 
now he later discovered that his watch and the police clock both registered 14 
minutes short of the actual time this case causes a huge sensation in the UFO community 
it was one thing to have a police officer going on record about what he had seen I mean this had 
happened many times however in val Johnson's case his story was supported by physical evidence not 
only not only in the form of his injuries but the damage to the vehicle itself Johnson's automobile 
a 1977 Ford LTB was eventually examined by several UFO researchers as well as experts 
from Ford motors and Engineers from Honeywell in an attempt to explain what had caused the damage 
and not surprisingly the researchers were unable to produce any conventional explanations 
Val Johnson's employer Officer Dennis Breck said and I quote we do believe our Deputy 
had an encounter we haven't been able to explain I don't know what happened 
and Officer Dennis Breck said in a later interview that he did in fact believe in UFOs the case 
really got some publicity and was investigated after Val Johnson contacted UFO investigator Alan 
Hendry who began an investigation and eventually brought the case to the Forefront of research 
later Val Johnson's case was featured on the television program that's incredible 
and on the show six months after the encounter Val Johnson said that this incident was his 
one and only encounter and that it quote brought us closer together as a family unit 
other than this show Val Johnson has shunned any publicity and no further information about 
this incident has been forthcoming an equally dramatic incident involving a 
UFO vehicle collision occurred to two Walmart employees in 1984 in Bowling Green Kentucky 
now these Witnesses are Anonymous the main witness all called Conrad that is a pseudonym 
and he wrote to the National UFO Reporting Center I do not wish to reveal my identity at this time 
my story is a very strange one and I have not told many people about this 
we decided to keep quiet about this incident back then because of being fired or people thinking 
that we were responsible in some way as will be explained they may have thought we were seeing 
things or drinking but we were doing neither so this was a warm day and it was the weather 
was clear and beautiful Conrad and his co-worker were driving a U-Haul rental truck as they had 
done many times before transporting merchandise from the warehouse to the main Walmart store 
now this was a seven mile drive this is a fairly large truck so Conrad was driving very carefully 
and as he says everything was going well until we came to the four-way intersection 
on the Nashville Road from Campbell Lane as is pictured here this is the exact intersection 
and as Conrad says I stopped at the intersections red light and proceeded 
to turn right onto Nashville Road we pulled up a bit and proceeded to drive the short distance 
left to our destination when something really powerful and large hit our U-Haul 
whatever it was hit us so hard it literally made us jerk sideways and it made a loud metal 
crashing noise after Gathering our senses I put on the flashing emergency red lights and 
we got out to see what happened we both thought that somebody had hit us in the back end of our 
truck yet when we looked around there was not any vehicle anywhere that had hit us nothing 
we would have seen a vehicle pass us while we were inside the truck but this was not the case either 
so there was no other traffic on the road at the time so there were no other Witnesses 
the two men got out of the U-Haul nothing was visible around them that could have struck them 
that's when they looked at the truck and got a huge shock as Conrad says now confused and puzzled 
we decided to look for damage to the U-Haul and this is where the real strangeness comes to play 
when we went to the right passenger side of the truck there was some severe damage to the truck but it was near the very top side of the vehicle 
my co-worker and I were completely stunned and speechless a severe Dent about eight feet 
long and two feet deep was plainly visible on the truck near the top this was the passenger 
side that no traffic at all could have been near because there was no Road there just a schoolyard 
whatever had hit the upper part of the youth Hall had to have been airborne the damage to the truck 
was extensive highly visible and not there when we had begun our trip that afternoon the truck was 
checked before we left the store whatever hit the truck had to have been airborne and very big and 
slanted to make a deep Dent like that the damage looked like what a disc would make if it hit metal 
so the men had no choice but to return to their vehicle and continue their interrupted Journey as 
Conrad says we didn't know what to do and feared that we would be held liable for the damage we 
feared for our jobs too after all who would possibly believe such a story as this how could 
we logically explain this after a while of talking we both decide to keep quiet about this because 
we felt we had to nothing was ever mentioned to us about the damaged U-Haul either when we got 
back to our store and we felt that was odd too so it was 22 years after this incident that Conrad 
finally decided to report it to the National UFO Reporting Center and as he writes in his report 
and I quote something Airborne hit and damaged our U-Haul as far as seeing a UFO or such we didn't 
yet my co-worker and I did encounter something very strange and unexplainable indeed this is a 
true story and my previous co-worker can verify my story if he ever decided to come forward I 
still to this day cannot understand what happened to us that day back in 1984 but I can tell you 
absolutely that something very large airborne and Powerful struck our U-Haul truck that day whatever 
it was had to have been flying at Tree Top level and grazed our truck yet we never saw the craft or 
whatever it was this story is absolutely true and accurate I have no idea how to give you 
any kind of sensible explanation for this we were attacked or hit by something strange strange stuff
so yeah UFO car collisions are bizarre enough but even more strange and rare are 
cases involving people who have struck entities in one such case occurred on 
September 1st 1984 to a family driving along Highway 89 not too far from Caliente Arizona 
it was around 2 A.M they were driving South on Highway 89 moving at about 60 miles per hour 
and the father who was driving describes what happened next in his own words as 
he says a person dressed in total white appeared in the middle of the road 40 feet in front of us 
we skid it to a stop but not in time to avoid hitting the person 
they heard no sound of any impact as they struck this figure and the figure disappeared the father 
exited the car and searched the vehicle and the area around it nothing was there this was a bright 
moonlit night there was no way for the figure to just disappear this was largely a desert area 
but unable to solve the mystery he got back into his car and continued driving 
and more strange things began to happen as the witness says a half mile later the engine dies 
and the headlights fail the interior lights the brake lights emergency flashers radio are all dead 
he grabbed a flashlight and used a vom a voltage meter to check the voltage in the 
battery it registered zero volts so he quickly escorted his family out of the car and off the 
highway where they would be safer and as you return to the car to get some blankets 
the interior lights of the car spontaneously switched back on so he was quite surprised by this you check the car battery again which now measure 12 volts 
so they all got back in the car and continued on their way and returned home without incident 
the witness who was knowledgeable about car engines exempt the vehicle and as he says 
I checked the battery cables generator other wiring and found nothing unusual 
I considered a main fuse breaking then in some way shorting itself to regain electrical power 
but the fuses showed nothing no burn marks Etc so 20 years following this incident he decided to 
report it to the mutual UFO Network now I just got a few more cases I'd like to present to you of UFO 
car collisions but I think they're important so I want to get through all of them and the next case 
I'd like to talk about occurred on November 21st 1988 at around 11 A.M in the deserts of New Mexico 
the exact location is not described but the main witness is Eric eversole who's driving 
with his friend Tammy Lockhart through the New Mexico desert ahead of him in 
another car was his friend Steve so they were convoying through the dis through the desert 
off in the distance to his left Eric noticed a shiny object traveling in the same direction as 
they were kind of pacing their car at first he assumed this was another car but it was 
strange because this was a very isolated area and there weren't any roads where he saw this object 
and he described it as being a round ball of metal hovering about two or three feet above the ground 
he kept his eye on it and saw that it was traveling at a diagonal path which 
was quickly approaching his car on an apparent Collision Course so he had a walkie-talkie and 
he quickly grabbed it and told his friend Steve ahead of him on the road to take a look and Steve 
responded that he saw it he saw a quote something shiny and he began talking to Eric's friend Tammy 
now Eric told Tammy to look but she was too busy on the walkie-talkie talking to Steve and she 
wasn't paying attention Eric however was becoming quickly convinced that something very unusual 
was happening and he's he says I kept driving and looking in the round ball the size of a basketball 
got closer to my car and as it got close he could see it quite clearly again it was pacing 
his car getting closer and closer and he kept his eye on it as best as he could while driving 
he had the distinct feeling that this object knew he was looking at it as Eric says I kept driving 
the round metal orb seemed to be coming toward my car straight toward my passenger door on my left 
all of a sudden it was about five feet from my car I saw it really clear I knew I saw it 
I felt it in my mind I yelled to Tammy to look real quick on my left but by the time she looked 
it hit my car between my door and the passenger door I stopped the car real fast then I looked 
down real quick the orb stopped for a second then went around my car and when I looked in my rear 
view mirror I saw it hover over the road back through the other side of the desert and vanish 
so he pulled over and stopped as did his friend Steve and as Eric says there was a round dent 
in the side of my car his friend Tammy was a bit shaken up she thought at first that they had hit 
a rock Steve however in the car ahead that he saw it he saw a quote something round hit the 
car but he said it happened so fast he didn't get a very good look But Eric was awestruck he knew 
that whatever had hit them was not a rock was very unusual as he says I saw it very clearly I 
know what I saw it has been bugging me for years whoever built that metal orb wanted me to see it 
and in the days months and years actually following this incident Eric continued 
to be haunted by this encounter he says he sometimes feels like he is still being watched 
he also has a very strong feeling that a day is coming when UFOs will show themselves to the 
public at large and everyone on this planet will know that UFOs are real again a very interesting 
case and here's another case more recent involving a collision with an actual entity this is quite an 
interesting case uh the main witness in this case is anonymous I call him Drake 
and this occurred on January 17 1989 along Lucky Strike Road at the Spring Mountain Youth Camp 
this is in Mount Charleston which is outside of Las Vegas Nevada Drake was in a Chevy Suburban 
heading up likey Lucky Strike Road and uh his Superior Joe was driving he was in Drake was 
in the front passenger seat and behind both of them sat another boy by the name of Todd 
now I will say that both of these Witnesses Drake and Todd were young men and they were being held 
at the camp as a result of delinquent Behavior and they were there to be rehabilitated so this 
is a youth camp for troubled youngsters and Drake reported what happened to the mutual UFO Network 
and it's quite a dramatic incident as Drake writes at the time this was a partial dirt road we came 
around one of the last curves to the left and a being stepped out of the forest and into the road 
Joe didn't see the being and struck the being at the last minute and dragged 
the being halfway down the road then the Suburban went over the side of the mountain 
luckily the Suburban came to a halt slamming into a tree so this caused a pretty severe accident 
thankfully they weren't hurt the coach Coach Joe made sure the boys were all right told them to 
stay there and hiked up the road and went to get help but as Drake climbed out of the car he said 
he saw what appeared to be the severed foot of the strange creature that he had seen them strike 
and this was not a normal foot as Drake says it was nothing I have ever seen before it had three 
toes with sharp talons black as nails now if Todd did not see this being either it was just Drake 
and he asked Drake what happened and Drake report pointed to this strange severed foot 
and told Todd we must have hit whatever this foot belonged to now at this point they did hear something moving around in the brush alongside the road 
so they both picked up a couple of sticks followed this noise and Came Upon an incredible sight as 
Drake says we found a being lying on its stomach attempting to crawl away that are the similarity 
of a crocodile the way the back looked and tail it heard me behind it and it flipped over on its back 
and at this point Drake became even more shocked because this was a reptilian like creature covered 
entirely in scales it was clearly female you could tell by its body the scripture had arms 
and legs like a human but otherwise looked very much reptilian he estimates it was about seven or 
eight feet tall and as Drake says when it realized I was there it crawled quickly towards the nearest 
tree and used the tree to support itself to stand on one leg with its back against the tree 
this being looked at me and Todd and began to cry with the voice like a child crying for help 
so Drake and Todd realize at this point that this figure was not threatening they put their sticks down and approached the being and it began speaking to them in a loud voice 
and according to Drake he and the being actually conversed asking questions of each other which he 
did not elaborate on but finally another car drove up it was driven by a teacher from the Youth Camp 
uh Drake and Todd stopped the vehicle and asked the teacher to drive this being to the hospital 
the teacher refused but said he would go get help so they stayed with the being until night 
fell at which point Coach Joe returned and he insisted that the boys returned to the Youth Camp 
Drake wanted to stay with the being but the coach would not allow it and promised that he would send 
help in the morning so reluctantly Drake and his friend Todd left the scene returned to the Youth 
Camp and the next morning Rick was called into the office to meet with a man wearing a black suit and 
a hat some sort of government agent Drake believes and this man wanted to know what happened and as 
Drake says as I told the story and got to the part describing this being this person in Black 
interrupted me and said it was a deer Drake said excuse me I was there and it was no deer and he 
described this reptilian being again but the man interrupted him and said very forcefully 
it was a deer and he began to threaten Drake reminding him that he was already 
in custody and that they had the authority to keep him there until he was 26 years old 
so Drake was Furious understandably but he was smart enough to see what was happening and he 
had no choice but to lie so he told the man okay it was a deer and he was eventually released from 
this camp but this really affected him profoundly in 22 years later following this incident 
he reported his case to mufon the mutual UFO Network saying quote I must talk with someone 
as far as I know this case was never followed up on I do find it interesting and that it involves a 
reptilian there's no apparent UFO this is true with other reptilian cases I know of they're 
often seen out in the wilderness so yeah a very interesting case and I just have three more UFO 
car collision cases I'd like to present to you these next ones are quite brief this uh next one 
occurred sometime in the year in the early 2000s the exact date is not given nor is the location 
uh the witnesses themselves are Anonymous the only information that regarding the location is that 
a boy and his girlfriend were returning from the Olive Garden restaurant that just descended the 
hill and we're passing a house in in a suburb and we're almost to their home when a small 
object appeared right next to their car on the passenger side and as the main witness says we 
spotted it simultaneously but did not know what it was black cubic and about two feet on each side 
and his girlfriend said she could see four metallic legs under it but the main witness said 
I thought I could see heat radiation coming off of its surface I tried to avoid it but it lifted up 
and rammed my right Fender my right front fender hard as I passed knocking off my fog light and 
folding the fender under the wheel well the object had a metallic feel to it when it hit my car 
so he was freaked out but he kept driving the whole car itself began to vibrate roughly like 
it was about to stall his girlfriend said I hear something weird she rolled down the window 
at this point as the witness says we both heard loud jet engine like noises coming from the right 
side of the car I told her to roll up the window and that I would try to get us home the object 
was pushing laterally on my car suddenly the noise and force pushing against the car stopped 
I coasted in my driveway we got out and examined the car and the right side of 
the fender shroud had been split plastic parts littered my driveway including the fog light 
at this point the object that had struck was now gone
another real briefcase occurred to an anonymous woman driving near Mount Clemens Michigan 
this was on November 27 1998 when the anonymous witness saw what she described as a highly intense 
ball of white light about the size of a basketball heading towards her car she was unable to avoid it and this object struck her car causing an audible thump 
it then moved off and afterwards she inspected her car and found a narrow streak of cream 
Gray colored residue where the vehicle had been struck she contacted researchers and they actually 
gathered a sample of this residue which was sent to UFO researcher Phyllis Budinger for analysis 
and the results were quite interesting they showed that this substance appeared to be magnesium oxide 
interestingly this metallic element has been detected in UFO metal fragment cases this element 
is stable at high temperatures and is high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity so 
commercially it's often used for fireproofing in other words UFO occupants may find it in Optimum 
material for the outside Skin of Their craft and one final UFO car collision case quite recent 
occurred on May 2004 to an anonymous woman who was driving along Lake Cook Road in Algonquin Illinois 
she was driving at 40 miles per hour there were no other cars on the road when without warning her car suddenly lurched to the right for no apparent reason she stopped the car to 
investigate and was shocked to see that the entire left side of her car was completely crumpled in 
there was no damage to the paint at all it was as if she had struck some sort of weird 
force field it almost looked like her car had been melted the case was eventually sent to 
mufan for investigation and although there was no evidence that an actual UFO had caused the damage 
researchers were also unable to explain how it had occurred pretty amazing huh I mean I 
really did not expect to find that many cases and I certainly wonder about these cases in 
which people have hit actual extraterrestrials pretty darn interesting and again super rare 
so many people report being chased down the road by these objects sometimes lifted up 
into the sky as I did on another episode I mean there are lots and lots of UFO car encounters 
so this category involving actual collisions is exceedingly rare but as we can see it does happen 
and in fact it happens with other vehicles like trains once again I only found one case involving 
a train this is pretty well known in the UFO Community you may have heard of it before but 
this occurred in Shelby Anna Kansas and it's quite an interesting case this case occurred on 
January 14 2002 and again is as far as I know the only case involving a train that has struck a UFO 
this train was reportedly on route from Russell Kansas to Shelby Anakin was 2 47 a.m January 
14 2002 when the main witness Derek that's a pseudonym and the conductor were at milepost 
42 coming around an area which they nicknamed The Wild Kingdom due to the fact that there 
were many animals seen there then they noticed this bright light ahead of him on the tracks 
they instantly assumed this was another train which was not unusual so as Derek says I killed our lights as not to Blind the oncoming crew as we round to the corner 
our onboard computer began to flash in and out the speed recorder went nuts and both locomotives 
died alarm Bells began to ring and that's when we saw the objects there were three of them each 
metallic silver with multiple colored lights near the bottom and around the middle he discerns no 
portholes or markings but these were classic discs each about 10 feet high maybe 20 feet wide they 
were situated at various positions over the nearby River sending down what looked like searchlights 
however the first and closest object was only 10 maybe 12 feet above the train tracks Dead Ahead 
and as the main witness Derek says and I quote with both engines dead as we rounded 
the corner we made little noise and at first in the first object did not respond in time 
I estimate that we hit the object at 30 miles per hour with 16 000 trailing tons behind us 
clipped the top of our lead unit then skipped back slicing a chunk out of our trailing unit 
and the first two coal cars the other two objects vanished Into Thin Air so due to the loss of power 
the emergency brakes had been automatically engaged however even with the brakes the train 
didn't come to a stop until almost two miles down the track by this time the power had come back on 
Derek and the conductor called their dispatcher in Jacksonville Florida and reported the incident 
they were told to inspect the cars and ensure that they would quote hold the rail 
and then to Trout to milepost 60. and as Derek says we checked everything out in the 
cab of the rear locomotive was demolished and smoking the second two cars looked as 
if they had been hit with a giant hammer but they looked like they'd hold the rail 
so Derek and the rest of the crew limped back into Paintsville where they were confronted by an incredible scene and I'll just quote the main witness directly as he says we pulled into 
the Paintsville yard at approximately 5 15 am the huge overhead lights lining the yard were 
noticeably dark and the only lights came from what we assumed were railroad officials Vehicles parked 
near the end of the track we pulled to a stop and began unloading our grips off the wounded train 
we could hear what sounded like Army worker an army of workers immediately tending to our train 
vehicle doors slamming guys running by in weird outfits and lights glaring from all directions 
the one thing missing was railroad officials at this point Derek was approached by a man who 
introduced himself as Mr Ferguson took him into an office where there were unidentified government 
officials waiting so once again we see these men in black type both Derek and its conductor 
were asked hundreds of questions Derek repeatedly asked to speak with the road Foreman or the train 
Master these requests were denied instead They confiscated the conductor's cell phone and told 
both men that they could leave but only after they had been medically tested for their own protection 
after all this Derek went outside and saw the damaged train cars had been disconnected from 
the rest of the locomotive and were now parked under a quickly constructed huge 
tent mic structure which was buzzing with activity and as dark was led away from the 
scene he was told quote due to National Security your silence on this matter would be appreciated 
now their Adventure wasn't over yet they were then taken to Martin Kentucky where they were again 
questioned This Time by railroad officials they were then also drug tested finally they were taken 
to their original destination shelbiana where they slept for eight hours and then were assigned to 
work a train returning along the exact same route in reverse from Shelby Anna back to Russell Kansas 
and as Derek says and I quote working back we passed by Paintsville no sign 
of the engines cars tent people nothing so the entire incident was allegedly covered up 
officially the explanation given was damaged due to a rock slide now there have been accusations 
of a hoax on this case but nobody has been able to provide evidence of it and in fact there are 
additional reports of strange activity in the area at that time of the incident 
as reported to the National UFO Reporting Center a Paintsville firefighter and a paramedic good 
Witnesses were driving home in Paintsville on the evening in question when he saw a big light zigzag 
over the road in front of me that's a direct quote he said the light was about 250 feet overhead and 
was followed by two other lights so that's three objects which matches what the main witness Derek 
says and according to this witness as the objects passed overhead his headlights flickered and the 
gauges on the dashboard quote went crazy he was very much impressed he called 9-1-1 and later 
heard about this train Collision reported his sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center 
so while this is a very controversial case and has not been as far as I know officially investigated 
it appears to be legitimate now I did find a couple of cases involving UFOs that collided 
with boats I found only one that I thought was really worth presenting uh so that's the case I'm 
going to be talking about here it's quite brief but it's pretty well verified and I think very 
interesting on February 5 1964 11 survivors were rescued by the Coast Guard from their emergency 
raft following the sinking of their yacht the Hattie d off the coast of Mendocino California 
now this is an area of particularly High UFO and Uso activity but what makes this story so unusual 
is that all 11 survivors of the Hattie D insisted that they were sunk by an unidentified undersea 
object the boat had set sail originally from Seattle Washington and was making its way down the 
coast of California when tragedy struck without any warning the yacht either struck or was rammed 
by an unidentified quote metal object the boat sank shortly later without any evidence of what 
had actually struck their boat crewman Carl Jansen elaborated on the event saying and I quote I don't 
care how deep it was what Hold Us was steel and a long piece there was no give to it at all 
so while they didn't see what it was UFO investigators seized upon this as a possible Uso incident and whatever sunk the Hattie D remains unidentified 
so there you go those are all the cases I could locate in the UFO literature involving 
collisions with unidentified flying objects and or extraterrestrials and yeah there are quite a few 
of them I did present these cases in my book not from here volume 4. these volumes are of course 
all about the more unusual cases the outline cases the cases that haven't gotten a lot of attention 
so if you want to learn more about these UFO collisions you can certainly check that out 
and that is it for today I hope you've learned something new about UFOs and extraterrestrial 
presence on our planet I hope you found this episode interesting once again I 
want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun
