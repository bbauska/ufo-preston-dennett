STOP! UFO! DON'T SHOOT!

Summary:
Apr 15, 2022
It is sometimes human nature to shoot first and ask questions later. This concept is perfectly illustrated with UFO encounters. In fact, there are dozens of cases on record involving shoot-outs between humans and UFOs and aliens. 

This video presents nearly two dozen cases in which people have shot at UFOs and extraterrestrials. Cases like these reach all the way back to the 1940s, the beginning of the Modern Age of UFOs, and continue up to the present day. Police officers, security guards, military personnel, hunters, ranchers and many others have all shot at UFOs. 

What happens when someone shoots at a UFO? Does it affect the UFO? Will the ETs react by defending themselves? The cases here show exactly what happens. And the results might surprise you.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos and the paranormal I've got a pretty interesting episode for you today I think 
i call it stop ufo don't shoot these are first 10 cases in which people have shot guns at ufos 
what happens when there's a ufo shootout well it's pretty interesting actually I've got over 
20 cases of this kind I'd like to present them to you chronologically starting with 
cases in which people have shot at craft and moving to cases involving actual humanoids 
so I think this has something pretty important and profound to say about ufo human interaction 
so let's just get started in the first case the earliest case I could find occurred in 1942 
this is best known as the la blackout or the battle of la and this occurred on february 25 
1942 just a few months after the bombing of pearl harbor and on february 25 1942 
the city of los angeles was invaded by several large ufos hovering overhead 
there was one particularly large craft and many smaller craft which moved in from over the ocean 
over culver city and one of these craft stayed in place over the city for so long that the entire 
city went into an enforced blackout and in fact the military converged underneath this object 
trained spotlights on it and began to shoot over 1400 rounds of ammunition at it in an attempt to 
bring it down which was unsuccessful however five people did lose their lives due to heart attacks 
falling debris car accidents this sort of thing it's a very well-known event that has yet to be 
explained to this day there was an initial cover-up the press tried to call it balloons 
but it became very clear that it wasn't balloons I did talk to a first-hand witness who says this was 
no way balloons uh he saw one of these craft quite low in the sky and more recently 
documentation released through the freedom of information act reveals that perhaps a couple 
of these objects were shot down one over the santa monica mountains and another over the ocean itself 
so it's quite an amazing event in ufo history and did actually result in a congressional 
investigation and is perhaps the earliest known case of a ufo shootout but certainly not the last 
and in fact in 1952 there was a huge wave of sightings across the u.s 
and the world and frank fischino's book shoot them down the flying saucer air wars of 1952 
provides a gripping account of many cases in which the air force apparently vectored 
jets fighter jets after ufos and tried to shoot them down unsuccessfully apparently in most cases 
though it's not entirely clear if perhaps in some of these cases ufos were damaged I do recommend 
frank fischino's book because it provides a really gripping account of how we used to shoot at ufos 
a policy which was apparently reversed after we had lost a number of pilots in these incidents
but moving on from there there's quite a history of ufo shootouts 
and the next case I'd like to talk about occurred in 1954
off the coast of bin korea this was during the korean war in the u.s air defense artillery had 
several hawk missiles set up in the event of an attack by the north koreans and at 10 am 
one morning in 1954 a blip was spotted on radar moving towards a base and the officers at the base 
cited the object visually which was described as quote a glowing metallic disc estimated to 
be 100 yards in diameter 10 yards high with red and green pulsating lights moving around the rim 
counter clockwise soon this craft approached within 700 yards of the base when the captain of d 
battery gave orders to launch a hawk missile which he did but before it could reach its target 
the ufo reportedly replied with a beam of white light disabling the hawk missile the ufo then 
departed making a sound like a swarm of bees so this was a very interesting response from the 
ufos in which they actually disabled the missile and a similar event reportedly occurred in the 
soviet union in july 24 of 1957 when several ufos were sighted over the coral islands the russian 
anti-aircraft batteries went into action however the repeated attacks failed to bring down any ufos
so people are not only shooting missiles at ufos but using handguns and rifles such as what 
happened in the small town of rio vista california in may of 1964 the town of rio vista which then 
had a population of about 2 000 people experienced a two-year-long wave of sightings these objects 
were viewed by hundreds of local residents and starting early in may of 1964 witnesses 
reported seeing a torpedo shaped object which was described as about five feet wide and 12 feet long 
glowing bright red and moving silently at treetop level through the town and in fact it appeared 
so regularly throughout the month of may that residents were able to actually predict its 
appearance apparently one resident was able to get a color photograph of the object which she brought 
to the local sheriff's office and this object would usually appear over a particular water 
tower about five miles outside of the town where it would hover about 50 feet above the ground 
one of the really dramatic sightings occurred on may 13 1964 when an anonymous female resident 
said that she saw two objects both described as round and luminous and one of these objects came down and actually landed in a field and by this time many others in 
the town were seeing this object which appeared again to be attracted to this water tower at 
one point two teenagers saw this object and they took out their 22 rifles and actually shot at this 
object and they are sure the bullets found their mark as they could both hear a metallic twang 
as the bullets hit the metallic surface the object flared up in brightness but did not fly away and 
continue to visit the water tower regularly for the next two years and later in 1965 another 
encounter would involve nearly the whole town and would generate interest from air force officials 
so this is a case in which ufos were shot at but apparently caused no harm 
and that seems to be a theme that turns up in a lot of these cases another case is that of michael campiador on may 13 1967 campiodor was near saint george utah he 
was driving when he became aware of a strange humming sound he pulled over exited his car and 
looking up saw a huge object he said it was about 50 feet in diameter and hovering directly over him 
frightened he retrieved his 25 caliber pistol from his car and started shooting and as in the rio 
vista case he heard the bullets actually strike the target but again the ufo was not damaged it 
just moved away without any apparent harm another case occurred that later that year on july 19 
1967 when jack hill a 60 year old night watchman for the lumber consolidated company in wilmington 
encountered a ufo he was patrolling the grounds when he observed a 50 foot long metallic craft 
covered with lights hovering only a few hundred feet away to a shock the strange object 
zoomed straight towards him he took immediate defensive action his flight or fight instincts 
prevailed and as he couldn't flee he decided to shoot first and ask questions later he drew his 
service revolver and fired six shots in succession at this object and as jack hill says and I quote 
then the lights of the craft went out and it flew away so again the craft was apparently unharmed uh 
jack hill was very impressed and reported his encounter to the los angeles herald examiner 
a really harrowing case of a ufo shootout occurred on the evening of august 30th 
1970. this occurred at the funeral dam and power station in rio de janeiro brazil 
the main witness was a security guard by the name of almiro martens de freitas 
so on that evening elmira was on the dam itself when he saw a ufo hovering over the dam this 
object he said had about 15 port holes alongside the circumference they were shining blue and 
yellow lights and he quickly walked as close as he could to this object which was about 50 feet away 
fearing that this ufo would cause damage to the dam almiro drew his gun and fired twice at the 
object in response this object whined loudly flared in brightness and then struck almiro 
with a beam of light this beam of light caused temporary blindness and at this point elmiro 
fired one more time now he says he heard all three bullets hit this metallic surface of the object by 
this point other guards had arrived and also saw this object as it moved away elmiro was absolutely 
unable to see at this point and was rushed to the hospital and he remained blind totally blind for 
two weeks following this incident until suddenly his vision returned spontaneously 
a later investigation of the area where this ufo had hovered revealed that the cement dam 
below this object had been damaged the cement was now powdered cracked and pitted with holes 
this was not the end of the sighting a few days later on september 3rd the object made another 
appearance over the dam the guard on duty flashed lights at the object which quickly darted away 
and then three days later on september 6 the ufo came back for a third time and on this occasion 
six guards watched the object circling over the dam uh they had been instructed not to 
fire at it given what happened to almero and this object eventually moved away 
so yeah this is a case which shows what can happen if you fire at a ufo sometimes they will fire back 
thankfully almero's blindness was only temporary but there are many cases in which people have 
used normal handguns to fire at these objects another case occurred on june 26 1972 at fort 
beaufort in south africa police came upon a ufo and fired upon quote a glowing metallic object 
from only eight yards away 24 25 feet upon being shot at the ufo made a loud humming noise and took 
off and although the gunfire did seem to chase the ufo away it did not harm it here's another 
very interesting case which comes from researcher brian vike this occurred on a january evening 
in 1976 when two men were driving along a remote dirt road on their way to go coyote hunting in 
the desert outside of clovis new mexico ahead of them they saw a bright green light at low altitude 
they had heard of recent ufos in the area and they realized that they were seeing one for themselves 
they drove forward and were actually able to drive right underneath this object which they estimated was less than a thousand feet high they exited their truck 
to take a closer look and as brian vike writes and I quote since the men both had rifles with them 
the witness I talked to grabbed his 3006 rifle and took a shot at the object 
and believes he put a round into it as soon as the fellow fired and the 
impact of the shell struck the craft it immediately started to move straight north 
so these two men now found themselves hunting ufos instead of coyotes they hopped into their truck 
and followed this object as it moved towards the town of clovis new mexico and although they moved 
at top speed this object easily out distanced them until it was about two miles ahead they continued 
to follow it until they saw a police car up ahead with its emergency lights flashing and it was also 
chasing the object and as they watched this object shot down a bright beam of light 
which completely flooded the squad car with light this point the object darted upwards and was gone 
as brian vike writes he one of the hunters told me he sat quietly by because he figured 
it might have been a military aircraft and he just put a bullet into the thing not wanting to get into any trouble overshooting it also he mentioned he saw the object doing all 
these strange maneuvers he was glad he placed a bullet into it 
well he got lucky that this ufo didn't shoot back because as we have seen sometimes they do a very 
dramatic case of a ufo shootout with a jet fighter occurred on september 19 1976 over t ran iran 
and on that day a bright glowing object was seen by hundreds of people in tehran as it maneuvered 
over the city the iranian air force scrambled two f-4 phantom jets to chase this object and 
the pilot of the first jet lost instrumentation and communication when he approached the object 
the second pilot was general parviz jafari and he watched this object dart around for more than 
26 miles in less than a second and suddenly a smaller object separated from the larger object 
the smaller object headed directly toward jafari he instinctively fired at it immediately 
all the instruments in his jet failed the radio went dead and as jafari says 
i was very frightened he wondered if he was actually going to have to eject when suddenly his instrument panel and radio began working again and he was able to safely land 
this was a very dramatic incident as this ufo was starting over tehran people's windows were 
shattering I talked to a first-hand witness he said many many people saw this hundreds 
upon hundreds of people saw this it was a very dramatic display and shows what might happen 
during a ufo shootout the ufos will take action to disable the guns or the jet itself here is another 
very interesting case involving a ufo shootout this case comes from dolly safran who is actually 
the subject of my latest book symmetry a true ufo adventure dolly is a fully conscious contactee 
she's been on board ufos thousands of times has spent many many hours well years months really 
on board ufos and on one occasion she had a very memorable experience when she was on board a ufo 
she says on numerous occasions people have actually shot at the ufo when she was inside of it 
but one particular incident stuck out this occurred in the mid-1980s and as dolly says 
i was flying and we were coming down we were going to pick him up this was a gentleman and as always 
says I think he might have been our target he was outside and he pulled out his shotgun 
he picked it up and aimed it directly at us and I'm like hmm and I knew better than to panic or 
do anything like that I'm well versed at what happens to people when they shoot guns at us 
and it bounced it ricocheted and it hit him in the leg and according to dolly this ricocheted bullet 
actually pierced the man's upper right inner thigh the man dolly saw now was really just a teenager 
about maybe 17 years old she estimates he had a crew cut hair wore a t-shirt jeans high top 
tennis shoes and after this bullet hit him his expression which had been pretty determined and 
angry transformed into one of shock fear and disbelief and he fell to the ground screaming
this bullet ricocheted accidentally this was not something the et's did and as dolly says 
we had to pick him up and take care of it they had to remove the bullet and fix it and I think 
what they were going to do that night didn't get done because they were busy taking care of him 
he was also on board for a long time like a day or two before we brought him back and he 
was brought back within time do you know what I'm saying there was no time for him 
he didn't know at all what happened in other words his memory of this event was suppressed 
and he was brought back to within minutes of when he had first seen and shot at this ufo 
so probably not a good idea to shoot at this ufo 
after this man was taken on board the et's healed him of what is essentially a self-inflicted bullet 
wound and uh usually they will just beam a person back into their house on this occasion they landed 
and physically walked him back into his house and again this was not the only time dolly had 
been on board a craft when someone had shot at them normally on these occasions if the 
bullet strikes the craft it normally just pings harmlessly away but on this occasion the bullet 
somehow ricocheted back at the witness so this is what happens when people shoot at ufos and 
people have not only shot at ufos they've shot at humanoids and this can become even more dangerous 
and I think some people in these cases actually regret shooting at these ufos one early incident 
occurred on november 14 1954 over the town of isola italy when a local farmer watched as the 
cigar-shaped craft landed nearby and disgorged three small beings dressed in diving suits 
which promptly surrounded his rabbit cages fearing for his animals the farmer quickly retrieved his 
gun and aimed it at these invading dwarfs and at this point something very strange happened 
his gun became quote so heavy in his hands that he had to drop it 
the farmer now found himself unable to move or cry out and he could only watch helplessly 
as these small little beings took his rabbits and returned to their craft and as soon as it 
lifted off the farmer could move again he quickly squeezed off a round of bullets but the object 
was now too distant to have any discernible effect so probably the most famous ufo et 
shootout of all times occurred on august 22nd 1955 to the sutton family of hopkinsville kentucky 
on that evening one member of the family was outside when he saw a glowing object landing in 
a field behind the house he ran inside to alert the family and moments later the entire family 
saw a three foot tall humanoid creature with huge eyes ears and clawed hands approaching the house 
then suddenly several other of these creatures appeared at once and the alarmed family 
ran inside one of the creatures appeared on the roof of the house and actually grabbed 
at one of the family members at this point frank sutton the father of the family fired a shotgun 
through the screen door at one of the creatures according to frank it was a direct hit and the 
creature was knocked over by the blast however it instantly jumped back up and scampered away 
and these creatures continued to terrorize the family for the next hour or two until 
finally the family piled into their car and drove off to the police the police and the 
family returned to the location but at this point there was no evidence of the creatures 
the police left and shortly later the creatures came back the family remained locked inside 
their house while these creatures roamed around inside and finally left hours later 
this is a very famous incident in the annals of ufology and has been recounted in many 
ufo books and as always seems to be these the case these aliens were not harmed in any way 
by gunfire another very well known case involving a ufo et shootout occurred on september 4th 1964 
to a hunter by the name of donald shrum he and his two companions were hunting in the wilderness 
outside of cisco grove california donald trump became separated from his companions and lost 
and as evening approached he realized he was going to have to spend the night outside and knowing that there were bears in the area he decided he was going to climb a tree and 
spend the night there and shortly later he saw a strange star-like object in the sky 
it dropped down until it was very low and it quickly approached him and he saw that it was 
actually a craft with three strange panels on the side before long he saw a smaller craft which was 
ejected from one of these panels and this smaller craft actually dropped down and landed about a 
half mile away and it wasn't long afterwards that donald saw a strange figure approaching him he 
said this figure was about five feet tall helmeted with large goggles and wore a white uniform 
it came to work the area where shrum was uh in his tree and began to examine the manzanita plants 
and shortly later it was joined by another figure and shortly later after that four more figures 
at first they did not seem to notice donald but when they did this is when the shootout began 
a strange robot-like figure approached and began to emit noxious gas to try apparently to get 
donald out of the tree it didn't work though it did render him momentarily unconscious and donald 
tried to keep this figure away by throwing down burning matches and bits of cloth he actually 
threw his canteen at them at one point I did have the opportunity to meet donald shrum face to face 
i actually held the canteen in my hands which was really quite a interesting thing to be able to do 
uh he's a very sincere man I'm absolutely convinced this incident did happen there 
is in fact a book written about this incident by ruben uriarty and noah torres at any rate uh these 
this robot like figure was not discouraged and continued to try to dislodge donald shrum from 
the tree and fearing he was about to be abducted he took out his bow and arrow and began shooting 
this was a large bow and arrows 60 pound recurve bow with a 28 inch pull and a close range the 
velocity of this arrow is comparable to a bullet and as donald trump says I tried shooting the 
robot with my bow I just pulled it back as far as I could and I hit him the first time there 
was a big flash of light the robotic figure fell backwards about 10 or 20 feet and at the same time 
the uniform the uniformed humanoids retreated and scattered and as donald trump says I guess 
it scared them a little but it did not scare them off because shortly later this robotic creature 
returned donald shot two more arrows at it each time there was a bright flare of sparks as the 
arrows struck the metallic body of this robotic figure which again fell backwards several feet 
unfortunately the arrows weren't able to keep the robotic creature away and it returned each time 
luckily for donald however their technique to dislodge him from the tree did not work 
and eventually they left returned to their craft which joined the larger mother ship which took off 
shortly later upwards and disappeared and that was the end of that but it was a very dramatic 
hours-long shootout in which this hunter shot a bow and arrow at this robotic-like creature 
which again apparently did not harm it but was sufficient to keep it away from him some cases do 
have a real tragic ending such as what happened on august 13 1967 in the state of goyas brazil 
the main witness in this case is inacio de souza and his wife maria 
they had just returned to their home to see a giant object which they says was about 35 meters about a hundred feet in diameter which had landed on their property 
they described it as a strange object shaped like a basin only upside down 
and as soon as they saw this object they also saw three quote strangers that inacio first thought 
were nude however his wife maria thought that they were wearing tight fitting yellow suits 
these figures were all slender with bald heads and these figures immediately saw 
that they were being observed and ran straight for this frightened couple 
anacio d'souza told his wife maria to run inside and he took his gun and shot at the 
nearest creature at that moment they fired back and inacio was struck in the chest by a beam 
of green light and fell to the ground his wife returned and grabbed the rifle all three intruders 
then quickly returned to their craft which took off vertically with the noise of a swarm of bees 
following this incident anacio became quite ill he experienced extreme nausea and full 
body numbness his body felt burning hot and weak and his symptoms progressed and became 
worse finally he went to the doctor who said that he must have eaten a noxious plant 
or something anacia said no told the doctor about the ufo encounter 
which uh prompted the doctor to order more tests including a blood test and the doctor 
was shocked to reel to discover that this blood test revealed a condition very similar to leukemia 
and inacio d'souza was told that he had about two months to live and as the doctor predicted 
anacio his condition worsened rapidly he lost weight became sicker and sicker and in less 
than two months he passed away so yeah that's a tragic case somewhat of an outlier but it does 
show that perhaps it's not a good idea to shoot at ufos another case occurred in october of 1973 
and this involved a gentleman by the name of paul brown a car dealer from 
georgia who actually may have prevented his own ufo abduction this ordeal began 
as paul was driving late at night and his radio suddenly became filled with static 
at the same time a bright light lit up the interior of his car and moments later a strange 
craft about 15 feet in diameter landed ahead of him on the road paul brown skidded to a halt and 
watched as two creatures exited the ufo and began to walk towards him in his car and brown described 
described them in a quote they were about four feet tall they look like they were wearing silver 
uniforms including their shoes there was some elastic at their ankles and their suits were 
closed tight at the neck also they had silver gloves and their hair was solid white fearing 
he was about to be taken by these beings paul grabbed his pistol from his car and aimed it 
at the aliens these ets apparently noticed this quickly turned around returned to their craft 
and as they entered into this craft paul opened fire on the ufo which promptly took off 
so he got lucky in that case that they did not take any action back at him and just left the area 
also in october that same year on october 18 1973 truck driver eugenio douglas was nearing 
monty may in argentina when he was stunned and temporarily blinded by a bright beam of light 
coming from above as he pulled off the road he saw a glowing disc land on the highway and 
four things like shiny metallic robots exited the craft and moved towards them 
realizing that he was about to be abducted by these beings he grabbed his loaded revolver and 
fired point blank at the advancing entities the bullets however seem to have no effect on them 
as he said so he says I took off running across the countryside uh eugenio flood fled towards 
the nearest town and as he did this disc actually followed him swooping low overhead and as eugenio 
says and I quote each time that disc made a pass over my head I felt a blast of roasting heat 
by the time he made it to safety huge blisters had formed on his back so while this case is 
famous for the injuries suffered by the witness fortunately his injury injuries were not fatal 
and he recovered some people have not only shot at aliens but at bigfoot as well 
and a very famous case occurred in fayette county in pennsylvania in october of 1973 when the local 
police received a series of calls concerning ufos and three witnesses said they actually saw a ball 
of light land in a nearby field one of the witnesses with stephen meacham he was armed 
with a 3006 rifle and he and two friends went to investigate and upon approaching the area they saw 
two hairy creatures in the field so whether these were bigfoot or just hairy et's is hard to say 
because this does come in conjunction with a ufo sighting but at any rate stephen meacham fired 
three rounds of ammunition at them and it had no apparent effect though he is positive the bullets 
struck the creatures they turned looked at him but did not noticeably alter their pace 
the police were called and a single officer was sent to investigate stephen meacham and the officer countered the creatures face to face and again michael started 
shooting at them as stephen says and I quote I shot directly into the chest of the creatures 
it swayed backwards and then came right at the fence again the bolt did not seem to harm 
the target but as steven says I had to hit them but it didn't phase them they kept the same gate 
they never hurried so again we have cases where these bullets strike the creature directly but 
does not affect them a very similar incident occurred one year later on february 6 1974 
and again involved a bigfoot like creature this occurred near uniontown pennsylvania 
when a witness by the name of miss a heard what she thought were wild dogs she ran got her 16 
gauge shotgun and went outside and was immediately confronted by a quote seven foot tall hair covered 
ape-like creature standing just six feet away this creature raised both of its hands in a threatening 
gesture so the witness fired the gun into the creature's midsection and the creature reportedly 
quote just disappeared in a flash of light the witness ran inside and her son-in-law who 
was living next door called her on the phone she told him the story and he ran outside armed with 
a six-shot revolver and as he approached uh his neighbor's house his mother-in-law's house he saw 
shadows of four or five hairy people with fire red eyes that glowed he fired two shots at them 
to no apparent effect he ran inside and at this point his mother-in-law spotted a bright 
red flashing light in the woods a short distance away so this is again a ufo bigfoot case 
also involving a shootout in which the entities were not apparently affected by the guns so there 
are some very interesting cases in which people have tried to shoot at ets and were defeated by 
very mysterious means one such case happened in july 15 1979 to a couple in san antonio texas 
a couple cited three large glowing balls of light right outside their home and as they watched five 
creatures described as quote thin with grayish skin large hands and large oval-shaped slanted 
eyes descended from these balls of light the man ran inside and got his shotgun and at this point 
both the man and the woman were overcome with sleepiness later under hypnosis they recalled a 
frightening abduction scenario however at the time they experienced only a period of missing time 
after firing at these objects the next thing they knew they were waking up in the morning 
to find the shotgun completely dismantled laying on the kitchen table with all the parts spread out 
so evidently the ets had taken the gun and pulled it apart for examination and as usual this weapon 
had no effect and certainly did not in this case prevent the apparent abduction from taking place 
another ufo bigfoot shootout occurred again in pennsylvania 
at point isabelle in the fall of 1988. in this case three men cited a bigfoot like creature 
outside their farmhouse and they decided to go out looking for it and uh sure enough they 
came upon it one of the men arnold hubbard was armed with a 22 rifle and he saw that 
this creature was only 50 feet away so he quickly took his 22 rifle and fired at it 
he believes he hit it because this creature let out a quote hideous scream he fired two more shots 
at which point this creature became enveloped in a white mist the mist dissipated and the creature 
was gone another one of the witnesses larry abbott said and I quote the three of us searched the spot 
where the creature was shot that night we found no trace of it no blood nothing next day we checked 
the whole farm nothing so this is what happens when people shoot at ufos or for that matter 
et's or bigfoot nothing usually nothing happens the ufo will simply dart away though in a few 
cases cases they will shoot back I did cover most of these cases in my book not from here volume 
one except of course the case involving dolly saffron which is covered in my book symmetry 
so as these cases show the ets are very advanced to the point that bullets are probably 
not going to have an effect certainly not on their craft and very rarely on the ets themselves 
but at any rate I think these cases show that it's probably not a good idea to shoot at a ufo 
for one reason you're not going to damage it second there is a possibility that it will shoot 
back at you and perhaps even cause physical damage so that would be my recommendation don't shoot at 
ufos this is something our military apparently learned early on and reverse their policy 
and I think this is good advice don't shoot at them because sometimes they will shoot back and I 
think these cases show how truly aggressive humans are because in no case not one did the ufos shoot 
first it was always the humans who shot first and if the ufos shot back it was only in 
response so there you go this is what happens when people shoot at ufos or ets I think it 
shows more about us than about the ets themselves we are far more hostile than the ufos so that's it 
for today I hope you've enjoyed this episode once again I want to thank you for watching I truly 
appreciate it and until next time keep searching for the truth and more importantly keep having fun.
