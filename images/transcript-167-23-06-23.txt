"I WAS INSIDE A UFO!" TEN STRANGE TRUE CASES
Jun 23, 2023

Summary:
Jun 23, 2023
There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, and of course, onboard UFO encounters. Of the many kinds of UFO encounters, cases of people going inside UFOs are among the most fascinating. These accounts contain the most information and tell us the most about extraterrestrials and their agenda on this planet.

A wide variety of events occur inside UFOs. While there are patterns, each case seems to contain new and unique details. There are many different types of extraterrestrials. And there are thousands (or perhaps millions) of these cases occurring across the world. Yet still there are more questions than answers.

This video presents six fascinating true accounts of people who have been inside UFOs. Each provides profound insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon and ET contact, and shows exactly what it’s like to experience the closest of all UFO encounters.

CASE ONE: “THE SCENE THAT I SAW WAS HORRIBLE.” In May of 1950, Dr. Enrique Caretuno Botta was driving through the desert in Bahia Blanca, Argentina when he saw a landed silvery saucer by the dirt highway. Exiting his car, he walked up to the craft and saw that a door was opened. Curious, he entered the craft and was horrified to see three dead humanoids. He walked around and inspected the craft for about five minutes, but was freaked out and left. Returning the next day with friends, the craft was gone, leaving a pile of ash. But up above them hovered three UFOs. And Dr. Botta had his camera ready.

CASE TWO: “INSPECTED BY MACHINE-LIKE ALIENS.” Lee Parrish of Prospect, KY was 19-years old when he left his friend’s house at 1:00 a.m., on Jan 27, 1977. It was a short 7-minute drive home. But his journey was interrupted by the arrival of a UFO hovering over his car. He rushed home, only to find that he was missing 35 minutes of time. His eyes were sore and painful, the cigarette he was smoking was missing, and the electrical system of his car went haywire. Realizing his sighting was something more, he went under hypnosis and recalled being lifted into the craft where he encountered strange machine-like ETs who seemed very interested in him.

CASE THREE: “I CAN REMEMBER, BUT CAN’T SAY.” On the evening of Jun 20, 1977, Rachel Jones of Coeur D’Alene, ID woke up and found herself unable to move as a strange figure carried her out of her home. She blacked out and woke up with a bad headache and a weird mark on her shoulder. A short time later, while flying on a jet, she saw unexplained flashes of light and received a strange message of greeting. Realizing that something very strange was happening, she sought out hypnosis. She remembered being taken onboard a craft and undergoing a strange procedure, but she was compelled not to talk about it. At least at first.

CASE FOUR: “I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU.” On Sep 25, 1980, Elias Seixas de Mattos, his cousin Alberto Seixas, and their friend Guaraci Fernandes de Sousa took a thousands-miles-long road trip from Belem to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While on the road, Elias received a weird telepathic message. Stopping their vehicle, the three men encountered a large glowing craft ahead of them on the highway. They then experienced five hours of missing time. Later, under hypnosis, Elias recalled being pulled onboard the craft where he met a seven-foot-tall ET.

CASE FIVE: “SOME WILL BELIEVE YOU, OTHERS WILL NOT.” On the evening of Aug 7, 1983, Julio Platner was opening the gate of a ranch in Winifreda, Argentina when he was struck by a beam of light. The next thing he knew he was lying naked on a table inside a small round room, surrounded by strange hairless humanoids with round bulging eyes. The ETs told him to have no fear, that they had taken thousands of people beside him and would cause no harm. Then began a very strange examination. After a short conversation, Julio was returned, only to find that he was now 8 miles from where he had been taken.

CASE SIX: “WE ONLY WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.” It was a warm evening in Jul 1988 when Carlos Manuel Mercado was woken up by a brilliant light shining into his home in Betances, Puerto Rico. Opening his window, he was shocked to see three hairless humanoids with huge dark eyes standing outside his home. Initially frightened, Carlos was reassured by the figures, who led him outside to a landed craft. The UFO took off towards and nearby mountain range and then traveled underneath it to an apparently underground base. During this time, Carlos met with a tall humanoid who had a special message for him, and a request.

Practically everything we know about UFOs and extraterrestrials comes from the firsthand cases of UFO contactees. And there are now enough cases on record, with all types of physical evidence to prove the reality of UFO contact. These cases leave little doubt that we are being visited and that the Universe is filled with life of all kinds.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I call this one I was inside a UFO six strange true cases 
as you probably know I love all types of UFO encounters whether they're simple sightings 
Landings face-to-face encounters but I especially love cases in which people are taken on board UFOs 
I think these cases are the most interesting and I think they have the most information they really have a lot to say about who these et's are where they're coming from what their 
goals are on this planet and so forth so what I'd like to do is present six cases which come 
from all across the planet and stretch back decades up you know several decades of time 
and involves some really interesting and unusual elements there are a lot of cases out there that 
are very similar but I chose ones that I think have something unique to offer to our understanding of extraterrestrials and why they are picking people up so these cases I think are 
super fascinating I don't think they're very well known either and what I also like about 
them is they have a wide variety of evidence so we're talking in some of these cases medical 
evidence electromagnetic disturbances animal reactions physiological effects and so forth 
and frankly they're just super interesting really unusual and the first case is probably one of the 
most unusual and fascinating cases I have ever heard I don't know any other case quite like it 
I call this one the scene that I saw was horrible and this is a somewhat controversial case though 
researchers like Leonard Stringfield and Jim and coral Lorenzen stand behind behind 
it I don't think it's super well known but it's so unusual and interesting that I think 
it deserves to be more well known which is why I wanted to include it in this episode
this case took place in May of 1950 that's an approximate date it was around there and it 
took place in Bahia Blanca Argentina and yeah as I said this is one of the strangest onboard UFO 
encounters on record but the main witness is quite credible his name is Dr Enrique karatuno Bata 
he was a physician he's a professional architect a former War pilot and an aviation 
technician with a doctorate in Aeronautical Engineering so a very intelligent guy 
and it was in May of 1950 when he was in Bahia Blanca Argentina and was driving along a remote 
dirt Highway through a desert area some miles from his hotel in the town of General acha when 
he saw what he describes as quote a silver object resting on the ground not far off the highway 
so he was intrigued being an aviation technician he stopped his car and examined it and could 
see it was quite unusual he walked up to it and approached to about 150 feet of this object and he 
could now clearly see that it was a saucer shaped object with portholes around the perimeter of a 
sort of Tower or dome which was translucent and there was a door open and he could see this sort 
of reddish light pulsating at one second intervals in the interior and as Enrique says in his own 
words I stopped and I observed with attention the interior of the vehicle and I thought about the 
remainders of an airplane Fallen but the strange form of the object caused me to abandon this idea 
the clouds that passed intercepting the sun produced on the object a strange effect 
so this thing was so shiny it reflected the sky reflected the ground and it reflected his own image and shimmered kind of in the Sun 
and realizing how strange this was he says that a boyish kind of excitement filled him and when 
he saw that the door was open and he could see into the interior of the object he became even 
more excited but first he decided to take a little closer look around the outside of it 
and now this is translated from another language so the wording is a bit awkward but I thought it was important to quote him directly and as Enrique says in his own words 
before entering I began to examine the object in detail it had an approximate diameter of 10 meters 
which is 30 feet and was formed by two parts a bowl in the shape of a plate sort of a bell and 
another up a cylindrical Tower and covered by a dome on the Dome a strange round flashlight 
its total height would be of some 4 meters or 12 feet and there was an extravagant color of 
chrome of a polished magnificence in which my image was reflected and that of the sky 
it seemed a dead thing nothing of Life neither of noise neither of vibrations 
I thought the door that was open and exactly to the foot of the Tower I realized that the object 
was not new because the lower edge of the Bell was a little deteriorated and was rough in some places
so what Enrique did was climb this little ladder that was coming out from the base and peered 
inside the doorway and it was darker inside than outside so it took a moment for his eyes to adjust 
but he was absolutely shocked by what he saw and as Enrique says I smelled a strong smell of ozone 
and garlic I jumped immediately to the interior the spectacle that I saw was so strange that it 
surpassed the imagination so he's walking inside and the first thing he noticed was that the floor 
seemed to flex under his weight and the walls themselves had sort of a rubbery texture that 
gave under his pressure they looked completely metallic but clearly a weird kind of metal 
he says the cabin of this craft was perfectly circular and contained a series of thick 
windows that reminded him of plexiglass you also saw a series of vents in the floor 
and again I'll just let him describe in his own words what he saw as Enrique says 
my eyes were being accustomed to the lighting the scene that I saw was horrible in the center of 
the cabin a strange seat was found occupied by a man of 1.2 meters to 1.4 meters of height that's 
about four feet dressed with a combination of gray and Lead it had a round head with thin clear hair 
and was inclined on its chest the hands well-formed were of a color of clear tobacco 
and they were supported nervously on two handles or levers on a black box its face was of the same 
color as its hands the nose well-formed the lips without mustache the cheeks without hairs 
the eyes were large very dilated and delicate the forms were perfect like an adolescent of 
15 years but with the characteristics of a man it was not a dwarf I touched an arm that 
was stiff and the figure was cold the feet were slightly supported on two pipes set to the floor 
the clothes seem to be done of hard leather and was inflated in the shoulders giving the pilot 
the aspect of a player of rugby the seat was of an adequate form to its body and of a color of 
red vermilion and it was born by a central axis so he's saying that it basically spun around 
and there was this little black box he said in front of the pilot which looked like a panel with dials much like a radio there were strange symbols on it like numbers but clearly not numbers 
and also what looked like a TV screen which was active and showing rays of light moving around 
so he's looking around this and he sees other people in there as Enrique says the 
most impressive spectacle was other two identical men lying down on two extensive comfortable seats 
on each side of the pilot and against the wall dead persons the eyes were open and terrified 
the ajar mouths and a little inflated but why was the third seat empty this really concerned him 
and as he says I touched it and I verified that it was of a very smooth weaving The Disappearance of 
the member of the crew evidently leaving the door open began to worry me over the box of instruments 
on board I noticed a transparent sphere of 25 centimeters in diameter surrounded by a flat ring 
and climbed to 40 degrees on the horizontal one and seemed exactly to the planet Saturn just as 
is seen in a telescope so he's describing this floating sphere it appeared to be rotating it 
had a little edge around it and giving it the appearance of Saturn though it was transparent 
this is a really interesting detail because this does turn up in other onboard accounts 
and at this point he looks up and he notices a blinking globe of light on the ceiling 
and this caused him some concern because he realized that this craft which he initially thought was not operational was in fact still operating at least partly 
and he was also quite concerned that there were only three pilots and there were four seats and with the door open he was wondering where this fourth figure might be 
and he was you know frightened enough at this point that he decided it was time to get out 
of there he looked around the cabin one more time and then exited the craft and as he stepped out he 
slid off the edge and onto the ground he had an attack of vertigo he says it was only then that 
he realized that the atmosphere in the craft was quite different from outside inside it was heavier 
and hard to breathe so he berated himself at this point for not having brought his camera 
and he decided that what he was going to do was quickly return to the city where he was staying at a hotel get a camera and return to the site with some of his scientific friends so he gets 
in his car and his car just barely starts he says it was if the battery had been drained 
but even once it started the engine was sputtering and it took him a little bit to get the car going 
and as he drove off the engine quickly returned to normal the farther away he moved from The Craft 
so this is a very interesting electromagnetic effect so in town he told his friends who were all 
shocked and at first disbelieving but they could see that Enrique was very much serious by this 
point it was quite late and there was a storm so they decided to return back to the site early the 
next morning which they did and as Enrique says we sought the apparatus and we could not find it 
the ironic Expressions began to be shown in the face of my friends who and when called 
our attention to a pile of Ashes approximately two meters of height and 5 meters of diameter 
that was found exactly in the place where we had seen the saucer the ashes had a silver red color 
so yeah his friends are kind of looking at him with surprised to see this huge pile of Red Ash 
which was exactly where this craft had apparently landed Enrique actually reached down and touched 
the ashes as did a few of the others and they were warm and they turned their hands green at 
least for a little while but one of them looked up into the sky and this is when they saw UFOs two of 
them one was quite low and the other was higher up but they were identical in appearance to the 
saucer that Enrique had seen on the ground the day before as Enrique says one of us raised his 
eyes to the sky and observed a saucer identical to which I had seen that flew over us at a height 
reckoned about 600 meters so that's not very high up that's about 1800 feet quite low that's when 
they looked up and saw another craft and then looking higher up they actually saw a third 
craft and this third craft was much larger larger it was cigar shaped and as they watched these two 
craft entered the big cigar-shaped craft which then took off at thousands of miles per hour 
now Enrique did have a camera and so he started snapping pictures of these objects 
as they're flitting around he managed to get four pictures only two came out and you can 
see here a pic a photograph of the UFO that he took before it went back into this cigar-shaped 
craft this is the best photo apparently and was published later in a newspaper article 
so this case does not end here immediately following this incident Enrique developed a 
pretty severe fever and his skin blistered he was quite unwell 
here's another interesting fact he was wearing glasses when he had gone on board this craft 
and there was a burn mark around his glasses so his skin was red he had blisters on his skin 
and a fever and this lasted for several weeks he was quite ill he was examined by numerous 
doctors who couldn't determine the cause they did test him for radiation but this came out negative 
so this was quite a profound experience for him which he kept secret only telling one 
or two people for a long time but finally did Grant an interview for a Venezuelan newspaper 
and he later agreed to share his story with crash retrieval expert Leonard Stringfield 
and in a in a letter to Leonard Stringfield he described again what happened I think 
more succinctly so although this is a little repetitive I think he described what happened much better and I'd just like to quote him directly about this whole experience 
from beginning to end it's quite short as he says in his own words the object was resting 
on the ground in an inclined position the disc was 32 feet in diameter the surface was slippery and 
brilliant the height was about 13 feet the Tower with Windows was six feet high while the interior 
of the craft was seven feet high three little men were seated in soft armchairs they were dead 
one of the three the pilot I believe was seated in the center of the Tower 
in front of him was a large panel with bright instruments his hands were resting on two levers 
there were about four feet in height in appearance they were human equal to ourselves with eyes nose and mouth the color of their hair was gray Chestnut cut short 
their skin was bronze their faces were dark they were dressed in overalls of a gray lead color 
there was one chair vacant of the four I touched the bodies which were rigid 
in the tower there was a smell of ozone and garlic in the roof of the cabin there was an intermittent 
small light of orangish whitish color it was very strange there were no cables no pipes only the 
panel of the controls and above the panel there was a small sphere within a circle to the right 
of the pilot there was an apparatus similar to a TV screen I remained five minutes in the tower but 
the absence of the fourth person impressed me so much that I went out of the machine very stunned 
the next day I returned with two Engineers but we found only a pile of Ashes very warm
so yeah Leonard Stringfield was very much impressed by this report and he did include it in his book situation read the UFO Siege also Jim and coral Lorenzen they some years earlier 
in 1955 actually August 1955 they published a summary of the case in the apro bulletin 
so yeah what a case as you can see that is a very unusual case of what appears to be a UFO crash 
and as unusual as it is I think it matches up with a lot of other cases involving that same 
subject that same area of ufology it's a case that is always stuck in my mind so I'm really 
happy to present it to you today and here's another case that I think deserves to be well 
known because it's really unusual I call this one examined by Machine like aliens 
people report all different kinds of ETS as we see and some people do report robotic like 
entities but I can't say I've ever heard anyone describe quite like what this gentleman describes 
who witnesses Lee Parish this case comes from apro the aerial phenomena research organization 
and it's just a really unusual case with psychic phenomena electromagnetic disturbances medical 
effects multiple Witnesses so I think you'll find it quite interesting this case occurred in January 
on January 27 1977 in Prospect Kentucky the main witness is Lee Parish he was only 19 years old 
when this happened and at the time he worked as a truck driver for his family business Parish Supply 
and one evening January 27th he was driving home from a friend's house going West on Highway 329 
he was about four miles east of us-42 and he was smoking a cigarette this is an important detail 
as we'll see when he saw a weird object hovering about a hundred 150 feet just over the tree line 
off to the side of the road he said it looked almost rectangular it wasn't that big it was 10 
feet high and about 40 feet long and it glowed so brightly it was hard to look at it hurt his eyes 
but at the same time he says he felt compelled to watch it and this was weird to him because he's 
driving at this time he doesn't know how he didn't drive right off the road but about 15 seconds into 
the sighting his car radio mysteriously failed and as he's driving he suddenly realized this 
object was directly overhead he did not see it arrive it was just suddenly there it was 
totally silent and the next thing he knows it's immediately accelerating away at very high speed 
so when he arrived home he noticed four strange things actually it was his mom who noticed the 
first strange thing and asked him what's wrong with your eyes and this is when he looked in 
the mirror and he saw that the whites of his eyes were very badly bloodshot and painful 
the second strange thing is it was now 145 A.M Lee knows that he had left his friend's house 
at precisely 1am because they just watched a TV program and it had ended and he lives close to 
his friend's house it's only a seven minute trip so he was missing 35 40 minutes of time 
the third strange detail they noticed was that the cigarette he was smoking was missing it was 
just completely gone they don't know what happened to it and the last thing that they noticed which 
was a little bit later that following this encounter the jeep that he was driving was 
malfunctioning badly the whole electrical system went haywire and needed considerable repair work 
so these are all interesting bits of physical evidence and the case was eventually reported 
to the aerial phenomena research organization and Lee Paris Parish after much trepidation 
agreed to go under hypnosis to recall the missing time he was really nervous about it 
but the same time he really wanted to know what had happened during this missing time 
so he was hypnotized by a hypnotist by the name of Lawrence Allison who worked close with the 
lorenzens and under hypnosis Lee relived the sighting and it was quite frightening for him 
he who was saying over and over again what is it and it's not moving so the light was so bright it 
was hurting his eyes which I think is why we see the red inflamed eyes afterwards this is 
one of the most common physiological fat effects then he says he felt quote something in his eyes 
and the next thing he knew he felt the Jeep itself being pulled up into the air 
and suspended there and next he felt himself pulled from the jeep through the closed door 
and he found himself in a circular white room it wasn't very large about 20 feet in diameter 
with 20 foot high ceilings but it puzzled him because the UFO that he had seen looked smaller 
than that so it looked larger on the inside than it was on the outside another interesting detail 
he said it was quite cold inside the craft and the entire room seemed to rock and sway 
back and forth much like a boat on the water it's another interesting detail 
so he was standing there unable to move and in front of him he saw three quote beings that 
he felt were alive sentient but it was odd because they looked very much machine like 
as you can see here in the illustration one was black it stood on his left side and was huge about 
as high as the ceiling he described it as having a flat bottom one sort of arm a featureless head 
and it seemed kind of rough-skinned and it moved towards him so this was mobile and it touched him 
on his back and left side causing an uncomfortable sensation of hot and cold sort of burning and pain 
now there were others the red figure was on his right it was about six feet tall close to 
his height also kind of rectangular and really reminded him of sort of a Coke vending machine 
it had one sort of arm it approached him as well it was moving touched him on the shoulder 
and right Temple right above the ear he felt a minor stinging sensation it didn't hurt as much 
as it did when the black one touched him and there was another figure the third one which was in the 
center in front of Lee also about six feet tall it had a very blocky structure sort of a squarish 
flat head no real features but he said it glowed and it appeared to have arms but did not make any 
movements and Lee had the distinct impression that this Center White figure was in charge 
so after the two others had touched him they moved off and the white one started to emit this rhythmic scraping sound and at this point Lee felt a warmth 
pass over his body all three beings moved back and suddenly disappeared 
so he was sort of alone there in the room at this point and he had the distinct impression that the 
reason he had been taken on board was so that they could check out quote his chemical makeup 
and he also felt that they were curious about quote the way that he was Lee 
so he thought were interested in his identity the next thing he knows he's about being floated 
back into his Jeep sat down in the chair and then the Jeep itself floats down to the ground 
now here's what's really interesting investigators learned that at 10 30 PM this is about two and a 
half hours before Lee's encounter a family who was about four miles distant from the encounter 
location had also seen a large white disc shaped object with a dome right outside their home 
so there was a whole investigation into all of this and Lee told investigators that he did have 
an interest in the subject prior to this encounter because he had seen UFOs several times before 
and on those occasions he had always been with other people and he wondered if the fact that 
he was driving alone on this occasion was a factor as to why he was taken on board 
he also said that he had a strong interest in psychic powers and it actually exhibited 
them on a few occasions for example turning on and off light bulbs by 
just thinking about it something which was verified by the people around him 
now Lee's mother also said that she had seen and heard actually a UFO hovering very low very close 
in their backyard it was making this loud sort of humming whirring noise she ran out and saw it 
so if this is an important fact because these things do track families 
and finally investigators did more researching and learned that there had been in fact a third 
sighting the day before only a few miles away from where Lee had had his encounter 
so there's quite a bit of corroborating evidence to this very unusual case I think you'll agree 
that was a very unusual case but with all the evidence surrounding it I think it's 
absolutely a legit case and just really unusual with the description of these entities that this 
gentleman saw I really wonder where he is today I suspect that he's probably had more experiences 
given that he's seen UFOs many times that his mom saw UFO very close up in the backyard as we know 
this is often with contact tease a generational phenomenon so I suspect there's a lot more to that 
case than is presented here but yeah a really unusual case that deserves to be better known 
and now we move to the next case which has some equally bizarre elements to it and I call this one 
I can remember but can't say I like this case for a number of reasons the witness was able 
to converse with the ETS I think it's got some real Credence to it because it was investigated 
by Dr Leo sprinkle who is a scientific researcher one of the first mainstream scientists to really 
take a good hard look at the UFO phenomena as far as I know the first to actually hypnotize 
people to remember missing time and it's a really interesting case in a lot of ways this case took 
place on June 20 1977 in Coeur d'Alene Idaho this one involves a woman who wants to remain 
anonymous she's been given the pseudonym Rachel Jones and it was just before midnight on June 
20th when she woke up to hear someone coming up the stairs into her apartment she first thought 
it might be her friend but it wasn't because she found herself paralyzed and unable to speak 
and it was dark inside so she couldn't really see who this figure was other than that was humanoid 
and it was wearing a bluish suit and she felt herself being physically lifted up 
and she apparently blacked out because the next thing she knew she was awake in bed and it was now 
about 2 A.M later than it had been and she woke up the next morning with a very severe headache 
so she kind of just tried to ignore this and push this out of her mind at first but it was 
one week later while flying from Coeur d'Alene to Dallas Texas that she looked out the window 
of the plane and which wasn't heavy cloud cover and she saw two distinct weird flashes of light 
and she had a real strong impression that this was the UFO sending her a quote kind of greeting 
and it wasn't long after her experience in her apartment that she noticed this weird healed scar 
on the back of her left shoulder so Leo sprinkle heard about this case he agreed to investigate 
the case and place Rachel under hypnosis he also inspected this Mark on her body as Leo says in his 
own words I saw her in my office and examined the scar on her back near the left shoulder the SCAR 
or whatever it is is circular to Elliptical in shape with some Central radiating lines 
which form a star-like pattern the border is well defined the lesion measures 10 by 8 millimeters 
and is essentially flat I don't know what it is it very definitely is unusual in its appearance 
and looks like healing secondary to an injury rather than something that would go unnoticed 
so Rachel as it turned out turned out to be very resistant to hypnosis 
and over and over again she kept saying I can remember but can't say 
so this is sort of a block that many people experience with their missing time amnesia 
but Leo sprinkle was very skillful with hypnosis and very persistent and with his guidance Rachel 
began to explain what had happened to her she said that this being came into her room had an 
unpleasant sort of ugly appearance she said he was almost bald had ears like a little baby tiny 
little ears that his mouth was just a line and he had no pupils in his eyes so very dark eyes 
and she remembered that he carried her and somehow transported her not far from her home to an area 
called Vernon's Lake and it was there that she was taken through a doorway into an enclosure 
with metallic walls sort of like brushed aluminum she said it wasn't super shiny it was sort of dull 
and this is clearly the interior of a craft because she said it was very bright oh she 
noticed no direct light source she saw that there were three others in the room 
two who looked very much like the figure who took her and one who looked much more human 
she was quite cold until this human looking figure grabbed her hand and then she felt much warmer 
and she's lying there in this room and a door opens and this is when 
she can hear a humming sound and what she described as in quote up right wheel 
it looked metallic it reminded her of some sort of surgical instrument and she actually began to 
walk towards it but the human-like figure stopped her and he telepathically told her sit down please 
so she obeyed she was getting a little bit nervous at this point because this surgical instrument was 
concerning her and she began to wonder what the name of this human looking figure was 
and the figure said Siobhan she repeated chauvar and he corrected her he says no Chauvin 
it's interesting that he provided his name so Siobhan asked her to take off her shirt 
now she didn't want to but Siobhan explained that they only wanted to examine her skin 
she was resistant to this she was kind of upset but finally she agreed and took off her shirt 
and Siobhan was examining her and seemed quite puzzled by her Tan Lines apparently 
not understanding what they were so she explained what her tan lines were the next thing she knows 
she's finding herself laying on a table on her stomach as a warm light shines down on her back 
and this is when she felt a painful burning sensation and she yelled at Siobhan to stop 
now he immediately raised his hand and the pain instantly stopped 
but she was pretty mad about it and she asked him are you going to let me go home 
and he was kind of Silent at first but replied eventually I didn't mean to harm you 
and he told her that they had quote made a change that would make her better for others 
uh they're not sure exactly what that means but this is sort of your typical examination in 
many ways at this point the three smaller figures entered the room again she asked this taller human 
looking figure will we meet again and he said yes and the next thing she knew she was back in bed 
so I don't know if she's had repeat encounters I I suspect she has but it's a pretty interesting 
case with medical evidence and other weird details I do think there's a lot more to that 
case also than we're hearing here I wish I knew who the witness was she is anonymous but yeah I 
think it has some very interesting things to say about what it's like to be taken on board a UFO 
and now we move to the next case which is super interesting because it does involve multiple Witnesses three Witnesses in fact and some very unusual effects and I call this one 
I want to speak with you I like this case because it began in a very unusual way again it involves 
three Witnesses has some really unusual what we would call electromagnetic effects effects on 
automobiles and machinery and so forth and just some interesting messages as well this case took 
place on September 25 1980 in conseso Brazil it was around 10 30 p.m on September 25 1980. 
when three men were on a road trip traveling from belem in Northeast Brazil to their home 
in Rio de Janeiro the three men were Elias satius dematos he's a truck driver 
guarassi Fernandez de Sousa he's a photographer and Elias's cousin Alberto sejas Vieira 
now Elias was driving when suddenly the truck headlights began to malfunction blinking on 
and off by themselves and at the same time Elias felt this weird coolness on his neck 
almost a liquid coolness and he heard this voice speaking telepathically in his mind 
saying Elias I want to speak with you so this kind of freaked him out he told his 
others that he was going to stop the truck as something very strange was happening to him 
and as he stopped the truck this blue beam shot down from above and struck the hood of the truck 
so they stop they get out of the vehicle and looking ahead of them on the highway they can see this fiery red cigar-shaped object it's quite far ahead of them about a mile they 
estimate it's right on the road and it was blinking this powerful white light active 
now Alberto the youngest of them was quite frightened but the other two men they had 
heard of UFOs they really were interested in what was happening and wanted to move forward 
Albert Alberto begged them not to but no the two other guys moved forward and in fact guarassi 
who had a camera and was a photographer did manage to shoot about eight seconds of film 
which according to the researcher who examined the film shows only this little white light 
at this point they thought of moving forward but then realizing that they knew about other cases 
of people being taken on board these crafts they became frightened and decided to retreat back to 
the truck and they continued on their Journey but became some concerned when it seemed that 
their trip was taking far longer than normal they kept driving and driving and they just 
were not arriving at their destination at this point of course the UFO had gone 
and when they finally arrived at their next stop they were shocked to find that it was already 4 30 
A.M and this was about five hours later than they thought it should have taken so when they go up to 
fill the truck with gas Elias was shocked to see that they hadn't used only one liter of gas over 
a length of 143 kilometers which he estimates would normally have used about 20 liters of gas 
so that is very strange things became even stranger the next day when they drove from 
Bello Horizonte to Rio De Janeiro this was a trip which should have taken about 20 hours 
but somehow it took just over half that time about 12 hours they could not explain that 
and as they arrived at the gentleman's various homes other weird effects began to occur 
they were dropping guarassi off at his home and there was a car parked in front of guarassi's 
house his wife's car the car headlights began to Blink on and off by themselves 
and when they arrived at Elias's home the hood of the truck which they were having problems with lifted up by itself and then slammed down twice by itself 
and there was a third very strange effect before this encounter Elias had a cyst on his hand that 
had been there for quite some time well now it was gone the cyst was missing so they knew something 
very strange had happened to them all these weird effects the missing time of about five hours 
so they reported their case which was investigated by a prominent researcher by the name of Irene 
granche and Dr Silvio Lago decided that he would would hypnotize the witnesses 
now Alberto he was too frightened he declined to be hypnotized he didn't remember most of this trip 
but Elias and guarassi did agree to be hypnotized so guarassi was placed under hypnosis 
but there was some sort of mental block and hypnotists just couldn't get any information 
from him no matter how hard he tried so next Elias was hypnotized Elias remember being the 
one who had the telepathic message I want to speak with you and Elias was a good subject 
under hypnosis he relived seeing the reddish cigar-shaped object ahead of them on the road 
and then he felt a strong spinning sensation and found himself floating head down stuck to the wall 
of this giant egg-shaped room and it was weird because the strange Force kind of slid him down 
the wall to a small set of steps which led to a circular room where there were tables and he saw 
a man standing there in the room this man had his back to Elias and was maneuvering multi-colored 
levels on this sort of panel this man says Elias was wearing a tight-fitting rubber-like yellow 
uniform with a belt the room itself was pure white so Elias approaches this man and says 
I'm afraid what is this the man didn't reply and it's at this point that Elias felt his arms become 
limp and he was at least partially paralyzed and as he tried to walk forward he felt this invisible 
barrier preventing him from moving any closer to this strange figure and it was then that this man 
turned around and looked at Elias and Eli saw that this one that was not a human as we would think of 
it he was humanoid certainly but Elias saw that this man was actually about seven feet tall very 
tall had lilac colored eyes with no visible pupils a long nose a large lipless mouth and pale skin 
so I'd probably say that this was a tall white now there was a window and the man instructed 
Elias to look out the window and he saw these very large spheres and a field of stars so it's 
possible these were planets it's really not stated in the report but it looks like he's somewhere out 
there in space so it's pretty rare to find a multiple witness onboard UFO case this one has 
three I think that alone makes it worthy of study and attention and there's always I mean there's 
so many cases like this these are just six of thousands upon thousands and the next one I'd like 
to cover I find also very interesting and I call this one some will believe you others will not 
I find this case interesting for a number of reasons in some ways it is your standard 
onboard experience involving a gentleman who has taken on board and physically examined by 
ETS but some of the descriptions of the interior of the UFO are quite unusual 
and also the aftermath is very interesting it's also a very well verified case in that he passed a 
lie detector test and there was medical evidence and other aspects to the case that I think 
give it a high level of credibility this next case occurred on August 7 1983 in winifreda Argentina 
and it was around 7 30 p.m on August 7th when Julio plattner who owned a livestock feed 
store had just driven up to his employer's Farm Ranch and he was opening the gate when 
his UFO experience began and I will just let Julio describe his experience in his own words 
as Julio says and I quote I was suddenly taken aback by an intensely bright light 
accompanied by a strange sound it was as if a Lori were coming towards me 
I covered my head with my arms and after that I do not remember anything until I awoke inside a room 
when I awoke I found myself lying on an operating table and I discovered four beings around me 
two were beside me at the top of the table one clasping my shoulder with his hand 
in front of me about two meters away there were two more beings a man and one woman 
I moved my lips asking where I was and what they wanted but no sound came out nevertheless they 
seemed to understand me one of the figures began talking and said telepathically don't be afraid 
we would not harm you what you are experiencing now has happened to thousands of people before 
you can reveal it if you wish some will believe you and others will not 
so looking around him Julio inspected the room he sort of had kind of cushiony walls that was 
his impression there were beige in color he saw no doors or Windows the room was pretty small it was 
round in shape about nine feet across and at this point he did notice that he was wearing no clothes 
he tried to sit up but felt as though he was being held down by an invisible force 
nevertheless he felt no fear as he says I felt very calm and comfortable the temperature inside 
was quite Pleasant I was not afraid I looked around and gathered as many details as possible 
once the woman came close to me and put her hand on my wrist but I did not feel it 
then they put a strange artifact on my left arm with some kind of tube about 30 centimeters 
long half rigid half flexible and they took some blood they didn't use any rubber band or needle 
but I could see how my blood raised inside the tube up to the middle when they stopped 
I tried to touch the being at my back but I struck something like glass I tried to stand 
up and my forehead struck another glass it was as if I were inside a glass cube 
now Julio says that these beings looked humanoid there were about five feet tall 
hairless with short noses a small mouth and small ears flattened against the head 
he says their eyes were their strangest feature because they were very much circular and bulging 
each of the more skin tight gray white uniforms and they acted very business-like they weren't 
really emotional just getting a job done and after the exam Julio was instructed to stand up 
and when he did he got a shock because he does not remember his clothes being put 
back on him but he was now fully dressed and even his watch was back on his wrist 
there was a sudden flash of light and he found himself sitting back in his van now and looking 
around this is very weird he saw that he was eight miles away from where he had just been taken 
so this case was examined thoroughly and in fact afterwards Julio was Exempted by his physician Dr 
Adolf Pizarro who you can see here and the doctor said and I quote in my professional opinion there 
was an extraction of blood or some material I have treated him for six years and I can declare that 
plattner has always been calm sound and sane he's well respected and in ideal citizen I have to give 
kudos to that witness Julio plattner for Having the courage to step forward allow his own name 
to be used and really tell everyone that this is what he experienced and I think given the fact 
that he is well respected in his community and has other Witnesses who corroborate his sincerity 
and honesty and there's a lot of reasons to believe that everything he says actually happened 
it's a great case and here's the last case that I'd like to present and this one has got a number 
of really fascinating elements to it and I call this one we only want to show you something and 
I love this case because it started out with the witness being quite frightened but as soon as he 
actually meant the et's face to face and started to talk to them his fear evaporated he found 
the whole experience quite benevolent and really interesting and the things he was shown and told 
are just super fascinating that's why I really wanted to include it in this compilation this 
case took place in July of 1988 in Betances Puerto Rico the main witness is Carlos Manuel Mercado 
was a hot July evening and Carlos was unable to sleep because of the heat so he got out of bed 
he was sleeping with his wife in the bedroom and went into the living room which he thought might 
be a little cooler so he's reclining on the couch and after a few minutes he noticed this 
white light outside and heard a strange humming noise he didn't think much of it until he heard 
a tapping sound on the metal shutters which were covering his windows so he gets up and opens the 
shutters and this is when he got an incredible shock as Carlos says in his own words there they 
were three little fellows standing there under the window it shook me because they were so different 
they looked a bit like us but they weren't human they were little chaps as I say and 
ugly with heads a bit bigger than ours and no hair they had no ears and their eyes were huge dark 
I could see no noses on them just little holes and a little slash for a mouth 
their faces looked flattened their skin was sort of grayish and their faces and hands were covered 
with little bumps or lumps you know how acne looks well it was like that they were ugly there were 
about three to four feet tall they were thin and dressed in overalls like Mechanics wear from top 
to toe and of a sort of grayish creamy looking color a sort of Sandy shade only their heads and 
hands were not covered by clothing so he first felt a considerable fear seeing that these guys 
looked so different but it was then that these apparent ETS began to talk to him telepathically 
and they said do not be afraid we're not going to hurt you and only want to show you something 
at this point all of Carlos's fear completely evaporated and he had a very strong impression 
that these beings were very good people with good intentions and meant him no harm whatsoever 
and as Carlos says they asked me to come out so I opened the door and I went out 
then two of them took a hold of me one on each arm and took me out up the road and it was then that 
I saw the machine it was one of those saucers of theirs was standing there on the ground besides 
the highway 101 right on the corner opposite my house so he describes this craft as you can see 
here the craft was round with a cupola on top the cupola had windows that were all lit up the rim 
of the craft was lined with a rainbow he says of colored lights the craft itself stood on four legs 
a ladder extended below it and the beings instructed Carlos to climb inside 
which he did and inside Carlos saw weird machinery panels with controls and little lights you saw 
other short beings there working on the panels and there was also another being inside who was 
much taller and looked very much more human he did have gray skin but it was smooth he had a 
large head and dark eyes but yeah much taller and he was dressed in sort of a robe or tunic 
so at this point Carlos heard a loud a loud hum he could hear the landing legs retracting and 
looking out the portholes he saw that the craft was in fact rising up and to his surprise the 
craft began moving towards the Sierra Birmingham mountains specifically to one mountain called 
the Monte El cajillo so he was shocked to see this craft with him in it heading directly towards the 
mountain and he was scared it was going to crash right into it when suddenly the mountain seemed 
to open up a tunnel appeared and this craft went inside the mountain to a very large Cavern inside 
it was huge and the craft lands and he gets out and he can see all these other craft there 
and as Carlos says the tall being told me to come out with him and he made me put 
on a sort of big enormous dark spectacles so that I could see everything down there clearly 
it was all very well lit down there you couldn't see where the light was coming from but it was 
very brilliant light very white all the walls there were covered with a very shiny silver metal 
so this huge Cavern was filled with short little ETS very much like the first ones he saw I think 
probably we would call them grays but this taller gray explained to Carlos that they've been there 
for a very long time they want to stay there they told Carlos that he was contacted because 
they wanted him to tell others that they have no bad intentions they have no desire whatsoever to 
harm humans or conquer humans or anything like that the being said that ultimately they would 
like to interrelate with humans but that it was our authorities who were causing the problems 
with this that our authorities don't want that so Carlos protested to him to them that he was 
just an ordinary guy and nobody important and why were they telling him but the ET said that that 
didn't matter that they had taken many people down there and given them the same message 
and that was the gist of the whole encounter was quite short Carlos was then taken back into the 
same craft which left the cavern the same way it had come in through what appeared to be a tunnel 
he said it was amazing because the mountain just opened up and then closed back up and there were 
trees and rocks and bushes and you just could not tell where he had entered or exited this mountain 
and it quickly landed back to the exact location where he had been taken 
they escorted him out of the craft back into his house and told him that one day they would return 
and they left and as Carla says it was after they had gone that I began to get nervous 
this thing which I have told nobody happened to me it left me too shaken it wasn't something bad but 
had a profound effect on me I'm still waiting for them because I'd like what happened in my opinion 
they aren't bad I could feel it if they had wanted to do me harm they could have done it when they 
took me I'd like them to come back so that I could go with them again they aren't bad people 
so he was very vehement about that because at the time there was a lot of press coverage about UFOs 
and his he says his experience was absolutely benevolent so there you go those are the six 
cases I wanted to present today six cases of people being taken on board or in the first 
case going on board himself uh really interesting cases and I think you'll agree they do have a lot 
more information than a simple sighting or even a face-to-face encounter people get to see what it's 
like inside a UFO and as you can see there are amazing similarities and some really interesting 
differences as well I think it's very interesting that in the vast majority of these cases we do 
see humanoid ETS though that one case with the machine like ETS that's off the charts an outlier 
I've never heard anything quite like it but again these cases do have a lot to tell us about the 
ETS these are my favorite cases it was probably no because I've written books 
about these ones called inside UFOs another is called onboard UFO encounters and several 
others like wondrous and of course symmetry all of which are all about onboard UFO encounters 
so I hope you've learned something today I hope you found this interesting and I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and like I always like to say keep searching 
for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun till next time bye
