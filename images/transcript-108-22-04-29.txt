ALIEN BOOKS
Apr 29, 2022

Summary:
Apr 29, 2022
It may sound strange and unusual, but there are now several documented cases on record in which people have met ETs, been taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft and shown an alien book. It doesn't happen often, but there are more cases than you might think.

One very well-known case is Betty Hill, who was taken onboard a UFO with her husband, Barney in 1961 in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. While on the craft, Betty was given a large book, filled with alien symbols in long narrow columns.

Another famous case is Betty Andreasson, a lifelong contactee from Massachusetts, who was given a thin blue book with glowing white pages, and was actually allowed to keep it in her home and study it for a short period of time.

These cases are not unique. A fascinating case involving an alien book comes from Jeff Selver, a Canadian businessman who has recently and courageously stepped forward to reveal his encounters with ETs. During an onboard UFO encounter at age sixteen, he was handed a "mystic book" and told to study its contents. The book was filled with deeply spiritual messages that would alter the course of his life.

Researcher Richard Boylan Ph.D., reports on the case of "Mike," a contactee from northern California. While onboard a craft, Mike was shown a book with a strange alien symbol on the cover, was instructed to read it, and was told he would remember the contents later in life. The alien book ended up having a profound influence on his life.

Researcher David Jacobs Ph.D., also reports on an unusual case in which a young girl was taken onboard to meet with a human-ET hybrid. They both sat down and read an alien book together.

This video presents nearly a dozen firsthand cases of people who have been given alien books by the extraterrestrials. Several of them have never been published before and are revealed here for the first time.

Perhaps the most interesting and extensive case comes from Dolly Safran, a fully conscious contactee from Florida who has only recently stepped forward to reveal her lifelong contacts with extraterrestrials. In a live firsthand interview, Dolly reveals her experiences with a sapphire-blue ET book which she has studied for countless hours while onboard the ET craft.

What do these books look like? Why are contactees being given these books? What kind of knowledge do these alien books contain? And most importantly, how are they affecting those who have had the fantastic opportunity to read them?

This video answers all these questions and more, and provides a study and comparative analysis of these very unusual events. Told in the witnesses' own words, with witness drawings and firsthand interviews, the secret messages in these alien books are finally being revealed.

If you would like to explore more about the most extensive case of an alien book on record, check out my book, "Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure," which presents the lifelong UFO encounters of Dolly Safran. Now available!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a brand new episode of ufos in the 
paranormal I've got a really interesting and unusual episode for you today I call it alien 
books and this may sound unusual but I have collected about a dozen cases in which people 
have been taken on board a ufo and have been handed an alien book these cases are really 
interesting there are a few which are well known but I think you probably haven't heard of most of 
these and at the end of this video I have a very special treat for you with a first-hand interview 
with a witness who has actually held one of these books so that is what this video is about today 
i think it has a lot to say about the ets and what they know and their agenda and so forth and 
it's just really fascinating stuff so let's get started and the first case I want to talk about 
is of course the very famous betty and barney hill incident this took place in 1961 in the white 
mountains of new hampshire when betty and barney hill were taken on board this is the first 
publicized ufo abduction case and what many people don't know is that betty 
very nearly got to take home an alien book and she certainly got a good look at it this happened 
right at the end of their experience and betty was about to go and exit the craft and she tried 
to get this book and she almost got it and I will just let betty say in her own words what happened 
i started talking with the leader and I said to him that this has been quite an experience it 
was unbelievable that no one would ever ever believe me and that most people don't know 
he was alive and that what I needed was some proof that this had really happened so he laughed and he 
said what kind of proof did I want what would I like and I said well if you could give me 
something to take back with me then people would believe it so he told me to look around and maybe 
i could find something I would like to take and I did and there wasn't much around but on the 
cabinet there was a book a fairly big book so I put my hand on the book and I said could I have 
this the leader agreed and betty picked up the book she said that the writing looked unfamiliar 
and appeared to go up and down in columns she says it had pages it had writing but nothing 
like I had ever seen before I opened the book and found symbols written in long and narrow columns 
i had never seen anything like it it was different I don't know because it was I mean I couldn't tell 
even though I have seen japanese written it had sharp lines and some were very thin some were 
medium and some were very heavy it had some dots it had straight lines and curved lines and the 
leader laughed and he asked me if I thought I could read it and I told him no I laughed too 
i said no but I wasn't taking it to read but this was going to be my proof that this really happened 
that this this was my proof and so he said that I could have it I could have the book if I wanted it 
and I picked it up and I was delighted I mean this was more than I had ever hoped for 
and I'm standing there and I'm saying I had never seen anything like the book and that I was very pleased that he had given it to me and that maybe some way I could figure out in time how to read it 
so betty held tightly onto the book as the et's continued to ask her questions she was shown the 
familiar star map that apparently shows zetta reticulum finally the experience comes to an end 
and betty and barney are being ushered down this ramp towards their car and betty was literally 
about to exit the ufo when suddenly the et's changed their minds and as betty says I'm ready 
to go down the ramp when some of the other men not the leader but some of the other men are talking 
i don't know what they're saying but they are very excited and then the leader comes over and takes my book and I say oh I'm furious and I said you promised that I could have the book. 
the alien replied I know it but the others object betty said this is my proof and the leader replied 
that's the whole point they don't want you to know what happened they want you to forget all about it 
betty said you can take the book but you can never never never make me forget about it because I'll 
remember if it's the last thing I do so at this point betty and the ets are arguing about whether 
she would remember the experience she she was told that she would be made to forget that he of course 
objected and as we now know she did eventually remember unfortunately she didn't get the book 
so that's betty hill's experience with an alien book and wow what a shame she 
didn't get to keep it that could have changed the course of ufo research unfortunately it did not happen but it's certainly not the only case and in fact there 
is another very well known abductee contactee who actually did get to keep the book and take it home 
and read it over a period of weeks and this lady is of course betty andreason 
the very well-known contactee from ash birnham massachusetts she's had a series of books written 
about her case by raymond fowler and betty's case is very very extensive and what I'd like to talk 
about here of course is her experience with this et book and uh this occurred in 1967 is when her 
first major experience happened she's a lifelong contactee but in 1967 a ufo landed in her backyard 
several et's came into the home and betty was taken on board and she actually gave the et's a 
book her very much cherished bible and in exchange betty was given a thin blue book to keep at her 
home at least temporarily and I'll just let betty describe this incident as she says and I quote 
i glanced down and I picked up the bible that was on the end of the table I turned and I passed it to the leader the leader passed me a little thin blue book in exchange 
i started to look the little blue book and the first three pages are snow white luminous white 
and I saw this silver gray top thing with like coils and there was a sort of a wheel and inside 
were four things I can't make out what these things are at this point everyone in the house 
her family had been put into a sort of trance-like state that betty's daughter becky however did wake 
up and witnessed what was happening so she saw this first hand and as she says 
it looks like a clay man a clay man talking to my mom some kind of man creature my mom was standing 
there with her hand on something and that clay form had his hand on the other part like a book 
that book was bright and mom was thanking them for something so it must have been the blue book
so at this point betty is taken on board has a long involved experience 
and she was returned to her home and the et's reminded her again of the blue book she was told 
that it would be hers quote for a time and that she should study it and she asked the ets why they 
had given her the book and the e.t replied it is given to you for a while to grasp as much as you 
might grasp from it there is writing there that will be discerned only through the spirit and it's 
the writing of light it can be understood only through the spirit the other writing that is upon 
that is for man to seek and find out there are formulas and riddles and poems and writings for 
man to understand nature for he too is nature he is formed from love and love is the answer for man 
so following this encounter betty put the blue book in the closet and went to bed and after 
the abduction she was told that she would forget the incident and she did she forgot much of what happened though she was left with the partial memory of the et's entering 
into her house and taking her into the ufo and she did remember being given this blue book it 
was three days after the incident that she first took it out and examined it and she even showed 
it to her daughter becky she said I'll I'll show you and as betty says I did take the blue book out 
i just see us she's sitting on my bed and I'm going to the closet there's a noise in the kitchen 
so I put it back and I closed the closet and I went out into the kitchen and I told her shush 
just of wait a minute honey I'll be right back I went out into the kitchen and it was just 
jimmy and mark coming in for a drink of water I went to get the book again and I showed becky 
i told her now don't tell anybody will you honey because it's very important it's from jesus 
becky's face just lit right up she was beaming and she was so happy and excited over it she said 
that's what they gave you mommy I remember that's what they gave you 
so betty was a little bit nervous about showing off this book because the ets had told her specifically that it was for her alone and that it quote must not be seen by any that were not worthy 
because it was for initiation and becky was too young to go through too many things yet in order to see it it was a book of initiation of mysteries and of everything that is 
it is because of things I have gone through and yet have stood fast I was supposed to look at it and grasp as much as I could possibly grasp for the future
so later nine days after the uh initial encounter that he locked all the doors sat down alone to 
examine this book more closely and she says I was just at the kitchen table there and I was opening 
the book there is something there on the cover what is it it's like in the very center it's very 
thin thin gold it just looks egyptian according to betty this book was about 40 extremely thin pages 
one side of the pages had strange printing and symbols and the other side was a glowing white 
as betty says there is strange writing in it and numbers the first three pages were just white 
light glowing there's all sorts of symbols one comma dash like a curlicue of some kind a sweeping 
under and a circle there are two lines close to each other with a kind of rounded line on top 
like you know with two sides a zero with a dot and some kind of line on an angle going through that 
with the little flag type thing on the line there are diamonds with a dot in the middle 
there's something like a staff and there are arrows there's something that is on an angle 
it's a rectangle on a side and it goes out a pyramid but a strange type of pyramid it 
has a shoot on it and it has an arrow some type of arrow it's all strange all strange it's like 
uh take off things for an airplane or something like pyramids with uh it's just hard to explain 
there's a mechanical thing that I could draw it is mysterious because of the strangeness of it 
after just over a week betty discovered that this book was missing and she could only assume 
that the et's had taken it because they had told her it was hers for just a short period of time 
but she did get to examine it closely she saw these e.t symbols as betty hill did so it's another really interesting case of an e.t book 
and perhaps an even more interesting case comes from a gentleman who has just put out a new book 
his name is jeff selver and his book is called the rising it's a very interesting book 
jeff selver has had ufo encounters his whole life and he writes about them in this really 
interesting book and in 1993 at age 16 he was taken on board and did in fact see a buck 
this is in the town of coquitlam in british columbia in canada 
and jeff was walking home one day and he was confronted by a gray e.t he got a really 
friendly feeling from this gray who told him come into our ship we'll bring you right back 
and jeff agreed and he was pulled on board and inside the graves began to speak to him about 
his life about what would happen to him in the future about his relationships with his girlfriend 
and so forth and was told that he would be working with them if he agreed to do so and he did 
after this he was physically examined had some medical procedures he had a very 
powerful and profound spiritual experience involving his higher self and past lives and 
future lives and this sort of thing and after this he was taken to another room where he was allowed 
to see a quote mystical book he was showed the book by one of these et's who we called the elder 
and he was told to touch it and as jeff says and I quote I opened it up and I could see their script 
and it glowed a metallic blue abstract red and yellow 3d holograms came out of the pages 
seeming to represent ideas that didn't make much sense to me 
there was a feeling that what was happening was spiritual or ritualistic she said look at the book 
i didn't understand I thought for a second but I can't read this then as I stared at the book it 
became hypnotic I could feel it had a mystical power then startled sections of the book began 
entering my mind like my brain was a vacuum or a hard drive and it was being downloaded into it 
at the time I was just a recipient of those strange and fascinating events happening around me 
unclear how they were coming when it was done she slapped the book closed she then brought her left 
hand up to my right temple I could feel a psychic force bury the book deep in my subconscious 
it seemed the state I was in allowed this book to go deep inside me she said this will be for later 
then she put the book back at this point his onboard experience ended and he was returned 
though of course more would follow throughout his life and much later in life jeff selver actually 
remembered the contents of this book and in fact he devoted the last chapter of his book the rising 
to what he learned from this mystical book and it's very very interesting I won't go all into 
it you'll have to read the book but I will say that it was about various spiritual issues such 
as how humans are much more than their physical body how spirituality and psychic development 
is really important how to achieve the state of levitation and more there was a section about 
god the divine source time and house eternal and the human connection to all these things 
it talked about the power of imagination observation and perception and how the universe is 
made of light colors and shapes we talked about the power of consciousness and the holographic 
nature of the universe talked about the power of love how to heal oneself and others so a lot of 
very deeply spiritual and profound subjects really interesting so this is the theme that seems to be 
turning up in a lot of these et books and another case comes from ufo researcher richard boylen 
in his book close extraterrestrial encounters this is one of the first books to sort of portray the 
et contact experience in a very positive light and this case involves a gentleman by the name 
of mike from northern california and in 1968 at age 11 mike was taken from his backyard into a ufo 
on board he saw grays praying mantis-like ets and what he described as plump human-looking 
beings he was physically examined he had a medical procedure and at one point he was 
handed a book and I will let mike describe in his own words as he says one of the plump 
beings walked over to me carrying a velvet bag he reached in and took out a thick large black book 
the book had rows of three chinese type bright orange letters and I was told that the book was 
the quote book of truth and I had wha I had known well its contents but I had forgotten 
a number of ideas about the book burst into my head that I have still not been able to decipher but I believe the contents were about the balance of the universe love of all things 
the peril of earth and coming changes I was then told I would remember the contents of 
the book when I turned 33. I was told that they had come to me because I was sort of their family 
they turned over the book and showed me a bright orange symbol that looked like the sun its rays 
swept by the wind and they said if I were to ever get lonely I should remember the symbol
so that was his experience with this et book and as the years passed mike had more experiences he 
grew up he was interviewed by richard boyland uh in his 30s and by age 36 he did remember 
some of what this book contained or at least he felt like it had influenced his life as he says 
and I quote I have felt a greater understanding of natural events and have had what I would consider 
a heightened spiritual view of the world it has been much easier to balance my work and 
fulfill my interests in all things spiritual so he's saying this in reference to what he thinks 
he learned from this book but he can't say he specifically remembers any passages in detail 
but it's certainly a very interesting case of another person who has seen a book on board a ufo 
and there are other cases another somewhat different and really poignant case comes 
from researcher david jacobs phd in his book the threat he tells the account of a lady who 
he's given I think it's a pseudonym carla and at age 11 carla was taken on board to interact 
with another hybrid half human half e.t child about her own age this was something that carla 
had experienced a number of times and on this occasion carla was taken to a room 
where she saw a big pile of books and this little hybrid girl took her to these books and opened one up and started sharing it with her and as carla says 
there's a lot of books all different books for different kids different ages stacked in piles 
and so carla sits down with this hybrid girl and they start looking through this book 
and carla can see it's a picture book like a children's book there's writing and there are pictures of what appear to be typical earth-like scenes 
kids with their families animals dogs in the park as carla says and I quote of kids and older people 
and animals they have pretty big writing and pictures and she really likes to just look at 
the pictures she just turns the pages and she's showing me the pictures that she likes the most 
which seem to be the ones with kids and parents in the park or something and there's a dog running around and she's amazed carla really got the sense that this hybrid child 
wanted to live on earth and felt kind of sad that she hadn't experienced these things 
carla did her best to comfort her so it was really quite a poignant experience for carla as carla did 
her best to explain what earth life was like so there's another very interesting case of et books 
in this case it's different from the others in that these et books are mostly about life here on earth so I did find other cases when I started doing research on this 
i put out a call on facebook on social media asking if anyone had had this type of experience 
and I got some very interesting responses uh as for example one lady 
karen is her name replied positively and I'll just read what she wrote she says yes I was shown a 
book on two different occasions or two different experiences I can share the first one with you 
i was taken on aboard a craft and was told to sit and wait and I didn't know why when a tall off-world being walked up to me and told me to come with him he was 
similar looking to a nordic with shoulder length hair and wore loose fitting clothing 
with a gold sash type cloth wrapped around like a belt which I thought was pretty 
i felt no fear we walked to an area where you could see a long ways out like a viewing screen 
which had rows of records like a library would that went on a long ways he picked up a book 
which was thick and had a brown leather looking cover which was aged and the book had a lock on it 
and he wanted to tell me about the book but I was not allowed to see the pages he said names were in it and it was a record of life and I asked if my name was in it and he said 
i needed to live out my life and many things were to come about on earth like earthquakes 
and events that we had to go through he had an aura of peace and love that I never felt before 
and I didn't want to leave he said I had to go but to remember I have the keys of the kingdom inside 
me so that's one case and another very interesting case comes from a contactee by the name of sky 
and I will just quote um from sky directly in a dissection I was guided through during 
one of my abductions they showed me a book the book played a holographic video tutorial 
on how to dissect the creature I was working on with oddly written words within it 
so this contactee was actually doing a scientific experiment which involved the dissection of an 
animal very much like kids do in school here on earth and as the witness says I remember stating 
that I didn't want to hurt any life-form and and wanted the least painful and invasive way 
of dissection they handed me a large book think of photo album book size the pages were thick 
and a very light gray almost white color when there was a picture all 
i had to do was focus on it and it played a holographic black and white video tutorial 
on how to extract dna from the being I was working on there were many pages my abductors didn't say 
anything to me they just watched me as I watched the tutorial and waited for me to complete my task 
so those are some of the more interesting cases I heard from people on social media though I did get 
some other responses what was really interesting is a lot of people did remember being handed a 
book and reading it but couldn't remember what was inside this is what happened to a lady by the name 
of leah who says I have been given a book on board a craft twice now I don't remember what was in it 
at all it was a brown and thick book another lady by the name of lynn says yes in my room on the 
starship I had my own book that I read I felt cozy reading it I would lay in bed with it it seemed to 
be in different lettering but I understood it I can't remember what I read only that I enjoyed it 
and a third case comes from a gentleman by the name of brian and he writes that he saw a book 
and that it was quote large photo album large or more book standard rectangular was on a desk 
in a room of light it was always occupied by one entity a benign presence if ever there was 
it appeared as like the desk had not been noticed initially the book appeared on my last encounter 
my experiences would soon be drawn to a close in that era of the 70s he drew a line on it and I cannot emphasize enough the anxiety
so those are the cases I was able to get from people after requesting if anyone had had this 
experience but the reason I wanted to do this video is because of a lady by the name of dolly 
saffron dolly is the subject of my latest book symmetry a true ufo adventure dolly is a fully 
conscious contactee and when I started talking about e.t books like the betty andreason case 
in particular but betty hill and the others I asked her if she had had this experience and she 
said yes she did and I did write about this in the book and I'd like to just tell you a little bit 
about what dolly experienced according to dolly the ets do have a huge library of knowledge and 
they do have actual physical libraries and kindle like electronic devices which she says and I quote 
it works off of your mind it listens to what you want and it will get it over to you they love to 
read reading is a big thing but it's mostly real scientific astronomy is a real big thing of mine 
i always like to figure out what star system I'm in and how it correlates to where I'm at so I read 
a lot of those I look at a lot of those I look at a lot of maps and coordinates and things like that 
but what's even more interesting is that dolly says she has her own alien 
book that she has read many many times was given to her when she was a very young girl 
she has her quarters on the craft and that's where it stays in this little cubby hole 
and I'll just quote dolly what she says about this e.t book because it is so interesting 
as dolly says it's a fairly hefty book it's mine when I'm up there and I've had it most of my life 
it is a book of not laws but morality and common sense it has a lot of sayings in it 
it has the philosophy of the universe in it it has understanding and wisdom and aphorisms to look up it's a weird book because it can change I don't know how to 
explain it because it's not always the same book with the pages in the same place at the same time 
you can read one thing and go back and still have questions and it will elaborate it will 
keep going with you until you get it it will even show you pictures of things and it's not metallic 
but it's iridescent blue beautiful like a sapphire well not a sapphire but like one 
when I was ever in trouble and they would give me dead air like stare at me hard like what the 
hell what did you just do and it was up to me to figure it out sometimes I consulted the book 
i was so at a loss that I'd go look what the hell did I do it had lessons about life in 
it that are profound and other things in it that are elemental things how life works and 
it never ends I've never read it cover to cover I've never been able to I don't think you can 
and I think it changes whenever wherever you're at it has pages but they're not typed on like we have 
each page is iridescent opaque light like glass movable soft glass it moves I've literally 
seen something up here on the page and I keep thinking it's something like a computer they have 
it's like go back to school and figure that one out it's a type of computer that's an aid and the 
cover is the quality of sapphire like a gem you think it's metal but it's not it looks like a gem 
like sapphire according to dolly this book is about eight inches thick about the size of a 
large encyclopedia however when she first saw it it was much smaller just an inch or two thick 
and over the years it has grown in size as dolly says I will tell you this I've had that book my 
whole life it has changed my whole life and it may have actually gotten bigger during my lifetime I 
think it was smaller when I was younger and it's bigger it will play music too if you think a song 
you want to hear something and you want to hear the music it will play you'll hear it 
dalia was of course forbidden to take any objects or artifacts off the ship with something she never 
even considered trying but one day she did think about taking this book home and boy did 
she regret it as dolly says I tried to once it was not helpful to try and it got taken from me 
i made it home with the book and it went poof so that was the end of that I never tried it again 
it's still on board in my quarters next to my bed like a little cubby and it's in the cubby
the et's told her that she's never to take that book uh away from the ship that it could 
be very dangerous in the wrong hands as it contained a lot of very important information 
and uh they kept it away from her for a little while but did eventually return it to her so 
now what I'd like to do is actually play you a little interview I just did with dolly in which 
she reveals even more information about this book and her experiences with it so here we go 
hello everyone I'd like to introduce you all to my friend dolly she's the subject of my new book 
symmetry and today we're going to be talking about her experiences with an alien book 
and for those of you who don't know dolly she's a fully conscious contactee has been since age 
14 her encounters began really before age one and are still continuing today 
it's quite an amazing story and for those of you who've read the book symmetry 
you already know some of this for those of you who haven't this will be new for you and yes we're going to be talking about the alien bug so hi dolly how you doing 
I'm really good I'm here so thanks for doing this I'm super excited because every time I talk to you 
i learn new information and we did do a little section on this alien book in the book symmetry 
but I'm sure I'm gonna find out some new stuff today so yeah if you could just tell me a little 
bit about when you first uh read this book and what it looks like and that will start there 
okay um my first my not subconscious memory that I sort of regained as I got older was the first time 
i saw this book it was in recorders and it was laying on my bed when I entered and I was probably 
about eight eight and a half nine years old I remember staring at it and thinking what is this 
um I sat down next to it on the bed I put my hands on it and I immediately realized that this book 
was psychic and that it had something to say to me um I opened it it's quite large it's about
a yearbook size a little bit bigger than a high school yearbook very heavy and um the 
front of the book looks like a sapphire an opaque zapper the whole front of the book 
wow it's quite beautiful um when I opened it it had thickness to it you know and I laid it aside 
you know the cover I laid it open and inside I saw immediately that the book was radiating light
and my name was on the next page it is it is not my name dolly I am not called dolly by the ets 
um I'm going to tell you something that you know but nobody else knows and that is my name is aura 
and uh and that was the name on the front of the book aura wow 
thank you uh I was shocked just I realized this is my book and I was quite excited I thought oh 
you know and I thought it would be like a dire at first it's the first impression I got from it and it's uh very far from that um I started turning page after page and what I started seeing 
were things that some things I knew and it was elaborating on and then some things that I didn't 
already know and the it moved the writing moved it gave me 3d pictures that gave me 
music it gave me a different strange visual effects um it was very very very cool 
so can we back up a second when you say like these pictures move was that like 
you know film like true life pictures yes yes it's like watching tv sometimes 3d tv uh it they lift 
off the page they lift up like holograms oh wow and they are quite uh interesting uh some things 
i saw from my past some things were teaching me what I missed you know that I didn't understand 
some things were current current events in my life and world per se uh 
when I was very young everything pertained to a moral issue good versus evil right versus wrong
karma different uh elements of how would you feel if things like that it was very psychological in 
a lot of respects and it was teaching me to be present emotionally morally spiritually present 
those were some of my very first lessons so you said you said you saw words were these like in english writing uh no no um I speak uh swedish uh as well as english dollars and uh uh 
i so I was reading swedish quite a bit um oh wow so it was in swedish 
yes yeah they have a language as well and I have I don't remember learning the language 
but I know the language and uh it would speak to me sound bites in the language of the grace 
and uh so I would hear that from time to time so is that out loud or telepathic yes telepathic 
i can hear it telepathically um everything everything I hear telepathically is I hear 
it like I hear you speaking but it's telepathic there's nothing going on around me I can hear it 
all right these pages where they thick is paper no they were thicker all right um they were very 
substantive in other words they had a little bit of weight to them and but they were flexible uh 
which amazingly it's sort of like silicone in a weird kind of way photo uh photo celled silicon 
if if you've got to feel the inside of a craft the walls feel like that too they're thick they have 
subs they're substantive they're not they're not like a regular wall that you've ever felt and um 
so kind of like that like a photo album some you know photo albums had that kind of thick thick 
plastic like sheets wow very very interesting how many pages would you say it was if you had 
when I was very young there was probably about 50 pages in it uh I never actually counted them and 
they're not numbered so I don't know exactly that was another question I had were the numbered no 
no number they would multiply as I got older though I mean it got thicker and thicker and 
thicker and depending on what I had to remember or what I was studying it stayed there until I 
accomplished it and then it would disappear and something else would show up this book 
rearranges itself constantly it's constantly adding or detracting according to what I need 
and I'm constantly learning so if I'm thinking about something it will add it in for me it knows 
what I'm thinking so yeah yeah well that leads to another question I had this is interesting because some of the other people that I you know found cases that I'm doing in this video 
um describe similar things but uh one thing I'm interested in is you know this this book is interacting with you to some degree does it have a consciousness is it 
aware I mean how does that happen is it in itself alive in some way I mean you know what I'm saying 
yes okay this is complicated and this is somewhat my opinion but I think I'm talking from knowledge 
uh ets interact uh obe all the time uh they go out of body they have access to the akashic library 
uh they have access to the online they're constantly interacting with the universe's mind 
they have all their minds as well I think that every single being in the universe has a book and I think it originates in the 
akashic library and I think that they have the ability to facilitate you to your book 
um I've spent time in the akashic library and from time to time I see my book there 
it manifests there somehow and uh remember I told you there's a big tree 
when you first walk into the library and it's full of gems and stuff like that and I sit under that tree a lot I love it it's like I i meditate under it it's my spot 
and it has shown up in my lap a couple times and then left after I finished my obe 
um I've never seen it anywhere else manifest like that if I'm on a different craft it will follow me to the next craft I don't always fly with tolada sometimes I go other places
all right and it'll show up it follows me so so on that vein um talata by the way for those of you 
don't know is the ship dolly flies in that's his name he's alive and uh is one of her main contacts 
so so this book will actually appear on the other ships you don't have to carry it with you 
no no you can I mean you could pick it up and walk around with it to be sure it's tangible 
okay but it shows up it somehow manifests into another area it's like they're sending it to me 
somehow I don't know it it has the ability to do that yes I think what they're doing is they're 
sending it through a light uh door in other words they you know how we transport quantum you know uh
interdimensionally I think that they send it to me that way I they know where I am and so they bring 
it to me all right so when you're on the craft and I mean it's normally in your quarters have you ever shown this book to other people on the craft mama I've actually sat with it in my lap next to 
mama and talked to her about it um I do not take it with me when I'm flying uh it does not it's 
i can't uh that is not an appropriate place for it to be um one time when I was 
out of the galaxy I was out in you know across the universe pretty much uh I was on a planetoid you 
know like a dyson sphere and uh it manifested into my room and I was reading it and I forgot where I 
was and I walked in to go eat and I had it with me when I was eating and um just sitting there 
reading it and other people were like watching me nobody talked to me about it but they knew that 
i was in my lap and they kind of left me alone with it um it was my impression from them that 
they knew exactly what I was doing they knew exactly what it was and they gave me my space 
so wow very very interesting okay so could you describe the cover again because it's you said 
at one point it changed actually so it's like sapphire is that metallic or you said it's like 
a no a jewel it's a like a real jewel like a real gemstone it is weight like one too it's very thick 
and it's opaque it's not a clear see-through gem it's kind of opaque but it shimmers with light you know there's light in it somehow and it fascinates the whole you know what enemy I mean 
uh the book itself has over the years uh become very personal to me the binding of the book is uh 
somewhat identifying of me um it has a scroll work at the top you know like little lines 
and then my initial s is the there for my last name and then on the binding itself are criss 
crosses that have blades sword blades broadsword blades on it um three down it's three of big 
two blades each you know opposite each other going down the binding of the book that means 
something to me um and then on the back of the book I'm really interested in dragons I love 
dragons I have been fascinated them my whole life and um I was reading when aragon came out 
it was a blue dragon and it did something to me my heart just melted for this beast okay 
and I loved it I mean I fell in love with this blue dragon and I had the book one day and I flipped it over to look for something in the back and 
there on the back was a beautiful beautiful blue dragon and it was gorgeous I mean just beautiful 
you know over the top and down the side of the book with little uh markings down each 
two sides of the you know at the bottom and on the side little squirrel works and I was like look look there's a blue dragon and and it the book sort of like settled to me it's 
this will be here for for as long as you want it to be it's yours it's your dragon and I was like 
and it's still there I've never asked it to leave I love that blue dragon yeah oh that's amazing 
now betty andreason she also described a blue book with white glowing pages and symbols and 
she was able to take it home or they yeah she they gave it to her and said you can keep this 
for two weeks don't show it to anybody she ended up showing it to her daughter becky who 
also confirmed and saw it so I understand you tried to take this book home yeah at one point 
yeah I was about 17 years old and I was leaving the craft and nobody was really paying attention 
to me and I had it on my chest I was cradling it and I was just being very nonchalant and 
i went out the door to grab an energy ribbon that drops me to the ground and uh I hear nope 
the book disappeared out of my hands I was like dang it and I was like no
i asked mama the next time I went up why why can't I take my book home and they said that uh I lived with very nosy people and uh no and I can only imagine I have 
my idea about who would be the nosiest and that was the end of that no it was not going 
into my environment no and did you get at all in trouble for that I mean did they yes 
yeah well I did something without permission I thought about it I implemented a plan to do it 
and I had to come up with uh understanding why that was not okay you know I kept the book away 
from you for a little while yes one whole month no book that was excruciatingly bad
yeah so so for those who don't know mama is a tall gray and sally's main well one of 
your main contacts her and talata all right gosh very interesting that reminds me of uh 
some crash retrieval accounts where uh you know from government whistleblowers who tried to move 
stuff out of the ufos and were not able to do it it would disappear and go back inside yes 
yeah well the ship was telling it to come back yeah yeah no you don't stay outside no
so cool so does this book have like it's is it does it have fictional stories in it or is it all 
true non-fiction non-fiction uh they do not spin yarns uh sometimes they will sing songs about 
our yarns they will tell about our fictional characters they will relate stories about us 
in that context but they're telling a truth about what we think and that's the whole point 
they only tell the truth they only explain things as they truly are history is very 
important to them and I have learned all kinds of history from them but they never 
ever ever lie they are incapable of it so you won't ever get non-truths or stories 
so they don't entertain themselves that way so when you're looking through this book is it uh are there sometimes only words are there always words and pictures and the whole I get I get um
sometimes I get almost like a poetic um oh god how do I explain this
talata would teach me through poetry he would write things to me he would write words to me that would touch me okay he was very good about doing that mama would sometimes send me 
messages that way especially if I was forlorn about something or frustrated she would use 
words that I emotionally attached to humans are very emotional in their talking and their thinking 
and so that's when words would show up explaining things in detail mostly mathematics would show up 
i could write in the book if I needed to if I was working out a problem 
astronomical symbols things like that yes well very interesting you know of all the accounts I 
was able to find on this I think the one from jeff selver matches yours the most 
because he talked about how it had holographic images and taught spirituality and morality 
personal stuff and stuff that also related to the world and the universe very cool 
very cool so I suppose at times you're reading it can be quite emotional for you 
yes very very very um we're emotional creatures so are they and uh they teach morality through 
uh understanding from the point of of uh unconditional love 
and if you break that if you if you walk away from it or if you do something that is demonstrative of you not understanding that concept in that particular arena whatever you're 
doing they will give you an emotional go-to to bring you back into line with it emotions 
are very important yes very cool so can you share just you know to kind of wrap this up one of your 
favorite things that you've seen in this book I know there's a lot that's probably a hard choice
that is that's a really hard choice um I did a needle point to this because this is the one 
set of words that uh gripped me completely gripped me they showed me a picture of the known universe 
not like our pictures where you see a micro uh shot of one teeny tiny section of the universe 
they actually brought it all up into view to me and showed me a huge watch chasm wide chasm of 
the what the known universe actually looks like now understand that if there's not a lot of dark places between the galaxies it's very full and it's got a lot of stuff going on 
uh one of the things that amazed me was that there is um plasma dust that's very thick between our 
universes and we touch each other plasma filaments like we're all connected like a neural net okay 
and uh it astounded me and mama wrote the words and then she said the words 
and basically it was a poem and it it was the one that's to see the world in a grain of sand and 
eternity an hour and that one and it went straight into my chest I i I was like you know it it 
connected me to everything in one second literally that fast and I bawled like a baby I went down 
on the floor sat there rocking and crying like I've never done in my entire life and it it made 
it made it changed me I went in that moment from being a child in my thinking 
to be an adult I understood in that moment exactly what it all really was and where I 
placed in it and how bloody incredible it is I mean just incredible uh there are no words that 
i could give you that would tell you exactly what this means to me I found the needle point for it 
and I needa pointed it and it's still in this house with me I never framed it but I have it in a drawer and I look at it from time to time um I showed it to you it is um 
very significant to me yes very beautiful very poignant oh thanks so much for sharing this dolly 
do you have anything else you'd like to add about this incredible alien book it's so cool um 
every single human every single entity everything all entities across the board 
have a book it is at your disposal it is probably sitting in the akashic library 
and if you want to learn how to go get it you need to meditate learn to obe go to the library and ask 
and I'm pretty sure it will be handed over to you you may only be able to see it there until it can manifest to you wherever you're at I don't know that our world is pure enough for this 
book to show up here but I know that if you went to the library you would be able to open your book 
wow mine's a dream I had we're very vivid with this book 
it's like the book of life with glowing pages and pictures that moved very harry potter-esque very 
um yeah so maybe that was something to achieve go for it very cool treasure 
of treasures yes well thanks dolly this was amazing all right thank you enough 
so uh I guess bye for now and I will talk to you soon okay bye all right so that is the interview 
i did with dolly about her amazing experiences with this e.t book and after that interview I 
told her how her case matches up closely with others and we started talking about betty hill 
and I explained to her that betty hill actually wrote down the symbols she had seen in her book 
dolly had never seen these so she asked me to send them over to her and when dolly saw them 
she was amazed because she knew what these symbols meant remember for those of you who 
have read the book symmetry dolly was taught how to fly this craft and seeing betty hill's symbols 
she knew what they meant and she was floored so what I'd like to do real quick here is just give 
dolly's translation of betty hill's symbols seen in the e.t book there's ten symbols as you can see 
here and dolly says that this is actually sort of like a flight instruction manual 
with the first symbol representing an et craft the second is indicating a right hand turn 
the third is turning up and then down the fourth is straightening up and moving forward 
the fifth is to remain level the sixth is a view of a heads up display the seventh is again to 
move up skiff upwards the eighth is a power up symbol the ninth is to take off at speed 
and the tenth is a full stop so this is dolly's translation of these e.t symbols as seen by betty 
hill and if anyone should know it's dolly again she's a fully conscious contactee who has been 
trained by the et's how to pilot the craft uh her uh experiences with this with this are not unique 
many other people have told me how they've been trained to fly these craft but never in as much 
detail as dolly so that's really interesting information that I really wanted to share with you 
today and those are dolly's experiences with this really interesting alien book and as you can 
see her experiences are not unique this is very much what jeff selver described betty andreasen 
and the other witnesses so yeah et's do have books again dolly's experiences 
are written about in my brand new book symmetry a true ufo adventure uh the betty and betty hill 
case and the betty andreason case I did write a little bit about in volume three not from 
here but these other cases for the most part are unpublished or are appearing in different books 
so these are the alien books and clearly there's enough cases that we can say they do exist a lot 
of people have seen symbols and alien languages on board ufos often on screens and things like 
this and in fact nancy duterte taytray I'm not sure I'm pronouncing that right nancy duterte 
wrote a very interesting book how to talk to an alien which is really focusing all about alien 
languages and it has a lot of these symbols uh it doesn't talk about alien books 
so much but I do think it's related to all this so I thought I would mention it
so yeah that is basically the presentation I wanted to give to you today 
aliens do have books and they're very profound and generally speaking are talking all about 
spirituality I hope you've enjoyed this video I really want to thank you once again 
for listening and watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers 
keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun.
