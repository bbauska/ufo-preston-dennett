I consider her a superstar and a true Pioneer in this field and her name is Dr Irina McCammon Scott 
I'm so excited she is actually a scientist pioneering UFO researcher and author and her

extensive knowledge in the sciences and listen to this the defense intelligence 
agency the DIA employed her in a PhD level research in Satellite photography including 
the air order of the battle section of its photographic interpretation office which involved 
aircraft identification with Above Top Secret sensitive compartmented information clearance 
so there might be some stuff we're just not going to be allowed to hear but it's awesome 
to know that someone's worked with aircraft identification in this field in particular 
so Dr Scott was also employed as a physical scientist cartographer in the dma Aerospace Center 
which is now the National geospatial Intelligence Agency using satellite photography and she worked 
with the Patel Memorial Institute and if you know about UFO history that's significant 
and this resume is amazing uh I can't wait to talk to you I mean Arena she has been sent for 
work-related purposes to write Patterson Air Force Base and has been in the secured areas including 
the Blue Room building this is the n-a-s-i-c so Wright-Patterson is a huge part of the whole UFO 
field for a lot of foreign technology is tested and identified but Dr Irina McCammon Scott was 
an astronomer at the Ohio State University radio Observatory the big ear which is noted for the wow 
study signal that might be Humanity's only signal from E.T gathered so far in terms of radio waves 
she is an amateur astronomer and also has taken flying lessons she was actually a correspondent 
for Popular Mechanics magazine and of course she's written some really well received books and works 
in peer-reviewed scientific journals magazines and newspapers and in fact her photography has 
been shown on television and in magazines books and newspapers I know I'm going on and on about 
Herman I really think it's important you know her history because she has served on the mufon board 
of Direction directors move on of course being the mutual UFO Network that was from 1993 to 2000 and 
is a mufon consultant in physiology and astronomy and of course a field investigator herself

for the Ohio UFO notebook her Publications have included articles in the movement UFO in journal 
International UFO reporter and fate magazine which is really cool I've had articles in those as well 
um well maybe not the international UFO reporter I don't think they ever accepted any of my stuff 
but uh Dr Scott was a keynote speaker at the 2022 fifth Symposium on ufology and 
exobiology International Symposium in Brazil I'm the featured speaker at the 20 19 50th Anniversary 
International mufan Symposium the 22nd annual UFO Festival in McMinnville Oregon oh I still

at any rate I'm wrapping it up here she's done numerous podcasts 
um such places as coast to coast and Shirley maclaine's independent expression radio and 
many others including of course tonight on episode 11 of the light gate so I'm sorry to go on and on 
about you Irina I don't mean to embarrass you but thank you so much for coming onto the show tonight
well thank you for me hey it's our pleasure yeah Dolly's researched you 
and she's like we gotta get this lady on and I instantly of course recognized your name 
because yeah I've been in this field since 1986 and I think you were around back then as well is 
that right I think I started a little later than that all right well gosh what a resume 
How did you get involved in UFOs
you have so I'm not even sure where to start but I always kind of like to start when people were 
little kids and uh if you don't mind I'm just curious I'm curious by Nature like how did you 
get involved in you know all these science research and particularly into UFOs and did 
you start having any UFO experiences as a young kid or moving forward yes I did and um in science 
you're not exactly supposed to be in the UFOs and so I contained it and didn't say anything 
about it for a number of years I mean quite a few years during my career but I started out um my 
sister and I had uh experience when we were real young like I was about six and she was about four 
wow and it was years before we ever heard of UFOs or anything like that so we didn't know what it was for a long time and even when we did find out about UFOs we still didn't know but 
um we had something in our bedroom when we were children well that's significant
um it was like a little ball of um it looked it was a very tiny little thing and it looked like 
um hot iron or something it was just a little tiny thing like like a literal Tic Tac or whatever 
um and it was flying around the room and I woke up and this thing was flying around the room 
and I it was nothing like a lightning bug or anything it was lit all the time it looked 
like hot metal and at that young age I noticed that um it didn't bump into anything it would go 
toward a wall and it would turn it'd go around furniture and stuff and um it seemed to be it 
seemed to know where things were that the room was dark it was night and um it wasn't storming 
or anything there there's reasons why I know that my whole family knew it after a while because we 
were told about it we didn't know it was UFOs so we didn't you know nobody said shut up this is 
UFOs for quite a few years but um it flew around the room and it got kind of close to both of us 
and then it flew up toward the ceiling and turned before it got to the ceiling and it was an attic 
room with walls that came together and then a thing in the middle and um it flew down the middle 
of the thing there was a chandelier in the middle and without feeling its way around or anything it 
came to the chandelier right between the and right between the chandelier and the wall again circling 
the chandelier and it circled for a long time and then it came down the spiral just exactly sort of 
getting smaller and smaller until it was just about exactly under the Chandelier and then I 
didn't know my sister was awake even but suddenly it became we both became absolutely terrified 
and tried to run out of the room except we bumped into each other and fell down the stairs and then 
we had in the stairs and we were scrambling in our Terror and we couldn't get the door open and 
finally we did and so he ran to our parents screaming and shrieking and they said uh it 
didn't really happen oh he didn't believe us well that's a shame I've heard that so many 
Why was it scary
times our parents just don't believe their children I'm wondering why was it scary I 
mean what what about it scared you I don't know that's one of the things I don't know 
um you know your parents would normally if there was just one of you your parents would say well you dreamed it but there were two of us and we both saw the same thing and we weren't 
talking about it or anything so we both you know experienced the same thing but we don't know why 
we both woke up at the same time she watched she woke up at about the same time I think she knew I was awake but I didn't know she was awake but we both woke up at the same time and I don't know 
why and then suddenly we just became terrified out of our minds at the same time and um I mean it was 
real terror and I don't know you know I thought maybe there was some kind of mind control going 
on was the only thing I could think of well it certainly seems significant now because that's 
the age where contact often starts with people who have regular contact throughout their lives
awake or before right when the thing um she said it just disappeared and I 
thought it kind of exploded but I don't know what happened but okay suddenly 
we both just became we both started screaming and running out of the room at the same time so I know 
we were both terrified at exactly the same time but I mean we didn't know anything about UFOs or 
anything we didn't know what it was right and for that we were even scared if it was doing something 
outside your reality yeah it would terrifying did you later talk about it you had a normal reaction
a normal reaction when it started was I was just watching and I'm wondering what that is and I and 
I will terrified or anything just suddenly when I was absolutely terrified and I don't know why but 
she was too well it's not too surprising it can be yeah like Dolly says it's the unknown which 
Talking about it
I think we have an automatic fear reaction to that but I'm wondering did you ever talk about it afterwards with your sister I mean you know if my parents had known about UFOs we they would 
have said shut up don't talk about it because you weren't supposed to but we didn't know it was a UFO and so yeah we talked about it you know my father threatened to beat us up if we 
didn't go back upstairs and he didn't believe us he said oh there's nothing in there and so 
we both went up we weren't exactly feeling like going up today we talked about it to our mother 
and then we we told all kinds of people like cousins and all kinds of people and lots of 
them still remember it I mean is that the only experience that you remember having 
Several experiences
no we had several in fact you know they say that people like you said start young well my sister 
and I had the experience together when we were kids and then we had another experience together 
when we were older and we both had other um experiences too okay or was there was 
it a different type of experience the next one of the the next one we had together I mean we 
both saw some separately we had one together that um lasted about three days for me wow 
several States big long geography of it um if you want to hear a long one oh yeah that's my career 
A long one
well this is a pretty long one um it was when I was working for the DIA so at that time I couldn't 
talk about UFOs or anything um but I was uh this happened in Ohio the first one but the second one 
was my sister was at Brewer University taking post-graduate courses and I was um working for 
the DIA in aircraft identification believe it or not and and with all kinds of security clearances 
and all that but um we were both on the East End of the country and we decided to go up on a 
vacation and see the New England states and so I um two co-workers wanted the trip up to New York 
with me and I took them up and picked up my sister and left them off and took pictures of everybody 
and then we went on to Boston and we were planning on staying at Boston all night but we got there 
early and so um we decided to go look around some before we came back to Boston and so we went up 
into New Hampshire and later I found out we're kind of on the way where the hill abduction took 
place the end of it but we came back down and we came back to Boston and looked for a place to stay 
and we couldn't find any everything seemed to be closed or filled up or things and so we were leaving and I was going to look around the outer Bell and as we were leaving 
we there was this airport the nor Norwich Memorial airport south of us and we could see airplanes 
flying in putting on their Landing lights and their green and red lights on their wings and 
stuff and we could see air you know regular airplanes and there was this other thing lower 
than the airplanes and it was white and blinking it was real white there were no other lights 
and my sister starts saying maybe that's a UFO and I was driving and you know I'm in science 
and things and so scientists explain things and so I told her it's an air it's a helicopter with a 
blinking its Landing lights I never seen anything like it either but she she has a real good 
eyesight she's a bird watcher and can practically see you know a speck on a burn a mile away that 
I can't even see in ostrich but anyway she was watching more closely than I was and she kept 
saying it looks like a it might be a UFO and I kept telling her she was crazy and so we continued 
and we got on the main night Route 95 that's route that had the big crash several weeks ago with the 
truck and everything but um we got on 95 from Boston it's a the main North South Route there 
and um there was a Woods on one side and I looked at the woods and there was this round thing in 
the woods it looked like it was on the ground or close to the ground it looked like glass and there was a light inside that was seemed to be it was going through a spectrum of like blue and 
red and purple and all shades of blue and red and purple and there seemed to be some kind of a thing 
that was going around it and I couldn't imagine what it was and I I still have no idea but anyway 
um the inside of the car lit up in green and um I looked around I didn't see green anyways and the 
light wasn't green I didn't know why the car lit up in green and so we continued and after a while 
my sister began screaming at me that the things she was watching was going to go over the road 
and that we should pull over and I still thought she was crazy and I told her you know if it was 
a UFO well the fire department and the police and everything would be there and watching and you know it couldn't be a UFO so anyway she kept screaming at me I finally pulled over 
and I was going to point out the window and say you know you're crazy that's a helicopter 
and I looked out and pointed my hand out and I was all ready to say that I saw it way off of meteor something looked like a mirror and then just immediately this thing came 
and it was a big thing real close real distinctive it um had seven square windows in a row and it had 
a little green light on one end and a little red light on the other didn't blink and it came close 
to it was right over the trees and at that time I realized my sister was right and I was wrong 
but um she said we didn't talk about it too much we didn't even see each other for about six years 
because she became a missionary in Brazil right afterwards and I got married and moved to Nevada so it was years before we saw each other and we didn't discuss it what year was this happened 
What year was this
1968. anyway uh it wasn't you you know something you could really discuss especially not with my 
job right but um so I immediately had written down everything that happened and she didn't 
know she didn't just last year she found a letter she wrote to my mother so we both had descriptions 
that we wrote immediately after it happened but um and heard this and I didn't we didn't discuss 
it much later either but in her description she said that right after this thing appeared over 
the Treetops that it's shown a light in our car it was sort of a strange color and I didn't see that 
but I did see something look like a meteor and then it came over and we both got out 
and it was it was real it distinctive I mean it wasn't like something foggy it was like you're 
just looking at a window of in your house or something and it was Square Windows and there 
was some kind of a blinking pattern of it was like the first two the first three lights would blink 
on and off and then all seven and then the last four and then repeat that or something my sister kept saying that's a signal and she kept saying something about she was trying to understand the 
signal and I didn't understand any of that but I had a I I had been using it just a regular camera 
but I also had a Polaroid that I had high speed film for and so I started 
getting all that and finding it in the car and everything getting it out and everything and um 
Photographing a UFO
then I was it was just yeah I was in photography at the DIA and so I knew what kind of a picture I 
could take and I thought if I took you know two or three pictures I could get him a stereo and get this object and maybe get the freeway it'd be a perfect picture of a UFO I mean 
it just proved it existed plus you could we thought the light was coming from the inside 
and so I was very anxious to get a picture and so I had everything set up and this truck driver 
pulled over in front of us and came up and right when I was ready to take the picture 
he stood right beside me and said what do you do and so anyway it and I was scared to take 
the picture because this man was standing beside me and so I pointed at the thing and said there 
it is what is it and I you know I didn't say UFO or anything I just acted like it was an airplane 
and then he just rotated around looking the opposite direction and said I don't see anything 
and you know at that point I was kind of nervous 
and so he said the same thing again what are you doing and this big thing was you know right there and I was missing a picture and so again I pointed at it and said what's that 
and again he just rotated around he looking exact opposite direction and said and said I don't see 
anything back and then he sort of gave me this uh motion like I don't remember exactly I think he 
pointed to his head or something like I was crazy and went back to his car well at that point I just 
missed the most wonderful picture I could ever imagine and then my sister's write-up one of hers 
she said that um that I seem to take a real long time to get my camera Freddy and so finally last 
year I asked her did she remember talking to this man and she was like No And so you know but so the 
whole thing was pretty weird there but I didn't I thought she was talking to the man I thought she knew he was there but anyway she also said that when I was talking the man that the object 
suddenly was in another place and I didn't notice that until I read her write-up years later but at 
that time I'd been able you know just able to get this perfect picture and when he left the thing 
was some distance away and I was afraid I get lens flares from the freeway and soy there was a hill 
nearby and I ran up the hill and it was a bald spot on the top and I did get I tried I took five 
pictures and only one turned out and I didn't understand it at first at all and I came back 
and um the thing is farther away then and it flew over the airport and it began to circle 
the airport and it would from South the North it would turn its lights on twice north to south 
it would go so fast you couldn't even imagine it you just sort of knew it went in a semi-circle it 
kept circling and circling and um at that time I thought I heard something like I mean I'm sure it 
was going faster in the speed of sound but at that time I heard something like a jet but it didn't sound like it was in Phase with its motion so I didn't know exactly what was going on and then um 
so I was real anxious to get a picture and she was looking through the window the whole time and 
trying to figure out why she couldn't see anybody inside it because there were these big windows and they were Square not like airplane windows and the thing made no noise whatsoever and it could go so 
fast you couldn't even see it or when it went over the road it was real slow and so I decided to go 
down the freeway and come to the next intersection and turn my car around and go back because I 
thought it had been going south but I thought it was going to go north I don't know why but I did 
that and the truck driver drove right in behind me and begin to chase us and I thought he was 
going to kill us if I switched Lanes he switched Lanes if I slowed down he slowed down if I sped up 
he sped up I finally just floored it and he just stayed right on my bumper and he was shining his 
bright lights down in my mirror and I couldn't see anything and I thought we were you know finished 
and you know I said goodbye to my sister and asked her to look behind and see if she could see it 
anything and she said no and um so I decided to go on the left-hand lane and then swerve at an 
intersection real fast across the right hand lane maybe I'd get rid of him and I tried that it was 
real dangerous because some of it's coming faster and that's on the right hand lane would get killed but I I did it and got off and you know turned around came back the thing was still circling the 
airport but then it started going toward the all the northwest and the roads kind of went 
north and south and east and west so I had to you know Skip a road here and there and follow it and 
finally I was on this really old miserable Gravel Road that was so bad you couldn't um hardly Drive 
the houses were a long ways away from each other and there were bumps and everything it was gravel 
and it was just a little bit faster and I could drive and it just kept going a little bit faster 
and I couldn't speed up I finally just gave up and turned around and came back and then 
we drove all the way back it was a 24 hour drive we drove all the way back to our dormitory 
and um went to sleep and then that morning we called our parents and told them her roommates 
didn't believe us at all and told us we were crazy but anyway yeah uh we were in our 20s in your 20s 
Reporting a UFO
um and you didn't have any Outlet to report that to anybody or at the time even with your job well 
I wouldn't have said anything about it my job but I there was more to it than that though okay 
I was supposed to pick up the two peak the two co-workers and I stayed there until late at 
night waiting for him and for some reason they knew where I was because I'd taken pictures of 
them standing out by my sister's dorm with her but later that we they both were really mad at 
me and said they couldn't find me and they didn't know why I didn't pick him up well I waited until night and then I drove back to Washington DC and then I had a poltergeist experience 
and it was scary too and then I woke up went to work but um so far as reporting it 
um with my job I was pretty nervous about reporting it and so I went to a pay phone 
and reported that I didn't know really where the report and I found UFO in the front directory and 
I get I think it was nycap and so I reported it but I didn't give my name or my phone number or anything like that because of my job and so there was no official reporting so I don't think um 
anything but I had written it up just immediately afterwards and um my sister 
thought she reported it to um Blue Book but we couldn't find a report from her but then 
like I said last year she actually found uh she had written the letters of my mother that day 
and told you know described it so we had two you know reports that we'd both written 
um right after it happened so that was pretty good well I have a really interesting question for you then in all your years of experience now from that moment to this day while you're 
talking to us what do you think it was that you saw I don't know um it was a UFO 
it was definitely unidentified and then error anomalous phenomena well it definitely was that 
um but we when we looked at it together we saw the same thing but and I just found out last year 
that she didn't see this man that I was talking to but she did know that he was chasing us so she remembered that and certainly unusual did you think there was possible missing time at any point 
yeah I found that out too from my sister's letter because later I reported it to Bud Hopkins and he 
tried to hypnotize me and stuff and he he went he actually went he actually took my sister who was 
living in Indiana at the time to meet um Deb cable and they disgusted and he tried to hypnotize me 
but I just didn't hypnotize at all but he asked me for a timeline and I couldn't give it to him 
because yeah I talked to him you know years later but then we found that write-up of my sisters and 
in my write-up I hadn't said anything about time I just described what happens well in her write-up 
she she had given time and so yeah it's possible we had missing time because we both thought we 
watched the UFO for like about maybe an hour I mean I thought we watched it for maybe 10 o'clock 
to 11 o'clock or something and I wondered why we got back at six o'clock in the morning to um
from her timeline that we might have watched the UFO for like four hours or something 
so there might have been missing time you know he's dead so I can't tell him now but 
I did discover that we might have had missing time and I didn't know it before I mean I couldn't calculate it well you skimmed over one interesting part that I wonder if you 
Poltergeist
could expound to putt upon you said you had a poltergeist experience was that yeah all apart 
this whole ordeal yeah I thought it was a part of it because it happened right afterwards but um
in Washington DC and um I never heard of poltergeist so I mean I was in science I read 
scientific right I didn't know anything about ghosts or anything and so anyway that night 
I I tried to go to sleep and I kept hearing somebody walking in my room it was like a 
man with shoes and he'd take about three steps and then be simply sales and take several steps 
and I was terrified and there was a little bit of light coming through the window from the street lights I couldn't see anybody not several times it was close to my bed and I couldn't 
feel anybody I was really scared and so of all the weird things to do I went to sleep 
and then I woke up and the alarm went off and I thought it's morning and I got up and started 
getting breakfast and then I realized it was dark I looked at the clock and it was like 1 30. 
and my clock would have been set at 6 30 whatever time I woke up and so I was terrified and I put a chair against the door and went back and went to sleep again 
well my alarm went off again and it went off at 2 30 3 30 4 30 and I think 5 30. 
and the trouble with the alarm was is that the little thing you turned it was broken and I had 
to use pliers to turn it and I couldn't turn it accurately with my hand but each time it was 
set right exactly where it should be I mean right exactly you know like 230 3 30 right on the thing 
and I tried to get it back and you know just approximately twisting it by my hand and then I 
was sitting on my bed and I was thinking you know I've got this security clearance and if I've just gone insane well I'm going to be in big trouble at work and I was trying to you know plot ways 
to go through my days at work and the sky's the fact that I was insane because I you know about 
Poltergeist I thought I would I thought I would you know my brain had gone and so then somehow my 
toothbrush just flew across the room and hit the wall yeah I didn't want to call in sick 
that you know that morning and so I didn't so I went to work and nothing else happened 
but anyway it was pretty scary well I have a theory about this sort of thing because this is 
Psychokinetic Activity
something we see with people who've been take one sure you probably run across this in some of your 
own research but people who are taken on board come back in their bioelectric field is kind of 
activated in a weird way to the point where radios might fuzz up lights go out they start having 
psychokinetic activity so maybe it was something to do with that when you're with uh when you're 
with the T you're on board with them and they're using their abilities with you okay they're not 
talking they're using psychic ability with you and it activates you a little bit okay and when 
you come back you're still active and you're doing it to yourself and Poltergeist is the right word 
because the Poltergeist always comes from the person who's in the room okay nothing outside 
of you is doing it and they might have been watching you still to see if you were all right 
um so I mean you're it can go on for hours after a contact they'll they'll keep an eye on you 
they'll watch over you a little bit you know they'll just stay with you through it and you 
may have just been real active you know doing it to yourself yep well I figured that had you know 
I was worried about it was insane and I didn't know about that time but you know I connected it 
with the UFO sighting I thought you know this was weird and maybe something else that you know where 
this one too but I was still kind of nervous because of my security clearance I mean I was 
very nervous and I know that feels like a little bit um anything else that was associated with 
that in terms of like physically or dreams perhaps or weird emotional reactions I don't 
know because I hadn't read about UFOs in like if I knew something about UFOs I'd have checked 
and seen I had real bad nosebleeds later right then though it started that takes a while yeah 
okay do you do you um are you do you experience psychic events even to this day do you have 
moments where you're real intuitive or you know things or things are happening around you still 
I don't know because being a scientist you know dream things will happen but I don't know if it's just coincidence or anything else so I can't say I mean you know I do have things like 
that but I don't know whether they're real or just you know accidents or coincidences all right well I have a question from Chad I'd love to pop in because I was kind of wondering 
Are you a military family
this myself it's it's something that I do ask other experiencers and this comes from Chris 
space teen who says not sure if this will be answered or not but the question is were 
they a military family or live near a military base or anything similar because there does seem to be somewhat High incidence of military people among contactees 
but you're already in the military right I mean eia with a high security clearance and you know 
identifying airplanes from satellite photography well I wanna I wanna add to that question a little 
bit then um what did your father and mother do for a living dad was a farmer and he had 
an eighth grade education and my mother um had gone to college and um my father didn't 
like books very well and finally he mellowed down and my mother started writing and things 
um we didn't we weren't a military family at all look my my husband had worked I married him later 
I was engaged to him then he had worked uh in area 51. okay I started you off on the road to science 
I mean you've got quite a diverse uh resume there uh Veterinary all the way into you know
how old were you when you knew you were thirsty for knowledge well I really wanted 
to be an astronomer even before I knew what it was I mean I was fascinated by the stars and I wondered and then I became you know I wanted to go into astronomy and I always did 
but and I started majoring in it but they didn't allow females in it was male only yeah but I still 
want to do research and so I got in the scientific I I tried to get into astronomy in the back door 
because they were making they were mapping the planets in and so I became a cartographer 
and then I wound up in the DIA and then I got married and we moved to Nevada and they didn't 
have any astronomy Department there but I went back I started working for the school and got my 
tuition paid for and everything and wound up getting the degree in uh veterinary medicine 
wow did you ever do anything with that or yeah I uh went to Cornell and got a 
postdoc and I was a professor for a while and then I came back to Ohio and worked for the 
um worked for Battelle and Ohio State University and the Department of Health 
the Ohio Department of Health yeah that's amazing to me that's absolutely amazing 
How did you start researching UFOs
um okay so in your research with your resume and everything when did you start heading 
toward researching uh UFOs or any of that how did that happen move on and all that 
well finally after years and years and years and years and years of not talking about it and 
um I guess the first thing was was related to the Pascagoula thing because um when I was living in 
Missouri my mother was in Ohio and one night she called me and said did you hear that noise and I 
told her you know you're crazy you know 600 miles away I wouldn't hear a noise that you heard and 
so anyway she still seemed curious and then later she was a skeptic and everything but several days 
later she called and said there's been a huge huge massive UFO uh wave there going on in Ohio that um
UFOs chased her one of her friends and the governor saw it and everybody was staying 
in at night and they kept their kids in it was just like a war zone the way she described it 
and I was in Missourian and didn't pay attention to it but later I was working at OSU 
and I thought I'd look up and just something to do look up and see if I could find when she said that 
and um so I was looking for a noise in a big UFO flap and there were all kinds of newspapers and 
I didn't know when it was but I just guessed it was the middle of October and at that time 
the library had actual newspapers and I went in this newspaper room it was like something out of 
you know one of those movies or something of vaults and things but I actually found the 
little notice real fast about a strange sound that was heard and I was really curious about that 
um and started sort of investigating and 
um it was heard all over a whole section of the United States and it was the same 
time as a pascagoul induction which I didn't pay attention to at all at that time but anyway I I 
decided to write it up in a scientific journal and submitted it and the state of Ohio seismologist 
was interested and he helped me do research and so I did research on seismographs and things and this 
this noise was real it was probably the second large most large in extent noise in the world 
and it went from Iowa all the way to the coast of of Washington and it was loud 
and wide and nobody could explain it huh what year was it it was uh 1973 October the 11th 
and it was the same time as the past Google objection which I paid no attention to at all 
what at that time in the astronomy Department anywhere I talk about maybe an incoming meteor 
um well no at first they said they explained it as a meteor but it was on it major I found two 
seismograph records of it so I could calculate just how fast it was in things and a meteor 
um no none was seen but they explained it as you know one that 
um I forget what they call it one that uh dips down and come flies back going 
across the water and skipping rocks yeah I forget what it was called but anyway 
um but you have to have a certain speed to do that to be above escape velocity and I could 
calculate its speed and it was way below escape velocity so the scientists explained it that way 
but that wouldn't have um the new explanation at all that's interesting that's really interesting 
um that is really interesting is that the only time you ever saw anything like that or heard of it or I mean so that's pretty much what ignited your interest s and what was that I 
said some other had seen some other UFOs um when I was a kid uh I was sleeping outside 
because we didn't have air conditioning and all that was sleeping on a rock outside our door
um over that was um it was just like a big uh globe or something but it seemed like it was about 
the size of an airplane didn't make any sound it came over and right overhead all the dogs in the 
neighborhood suddenly started barking and our dog was locked in the kitchen we couldn't see anything 
it was sounded like it was tearing up the kitchen right when it was exactly over and it went on over 
and I was really really terrified at that time wow they didn't say anything about it because I was 
afraid my parents would beat me up or something tell me I was lying and then another time 
um this was in the 1980s I have the exact date but for some unknown reason I'm just going through my 
normal life I suddenly got scared of UFOs and I have no idea why but I was so scared I wouldn't 
I would hardly go out the door I mean I had to go to work and everything and so I thought 
UFOs are sneaky and I won't go out in the woods so I won't go out by myself or anything and so 
you know I just sort of kept in the house and in the car and going to work and stuff and so 
anyway I saw one at work and um I had a bunch of other uh Witnesses too because I saw this thing 
and I couldn't figure out what it was and I asked somebody and then we went to the office of the department and a bunch of people saw it including professors and I 
even got write-ups from professors about it um it was in view for about like 15 or 20 minutes 
wow they had any idea what it was it was in 1984. but um it was really weird because 
I was just that day I had received uh I decided to write my uh report to the UFO office um at kufos 
and um I picked up the paper that day to start filling it out and that's when I saw the UFO 
and it's that seemed funny what that seemed pretty weird too but then I saw it at work and 
um I had a lot of other Witnesses and they would even the professors wrote out descriptions of it I 
made copies of it and still haven't put in my book so as a professor you were able to talk about UFOs 
Why not talk about UFOs
but while working well here I want to pull up this comment from the chat because I think this applies 
um so you as a professor you know talking about UFOs was fine but working at the DIA Central 
Wisconsin is asking why not talk about UFOs was that just something that you were concerned 
about personally or was there an Unwritten rule while you're in the DI UFOs are taboo 
well at that time that was in the 1960s well the government was saying UFOs don't exist the 
season is crazy and so you know I had a job I had a good job I didn't want to go out and 
beg on the street and so I didn't say anything about them plus I was the only female in the 
department there was one other female on the whole floor and you know I was a female let's start with not sink now I see UFOs I think so I didn't you know say anything about it
that's amazing well I know we've talked a lot about your personal experiences and I do want to get at some point into some of your research and the books you've written so I'll 
Sacred Corridors
just pull up one here onto the screen which I found super interesting this one you wrote 
It's called sacred corridors the secret behind the real Project Blue Book Wright Patterson Air 
Force Base Roswell Patel Memory Metal and that's quite a long subtitle I'm not sure I can make up 
the rest of that Dr heineck and UFO cover-ups this looks like a really interesting book Irina 
um what prompted you to write this one and can you talk a little bit about it yeah um a lot of 
it came from did you ever hear of Jenny seidman oh yeah oh sure yeah Jenny absolutely a lot of 
it came from her material and she worked at uh Battelle when they did the act the UFO study 
of the Memorial Institute did the um the um Special Report 14 on UFOs it was a real good 
scientific study well she worked at Mattel then and she was working under Dr heineck 
and actually her job for a while was to go through all the UFO uh reports that come to him and pick 
out the good ones and tell him these are good reports and so she was really involved and she 
knew the other people that um did the study and she'd had notes that she'd taken all along and she 
gave me the notes and so a lot of it was a lot of my book was on her material but also I had been a 
Wright-Patterson several times in the secured area and um oh several times my job you know 
um meetings there to um different meetings and I had been in the secured area and so 
I wasn't really exactly in the UFOs then but um I was kind of and so anyway I didn't ask 
anybody I just went around Wright-Patterson with a camera and took pictures of old buildings and 
everything in a secured area and so um people are familiar with Wright Patterson because it 
has a museum but the rest of the secured area with chain link fences and everything 
and so I took pictures and published the pictures of you know different buildings and things
wow that's amazing to me amazing
I oh
um oh there we go that was my first book and that was um that was written I posed in 2017 and it was just I started 
um belonged to this group that investigated UFOs and I'd been investigating and so I kind 
of covered chronologically UFOs from uh starting actually before 
uh the 1940s into that day's UFOs and covered a lot of things um such as oh one thing that 
I started out with was um I had accidentally found the book by Kenneth Arnold
um and read it and I found it was it was just fascinating because he was the first first person 
that Drew attention to UFOs is you know with the idea that they're um you know craft with Pilots I 
mean I don't know if they are but that was you know that's what people think now and um so he 
was before Roswell but not very far before Roswell and um you know a lot about aircraft 
you can identify many many aircrafts how many times have you seen in non-aircraft in other 
words none from here that you've been able to say that is not from here versus from here
oh well just um the sightings I had with my sister that was kind of an aircraft and it was 
in our room and um the one I talked about that I was laying on my a rock outside and um one I had 
with my sister of the windows and everything and the one I had at Ohio State none of them looked 
anything like aircraft the one from Ohio State I had descriptions of people and they said uh they 
told them what direction it was going and the wind was going the opposite direction things like that
what do you think about all the recent whistleblower talk like David grush and the 
accounts of people reverse engineering craft and some of the stuff people are seeing now 
being our own do you put any Credence in all of these accounts coming from whistleblowers 
I don't know because um you know if somebody if they had if the government had a UFO I 
think they'd take over the world for one thing real fast but for another thing if they had it 
they ought to fly around and show it doing the same kind of things that UFOs do and then land and take people in and have people inside it and all that 
um so I don't know I mean I know it'd be secret because I had you know a job with 
classification too but um I just don't know I mean I think the government for my work I thought the 
government knew more about it than they said but I don't know how much they know about it 
right yeah well it's kind of the way I feel I mean I've talked to a few whistleblowers myself so I suspect there's quite a bit going on behind the scenes but yeah unless I talk to them personally 
it's hard to comment down so I totally understand that but okay I'm going to pull up another book 
Inside the Lightning Ball
because I do want to point get to the your recent books but here's a really interesting book you 
wrote called inside the lightning ball this is the scientific study of lifelong UFO experiences 
so can you talk a little bit about why you wrote this book and what it contains well they always 
say scientists don't see UFOs I mean that's the common idea that you know scientists are opposed 
to UFOs and just you know nuts see UFOs and they you know say well science they're logical people 
they you know just think logically and so they don't see UFOs and I had a lot of scientific 
training and I saw UFOs and I thought I you know I had other Witnesses and things and even 
had pictures and I published one of my pictures in a scientific journal and I also wrote up the 
thing about the sound and the scientific journal so I had several things in scientific journals 
um and that was just my own experience and I also included other um 
the information from other people that were in science at Seoul UFOs too
very very interesting yeah well he's certainly been busy in this field now I do have to take a quick station break so if you allow me to do that for just a second 
I want to thank everyone out there who is listening and watching you are watching the light gate I'm Preston Dennett my lovely co-host is contact T Dolly saffron our amazing guest is Dr 
Irina McCammon Scott PhD and I want to give a huge shout out to United United Public Radio Network 
work we're streaming on them in 107.7 FM and UFO paranormal radio network at 
105.3 on numerous other platforms Facebook Rumble Roku is that it roku.com of course uh 
YouTube and uh yeah we're on our second hour I see some of the questions in chat I know I 
really want to dig into a little bit onto the Charlie Hickson Calvin Parker case because I saw you done two books on that co-wrote uh with uh or whoever it was you'll let us know 
but yeah here I'll just pop up the next question in chat because we get a lot of questions and 
I always like to say no questions are you know to I mean all questions are allowed 
so here is one from L and I like this question and she says please Irina do 
you experience a lot of synchranies synchronicities in your daily life
I there's just no way to figure out whether they're coincidences or whether they're real synchronicities and so I don't know
um that's a dumb answer I don't know no that's that's fine
well as a scientist have you ever okay um uh checking yourself out for being psychic have 
you ever taken a test or delved into reports that people have about being psychic and being able to 
hear what they're saying mentally that kind of thing no I never did you never did oh wow 
okay okay I'm trying to pull up another of your amazing books hold on a second
so many I lost track of the file here and just pull this up because I want to get 
into here we are I want to get into the Hall Pascagoula incident which is so I mean has 
had such a huge impact and here is the book let me see let me just pull this up that you 
co-wrote with Philip mantle no I wrote one earlier and then 
I'm co-writing them with Philip mantle but it's not published yet that's that'll come out later 
but this is the one that's coming out later oh okay not later it's not published yet wow
we will save that for the next time you're on but here is the one that's the one 
um Beyond Pascagoula and it's about uh Kelvin Parker and Charles Hixson and the Pascagoula 
incident honestly I think I have I'll wait for that getting all kinds of lovely pictures yes
hold on let me try I wanted to show um let me pull up the other ones but so yeah just tell us about your research into the Travis Walton 
case okay on the Pascagoula case okay um well the reason you know what kind of started me in 
it was that sound and that happened exactly at the same time as the abduction but I did 
research on the sound which is more or less physical research scientific research and 
then years many years later I mean a couple of years ago employees of a shipbuilding company 
and um the older man was in his 40s and the younger man was a teenager they were working and 
they were family friends the older man was friends with the younger Man's father and vice versa 
and the younger man his son were just real good friends and so they had finished their day of work 
and they decided to go fishing which they're down at Pascagoula which is by the gulf and there's a 
big river there and I guess that's what you do especially when you're down there and so they 
had no interest in UFOs or anything they were just going fishing and they looked at one place 
and then went to another place they didn't you know UFOs weren't a subject of anything to them 
and they were out you know with their fishing gear fishing and this thing came uh they had 
um uh the younger man had his car and they had parked some way from the pier and he wasn't real 
thrilled about going to the pier because there was a lot of Crash and weeds and things and there was 
a no traffic Passing sign he was afraid the police would get him and so he's told the older man you 
know if you get in trouble it's your fault not mine you can go to jail and everything and you know so anyway they went and that's the pair they went out on the pier and began to fish 
and then they saw this blue light and it was kind of the same color as the police 
um you know the blue light on the this uh on police cruisers right and they thought at first it 
was a police but then it was really really a lot more horrible than police because this thing came 
it was a UFO and it was sort of levitating and suddenly it opened up and these things came out 
and that's the picture they drew of it and um two of them grabbed the older man and one grand the 
younger man and they kind of levitated them into the thing I mean this was totally unexpected for 
both of them they were terrified they took a man and um the guys couldn't do anything 
because it was like they were paralyzed it was like they they thought that somebody had given 
him a shot or something and you know that they thought maybe it's a government but you know 
at the same time you thought it's a UFO and they took them both in and put them in different rooms 
and laid them back and they couldn't see much at all because it was really really 
bright light on the inside and with both of them they described these things came out of 
the wall or the ceiling and came down and it was kind of like the described as the size of a deck 
of cards now I think you'd describe it as a iPhone and Escape like it was scanning them 
and then um they were laying there they couldn't move all they could see do was move their eyes 
and they were terrified and they didn't know how long they'd been there they didn't know whether they would ever get back or whether they were going to be captured or killed or anything else 
and then the things put them back where they started from and um these were 
you usually people describe aliens as sort of like skinny things and you know with you know skinnier 
the Grays and things like that but these things were kind of Porky and they couldn't exactly see 
there's they didn't know whether they had skin or covering but they were kind of wrinkled and 
with people you have two ears and the nose where these things sort of had projections out there 
like somebody just made a an imitation person or something and um so it they think the things put 
them back on the uh deck and disappeared at the object disappeared um and what would you do if 
that happened I mean this was back in 1973 when people if you said UFO everybody told you you 
were crazy and you were lying and so you know if it happened things like that happen to people well 
they didn't talk about it and the only abduction before that in the United States had been the 
hills and they had to recall it hypnotically they didn't remember it well these two people 
remember that consciously and they discussed it and said we're not going to tell anybody and then the the younger man was just terrified and just having a nervous breakdown all over the 
place they both were and the older man had been in the uh Army and he had been in life situations 
and he thought he could stand up to all the harassment they were going to go through and you can imagine you know Shipyard workers how you'd be harassed and so the older man decided to report it 
and he tried first of all a newspaper newspaper was closed or something and then he tried Kessler 
Air Force Base which is close to there and it was night and Kessler said they were closed 
and they didn't do UFOs anyway and told him to call the police and so he decided to call the police the other man didn't want anything to do with it he was a teenager and you know 
he didn't want to be called the craziest whole life and so anyway the older man contacted the 
um police immediately and the police came and that's real unusual because most people even if 
they remembered something like that they don't go around talking about it because nobody believed you even now and back then you know it's just not things something he did but this was different 
and the man he did contact the police the police came out and got him and they separated him and 
interviewed them both in separate rooms which is a real intelligent thing to do 
then the police didn't want to make be made fun of or you know been used or anything and so they 
um put him in the same room but they hit a tape recorder and they thought you know if these 
people are in the same room and nobody was there I mean they first of all talked to them in the same 
room and then the man left and so they thought if they were hoaxing well they would be laughing and 
saying well we really put it over well the two are just absolutely terrified and the the tape 
recording still existence on the internet you can tell you know how they felt by their voices 
yeah I heard that actually it's very compelling yeah I mean they were terrified out of their minds 
and the one who's praying and everything and um so that made the police believe it 
when they went home that night and came back and somehow it got out um 
they didn't really want the world to know them know about it and you know but somehow it got out and there was all kinds of telephone calls and everything 
else coming into their work in the morning and so they were then questioned by professional 
people like Colonels and things at first of all at a hospital and then a Air Force Base 
and um everybody thought they were sincere there wasn't anybody you know that even though it was 
something weird that they were very convincing as being you know something really happened to him 
wow amazing yeah I mean this is a landmark case for sure I think it's one of the top 10 
best verified cases people who have been taken on board and I know there was a book that uh 
on Kelvin or Charlie Hixson wrote with Dr Mendez and he had follow-up sightings 
afterwards now is that true also with uh Calvin Parker that he had following us 
yeah I think he had at least one in 1993 oh wow very interesting yeah well that's yeah it's truly 
an amazing case so did what was it like to you know speak with him and you know how to 
he's such a huge figure in this field right now I'm sure it's difficult for people to go forward 
and I've heard him speak he seems like this affected him really profoundly it did because 
like I interviewed his wife and at that when that happened they were engaged and you know 
it was like people were wondering whether she was going to marry him because he was a UFO person and it didn't bother her at all she you know was in love with him and they got married 
but she said he didn't talk about it for years until about 19 um uh until uh 2018. it happened 
in 1973 and he didn't even talk about it to her and right after it happened he had a nervous 
breakdown went to the hospital and things but he didn't talk about to anybody for a long time and 
then his wife had encouraged everyone Philip Madoff had encouraged him now he's glad he 
talked about it wow all right now if I could I'd like to bring because of the questions in 
chat are stacking up and it's always fun to interact with people who are listening and 
watching so here's a question which I think I could probably answer myself but I don't know 
how this is from DGK did Dr Scott's work include handling or cataloging items found inside a saucer 
I think it was June crane who is famous for doing that and she stepped forward practically 
when she was near to passing away but yeah did you ever have any involvement with that in any way 
I mean somebody gave me something that they said was a UFO from a UFO and stuff but I never never 
did anything with it oh all right that's pretty well here is another question if you 
don't mind because some of these are a little bit off topic but this is kind of interesting 
because you did talk about you and your sister having experiences together and then she went off to Brazil and Maggie Smith is asking did your sister have any odd things or sightings 
when she was in Brazil yes she did um uh one day one night she she was a missionary and she was 
working with several other missionaries and she and this missionary were in this really bad Road 
where you couldn't pass anybody or anything it was like a trail and they were in a four-wheel drive 
and she said they saw somebody coming and that the man drove off the road so the other 
person could get by because they saw this light coming and then they said it just disappeared 
that nobody was there even though they'd seen that and they were scared and the man 
uh drove back on the road and drove back and she said he never talked about it after that 
hmm wow amazing yeah Brazil is all about UFOs it's got a lot of activity there all right here is a 
question from Doxie which maybe Dolly you could answer I don't know if you're able to answer this 
Irena but it's certainly an interesting question I've been asked it and I don't know the answer to it but Doxie is asking has anyone worked out which craft goes with certain types of extraterrestrials 
I hate calling aliens that's not a thing oh uh there are certain types of crafts and any type of 
ET is capable of using them they uh it's so like if we had a fleet of different vehicles or all 
our Air Forces had planes and we saw them or we train them back and forth that's how it is with them they they their specific types and therefore it's more for the mission and what they're used 
for it doesn't matter who's flying it so that's why all right you have any comment on that Irina 
I don't know yeah I have not been able to note any correlations so what you're saying golly 
makes sense to me but here is a good question from Allison Carr because I'm wondering Irina 
how you feel about hypnosis and having possibly experienced it you know missing time yourself 
I had a missing time incident and I'm reluctant to go under hypnosis I kind of want to remember spontaneously but Alison Carr is asking I wonder if she's tried hypnosis to see such why she was 
I think scared of UFOs later and follow-up question is to that would you try hypnosis 
to see why you became afraid of UFOs I tried uh Bud Hopkins tried to uh hypnotize me and then 
I went to two doctors too but I just don't hypnotize at all I mean absolutely nothing 
happens to me under hypnosis so it just doesn't work I mean it'd be nice if you know I hypnotized 
and I remembered all these things and knew what happened and all that but it doesn't work on me 
no it didn't work on Dolly either so some people they explain it to you or not but 
I I am I'm completely conscious all the time and uh I am fully in control of myself and it's like
the person who tried to hypnotize me told me Point Blank that um I could probably recall anything on my own I don't need anybody to help me I just need to be able to relax Center myself 
and then replay it as if I'm watching it on a movie screen so that the memory is all congeal 
and they come back to me and that's exactly what I did um before when I was trying to figure 
everything out and that worked for me do you have an eidetic memory Irena the what memory an eidetic 
memory do you have a like a savant ability to remember things photographic memory yeah 
oh I don't know I'm kind of good on academic things but um like my sister and I had you know 
we might have had missing time twice but neither one of us remembered of anything happening during 
our missing time yeah and um you know if we have a subconscious mind it hasn't erupted too 
we're not in contact with it anymore well that's why I asked you if you had used any 
psychic abilities from what you're saying you have them everybody does but sometimes we just don't 
explore them we leave it alone and that's how you reach memories like that you're talking to your 
super conscious who you really are your physical mind uh is it uh in contact with that which you 
remember anyway you know your Consciousness it's not unconscious it's true Consciousness it's your 
super conscious and all you have to do is just let it go but you're in control of yourself and 
some people won't let go of that at all you know you're just not interested well I'm interested 
and I'd like to find out but um it doesn't work on me I know well what I'm saying is you'd have to do 
it for yourself you'd have to learn to meditate and you know single get focused in your mind and 
then walk yourself through it in other words you don't want to share it with anybody else you just want to be the one to do it it works that way trust it does you should give it a shot 
um our meditation can work writing it down again and trying to pull up different details 
yeah yeah I mean having experienced it myself I would like to know I really would I haven't 
tried hypnosis I think it works but I did get to meet Bud Hopkins as well a very nice man but 
never really pursued it so here is another question and this one is from fun Talks TV 
and I think this is an interesting question because you being very scientifically minded and being exposed to so many people who are having ongoing contact like Dolly and so what 
do you make of all these people who are claiming UFO encounters and going on board and all of this 
do you feel like the onboard experiences a valid experience I guess this is what fun talks is 
kind of leaning towards well I have a real open mind on this subject because of you know having 
Close Encounters ourselves and besides that just last year I found out that I was talking 
this crazy man and my sister didn't know he was there and I'd never asked her about that 
I mean I sort of wondered and so you know there was something really weird going on 
right neither my sister I remember anything about induction or anything yeah you know you might 
not have met the right hypnotist yet sometimes hypnotizing takes months before you actually start 
to get uh down into it enough to be able to recall and it I mean it can't just be one session and you 
have to practice at it for a while and get really good going under with someone that you trust and 
once you reach that level of Consciousness you know where you're opening up to it then then 
it'll hit you pal but it can't just happen in one session for some people and maybe that's you know 
maybe you should consider that finding somebody's willing to work with you for a few months and teach you how to go under because that's the whole point of you letting go so that you recall 
um some people have to you know my mom did it uh doctor took forceps and he put it in between her 
thumb and her fingers so she would feel no pain and when she finally got to the point where she 
absolutely didn't even know they were honor her he said we're ready to begin and that's when they started regressing her and it takes a while to reach that level of you know going 
under you might try it find you know keep try to find a better I don't know Preston knows a lot 
of people who do this you should ask him to give you an idea who to talk to well I generally don't recommend hypnosis for people unless they're absolutely dead set on doing it or having 
anxieties in a very clear-cut case of missing time which I think you probably do but yeah 
well okay here's the chat is loving you uh Irina Galaxy just wants to say thank you for speaking 
out and helping us all understand what's been happening so very much appreciate your good work 
oh thank you I know but here is a question from neural channels um I certainly have my 
own opinions about Bob Lazar and some of the stuff he's put forward I think he's legit I 
really do because I've talked to contact these who said yes what he described is you know what 
I saw on board of craft I know Dolly has talked about this some of the stuff he said she says 
that's scientifically accurate so you don't have to comment on him if you know you prefer not to 
but neural channels is asking what is your take on Bob Lazar and have you ever met him 
no I don't know um I think you know I think it's quite logical that the government is 
trying to back engineer UFOs but and so you know there's people doing it and all that but you know 
I don't know whether they've done anything I don't even know if you have those are technologically are technological things or what they are so you know I'm sure they're working on that but 
I don't know I mean my husband worked the area 51 too or anything but so you're not allowed I 
think there was a question back there which I kind of skipped over you being married to someone you're not allowed to discuss anything top secret even with your spouse is that correct 
well he my husband's dead now he died several years ago and since he died I can think of all 
kinds of questions to ask him but I didn't ask him when he was alive so I'm a little late on 
things you didn't leave a note or anything write something yeah that's pretty stupid I 
should have thought of all those questions you know when he was alive and I didn't well we get to ask you questions and here's a good one from M Wang 
and he's asking what is the strangest experience you have ever had that could be a lot of things
it seemed like there was probably some mind control involved but there's just a little tiny thing it didn't seem like much of anything it made me think that UFO phenomena can just take 
any form you know it might look like a you like a spaceship like a UFO or it might look like an 
alien or something and you know maybe we're kind of primitive and the universe is above us and 
um maybe they can just show us anything um one strange experience um was uh us about um 
synchronicity and things or when I was a kid there was this big picture in my relatives 
um uh living room and this man called John Perdue and I thought it was an oil painting that 
um my relatives had bought I didn't know anything about John Perdue and my great aunt died and the night she died picture disappeared off the wall 
and I couldn't figure out it was a big picture and it was always there and I my parents I didn't know 
she was gonna die that night my my parents were in with her talking to her and her daughter and I was 
in the living room where the picture was and there was no picture and I just couldn't understand I went over and felt the wall and the wall paper was a different color and everything and then later we 
went home and she died and they had a funeral and after the funeral he came back to their house and 
the picture was up and I couldn't understand that and I asked everybody and they said oh the picture 
was up the whole time well anyway years later um my mother went through all their paper and found 
all this John produce stuff and it turned out John Perdue was the founder of John of Purdue University he was a big famous person and that's why there was an oil painting and I had all this 
material and so I wrote up a book on John Perdue and Purdue University published it 
and I was thrilled to death but that happened way way back before I knew who John Perdue was and it 
was always sort of nervous that maybe John Perdue was telling me not to write a book about you
that's certainly interested you know something weird that happened once yeah 
I'm dying to tell you this um I want to give you a hint about your first experience that you remember you know the light uh-huh one way that uh the etus on uh children 
when they're coming in contact with the first time and they want your attention and uh their 
it's like hypnotizing you you know how a hypnotist will sometimes use an object and wave it in front 
of your face and you're supposed to follow it with your eyes they were literally showing you the light and spinning it around it's a way to get your brain to focus on to the light it opens 
you up to suggestion and they were in the room with you already you just couldn't see them and 
that's how they brought you down so that you could go with them and then come back so I'm 
positive I'm positive this happened to you and what yeah I think something like that happened because we there wasn't any reason why we both wake up at the same time but we did exactly 
he's in the room with us we went together they they hypnotized you okay they brought you out 
they brought you back and you just happened to wake up at exactly the same time that is a common tool that they use on small children so and I know of it so I mean I'm telling you 
they did that you you really do have missing time you went with them and then came back 
well that thing you know that I wondered about that is mind control and why they do it to kids 
why don't they do it to adults when you're you know adults are less likely to uh go blank when 
they see something they don't understand you or young you had never seen anything like that before and it was easier to get you to drop what you were thinking so that you could be uh contacted but 
you're below it Baltimore dated don't go with that and they'll attack children don't do that so yeah 
well we didn't even we didn't we'd never heard of UFOs or anything so we had no clue they're 
innocent and you went right under form that's that's exactly what they did even before that 
I can remember having really bad nightmares when I was like three years old of these round things 
that were chasing me and I was terrified but um so maybe something happened earlier than that 
oh yeah if you're contacted and you're really young it probably started when you were really really young you know that's the pattern and uh so they've been watching over you for a long time 
so I was glad my sister was there because otherwise you know I'd everybody tell me I 
was crazy and I you know dreamed it but not at all it was there and she remembered I'm gonna experience yeah well I was going to ask you about dreams you mentioned nightmares which is another 
red flag but moving forward like after that major experience with your sister in the UFO and the 
highway and did you have any dreams about that incident or any other dreams of being on a craft 
because that's definitely one of the things that a lot of contacties have and you're kind of ticking the boxes Irina I think you are a contactee I'm just saying well I've dreamed you know about being 
UFO in UFOs but that was after I heard about UFOs before that I had just dreamed about round balls 
and um yeah before I found out about UFOs I dreamed about things in the sky and things 
and I'd wake up and I'm just so terrified you couldn't believe it I mean I was just terrified but you know you'd think you were terrified because you were thinking it was a UFO and it 
was you know an alien or something well I had no idea why I was terrified and then when I found 
out about UFOs it seemed less terrifying because I could just yeah knowledge is power to your mind
it worried me that um you know there might be mind control going on and it's just horrible yeah it's 
not mind controlling what you're thinking it's just to relax you to get you into a state of you know uh acceptance and calm uh their biggest worry with the human races that you get on board 
and start trying to kill them and they don't want that even children will fight and so they get you calm so that you can see what's going on you understand and you'll follow them and go 
with what they're asking you to do and then they bring you back and uh more most people when they 
want hypnosis is just because they're looking for the explanation of what happened to them 
and it's terrifying not to know I understand that okay I really do it lingers with people 
and if you can shine a light on the experience and open it up and see it for what it really is then that fear just goes away because then you realize oh okay that's what happened 
and uh so whatever you fear is something telling me that something's dangerous 
and I had a lot of fear did you ever have anything happen to you they took it away but is that a good 
thing or should I be alert to something that's really bad no fear Fierce fear is unknown in other 
words you're fearing it because you don't remember if you could have remembered you might not have been afraid see what I'm saying did you ever come home with a bruise a cut something bad did 
you ever physically get ill anything like that do you ever have any of those memories no like you're 
um I had a real bad leg injury I just woke up and my leg turned purple and my knee was swelled up 
to about twice the size and the doctor pulled these syringes of blood out of it and they did 
an MRI and I had um like tendons sprayed and ligaments pulled like something had twisted 
my leg and pounded on it and I had no idea what happened and you don't know what happened wow 
that's interesting so you don't know if you okay so you did you don't know if you had a nightmare 
I didn't know anything I've been working on my computer and nothing happened to me and I had all 
that happen and I had no idea what happened wow but it was like it was like a football 
injury that like somebody pounded on my leg and twisted it and all kinds of things I don't know 
I'm I took physical therapy for like um nearly a year [Music] wow that's amazing that is amazing 
wow I'm not even sure what to make of that if it was me I'd really be going for trying to remember 
at that point you know try to explain why would you have an injury waking up you know I've had 
um I had an injury once waking up but I know why it happened somebody attacked me in my I was drugged and uh attacked so I don't know that's amazing hard to say but I want to pull up some of 
the pictures that I found online Irina because you have seen you've rubbed elbows with a lot of the 
big people in this field here is Kathleen Martin uh Kathleen Martin is just a wonderful person she 
helped me with all kinds of things and she's the nicest person you could ever imagine she's really 
hard working she's really sincere and he's the niece of Betty Hill and he's just a wonderful 
person yeah I was on a show with her on a panel and yeah it was awesome I really enjoyed being 
on the show with her and it looks like you got to meet Whitley schrieber as well really yeah 
he's totally impressive and you know the things he talks about um you know they're just amazing 
and he just he has the courage to talk about it and you know people call him crazy so what he's 
you know what was your impression of Travis Walton I didn't I just met him briefly I mean 
he seemed like a pretty nice person to me but I didn't know him very well everybody else that way 
too it's been you know really nice right and here of course this is Stacy Wright from Phoenix mufon 
a wonderful person yeah I spoke for her group um once once I had to cancel I was very sick 
but I very much enjoyed meeting her and this of course is Tom Kerry of uh Roswell Fame he's 
a very famous Roswell researcher what's your take on Roswell and what was it like to meet Tom Kerry 
oh I was totally impressed I was just amazed that um and you know you'll talk to you know I see him as you know like a god or something
nobody so I was really impressed with meeting him and everything and really impressed with his work 
too yeah I think the Roswell case absolutely happened I mean there are there's close to 100 
bucks in that case I'm not kidding uh it's clear they've interviewed everyone from beginning to 
end of that incident it's not a mogul balloon I'm absolutely convinced that was a genuine 
UFO that is in our possession which brings me to the next person you've met who is Clifford Stone 
was of course very well known for talking about crashed retrievals so did you get a 
chance to talk to him or what is your impression of the whole yeah and I was in his house and I 
was in his room with all his material and but I didn't ask him the stupid question I should 
have asked him you know I should have asked him I mean this would be a dumb thing to say and of 
course you know the answer is this really true and things and I didn't ask him that 
um instead I just talked about the government and hiding things and things and he just had he just 
had files and big files of material about you know the government and hiding things and that 
sort of thing I mean he was real impressive but I didn't ask him the things I should have asked him
holy Mackle all right well here I've got some more questions from Chad and here's kind of a 
an interesting question from Raul Melendez he says I would like to know Irene what are you learning 
from your experiences there is a purpose for this so I guess that's pretty philosophical question 
with no easy answer but uh yeah I mean this is a big life Journey for you I mean 
I mean how do you feel learning is um from that very first experience with a thing in my room 
um I thought there was mind control in thinking about you know first it didn't understand it at all because we didn't know anything about UFOs or anything else 
but it seemed to me that you know this tiny little thing was in the room and there seemed to be mind 
control involved and I think you know with the quantum theory and things maybe things like 
size and length and things like that don't really exist even time that they're just things that we
category you know categorize or you know our life and experiences that way but it may be that 
reality is a whole lot more complicated we could ever imagine and like there was this 
little tiny thing in our room but it seemed to be able to affect our minds and so you know I 
think whatever the phenomena is that it can make you think see anything and I worry that you know 
people talk about induction so maybe abductions or screen memory for something worse I mean I 
don't know it just kind of worries me that um our minds might be under you know control
yeah well here's a question from neural channels and I mean in your bio it says you were actually 
did take the test to become a mufon field investigator so did you actively investigate cases 
for mufon because neural channels is asking what's the most memorable mufon case you've investigated 
well I used to I used to be an investigator and then somehow I lost the thing um I took the test 
way back and um so now I'm not an investigator although I'm investigating with um I investigated 
all kinds of things the most uh interesting one that I investigated was happened in the 1990s 
and it was um with some other people it was near Logan Ohio and it was these people that kind of 
lived out in the country and they saw these um red lights flying over their cornfield and all around 
and they called um all kinds of people they called Wright-Patterson they called the sheriffs 
they called the TV and the radio and everything reported them and the things kept flying around 
one of them followed a car along the road and after they did all this reporting there was a 
plane that started flying a grid over top of them and one of the things flew up and followed 
the plane and they had policemen come out and the policemen had no idea what happened or what was 
going on and the policeman watched the thing too so it was really an interesting report because of 
the authorities came out investigated all kinds of people investigated and things kept flying around 
uh and then you know later that night they disappeared but usually like it was a lot 
of UFOs there's just you see some they'll report they'll see something flying across the you know that's all it's over with well these had investigators and everything there 
was it just two red lights no it was several red lights they were flying over a cornfield okay 
and then something else you know you asked about synchronicity something else that happened 
funny was that happened years ago and um several people went out and interviewed 
them and everything and then sometime later another person I went out and interviewed him 
and after we left they had another experience of that and I thought what a disappointment um 
you know because we left and then they had another experience well then sometime later this was more 
recent I had another UFO thing that it wasn't a real big thing but it was in my yard right here 
and of seeing a UFO that seemed to be like a they called it the dancing lights or something 
and I was standing out there taking pictures of the planet with um a camera in my hands and this 
thing came by and I didn't take a picture of it which is totally stupid but I had another camera and later this guy just sort of went into like it was fireworks and I got pictures of that with a 
video camera but several years later I looked at the date the date was just exactly so many years 
to the day of when this man and I had been out talking to him and I thought that was you know 
really synchronous and that is the synchronicity yeah that was a deliberate one that that's amazing 
yeah where are you living now where did you see this right here in my yard so I didn't go into 
it a lot like everybody like the other ones where I had another witness wow I had two cameras and 
um right in front of me and I didn't take a picture of it I know what that's like I've seen UFOs and had a camera with me and did not take a picture 
so I guess it happens to other people I couldn't believe it was I was that dumb 
yeah I sometimes wonder if there's some design going on there because I do know cases where 
people have had a camera and lifted it up to take a picture of the UFO and the camera powered down or the UFO darts off or turns off right they're aware I remember you know Dolly is a contact D 
with a lot of experiences and was having a lot of trouble getting pictures until she finally asked them listen I'm going public I need at least some pictures and uh they did listen to me 
Preston got to see him live so yeah that's pretty cool it's when they it's proximity in other words 
they can only get within so many feet of you and your camera will keep working you know the closer 
they are the less chance you have on your camera going off and that's what was happening to me I was like sneaking the camera in my pocket okay and they were coming for me and I'd lifted up to take 
a picture and the camera blade camera don't work or the film because I was using 35 millimeters sometimes 400 speed sometimes and it would be totally white just white and it made me mad and I 
could never get a camera inside either because the environment there's too many electrical impulses 
going on you know in in emfs you know and uh so the camera won't work on board anyway and 
uh I was getting bloody frustrated and I just said one day you know I can't I have to have something 
this is ridiculous and so these shots well great all right well here is another question which is 
kind of interesting I certainly have a comment on this this is from fun Talks TV and he's asking has 
anyone had a similar experience where they grew a passion for the cosmos and astronomy and later 
evolving to ufology and close encounters I see this occur quite oftening and I'm quite often 
and I'm wondering is it just me I have seen this actually in the other direction people will have 
a UFO encounter and then they develop an intense interest in cosmology astronomy quantum physics 
but yeah I think it probably is a two-way street and that's kind of how what happened with you 
Irina I mean you were interested in astronomy from a very early age but also having some interesting 
experiences well I was interested in astronomy and conscious of that but I wasn't conscious of 
UFOs time I mean I when I was real young I was interested in astronomy so I'd never 
heard of UFOs until later and after I had several experiences with UFOs 
so you know I kind of wonder about that too the same thing and I don't know could I be 
interested in astronomy because if something had happened way way back and I don't know
veterinary medicine because contactees as a rule have this 
amazing connection with animals and really environmentalism in general and yeah I mean
that's amazing to me so okay did you ever actually work as a vet or are you just a professor and taught veterinary medicine that kind well when I was in school you 
know we did some surgery on animals and things but no I never worked as a vet wow there weren't you know back a few years ago jobs were male only and things like that 
and I never even thought of myself as being a vet even though I had the degree to do it wow that's 
amazing to me well we're approaching the end of the show we still have five minutes or so but 
um I do want to ask a few more questions here's just actually a comment that I'm going to pop up from Maggie Smith I'm Andy's friend that Preston met at Stacy's should I say hello sure hello gosh 
that was a long time ago so I'm not sure remember but yeah I remember it was Austin Stacy actually 
let me stay in her house which was such a good night me too yeah she's a truly wonderful lady 
but here is another question from Jay truth seeker and I mentioned this I'm asking did you ever meet 
Wendell Stevens I never did but I did correspond with them because he had the UFO photo archives he 
was the UFO photo guy really the go-to guy when it comes to that and I used some of his photos 
in my book UFOs over California I didn't meet him face to face but yeah he was in this field 
way back in the 1940s I don't know if you've ever rubbed doubles with him as well no ah too bad yeah 
um I'm truly amazing guy and of course he helped publish a series of books of 
contactees that is different from your average you know 
quote abduction I'm sorry I know you don't like that word she won't use it but yeah he wrote a 
bunch of contactee accounts as opposed to the sort of abductee genre because he felt like Dolly like 
people are having friendly contact and a lot of fear that's surrounding the subject part of it is 
misinformation and disinformation in my labs so yeah he's a real really interesting fellow yeah 
I certainly understand your clearances too when you're I grew up military my dad was an 
Airborne Ranger and he was high placed in uh so I lived like this my whole life you know 
we don't talk about it period the end end of sentence and and then I did work for the 
military and I wasn't allowed to say anything and I I did have an experience one night on the way to 
work and I tried to talk about it and found out really fast no we're not going there tonight no
no you know it's just and then there's ndas and you have to live with those 
and it's just the life you live you know you set you up and it leaves you open to 
being watched you know I that's a question for you have you ever felt like you're monitored 
in any way shape or form from the jobs that you did for the you know government 
yeah Allison Carr's asking that did you ever run into the Men in Black
um don't think so or I don't remember if I did okay wow I did I did have oh I guess it's time 
to go so yeah well we've got a few minutes but I would like to just give you a chance to 
um promote some of your books and yes you know what's going on because you do have here sacred 
corridors Secrets behind the real Project Blue Book Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Roswell 
Memory Metal Dr John heineck and UFO cover-ups well I was in I was in the Blue Room the uh 
actual buildings been identified as a blue room I didn't know it was a blue room when I was in it 
but I went to a UFO meeting yet that's cool yeah and UFOs today 
um yeah these books are very well received I encourage everyone to check them out course inside the lightning bar scientific study it's really delightful Irena that you're able to apply 
you know truth science to this because there's so many people out there just speculating wildly and saying things with absolutely no support and there are absolutely contrary to basic science 
so I'm very really happy to see that you're putting out some very you know information that 
can be verified and is really is through Amazon who's your publisher uh my publisher is applying 
this press in England and the publisher for the Purdue book was Purdue University 
um the UFO books have all been flying this press and we're coming out with the new one in September 
which is really good it's about pascagola and we've got a whole lot of other Witnesses 
um and saw things you know the same time as as the Pasadena abduction
all right well any last words you want to leave with our audience before we close up the show for tonight well I wish somebody explained the whole thing to me
no I mean but if you ever want to chat with me I'd love to talk to you I want to I would love to have 
a conversation with you yeah I'd be interested so great okay we will do that I'm going to talk to 
you after the show okay okay all right dollies I think we have to close it down now we're pushing 
two hours so if you watching the liking and we were coming to you from New Orleans at the United 
Radio public with the United public radio network at 107.7 and the uh UFO paranormal radio network 
at 105.3 we love y'all we hope to see you again uh next Monday Irena thank you so very very much this 
has been thank you um thank you and we want to say goodbye to all our people see you next time bye.
