ETS TEACH PEOPLE TO LEVITATE

Summary:
Dec 2, 2022
A UFO encounter can have many profound effects upon a witness. A person can be physically affected, with such symptoms as injuries or healings. An encounter affects a person mentally, challenging their world view. A UFO encounter is also a very emotional experience and can trigger the full range of emotions. But it goes beyond that. A close encounter can also transform a person spiritually, triggering a wide variety of paranormal events. It’s not unusual for contactees to experience OBEs, precognition, past-life memories, channeling, ghostly encounters and more.

One of the most bizarre effects, one that has received little attention, is that following an encounter, some abductees experience spontaneous human levitation. As unusual as this may sound, there are a growing number of cases. This video presents more than a dozen cases of people who have levitated as a result of a UFO encounter. It appears that ETs are teaching people how to levitate.

One case comes from French researchers Aime Michel and Jacques Vallee. It involves an anonymous medical doctor who had a close encounter that healed him of a wound on his ankle and partial paralysis. Following the encounter, the doctor also experienced two episodes of spontaneous human levitation.

Whitley Strieber (author of Communion and other books) also reports having a spontaneous levitation experience in his cabin in upstate New York. Strieber had just gone to bed one evening in 1986 when he found himself floating up to the ceiling. He rose up and down several times before finally coming down to a landing in his bed. Following this experience, he began to research these experiences and located two other contactees who reported nearly identical events.

Another well-known contactee who has experienced spontaneous levitation is Dr. Steven Greer MD, founder of CSETI. Following an onboard UFO experience at age nineteen in his hometown of Boone, NC, Greer found himself able to make leaping bounds, floating more than twenty feet with each step. Some years later, he experienced another even more profound episode of spontaneous levitation and floated a few feet above the ground for several yards before coming in for a landing.

These cases are not as rare as you might think. Researcher Budd Hopkins (author of Missing Time and Intruders) uncovered two cases, both involving children who were having UFO experiences. In each case, the children levitated on several occasions. In both cases, the witnesses connected their levitations to their UFO encounters.

A firsthand case comes from a man by the name of Maurice who reports that in 1966, he and his sister were taken onboard a craft. In the hours following the experience, both found that they had the ability to levitate. They floated around the basement for an hour and afterwards played with this ability in their yard. 

In 1951, eight-year-old Mary Frank (who would later discover she was a contactee) experienced a profound levitation event during which she flew down a corridor for several yards, even turning corners, before coming to a soft landing on her feet. She tried several times to duplicate it but was never able to repeat the experience.

In 1953, five-year-old Ramon (who would later become an officer in the Marines) was taken onboard a UFO from his home in California. Following the encounter, he discovered that he was able to levitate. In the days and weeks following his onboard encounter, he levitated on at least three separate occasions, two episodes which were verified by outside witnesses.

In another case, a mother went to check on her infant child and discovered that her baby was floating above her crib. Later, her child would report many UFO experiences, including being taken onboard a UFO.

Researcher Rey Hernandez reports on the case of Alberto Fernandez, a contactee from Florida. On one occasion, Fernandez’s wife woke to find her husband floating above his bed, sound asleep.

Another amazing case comes from fully conscious contactee, Dolly Safran. Throughout her life, Dolly has had numerous onboard UFO encounters. She also reports many cases of spontaneous levitations. While most of these occurred as a young child, even as an adult she experienced levitation, and on several occasions, the related phenomenon of telekinesis.

Many other cases exist. The dozen cases presented here are likely only the tip of the iceberg. One thing is clear, there is a connection between human levitation and the UFO contact experience. ETs are teaching people a wide variety of psychic abilities, including the ability to levitate.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the 
Paranormal got a very special episode for you today this is something pretty different I think 
the title of this episode is et's teach people to levitate and yes this is actually a thing 
UFO contact can be incredibly spiritually and psychically transformative as a general rule 
people who have contact experience a large variety of paranormal and psychic events people who have 
contact often come away from their experiences with a whole range of abilities everything from 
astral travel past life recall healing remote viewing mediumship all kinds of things and 
among these is the ability to levitate and I'm not talking about people being lifted up by beams of 
Lights from UFOs this is an innate natural human ability I did write a book about human levitation 
it's been well verified in a laboratory setting cases occur all over the world they reach back 
thousands of years actually there are well over 330 documented cases so my point is levitation 
is a thing but there is a connection between having UFO contact and the ability to levitate 
I've got about a dozen cases I'd like to share with you today some some of them involving high 
profile figures in this field such as Whitley streber and Stephen Greer and others I've also got 
a very special treat a first-hand interview with Dolly saffron subject of my book symmetry where 
we're going to talk about her experiences with levitation and how it's connected to UFO contact 
of the Dozen cases that I'm presenting here I suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg because most people aren't talking about this this is quite a fantastic experience that people have 
and it's one thing to talk about having experiences with ETS and UFOs and quite 
another to tell people guess what I flew but this is happening and each time I talk about this 
I actually hear more cases so I've got a lot I want to share with you and let's just get started 
the first case I'd like to discuss comes from French ufologists Ain Michelle and Jacques Vale 
and the main witness is an anonymous medical doctor identified only by the pseudonym Dr X 
but it did appear on French television so here is his picture and his experience is really quite 
interesting it was the early morning hours of November 6 1968 when Dr X was woken in his home 
in southern France by the cries of his infant son and walking into his son's bedroom he saw bright 
flashes of light coming from outside and looking outside he saw two large glowing disc shaped 
objects hovering outside these two discs merged into one which then turned onto its side and sent 
a powerful beam of light into his house this was followed by a loud bang and the disc disappeared 
at this point the doctor returned to his bedroom and very dazed and tired went straight to bed 
and uh the next morning he had largely forgotten what happened until he tripped down the stairs and 
it all came back to him but his wife did notice that there were strange things going on because 
he had an ankle wound a wound on his ankle he had been chopping wood with an ax a few days earlier 
and gashed his ankle real bad and this wound was completely gone it was scarred over the whole deal 
and furthermore he was suffering from partial paralysis from injuries suffered 
in the Algerian War years earlier and this was also gone he no longer walked with a limp he 
was a professional piano player but had to give it up and he could play piano again 
so he was healed of two conditions and that's not the only thing I think what is important 
here is what happened a few weeks later as Jacque Valley writes and I quote finally 
there is the matter of the Paranormal phenomena that now take place around them 
coincidences of a telepathic nature are frequently reported and the doctor has even on at least one 
occasion experienced levitation without being able to control it according to Amy Michelle 
this actually happened twice the doctor also reported weird problems with watches and other 
electrical equipment which is common among contact DS but yeah the doctor floated right up out of his 
bed and right up to the cathedral ceilings which were quite high up it happened twice and on one 
occasion he happened to be holding a piece of fly paper in his hand which he went all the way up to 
the ceiling and stuck it on the ceiling so he was able to verify this to a certain extent when his 
wife saw this fly paper stuck to the ceiling and this is just one case of a contact D who levitated 
following his encounter there's something about an encounter that is very spiritually transformative 
and the second case I'd like to cover comes from Whitley streber author of the record-breaking best 
seller communion and many other books he's very well known in this field as being a UFO contactee 
but on the evening of July 18 1986 Whitley had just closed his eyes and lay down to sleep in 
bed when he heard his sheets rustling strangely he opened his eyes and received an incredible shock 
and I'll just quote him directly as he talks about this experience of levitating as he says 
I was disoriented by what I saw the first thing I was aware of was that I could see 
my hands straight out in front of me as if they were pointed up at the ceiling 
the ceiling had changed remarkably it is a raw pine ceiling slightly angled towards its peak 
following the cant of the roof now however it appeared flat and there was what looked like 
a huge rectangular Appliance hanging from it I lay there staring blankly at the scene before 
me after a moment I realized that the big rectangular object had a woman stuck to it 
I had the horrible feeling that the whole thing woman and all was about to come off the ceiling 
and fall on me that I realized there was a quilt on it and sheets our quilt our sheets 
beside the woman was an empty place the scene resolved itself it was our bed the woman was Anne 
suddenly I comprehended that I was on the ceiling I had somehow been pulled up against the ceiling 
so at this point Whitley felt as though he was starting to move through the ceiling itself but 
he sank down and floated up again up and down a few more times uh and was not really able to 
control it then as Whitley says a short time later I went spiraling down to the bed moving 
through the air quickly and Landing Softly I had not been unconscious when this took place 
I had not been asleep there was no Amnesia and no confusion I was aware of the fact that I had risen 
up to the ceiling remained there for a period of time and then floated back down to the bed 
so following this Whitley did fall asleep but events weren't over yet as Whitley says even 
the next morning I did not feel normally heavy the mere Act of walking fast produced in me the 
impression that I might take off again so this really impressed Whitley and he started asking 
around he talked to some other contactees and learned that his experience was not unique 
as he says and again I quote recently physical levitation has been associated with a number of 
contact cases in January of 1988 I met another person who has had the visitor experience 
when she finally felt comfortable with me she told me the things she considers strangest about her encounters I levitated she said with a defiant expression I'm sure I did 
two months later another woman had a levitation experience strikingly similar to mine 
so this it's clear to me that this is a byproduct of UFO contact 
and consider what happened to Dr Stephen Greer MD who's very well known for starting the group C 
seti the center for the study of extraterrestrial intelligence and is also spearheaded largely 
the disclosure movement it was October 1973 and Greer was celebrating his 18th birthday 
he had gone hiking in the mountains outside his home in Boone North Carolina when he saw a UFO 
it was a short time later he was approached by a quote an extraterrestrial biological life form 
the next thing he knew he was being transported into a craft and on board he was greeted he says 
by short four foot tall humanoids with soft deer-like eyes the craft turned transparent 
at one point to reveal a beautiful field of stars and what followed was for him a deeply spiritual 
experience during which he and the et's meditated together and experienced a cosmic consciousness 
so Greer had no fear during this experience instead he calls it quote an incredible encounter 
entirely different from stories usually circulated about extraterrestrial contact 
I wouldn't call it entirely different there's a lot of stories very much like this but at any 
rate this experience ended he was removed from the craft and placed back near his original location 
but it was what happened immediately following his encounter that left him even more amazed 
as Stephen Greer writes and again I quote I found myself back on the mountain under the beautiful 
Starry Sky only to experience another strange phenomenon I was perhaps 100 yards further down 
the Gravel Road as I started down the mountain I found that with each step I was in a state of 
near weightlessness as if walking on the moon my steps were actually leaps of 20 to 30 feet at once 
it was more like floating than walking there was a strange magnetic anti-gravitational effect around 
me making me lighter it wasn't a product of my imagination my physical body was light I was just 
as happy as a lark here I was fresh from this experience on an ETV and now bounding down the 
mountain traveling in Boeing Boeing Boeing leaves across impossible distances with each step it was 
incredibly blissful as I got closer to Town the phenomenon faded and my weight returned to normal 
so again this is clear this is not an out of body experience this is happening during full waking consciousness Greer was totally amazed by this event and following this encounter in this 
levitation event he began meditating regularly and calling out to et's telepathically and it 
was just a few years later that he had another incredible levitation experience and as Greer 
writes in his own words as I was walking in the field behind the manor where we were working 
I spontaneously without effort or forethought levitated it was reminiscent of the prolonged 
experience of bounding down the Mountainside after my ET encounter in October of 73. 
this time I just lifted vertically maybe two or three three feet above the ground 
instead of walking to my destination I glided there in an upright vertical levitation experience 
and then at the moment my intellect kicked in and I exclaimed my god look what's happening how 
can I be doing this I settled down to earth it was halted by my own intellect and ego 
so following this Greer came to the conclusion that all humans likely can levitate and I really 
like what he says about this as Stephen Greer writes ultimately is recognizing and embracing 
the power of God within each of us after this experience it became increasingly clear that 
we have within us any capability and that anyone can acquire and develop them there is sometimes 
a tendency by people involved in various spiritual and religious groups to put people 
who have this level of experience or knowledge on a pedestal as if it's unattainably Unique 
it's not and that's very important to understand it is in fact a disservice to the nature and 
potential of humanity to idolize something that should be understood as the birthright of everyone 
I totally agree anyone can do this you don't even need to have UFO contact it just gives you a boost 
and I was able to interview a person first hand who had the same experience 
this comes from a gentleman called Maurice who had an experience when he was only 10 years old he was taken on board with his sister as Maurice says and I 
quote I have shared many times how in 1966 my older sister and I were taken on board a UFO 
after we were back we were in the basement jumping over a mattress on the floor 
we were able to go so high we nearly hit the light bulb on the ceiling then I set up an 
obstacle course in the yard I found it easy to run and leap over things like saw horses and such 
the ability of levitation shortly after being brought back stuck in my mind for years 
so yeah I believe holy that we are able to develop abilities like this 
and this may sound uncommon but I don't think it is bud Hopkins the author of missing time 
Intruders and other books does have several cases he interviewed a gentleman he calls 
Spencer a television Anchorman turned Entertainer who is also a UFO contactee 
and Spencer told Hopkins that there was a short period during his early childhood when he was 
able to levitate repeatedly he called it quote the floating stage and Spencer told Bud Hopkins that 
his many flights took place exclusively on one particular staircase usually when he was running 
as Spencer says I'd hit the landing and I swear to you that I'd float up over that Landing 
sometimes I thought I'd hit the ceiling but then somehow I'd end up at the bottom of the 
stairs without ever having walked down them at a certain point in my life it happened a lot 
I didn't make anything of it I just thought I was at you know the floating stage I didn't know I 
was a kid I thought everybody floated so at the time that bud Hopkins was interviewing Spencer 
he speculated or concluded that it was the result of a UFO experience but he wondered if perhaps 
there was a UFO above the house levitating Spencer however Spencer did not agree with that he saw no 
light beams or anything nor was he taken on board during these episodes and Hopkins has 
another case he recounts another contact d and his brother and uh the brother his name is Peter 
reports that he often flew as a young child not only at his home but at a friend's home 
as Peter says and I quote I was doing it in my bedroom I was doing it at Eric avilar's house 
I'm flying around his room that's right I remember that in the bedroom I can even tell you what it 
feels like I honestly do remember floating around in our bedroom and also over at Eric avilar's 
house floating around their house it was a kick I know what it feels like to be flying around I'd 
be way up there too I'd be almost to the ceiling but I don't think I was steering or in control 
so quite a few cases I did interview a lady a family friend by the name of Mary Frank who had 
this experience as a young child at the time I wasn't aware that she was a UFO contactee I 
didn't think to ask but later she did tell me that yes she has had experiences they're quite 
personal to her she doesn't really want to get uh involves in terms of an interview formally 
uh it's all very personal to hear and she just doesn't want to share these experiences she's had as a contactee but she was happy to share her levitation experience it occurred back in 
1951 when she was eight years old as Mary says in her own words my parents were taking me to the 
doctor the doctor's office is a fairly large office building an older building in Chicago 
we got off the floor at the doctor's office it was a square-shaped building and to get to the office 
that I had to go to I had to walk three-fourths of a square all the way around to the other side 
so kind of a horseshoe and as Mary says I ran ahead of my parents and 
I had a sensation of light changing in the corridor it wasn't a bright light but it was 
more like a glowing feeling I felt like the faster I ran this glowing feeling around me 
not in myself but in the exterior around me intensified and I felt my legs no longer 
touching the ground I felt that I could fly and I looked down and I was flying 
and I didn't go very high because I was inside but I was at least three feet off the ground and 
it lasted for however long it took me to go around the corner probably 30 seconds I flew around the 
corner inside the building nobody was there I was ahead of my family I was going fairly fast 
it was more like a floaty well it wasn't probably too much faster than a really fast run except I 
wasn't running I remember the sensation of flying and I felt elevated I was steady as a bird I do 
remember thinking oh my God I'm flying in other words recognition came right away 
I remember being very very astounded by it totally astounded it was amazing but not scary 
because I felt safe I was amazed it was neat I wasn't thinking anything but how neat it was 
you know I was a kid and at that age anything seems possible sort of wow I learned to fly 
and Mary continues when I came to my feet I had this sensation of being placed down as opposed to 
Falling or all of the sudden not flying I felt almost placed back down on the ground that's 
what I remember I remember running back to my mom and dad telling them you won't believe what just 
happened to me I just flew around the corner and when I tried to tell them about it they said of 
course yeah sure but no one could ever talk me out of the fact that I had flown because I felt I had
so there's another experience and there are quite a few others there's definitely a strange 
connection here between UFO encounters and human levitation not too long ago I 
did interview another contact D who does not remember levitating herself but was told by 
her mother that she saw her child the contact d as an infant floating a few feet above her crib 
it freaked her mother out she quickly scooped her up and put her back into bed uh here's another 
case involving a gentleman who I did an interview personally he's a Marine officer a good Witness 
but in 1953 Ramon as I call him was only six years old he was living in a government housing 
project with his family in the Hanson Dam Area of Southern California this is in San Fernando 
and at that time he had experienced a series of three onboard experiences with this UFO that was 
landing near his home and it was just a few hours after the first of these experiences that he began 
to spontaneously levitate after being let out of the craft he went back into his home as Ramon 
says I went to my room and I closed the door I had this real comfortable red patch sofa and I 
sat down upon it I don't know how this happened but I began to levitate inside the apartment I 
went straight up and I started to touch the light fixtures I touched the curtains the curtain rods I 
used my hands to walk across the ceiling and then I went right back to the top of the sofa and I 
went straight down so he was super excited he ran out of his room and told his mom Mom I just flew 
his mom was disbelieving and sent him outside to play hide and seek with the neighborhood kids 
this was early morning when this happened and while playing this game Ramon levitated again 
because he had just joined the game of hide and seek he was designated as the seeker and as Ramon says I started counting backward from a hundred and I got down to about 70 and I went 
into a stupor it was like I just fell asleep right there and the next thing I knew I'm on 
top of the roof of the housing units and I'm able to hear the children wherever they are underneath 
a car behind the bushes or wherever and the next thing I know I'm standing right in front of them 
and I brought them back to the tire that was the place where they everyone hid from 
and as Ramon says then I started walking away and this thing repeated itself I went back to 
the top of the roof I don't know how I got there I just levitated right back up on top 
there and I could hear the children and I went to the next group and they became frightened 
so at this point all the kids were freaking out and they asked him how did you do that how is this happening he had no explanation to give him he didn't fully understand it himself it just 
happened spontaneously and not surprisingly this did break up the game of Hide and Seek 
but it was not the last time Ramon levitated it was one week later when it happened again 
he was in his home and normally he would be outside go playing but he felt himself falling 
into this trance again and moments later he comes out of his trance and finds himself standing on 
the roof of the building and there was a small crowd of people below him saying don't move stand still I knew he's just a little kid but there was no way to get up onto this ceiling 
it was locked they had to call the firemen a fire truck arrived they sent up a ladder and 
quickly carried him down from the roof nobody asked Ramon personally how he got there instead 
the fire chief approached his parents and asked how did your son get up there and they had no 
explanation and the only access to the roof was locked was impossible for Ramon to be up there 
so that was his last experience that he recalls but later he would have many more encounters 
and yeah the more I talk about this the more I hear in fact Ray Hernandez who's quite well 
known in this field I was doing a podcast with him and I brought this up and he says wow you 
know I'm glad you mentioned this because I did talk to a contact D it's a good friend of his by 
the name of Alberto Fernandez from Florida who's had repeated contact his whole life 
and Ray Hernandez was speaking with Alberto and Alberto told him that he did have a levitation 
experience Alberto doesn't remember it turns out he was asleep and his wife woke up next to 
him and found that Alberto was floating above the bed about three feet sleeping 
this is a category of levitation I call sleeping levitation there's quite a few cases but this is 
one that's absolutely connected to UFO contact and I think another case which is really interesting 
uh is when I was doing another interview with a podcaster who I won't name but we started talking 
about this subject contactees who have levitated and he was so amazed he's like I'm so glad you 
brought this up because I never tell anybody this no one would ever believe it but since 
you brought it up I will tell you and he said and as I and I quote when I was a kid I used to 
be able to levitate one time I did it and I got stuck on the ceiling I remember that it happened 
so this is absolutely a thing and to close this off I'd like to bring on one of my favorite 
contact D's really one of my favorite people on Earth ever and that's Dolly saffron she's the 
subject of my book symmetry A true UFO Adventure she's a fully conscious contact D and has had all 
kinds of really amazing experiences and certainly this involves levitation and she is going to share 
with us some of her experiences with levitation Hello Dolly thanks for joining me today
yeah as you know I'm doing an episode on human levitation and how ETS have taught people to 
levitate or are levitating as a result of contact or the whole connection here and know that in our 
book on your experiences the oximetry a true UFO Adventure you talked about some levitation 
experiences this was something I asked you kind of out of the blue because I was doing research 
on this and had discovered there is definitely a connection between levitation and UFO experiences 
and contactees having this ability and uh I would really love to talk to you about it a 
little bit more in depth than we covered in the book okay uh because I cut you know I 
found a lot of cases and it's really amazing so I know that uh we covered at least four uh 
specific instances and some psychic stuff that I think is connected to this telekinesis and such 
so I thought we would just go through some of these and explore you know your thoughts 
on levitation and when I say levitation this is not et's lifting people up on a beam of light 
this is something that's internally generated uh I believe so yeah you had this experience I 
think the first one was when you were just a wee little thing two years old oh almost 10 months 
oh really yeah no not the one in the crib well okay two years old yes that was on my own yes 
yeah because the one in the crib was they was they were lifting you up right right yeah 
yeah so um yeah I'm talking about that experience you had at age two were you I 
was looking for a hiding place yeah but let's cover that one this is nice interesting to me 
um my mom would play games with me sometimes and to keep me occupied while she was doing housework 
she'd say let's play hide and seek and so this became a regular thing and especially when she 
was pregnant and uh I was constantly looking for the best place to go and I looked up at the closet 
one day in the hallway and I thought hmm and I knew there was nothing up there and she had 
a hard time getting up there little on anybody else so I wanted up there and I kept thinking how am I going to get up there and I thought about a chair I thought about her step stool 
none of it out me and then I thought okay I'm just gonna I went up there and I kept staring 
at it and thinking oh just up up up how do I get up and the next thing I know after about 
an entire afternoon of staring at it and thinking this I suddenly shot straight up and went toward 
the door pretty quickly and I slammed it back as I approached it and then I went in and uh I curled 
around in it and I shut the door and I started laughing because I realized that I'd done it 
um I laughed hysterically for a long time until she found me and she couldn't understand what she thought I was laughing at her not finding me I was laughing because I had just levitated 
myself up into the top of that closet it gave me all kinds of ideas and then became my quest 
to keep levitating I would do anything to do that I mean oh my God think about it so yeah 
that was the biggest day she freaked out they changed all the locks she called my Dad they 
bought a dog they were so worried that somebody was in the house messing with my mom but no it 
was me all right so there's no way you could have climbed up that no no it was a Florida 
closet they they have the doors the height of the doors is probably seven feet and then above the 
doors are the two closets and they have the swing doors you know they go back and forth and that's a good eight feet up and I didn't the hallway was about three and a half feet wide and 
there was no way I couldn't have done my arms on the hall or anything I was just two so yeah no way up so at that age were you thinking that this was unusual or a natural thing or 
I it was natural for me in other words this I was experiencing something that I felt normal to me 
um I don't even know how to think about it any other way I've thought about this over the years 
um this is just normal for me um I think we all have this ability I really do 
um I just have to work at it yeah I mean in my book human levitation I found 300 cases stretching 
Back 2 000 years it's in all cultures and yeah it's particularly prominent among people who 
are spiritual I guess would be a way of putting it nuns and monks and medicine men and so forth 
but absolutely children comprise a good portion of cases because I think they're 
still kind of awake or connected to these well I didn't know I couldn't let's put it that way 
yeah I think that does a lot to people if you think you can't you don't and I didn't know I couldn't so I did and when you did this was it like just 
willpower I guess would be the way of putting it or how to do it my mind okay what I've learned 
since that happened is is that my mind capable of um my my Who I Am The Entity me not the body me 
or the my physical mind me but my Consciousness is capable of altering uh my situation in other words 
I think that um once I can move my Consciousness up and out almost like an Obe my body follows me 
wherever I go if I will it okay and there's energy in our bodies it's I call it prona 
that's what I was taught that it was and that energy goes with me and it literally 
pulls my body up it lifts it up it has that kind of power and it would lift me up and it's still 
when I levitate and can levitate that's what's happening I'm I'm my Consciousness is leaving 
my body but my body is following me because I'm willing it to and it's a an altered state to be in 
and you can't reach it you can well that's exactly how people have described it other people who I've 
you know interviewed or researched describe it exactly like that so this you know that closet 
incident was not a singular event you went up to the closet again a couple of times is that 
right just just because in the middle of the night I'd get up and wander around the house and I practiced I would do it over and over and over again I started um we lived we weren't out 
in the Glades yet we were near a lake and uh I had the ability to go outside when I could 
get outside and find trees we had lots of trees and um I found out that I didn't have to climb I 
could lift myself up into the tree and just hang out there which became my favorite place to be 
um then I started walking out when I got older I started walking physically out of the house and 
thinking about it and actually lifting straight up into the air and I could move around our property 
I could go around or you know about a mile away and come back um I didn't have the guts to go 
to downtown Miami in the beach but I I was at least within the area that I was that I felt 
comfortable in um I did that at night a lot um I had a habit of going down the hallway the big 
long hallway in our Ranch and uh going up the walls to the ceiling and I'd flip over and put 
my footprints on the ceiling because it drove my mother insane I get my feet dirty and leave prints one day a little practical joke for you pretty much my brother caught me and wanted me to take 
me I was outside and he wanted to come up in the tree with me I was way up in the tree he's only like a year and a half two years old and well he was two because I was five and uh I brought 
him up in the tree with me I levitated my own brother which kind of was amazing that I could do that I took him I physically held him and he his weight came with me somehow and I found out 
that I could lift objects that way called them I got him all the way up the top of the tree 
and my mom you know mother's got a sixth sense okay and she came out looking for us and she's 
like golly Dolly and I'm not saying anything it's like no and she looked up and there we were and 
she freaked out and I had to put him back on my chest making hold on to me and come back down 
and I was reverse levitating I was coming down really slow because I was afraid to kill him in front of her and she threatened me after that never ever ever again take him anywhere like 
that don't do it you know I think it dawned on her because it's 150 foot tree and I was 
five years old and he was two there's no way he could have climbed up there I lied to her and said I helped to teach him to climb there's no meat and it dawned on her and she started 
looking at me funny after that like so all our activities got put in this Garden they had and 
we got left in there with high walls around us and she figured we'd be safer that way [Music]
because you knew it would you know you never like showed it off is what I mean yeah no I kept 
it to myself people would freak out my mother's reaction convinced me that uh there's no way I 
was gonna show this to anybody else after that she made me feel different to the point that 
um you know wouldn't let anybody see um I would go out in the woods we had tons of trees in the Glades and I'd get up in a tree and I'd not be happy with that tree I'd go to 
another tree and I could levitate over you know just eject myself over and get in it 
um so we were like going I mean this was like fun yeah I got to liking willow trees I could sit in 
the top of a willow tree just fine and things like that and I also found out that I could skim water 
um we lived on on Lake system and uh yeah I'll go out about 20 feet and come back you know and 
um it's not walking on the water you're skimming you're just going across you know in other words you've levitated up and you're going across and come back um water this is a weird situation huh I 
also think this is connected to you know how fast you can run because one lady I interviewed who 
um had levitation experiences as a child was the fastest runner in the neighborhood and could outrun all the boys and she says I actually was kind of you know I don't know how 
to describe this but I was yeah levitating this is called Running levitation this is a thing yeah practice Yeah I think about this is true because I was a gazelle and I got 
um uh approached when I was in elementary school by a man in a trench coat and a hat 
uh carrying a stick and like a cane and my best friend was with me and we were walking 
home together and uh oh yeah we covered this in the book I remember this yeah I jumped four six 
foot fences in a single bound with no trouble and I was only like seven eight years old and 
I think I levitated someone to do it I have instances where I emergency protect myself 
um when I was in my 20s I was painting the staircase in our house in Atlanta in um I 
had the cans I was going back down to get the lids and I walked right off the top step and screamed 
because I knew I was dead and I mean I screamed and I I slowed down my descent and I turned the 
corner at the bottom of the stairs and landed on my feet screaming my dad came running in there you know he thought I was dead he because he heard the cans clanking in my hands and I I only 
dripped the pain a little bit I mean it shocked me that I could do that without thinking about it so yeah yeah that's called a crisis levitation yeah there are a number of cases of research where 
people have fallen and floated down that happened to Robert Monroe across wow on the stairs floated 
down happened to him twice once he slipped on ice floated down like a feather and Rose of course the 
out of body guy and this is 100 I think connected to a person's ability to do astral projection and 
I know that you've had a lot of experiences with that so I think that that is hand in hand 
I really believe that because you're lifting your Consciousness out of your body okay and that's the 
process you're you're leaving your physical body but when you levitate your body with you you have 
to change it somehow and I think that's what's happening you go into an Albert State and comes with you and I think I think your Consciousness is capable of creating that situation I really 
do because the energy of it surrounds your body it's The Prana and it just lifts it up with you 
yeah it's funny I have a lot of cases of people on the staircases for whatever reason I think because 
it provides an opportunity but you also um did a few times you would uh jump off the roof and 
do this my dad was an Airborne Ranger and he used to jokingly teach us how to land you know we did 
the jump tuck and roll in uh on the ground and um I was very athletic and I was very gymnasticky I 
guess that's not a real word but I could summer salt and do all kinds of stuff and he wanted me 
to learn that for some reason and I took it to the roof I could get up on the roof via a tree or 
the antenna on the house and I would go our roof was almost flat it's Florida okay it had a little 
bit of a tilt and I would go to the middle of it and run down to the edge and go straight down and 
a junk tuck and roll and but I was slowing myself down I wasn't really hitting hard 
at all and it was hysterical and I do it over and over and over and it became a joke um my mother didn't like it very much because she could hear me going down the roof and then I had 
another habit I would be in the living room standing there watching TV and I would just let my body drop and I would hover just before the ground and put my hands out and stop and 
she caught me doing that twice and she couldn't believe I could do it she's like I tried to teach my brother he didn't quite get it but he tried and uh yeah so this was a thing that was pretty 
prominent during childhood but did it fade as you got older um
there's a funny thing in your brain um EarthBound and the older I got because I've had so many um accidents falling and getting hurt that 
um that plays with your brains so height levitation that kind of thing a tend not 
to want to go there anymore I think if I was in an emergency situation I could probably do it no problem I'm more telekinetic now than I am that way but when I'm with DT it's a whole 
nother matter I'm fully I'm fully um when you're in an environment where everybody's psychic and 
everybody's using that energy and everybody's amplifying it uh it just comes naturally and when I'm on board I can pretty much do whatever I want and yes I levitate a lot 
um they all do they don't really pad down on anything they levitate so yeah 
yeah well just backtracking a little bit um in terms of Crisis levitation you're falling down the 
stairs there's a lot of cases where people are in an emergency situation you know I mentioned Robert 
Monroe but I'm thinking of all the people who've lifted tractors or cars off of their loved ones 
right exactly it takes quite a bit of mental power to do that yes you can it's not your 
body doing it it's you it's your Consciousness doing it yep and when you're on Craft so peop 
I hear this a lot from people they're like I was floating around so this is them doing it you think 
it's um um just because they're in that environment being engaged yeah your pineal gland 
um when you activate it it's like when you open your eyes you have sight 
um when you're psychic your pineal gland you can turn it on and off it will in other words I can ignore it when I want to work and have it on when I want to it's a reflexive action in uh 
so I think I'm more on I'm constantly on I'm constantly being psychic when I'm with them 
and it just amplifies in other words I'm getting them they're getting me I'm able to do all of this 
it's really weird well there is to say that is because this is you know the cases I've collected 
are usually people levitate right after coming off the craft and I was still floating around you're still messing with it that's right your bineal gland is the operating wide open that's 
right you know when it's happening because everything around you changes a little bit um I see energy more uh frequently more clearly when I'm wide open with them uh when I'm here 
like I see energy but not like when I'm with them I see uh your aura here I can see the 
energy surrounding you I can see the energy of all the objects I don't really see flat surfaces 
at all people tell me oh that's a beautiful color and I'm looking at it and I'm thinking 
I'm not sure about what I'm looking at because I don't see that I see the energy of it and it 
supersedes what you're looking at so yeah but when I'm with them it blooms it goes way off the charts so and you also mentioned just offhand because I didn't get a chance to 
put this in the book that little the gray babies when they're born are floating above their cribs 
yeah that's natural ability right there oh um so they're fully activated I mean this is something 
they can do easily and so when we see the gray is floating around or the ETS in general it's because 
they're doing it psychically not necessarily mom is up to it too Mamas are able to float their 
babies as well and it's a cooperation between mother and child I really believe that okay 
um when my daughter was a little baby um I used to I woke up I was breastfeeding I was an older 
mother when I had a daughter okay and um I woke up I woke up breastfeeding and I was sitting on the 
couch and I jerked and I thought oh my God what if I drop her you know so I'd sit on the floor 
with her and put blankets down and everything and pillows and everything and I realized something 
that I wasn't hardly even holding her that she was literally levitating in my arms uh while I breastfed her because I was terrified of letting her hit the ground and I thought oh wow I can do 
that and Mama on board said yeah that's a thing it mothers kind of tend to do that you know so 
yeah there's all kinds of accounts of babies falling off Windows and stuff and they're not hurt 
right um so I think that they have that ability or something something's going on here a female 
who has a baby all your high senses are heightened including your Sixth Sense mothers are intuitive 
that's an that's a thing throughout our history that we all know mama always knows something um our sense of smell oh we know I can identify our babies by their smell we know what they hear 
we can identify the sound of our baby's voice above all others um we're capable of being uh 
connected to them we know when they're hurt crying or whatever we don't have to be in the room I mean there's a long list of what happens to you when you have a baby and the connection between 
you and your child and I I'm I've questioned growing older you know in my 30s and 40s to E.T 
explain that and they said that you're naturally using your own innate ability 
to assist you and that's how we need to start learning to think about this that 
um this is not something that we pick up and put down uh easily it's natural to us and we should 
be using it and you know I totally agree and that's kind of why I really want wanted to do 
this episode because this is one of the main uh ET agendas I guess would be a way of putting waking 
us up to our own I won't call them Supernatural they're natural abilities and this I think is 
connected to a lot of different things like I said actual projection but you know precognition and 
healing and remote viewing and I also wanted to touch on telekinesis because my sister-in-law who 
you met you know when you visited my hometown of Topanga Canyon did see grace face to face 
and this is not kisara this is my other sister-in-law right and uh she you know had seen 
UFOs seen Gray's face to face has had passed life recall out about experiences but had an experience 
with telekinesis where someone threw a coin at her and she said no put her hand out and went into the 
wall and thunked into the wall hard and that was telekinesis I know you've had a couple of really 
cool experiences with that I was wondering if we could touch on that like the one with the hat boxes coming out of the closet another one at school where you moved a book 
yeah uh the head boxes that was really small it was probably about five years old and one of my 
aunts had come over and I have a cousin who is um a a very loving sweet human being but her Ikea is 
not okay and um my aunt was yelling at her for some reason and I was upset with her you know 
you don't pick on my girl okay I loved her and uh she was really yelling at her and she came in she 
came in my room running away from her mom and her mom followed her well my closet door opened where 
my mother keeps all her hat boxes and they just flew out straight at my aunt said and screaming 
ensued people started vacating and scrambling and running and I was just sitting there going yeah don't do that anymore and my mother just glared at me like don't do that again you know and my 
aunt my aunt didn't come back for a whole month after that and she she and it's weird because it 
spiritually woke her up she said if you can do that at that age I'm gonna learn how to do this and she she was very spiritual after that which made me happy is all get out she became very very 
psychic and she learned a lot about life and I kind of feel responsible for that I was glad you 
know and another incident which had just tickled me because it was really cool when you were at uh 
the universe librarian yeah downtown Miami on Bayfront Park it's a big Library there they're 
like 12 12 or so uh yep and um well yeah 12th and I was sitting in the library my father used 
to take me down there because he had to do research and it's that big a library and uh he just turned me listen and say stay here I'll be back you know I'm like okay and I would get 
reference books because you can't take them home and I'd sit there and read them they're huge you know medical books engineering books anything I could lay my hands on and there was this huge 
medical book that I really really wanted and it was already out it was laying on the table well these tables are huge and they're backed up to one another so everybody's sitting around them 
and it was just too far for me to go get and I was leaning I was trying to grab it trying to grab it I was like oh I cannot believe this and I put both hands out I was like come to me and it did it slid 
right across the table and I looked around to see who saw it happen and nobody saw it and I was like 
and I ran ran I took the book and they have this room there that's got it was like the 60s okay and 
it was this like hippie dipping room with candles and hanging things and big old bean bags on the 
floor and I sat on the floor with this book only I put it about three feet away from me I'm like come to me come to me come to me and it started doing it over and over and then that was it when 
we left I went home that night I was like come let me have this let me have that I just worked on it all the time it's like once you learn how to do that you can't stop it's a thing you know it's 
like walking babies who get up and walk they're gonna walk so yeah yeah well telekinesis has been 
proven in a laboratory setting as by the way has levitation I don't think a lot of people know that but it's been scientists I know of at least three different occasions four right the most famous one 
that is the one that you wouldn't think of as telekinesis but it's dead up telekinesis um they put a woman in Russia in a chamber locked her in sealed it pressurized it and 
all they had in there with her she sat in a chair and there was a a device that gave a full spectrum 
ray of light okay she it was a white light and what she did the first thing she did was she 
spread the light she prismed it the light just spread into a rainbow and the next thing she did was she totally been thought down and that is televised if I'm correct it's Nina kulagina 
Kula Gina yes um because they yeah she was really good at that you had another incident 
and then I'd love to talk about this because you recently gave me the wonderful opportunity to talk 
to someone who could verify your story okay I've done this several times which is your ex 
and she said oh yeah he started verifying all the weird ET incidents and stuff but um you're like 
tell them tell me about the incident where you guys were having a little bit of a disagreement
and I was very angry with him and I have this big wooden shelf on the wall and it had all my little 
Holly Hobby figurines on it and he was standing there and he balled his fists up and that's all 
I need that's all I need to see to know that I'm going to react to that and two of the hobby 
figurines came straight off and went straight for his bed and he ducked and they smashed into 
the wall behind him and then when that wasn't good enough for me all the rest of them came and two of 
them pelted him pretty good and he just walked out the front door and didn't come back for an hour time she said that was not the only incident no no I had it I have a tendency to draw all kinds 
of energy we had a we lived in Stone Mountain and we're literally right under the mountain and you know granite's a conductor of electricity and this was an old house so we're getting ready 
to rebuild it and um I'm a lightning drawer for some reason lightning oh my God and there was no 
storm nothing but suddenly out of nowhere this bolt of lightning hit the mass head above our 
you know where the electricity comes in and every single thing in our house that was electronic and 
plugged in exploded including the microwave and I was in the kitchen um I put up a barrier around 
myself to protect myself I've been struck by like amiu then I did not want to go there again and I fell to the floor as I was doing it Patrick was in the house my ex and saw a blue white 
light surround me when I did it he thought I was struck no I was in protective mode I'm not gonna 
go and I went straight down and it freaked him out completely it completely freaked him out and 
I think this is connected to why you can't wear watches and others yeah I just did it again the 
other day I was walking in the laundry room of the house and I went to turn on a light and it knocked 
the whole Light Panel out I was like oh no I was like pushing Breakers and stuff trying to fix it 
it's not a half again I have to ground when I go to touch anything I have to ground the arc on it 
all right yeah well this is cool this is exactly what I wanted to talk about um this is so common among contactees and as you know I found a dozen cases and I think there's a 
lot more because people have a tendency not to mention this you didn't mention it when I was interviewing you I was hard to talk to people that's why I'm glad you're doing this because 
people need to talk I mean I would love to hear what other people have to say I'm kind of encouraging it right now if you got a story tell it because we all need to get on the same 
page with this we all need to admit that we have these abilities and use them at CT's found this 
desire that we do that so yeah all right well that's awesome thanks so much for sharing these 
really cool stories but it's awesome that you know so many people are experiencing this and I 
think that shows you know how contact can be very spiritually or psychically probably is a better 
word transformative yes and Awakening and bring people to a new level of being coming a complete 
normal human being is how I'll put it so just to close this off is there anything you want to say 
but we might have missed in terms of you know experiences of the mechanics of this or any 
last messages you want to give to people just that um in the mechanics of this the one thing that will shut you down is negativity okay anger anger can make a telekinetic emotional tirade in 
your brain but mostly when you're trying to use it in a controlled way it's not anger it's not high 
emotion it's not negativity it's all positivity so you have to learn to reach that part of your brain that one's better at it than the anger part of it the older guy's stuff so just remember that very 
cool well thanks so much dolly that was awesome I always enjoy doing these interviews with you and I 
always learn something so thanks so much welcome bye bye all right there you go a dozen cases 
of contactees who have levitated or learned how to levitate as a result of their UFO encounters 
I did Cover these cases in my brand new book not from here volume 4 and of course Dolly's story is 
covered in my book symmetry A true UFO Adventure and if you want to learn more about levitation in 
general definitely you might be interested in checking out my book human levitation 
which covers basically the entire history of this subject on our planet and as you can see 
human levitation is a natural human ability we all have this ability UTS are trying very hard 
to wake us up to our natural human abilities and levitation is among the most dramatic of these 
but it's all connected and I think it's really important that people know about this and try to 
develop themselves psychically and spiritually that's really why I wanted to do this video 
so fun and interesting and just imagine being able to fly wouldn't that be awesome so that's 
it for today I really want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next 
time keep searching for answers keep asking questions and most important keep having fun.
