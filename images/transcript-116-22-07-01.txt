UFO DISPLAYS: SEVEN STRANGE CASES
Jul 1, 2022

Summary:
Jul 1, 2022
According to several polls, the majority of people (at least in the USA) believe in the reality of UFOs. Yet, the UFOs themselves remain somewhat evasive. In other words, you can't just go outside and see a UFO anytime you want. And yet, sometimes you can!

There is a type of UFO behavior that investigators call "displays." In these cases, UFOs will brazenly appear over witnesses and put on a show, darting around and dancing across the sky as though they want to be seen. This type of activity is clearly a publicity campaign, involving what appears to be an agenda to announce their presence and convince people that UFOs are real, and we are not alone.

This video presents seven cases that fit this unique category of UFOs that have overcome their typical shyness and instead are showing off. These types of events have been occurring for decades and are still going on today.

1945: Mount Baden-Powell, California. Joe Stein and twenty other young boy-scouts are camping in the forest when a multi-colored object shows up and remains in the sky for most of the night.

1954: The Blue Ridge Parkway, Virginia. Bob X. is in the backseat of his parents' car traveling along the highway when an enormous shiny silver disc shows up and begins pacing their car.

1970s: Encino, California. Ronny Baron has experienced several UFO sightings throughout his life, but after moving to California he experienced three spectacular displays. One occurred over his home and was also witnessed by his son. A second occurred at a daytime party and was witnessed by twenty people. And a third occurred in the central valley in California.

1972: Costa Mesa, California. Traffic stops in the streets, people rush out of their homes and offices, and thousands of people stare upwards to see a humongous, perfectly oval, cloud-like object filled with soft pastel, multi-colored lights scoot across the sky.

1978: Palm Springs, California. Chris S., her brother and friend are camping outside when three star-like objects (red, yellow and green) start cavorting and dancing around in the sky, putting on a spectacular display.

1983: Lake Naciemento, California. Robert X and six friends observe multiple clusters of lights darting around the night sky for all night long. As they drive around, they see many other people pulling off the road to observe the dramatic display.

1990: Pasadena, California. Arni Whyler receives a telepathic message to look outside his window. A UFO instantly appears and performs an incredible maneuver. Shortly later a mysterious beam of light sweeps over his house, followed by an eerie silence and other weird effects. He also experienced another display as a young boy in Cleveland, Ohio.

These seven cases illustrate how the UFO occupants sometimes have no fear of being seen and are in fact announcing their presence. The question is why? Could it be that this is preparation for a future open official contact with all of humanity? Time will tell!

UFO DISPLAYS: SEVEN STRANGE SIGHTINGS
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode ufo displays seven strange sightings as a general rule ufos are evasive the 
sightings are usually brief often quite distanced and off they go on their way you can't just go 
outside at any given time and see a ufo however on other occasions this type of behavior makes a 180 
degree turnaround and ufos behave in a way that can only be called a display where they brazenly 
show themselves as if wanting to be seen and in fact I think that's exactly what they are doing 
they want us to know about them there are a lot of cases like this I want to present seven cases 
in this episode that I've personally investigated where ufos show this type of brazen showing off 
behavior putting on a display I think these cases are not only interesting in that regard but also 
have some other interesting elements that provide information about the nature of the ufo phenomenon 
so that's why I wanted to do this episode view today these cases stretch back decades all the 
way up to current times and I think you'll find quite interesting I certainly hope 
so at any rate let's just get started and the first case I want to talk about I call 
a boy scout ufo encounter this case is really interesting because it occurred in 1945 
this is before roswell before the modern age of ufos and it occurred to a group of boy scouts 
who were camping out in california at mount baden powell this is a national forest area 
and the main witness is a gentleman I used to work with by the name of joe stein 
as a little boy he was out with a group of about 20 other young boy scouts when everyone woke up 
to view a dramatic ufo display and I'll just let joe describe their sighting in his own words 
as he says I remember waking up and looking out and on the horizon I saw these three lights 
i think they were somewhat stationary I don't remember them moving from one area to another 
the first thing I thought was what are those lights doing there if I remember correctly they 
weren't that far but the thing that bothered me more than anything was the distance between the 
lights in other words it was a large something whatever it was it was not small they were bright 
enough that I knew there were three different colors I remember there was a variety of colors 
so joe estimates that this object was about a half mile away he and his fellow boy scouts watched it 
for about 20 minutes and they never saw it move there was no sound and at some point they went 
to bed of course they investigated to see if there was any structures in the area which there was not 
this was a wilderness area and none of them were able to figure out what this thing was 
at that time there wasn't much talk of ufos really at all so they didn't have any theories until 
later when the subject of ufos became more popular it's a very interesting sighting not only because 
it's a multi-witness sighting but it involves a very large apparently structured object and it's 
a very long sighting and typical of these sort of cases in which ufos appear to want to be seen 
so that's the first case I'd like to present but there are others here's another case which I call 
THE BLUERIDGE PARKWAY SIGHTING
the blue ridge parkway sighting this occurred in 1954 and the main witness I call bob that is 
his real name but he did not want his last name used he's currently a musician and a magazine 
article writer and as a young kid around age eight he had an incredible sighting 
while driving with his parents along the brew blue ridge parkway in central virginia 
it was daytime they're cruising along the highway his parents are deeply involved in 
a discussion and bob is sitting in the back seat and looking outside his window he sees an enormous 
bright silver disc shaped craft pacing his car high up in the sky moving in and out of the clouds 
and again I'll just let bob describe in his own words what he saw as he says I was riding in the 
back seat of the car I was with my parents and I looked up and I saw a large disk going through 
the clouds it was just scattered clouds but it was going in and out of the clouds 
would come out you'd see a large disk and it would enter into a cloud it wasn't above or below it it would go through it and it was easily the size of our 747s it was fast 
roughly the same speed as a jet fighter a silver colored aluminum colored disk it was way up there 
i tried to get them to see it I pointed and I got in a lot of trouble for interrupting their 
conversation and they yelled at me for that about 15 minutes later when they got through talking 
they turned around and said okay now what was it you had to say that was so important 
of course it was gone by then and even at age eight I knew better than to say it was a flying 
saucer because then I'd really get in trouble but it was there I really saw it I can't say 
what I saw it was a disc it was a very large disk it was not my imagination so this is another 
very interesting daylight sighting you saw it for a good minute or two 
and it was very large very obvious it was not a planar helicopter he's quite sure about that 
and it made him a lifelong believer in ufos and this is a good lesson for parents out there when 
a child or anyone really says that they are seeing something take the time to look and you could have 
an experience that you will not soon forget and now we move on to another case and I call this one 
two ufo displays for arnie weiler this uh case is very interesting it involves a gentleman who works 
TWO UFO DISPLAYS FOR ARNI WHYLER
for nbc as an adult and he has had four major sightings I'm just going to present two here today 
two which involve this really unusual display type of behavior one occurred when he was just 
a little boy he was eight years old and he lived in an apartment building in cleveland ohio that 
CLEVELAND, OHIO AND LAKE ERIE
overlooked lake erie and one evening he asked his parents if he could camp out on the balcony 
of their apartment and they agreed and he went out there in his sleeping bag and his flashlight 
and it wasn't long after darkness had fallen that arnie witnessed a dramatic ufo display it started 
with an unusually bright star-like object and when he saw that it was unusual he kept his eye on it 
and he was glad he did because it started to do things no star can do as arnie says and I quote 
there was a star that got a little bit bright and a little bit brighter and of course I kept 
watching it because it kept getting brighter and brighter and it seemed like it was growing and then it started moving in a clockwise circle very small kind of like vibrating a little bit 
and it moved in a wider and wider circle a huge circle and when it hit the bottom of this circle 
it stopped it just stopped dead of course I kept watching it because I couldn't figure out what 
was going on and then it went off to the west it just shot right off after this thing darted away 
arnie ran inside and told his parents and they did not believe him he was quite disappointed at that 
and that would not be his only sighting certainly did convince him that ufos were real 
and he would later have more sightings and the second one I'd like like to talk about was a very 
strange sighting involving high strangeness on multiple levels and this one occurred on 
october 14 1990 at the time he was living in a home in pasadena in southern california and 
PASADENA, CA
it started when he had a very sudden and very strong impulse to look outside as arnie says 
i got this funny feeling I should look out the window I don't know why I got the funny feeling I 
should look out the window but I got up and I went over to the fireplace and I looked out the window 
and a spot of light appeared over the house it went off from east to west off to the horizon line 
then it shrank from the size of a quarter to a pinpoint of light it also changed in 
color from a warm white to a very very bright intense blue white light at this point judged 
judging by its appearance and movement arnie realized he was seeing an actual ufo 
he quickly ran back to the living room and woke up his brother who was sleeping on the couch 
and told him that he had just seen a ufo but the experience was not over yet at this point 
something very strange happened this weird wave of light swept over arnie's house as he says 
it was as though you took a giant donut of light and ran it across the house so it that glow 
so that it glowed only around the house not down by the street it was easily visible and it 
illuminated all of the foliage around the house but nowhere else I just got the funny feeling 
something was up close what's really interesting is when this wave of light swept over the house 
arnie noticed two things his ears popped as if he had gone up in elevation and not only that there 
was this eerie silence that settled over the entire area ufo researchers are quite familiar 
with this effect and it's called the oz effect and this can sometimes turn up in close encounters 
and certainly turned up in arnie's case it was very apparent to him as he says I went outside 
and there was absolutely no sound the crickets had stopped making noise it was absolutely silent 
my ears felt like they were going up another level in height it was as though I had gone up 
to about 5 000 feet but it didn't hurt it had that sort of silent feeling it was absolutely silent 
until I got to the street and then the normal noises appeared arnie went back inside and uh 
his brother was still in there trying to wake up and he did see the light sweep over the house but 
nothing else at this point the sounds returned to normal and the sighting appeared to be over 
but arnie did notice one other important and I think significant detail as he says on my retina 
the blue light when it got to a fine pinpoint towards the horizon it burned the color into my 
retina so every time I closed my eyes I could clearly see the image of what I saw in the sky 
it was a perfectly round disc a little oval and I saw it on my retina for at least two or three 
hours afterwards so this was clearly some kind of display and it's got several strange elements 
i think the most interesting is that arnie had a very strong flash of precognition or a weird 
impulse to look outside and as soon as he did this is when this ufo appeared the other interesting 
details are of course this weird oz effect and also the physiological effect of this after image 
on his retina which lasted for two or three hours so this goes to prove that there was something 
actually there eye irritation light sensitivity is one of the most common physiological effects 
as a result of a ufo encounter so it was a very interesting sighting and it appears that this 
ufo these ufo occupants wanted arnie to see them and made it sure that he looked outside before 
they appeared now I'd like to move to another case which shows a very interesting aspect of ufo 
behavior and I call this next case the repeater problem a ufo sighting is often once in a lifetime 
event however for some people it's not it's something they experience over and over again 
throughout their lives that's certainly what happened with ronnie barron he's had 
well over a dozen sightings he doesn't believe he's a contactee he has just seen 
ufos on many many occasions um he had a very interesting sighting as a little boy in biloxi 
mississippi when he saw a powder blue disc uh an orb rather shooting across the sky and she's had a 
lot of sightings I just talk about three of the major ones each of which was clearly a display 
at some point ronnie barron moved to encino here in southern california and uh started seeing ufos 
ENCINO, CALIFORNIA
again and this often happened when he would step outside at night to look at the stars and these 
objects would appear start darting around and move off and he told his teenage son about these 
sightings but his teenage son did not believe him until one time they both together had a dramatic 
ufo display appear overhead this occurred in the early 1970s again in encino california 
ronnie and his son stepped outside and five orb like objects started darting around 
in really amazing maneuvers and patterns as ronnie says I saw five one night in a cluster 
and they were close I was outside with my son it blew him away he wanted to deny it he didn't want 
to believe it like no this can't be he was just totally blown away by it because this cluster 
was up close they stayed kind of still in one spot and they came together and then they'd split 
really fast they'd separate and go higher it was kind of cool whatever these things are they're in 
touch with each other and they're doing things together they obviously have some kind of heavy 
communication because they were doing all these strategic things together they knew how to split 
they knew how to take off in an instant like somebody said ready go shoo and in a few seconds 
one shot straight up in the air and they were out of sight they were not visible anymore they 
somehow separated so this is a very interesting sighting because it shows that these objects are 
essentially showing off dancing around each other in the sky in ways that our own aircraft can't do 
i think this shows how technologically advanced they are there was no sound associated with 
this this was clearly not helicopters planes or shooting stars or fireworks or balloons 
or anything like that and it absolutely convinced ronnie's son that ufos were real of course ronnie 
himself was already convinced and I think in this case they were probably showing off to 
ronnie's son so that he could become knowledgeable about the fact that these things are real and that 
we are not alone in this universe I think that is the reason behind these ufo displays the agenda 
and I'd like to move to another case involving ronnie barron and this occurred again in 
encino california when ronnie was attending a party at one of his friend's house 
this was in the afternoon it was a clear sky there were about 20 people at the party 
and ronnie was the first to notice five objects four or five objects up in the sky and they were 
orb like objects bright white and darting around in these very strange patterns that 
were really obvious to everyone that this could not be anything normal as ronnie says 
they looked white and they were flying in sharp triangles I pointed them out a lot of 
people were looking at them we were all watching them go back and forth in these triangle motions 
really fast just turning on a dime flying in one direction and all of a sudden heading back in the 
opposite direction and going up to interlock these two lines it would fly on a point and 
then make a square in the back of a triangle they were moving in a little mile wide area 
so everyone just stared up these things in awe and this display went on for the entire length 
of the party three or four hours until people actually got bored looking at them and left 
this is a clear example of a ufo display what are they doing up there why are they darting around at 
right angles directly above a group of people it seems pretty obvious that they want to be seen and 
now I want to move to the last case involving ronnie barron he's had other sightings before 
and since but this one it's a really dramatic sighting which had a very interesting element 
to it that you do not often see ronnie was driving with three of his friends through 
the central valley in fresno california along the interstate 5 freeway and this was daytime and as 
AERIAL VIEW OF CENTRAL VALLEY, CA
they were driving ronnie was in the passenger seat his friend was driving and the two other people 
were in the back sleeping suddenly both ronnie and his friend saw these two enormous white globes 
of light dropped down out of the sky and head towards them directly over the freeway was very 
obvious very brazen and it was so big that both ronnie and his friend thought that perhaps a 747 
was coming in for a crash landing although they couldn't see any structure there was just these 
two enormously bright white globes of light like landing lights they thought at first but as it 
got closer it was clear to them that this was not a plane or anything conventional and again I will 
just let ronnie describe in his own words what they saw as he says it looked like lights coming 
down over the road coming right at us I looked at the driver of the car and he looked at me 
he didn't say anything and I didn't say anything we saw these two things up there and nobody said 
anything and all of a sudden these lights came straight at us and disappeared into the ground 
on the side of the car in an instant they vanished right down into the ground no smoke no sound and 
it happened so quickly I looked at the guy driving and he looked at me we were both very puzzled 
no noise nothing just total silence it disappeared into the ground no explanation nothing you could 
say about that it was like there was a tunnel or something waiting for it to come and land there 
there's a lot of power operating those things somehow but no sound at all with 
all that force of power happening it's kind of funny unearthly you know what I mean 
still nobody said anything about it it was mind-blowing there was no explanation for it it 
scared me because it reaffirmed that there's some kind of life and intelligence happening up there 
to actually see it up close like that you know that we're not here by ourselves so 
ronnie would later have more sightings he believed ufo sightings are far more common 
than most people realize and I agree because most people do not report their sightings certainly 
ronnie did not none of the people in this episode did so the vast majority of sightings go 
unreported and this appears to be another example where this object was showing itself off on 
purpose to make another person a believer in ufos and what's most interesting to me about this case 
is that this object disappeared into the ground as ronnie says as if a tunnel opened up this is something I've heard before I do know of other cases these objects do have 
the ability to not only fly in the sky or in the water but into the ground they apparently have 
some force field around them that they can render solid objects permeable or able to slide through
water or trees or land as if it's not an obstacle at all 
and this is another good example not only of a ufo display but how truly advanced these craft these 
beings are it's a very interesting case and moving along I've got another really remarkable sighting 
i call this next case cavorting stars over palm springs the main witness in this case is another 
CAVORTING STARS OVER PALM SPRINGS
person I worked with for some time by the name of chris schwindler and she had a very interesting 
sighting with her brother and friend while camping out in palm springs in 1978 they were actually out 
there on the deserts lying in their sleeping bags when they were treated to a really remarkable and 
obvious ufo and again I will let chris describe in her own words what they saw as she says 
we were laying around and looking up at the sky and we saw these three different colored lights 
and they circled around each other and went down and pulled apart and went down and pulled apart 
and it lasted probably a couple of minutes and then they went away they were little but they looked like stars they were red yellow and green they were lights they 
looked like the size of stars from where we were I don't know how high but they were up there though 
so chris does not know what they saw the only explanation she can think of is ufos they were 
silent and they were not helicopters or planes or meteors or satellites or balloons or anything that 
she could figure out ball lightning fireworks no and what's really interesting about this case is 
that these objects were three different colors that keeps turning up in these ufo displays 
it's as if they're these ufos are putting on their lights with different colors 
sort of to show off show their presence and their way they're darting around in these dancing 
you know playful maneuvers is I think another indication that they are showing off so although 
this was a brief sighting it definitely made believers out of all three of these witnesses 
and again I think that is really the main agenda behind these types of ufo displays the ets want 
us to know about them and they continue to pick groups of people individually small groups and 
sometimes large and show themselves off to various people and the next case I want to talk about 
is one of the most dramatic ufo displays I've ever investigated because this one was 
witnessed by a very large group of people and I call this one thousands of people saw it this 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SAW IT
occurred around 1972 over the coastal southern california cities of costa mesa laguna beach 
and the surrounding areas the main witness in this case I call walter he does not want his name used 
he's a former military officer quite familiar with aircraft and he had a very interesting 
sighting while in laguna beach and as he says this huge cloud-like lenticular shaped object cloud 
but it wasn't a cloud appeared over costa mesa he saw it from laguna beach but thousands of 
people saw this work stopped traffic on the street stopped as people rushed out of their 
cars and stared people ran out of their homes pointing and looking and screaming at this huge 
huge perfectly oval-shaped object cloud-like object that was hovering over costa mesa 
and it clearly wasn't a cloud because there were little lights pastel colored lights of 
many different colors scintillating and darting around not only inside it but around the perimeter 
and I will just let walter describe in his own words his experience with this amazing sighting 
as he says I saw something when I lived in laguna beach that thousands and thousands of people saw 
everyone was out in the streets looking at it a big cloud that was perfectly oval shaped 
and colors moved around it there were pinks and others and they moved they would scintillate 
and move around it people were out in the streets everyone was looking at it it was over costa mesa 
but I saw it from laguna beach the paper said that people were out in the streets in costa mesa I 
mean thousands and thousands of people saw it just staring at it looking at it and towards evening 
the media dismissed it as some kind of thing but I didn't think so there were lights in it 
and they were around it moving through it colored lights and the thing was perfectly shaped and it 
was moving slowly people were just going what is that someone said that's a cloud I said bull that 
is not a cloud so walter watched this for at least a half an hour and this thing was moving at a very 
slow pace over the city and after about a half an hour it moved off into the distance the media 
dismissed it as atmospheric phenomena something walter vehemently does not agree with this was 
while it had a cloud-like appearance the fact that there were so many of these multi-colored lights 
moving all through it made him feel like this was a ufo of some kind and he has no way to 
explain it other than that it was a very dramatic sighting that was very widely viewed and I think 
that was the whole point of it when thousands upon thousands of people see something like this 
it can cause a huge shift in public opinion on the subject so now I'd like to move 
to the last case which is another dramatic ufo display and I call this one they flew all night 
THEY FLEW ALL NIGHT
the main witness in this case is a gemstone by the name of robert he's an office manager I did 
work with him for a number of years and this case took place in 1983 in at lake naciamento 
this is in the paso robles area of california and robert and his friends were driving through the 
lake naciamento area one evening when they saw something that they could not explain 
looking at it they realized that this was not stars as they initially thought but it was a ring 
of lights dim sort of orbs and in the center was a much larger bright light so there was all these 
little objects surrounding one central object and as they watched these little lights would leave 
the main one and start darting around all over the place so they stopped the car got out and looked 
at it and that's when they noticed that there was several of these weird formations of lights and 
they started putting on this dramatic display that lasted for hours it really deeply impressed them 
as uh robert says it was like wow it was a central light and there were these other 
ones that would fly around it it was really weird I've never seen anything like it before 
they just look like a cluster of stars at first there was one real bright one in the middle and a 
bunch of little ones around it and the one in the middle was really bright and you'd see them move 
they'd dart across the sky dart back but they go back to the same place which was kind of weird 
they'd fly away from each other sometimes one or two would take off in a different direction 
but the clusters didn't dart there was a center object with like five or six around it 
and the ones on the outside would dart across so robert and his friends were amazed flabbergasted 
and stared at these objects in amazement and disbelief and tried to explain what they were 
seeing as helicopters or planes or anything and finally one of them very reluctantly brought up 
the word ufo and all of them were surprised to see themselves agreeing there was no other explanation 
for what they were seeing these had to be some kind of ufos just judging not only by their 
appearance but by the way they moved although they were quite high up there there was absolutely 
no sound and again there was quite a few of these things four maybe five main clusters each 
with four you know five or six lights around them so this was quite a number of objects 
and uh robert and his friends decided to drive around to see if they could get a better viewpoint 
and they saw a lot of other people pulled off the road looking at them as robert says 
it was really weird we went driving up to the lake and there were other people standing around 
looking up we just kind of looked at them and they looked at us it was weird there were other 
people who pulled over looking up watching so we weren't the only idiots who saw it so they watched 
this for hours upon hours and at some point drove up high up onto the mountain to get a better look 
and as robert says we were there after midnight and they were still going on 
we actually got bored of watching it so they watched this for two three four hours 
and as it got late they decided to drive up to the top of a nearby mountain to see if 
they could get an even better look and by the time they got up there the objects were gone 
but this was something that went on for many hours most of the night and really impressed 
them that these objects were wanting to be seen were showing themselves off 
and many many people saw it and that is a trademark of these ufo displays and while in 
some of these cases that I cited I'm only talking about one or two or you know 10 or 20 witnesses 
I'm guessing that there are probably a lot more people who were also watching it but do not report 
their sightings and in this last case with robert and these ufos up at lake nazimento he scanned the 
newspapers the next day watched the news he was positive this was going to be front page news 
you know television headlines but of course it wasn't there was no mention about it whatsoever 
and I asked robert if he reported his sighting to any media outlet the police air force and a ufo reporting center he did not that is one of the problems with these ufo 
sightings and the phenomena in general is people do not report their sightings one in a hundred 
maybe we'll report their sightings so any estimate of how many sightings there are is probably 
vastly underestimated but I think these cases show a very unique and important type of ufo behavior 
a ufo display so those are the cases I wanted to present to you today I did write about them in my 
book 1 in 40 the ufo epidemic and while these are just simple sightings again they show this really 
important aspect of ufo behavior where I think the ets have an agenda to show themselves off 
to announce their presence it's in essence a publicity campaign to say hey you guys you are not 
alone we are up here we are real and that is I think absolutely the agenda behind this 
and why would they do this why do they want to show themselves off why do they want us to know about them I think at some point we're going to be looking at open official contact 
and they are getting us used to their presence before they do a type of display that every single 
person on this planet will see that will leave no doubt in anyone's minds that they are real 
that will change the way we think about ourselves and our place in this universe forever 
i think at some point we will have open official contact ever since the modern age of ufos ufo 
activity has been steadily escalating so at some point I think it's inevitable that we wake up to 
the fact that we are not alone and when we do you know when we can get over this stupid 
ufo cover-up when disclosure happens I think we will finally be ready for that type of display 
where everyone in the world knows that ufos are real and this will no longer be labeled a mystery 
and I for one look forward to that day so that's the episode today I think it's 
really important that people recognize ufos are real and that they're trying to get us used to their presence and that's why I wanted to present these cases for you today I hope you've 
enjoyed this episode I want to thank you once again for watching I truly appreciate it so until 
next time keep searching for the truth keep asking questions and most important keep having fun
