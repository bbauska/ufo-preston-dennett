THE CHATWORTH UFO EPIDEMIC
Apr 8, 2022

Summary:
Apr 8, 2022
On the evening of December 26, 1988, Teri Smith (a physical therapist) went to sleep with her 
boyfriend Brian in a bedroom in a large condominium complex located in Chatsworth, California. 
At some point in the middle of the night, Teri woke to a strange thrumming noise and the feeling 
that somebody was in the room. She found herself unable to move or speak. As she struggled against 
the strange force, she felt four prong-like "things" grabbing her ankle, causing pain. Terrified, 
she finally managed to open her eyes and was confronted by a baffling sight.

At the foot of her bed was a large glowing misty-like entity. As she sat up, this entity quickly 
darted out through the closed window of the bedroom. Looking outside, Teri was shocked to see a 
huge UFO landed in the alley behind the condominium. The strange figure entered into the landed 
object, which promptly took off straight up. Only then did Teri's boyfriend Brian finally wake 
up. He hadn't seen anything. Neither had three other adults and a child who were also in the 
condo. But Teri knew what she had experienced. It wasn't a dream.

The next day, the entire experience had completely left her mind. It was only while she was at 
her place of employment when she felt a strong pain in her ankle and a soreness in her neck that 
the events of the previous night flooded back into her mind.

After work, Teri called her best friend, Traci Stoor, and told her what happened. Traci was 
shocked. Traci hadn't told Teri, but Tracy had been having these kinds of experiences for many 
years. Now it seemed that they had spread to her friend Teri. And not only that, on the same 
night of Teri's encounter, Traci's boyfriend, George, had also had an encounter, and it was 
identical to Teri's down to the tiniest detail! This remarkable turn of events was too strange 
to be a coincidence, and it provided Teri with confirmation that her own experience was 
absolutely real.

Meanwhile, attention turned to Traci, who confirmed both Teri's and George's encounters, and 
also had her own encounters. Traci revealed that she had experienced a face-to-face visitation 
with an alien entity in a location that one would never expect.

This video presents the story of a small group of friends, and how Traci's UFO encounters 
spread like a contagion among her two best friends. It reveals many of the standard patterns 
of UFO contact, and shows how encounters can happen in the least likely locations.

The full story of "The Chatsworth UFO Epidemic" is presented in my book, "One in Forty." Now

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode the chatsworth ufo epidemic I wanted to present it to you today because 
it shows how one person can have encounters and they begin to spread among their friends 
so this is about a small group of friends each who have had encounters another interesting 
aspect about this case is that one of these encounters took place in a very unlikely location 
so let's just get started the first case I'd like to talk about took place in the town of chatsworth 
in southern california this is a very densely populated suburb just outside of los angeles and 
the main witness is a young woman in her early 20s by the name of terry smith at the time she 
worked as a physical therapist in a doctor's office on the evening of december 26 1988 terry 
smith and her boyfriend brian had gone to sleep in a condominium complex in chatsworth california 
and there were other people in the house at the time three adults and a small child but 
terry and her boyfriend brian were in a room alone and in the middle of the night terry 
woke up because she sensed a presence in the room or she heard the sound she's not sure what exactly 
woke her up but I will let her describe what happened in her own words as terry says 
i have this little alarm clock that ticks really loudly and I was just woken up for no reason 
my alarm clock started getting really loud the ticking then I felt the bed move it was vibrating 
to the noise of the alarm clock then that's all I could hear I couldn't hear anything else 
it was really loud so I was trying to open my eyes I tried to get up because I thought it was 
brian who was next to me I was just trying to tell him but I realized I couldn't talk 
the sound was like the perfect beat with the clock but really loud I realized I couldn't talk 
i couldn't get up I couldn't move anything and this feeling I don't know how to explain this kind 
of feeling but I couldn't see you know how when you get up really fast and you kind of black out 
like when you are coming to when you start to see it's really spotty kind of 
i could see a little bit but it was cloudy spotty and I was trying to look for brian 
and then I started to hit him in the back because I couldn't talk 
i couldn't I could tell I was making this noise like a choking gasping noise this weird noise 
but I couldn't say anything and then I tried to just kick my legs over and jump off the bed 
and that's when I felt I don't know if it was like fingernails or what but down on my ankle like a 
stick in my leg all of a sudden that's when I got scared because it was hurting I was trying to move 
my leg and I was trying to move my upper body and I couldn't do anything then all of a sudden with 
all my might I don't know how long this was lasting I have no idea how long this went on 
but with all my might I just screamed out his name I realized it sounded funny when it let loose 
i hit him in the back because I had so much pressure and finally it just released or whatever 
and this is the part that sounds really stupid to me I thought am I crazy was it a dream 
i don't know but I looked to the window this went really fast too the window was about 
four feet from the bed and there were these really sheer curtains hanging down and they 
were opened but you can see out the window and I just saw this bright light like leave the room 
and then which really sounds stupid but it's what I saw unless I'm crazy or dreaming I saw this 
i don't know spaceship or something it was round and it just took off it looked like 
a round-like spaceship I have no idea like a flying saucer it just went shoe and up and gone 
so I asked terry to describe these events a little bit more closely and she said that these pains in 
her leg felt not like fingernails so much but like two prongs uh one two on each side 
something sort of gripping her leg and this object she said looked like a spaceship she doesn't know 
how else to describe it as she says it was white it didn't have any lights on it or anything 
it just looked like a white something it looked like a spaceship type thing 
it was just this round object that as soon as the light left the room whatever it was I'm still 
trying to focus my eyes it turned to smoke on the outside of the window and then I saw this object 
take off all of a sudden it was gone straight up in the air and gone so this completely freaked 
terry out she immediately woke brian who told him what happened and he had no explanation though 
he could see she was concerned no one in the house apparently saw anything we found out later 
so it was just terry who saw this and not only saw this and heard this but felt it as well 
eventually they did go back to sleep this was in the middle of the night she went back to sleep and 
all night long she had nightmares of people coming to the room grabbing her leg trying to pull her 
out of a bed she dreamt about helicopters hovering above the house shooting at her 
but these were just dreams this event before she says was absolutely not a dream 
she says I don't care if people think I'm crazy I know this was not a dream 
but when morning came along here's where it gets strange she did not remember it 
at all it had completely left her mind of course this does turn up in ufo encounters 
so that is where it was for the time being until she went to work that day and she's 
walking around the office in her high heeled shoes and realized that her foot 
the one that had been sort of grabbed by this force or these prongs felt really sore and it 
was just the one foot and that's when this all came flooding back into her head and not only 
was her foot sore her neck was also very sore and this soreness in her foot and her neck lasted for 
about a week so this was another indication that this was an entirely physical encounter 
terry does say that there was a huge alleyway behind this condo and plenty of room for this 
large round shaped object to be sitting there what she said was probably about the size of a 
small room it never made any sound the only sound she heard was that weird sort of ticking sound so 
after work she got home and she decided to call her best friend tracy store and tell her about it 
and tracy was surprised to hear this because she had never told her friend anything but 
she was having very similar encounters where something would enter into her room 
she'd find herself paralyzed unable to move or cry out and she told terry that yes this sort of thing 
had happened to me several times never however had she seen a ufo and then she told terry the shocker 
it turns out that tracy store's boyfriend george that had the same experience 
on the same night and this is just a few miles away in chatsworth so terry asked to speak with 
george and they spoke together on the phone and george said that that night december 26 
he had woken up because something had entered his room and he couldn't move or cry out and 
terry said did you feel anything and he said yes I felt like something was trying to grab my leg and 
he asked her did you see anything and she said yes I saw this white like object and she asked him did 
you see anything he said yes I saw the same exact thing and it left the room and outside of it there 
was this white object this round like spaceship and it darted out of the room turned to smoke kind 
of entered this object which took off straight up so they basically had the same exact series 
of events happened to them on the same night only a few miles away so clearly these events were 
related they are both very good friends with tracy store so this was a truly remarkable coincidence 
and really freaked out terry smith because it provided a further level of confirmation 
and uh turns out that tracy's store is the center of all this activity 
because while terry smith and tracy's friend george have only experienced experienced this once 
tracy store has experienced it numerous times and when I spoke with her she had a very interesting 
story to tell about one of these encounters and this occurred one year earlier in 1987 
in the town of woodland hills california which is immediately south of chatsworth just a few 
miles woodland hills is a very densely populated suburb again right outside of los angeles and 
tracy's encounter took place in a very unlikely location she was staying at the marriott hotel 
in woodland hills this is a very large hotel with multi stories a huge building located in the heart 
of woodland hills and tracy had rented a room in the marriott hotel on the evening in question 
when she had this experience and it was the middle of the night 
when tracy woke up because she felt like something had entered the room and again I will just let 
tracy describe in her own words what happened I remember trying to lift my head or move my arms 
it was like something was on top of me holding me down and I tried to yell and I couldn't yell 
my mouth was open and nothing came out I was trying so hard to either wake up or get up or snap 
out of it and it felt like something was stopping me from doing it and I remember like looking 
up and there was something with a red light around it when I was trying to see what it was 
i was looking and I couldn't see any facial features whether it was a boy or a girl but 
it felt like something with a red light holding my head down and all of a sudden it stopped and 
i sat up and I was like oh my god what was it and then I realized there was nothing there
so I asked tracy to describe again what this light looked like in this figure 
and that's what it became clear to me what was going on here as tracy says 
it was like a light behind a person I didn't see the actual light source it was like a red light 
that you would think was behind something I saw the outline of whatever was holding me I remember 
seeing something standing there with a foot on me standing towards my feet with a foot on my leg 
imagine somebody standing in the dark in front of you with a bright red light behind them so 
all you can see is the glow of the red light and the silhouette it was the shape of a person but 
not a big person a small person maybe about five feet tall it was like a skinny person
at the time tracy did not know how to interpret this experience and uh now 
looking back at it she realizes that this is probably extraterrestrial but at the 
time she was wondering if this was a spirit or something but given the shape of this person 
the fact that it was standing on her bed there was a bright red light filling the room these 
are all details that we see again and again in ufo encounters and tracy is sure this wasn't a dream 
especially because these encounters had spread to her friends so this is all she really remembers of 
her encounters is being visited like this so again this is not a very extensive case but what I find 
interesting about it is where it took place in a hotel in a hotel room in a very crowded suburb 
in woodland hills california it seems like an unlikely location for a ufo encounter but as 
you know if you study this subject ufo encounters can happen anywhere so that's a very interesting 
aspect of this encounter is not only the location but that it spread among tracy's friends 
which is another sort of pattern we see another very interesting aspect of this encounter was how 
terry described this being this figure or whatever it was that entered her room as being like a light 
that turned almost smokey or transparent as it went outside this is a detail I haven't 
heard a lot and if she hadn't seen this actual solid-looking round-like craft in the alleyway 
outside of the condominium complex I might have doubted that this was even extraterrestrial at all 
but she did and so did tracy's boyfriend george so this does appear to be a series of ufo encounters 
that happened among a small group of friends and it's got those interesting details which 
turn up again and again that's why I wanted to present this little episode for you today 
i know this has been a short one but I hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you very much for 
watching I did present this case in my book 1 in 40 the ufo epidemic was one of the earliest cases 
i investigated I've since lost touch with the witnesses but I suspect it's probably 
more extensive than what I've reported to you today but unfortunately I can't tell you anymore 
because that's all the information I have for you today once again thank you until next time 
keep searching the skies keep asking for an answers and most importantly keep having fun
