"A UFO LANDED RIGHT NEXT TO ME!": TWELVE TRUE CASES
Jul 21, 2023

Summary:
Jul 21, 2023
One of the rarest kinds of UFO encounters is when a craft lands on the ground. But the fact is, there are thousands of cases on record like this. They reach back decades up to the present day. They come from all over the world. Many have multiple witnesses and a wide variety of physical evidence including animal reactions, landing traces, EM disturbances, medical effects and more. These cases make it clear that UFOs are technological advanced machines. Here are a dozen cases of this kind which show just how strange and fascinating the UFO phenomenon can be.

APR 7, 1950, AMARILLO, TX: When David Lightfoot (age 12) and his cousin Charles Lightfoot (age 9) went fishing by their home, they saw an odd object zoom overhead, circle around, and then land next to them. It was only a few feet wide. David ran up to the craft and touched it as it took off. Afterward, his arms and face were red and covered with welts.

NOV 3, 1960, PRICE COUNTY, WI: Two eight-year-old boys (Douglas Fox and Mr. Gehring) decided to test their new bow and arrow out in the wilds near their home. Hearing a weird noise and feeling a blast of heat, they looked up and saw a flying saucer land on the hill next to them. They ran up to it, at which point it took off. The ground at the site was still hot.

JUL 19, 1965, VAUCLUSE BEACH, NSW, AUSTRALIA: Denis Crowe was taking a walk along the beach when he saw a glow ahead and heard barking dogs. As he approached, he saw that the light was a silver saucer-shaped craft resting on short landing legs. He got to within 60 feet, at which point it shot upwards, leaving burned marks on the ground.

MAR 1, 1966, CARSON CITY, MI: Two seven-year-olds were walking in a field near their home when they came upon a huge, silver, cigar-shaped craft. Heat waves were coming off it. As they walked up to it, it took off in a weird zigzag maneuver. On the ground they found crushed, burned grass and strange holes.

MAR 29, 1966, HAMILTON, ONTARIO, CANADA: Charles Cozens (age 13) watched in awe as two strange craft landed directly behind the local police station. He approached one of the craft and actually touched it. It felt smooth and metallic, but as he touched it, an electric arc three feet long zapped him on the hand, causing a burn.

MAR 29, 1966, ANCHORAGE, AK: It was many years after the incident when a young man remembered his childhood encounter with a UFO that landed on the street right in front of his house. The craft was about 50 feet wide and had a little ladder leading down to the ground. Unknown to the witness, his own brother watched from the house.

AUG 26, 1968, GLEESON, AZ: Pearl Christensen was driving home when she saw two large craft landed on the peak of the nearby 7200-foot-high Brown’s Peak. She watched them through binoculars for almost 4 hours. Another witness also saw them. Later, researchers went to the landing spot and found landing marks and burned vegetation on the site.

MAR 13, 1975, MELLEN, WI: The Baker family could hardly believe their eyes when they saw a classic, silver flying saucer with colored lights and a dome on top landed on the street right next to their home. They called the police, but the craft departed. But the next few days, the craft returned and was seen by many people, including police officers.

Nov 10, 1978, KUWAIT: Seven oilfield workers got the shock of their life when a UFO landed next to the Al Sabriyah oil pumping station, knocking it off-line. It was as big as a jumbo jet and remained there for 7 minutes. An investigation revealed sightings both before and after. One man even photographed the UFO. The case went to the highest levels of govt.

Nov 27, 1978, LEEDS, ENGLAND: Lynsey Tebbs and Susan Pearson (both age 14) were walking near their homes they saw a UFO hover overhead and then land right next to them. They turned to run, but the craft took off. They stopped and watched it land again. Researchers arrived and discovered strange landing traces. Then the govt showed up!

MAR 30, 1995, TRANSVAAL, SOUTH AFRICA: Jan Pienaar was driving along a country road when he came upon a landed UFO right in the middle of the road. His truck engine failed, and he became paralyzed. The craft, he saw, had a gaping hole in the side. Shortly later, the craft took off, leaving behind scorched marks. Other people in the area also saw UFOs.

APR 10, 2002, CROSSVILLE, TN: A teacher woke up early in the morning and saw a 20-foot-wide metallic craft floating on the surface of the lake. She watched it for one minute, then went to get her husband. When they returned, the craft was gone. Later she saw an object exit the lake, and further events revealed that she was having direct contact.

These cases show that UFOs are physical machines utilizing an advanced technology far beyond our own. These cases leave no doubt that we are being visited. They are only a small sampling of the huge number of cases involving UFO landings.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
this episode today is all about the UFO landing cases and in fact I call it the UFO landed right 
next to me now let me just put a caveat here when I say right next to me I mean within in most cases 
a couple of hundred feet because let's face it if a UFO landed right next to you you would probably 
be fried to a crisp so in these cases people either Came Upon A landed UFO actually saw it land 
and ran up to it and in a good number of these cases not only saw it land but take off as well 
these are really interesting cases which I think do have a lot to say about the UFO phenomenon 
I think it's also interesting because it's I suspect that a few of these are not 
extraterrestrial craft but are instead reverse engineered craft from our own perhaps secret 
governments you can decide for yourself on that but I think these cases are important and do have 
some important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon and for that matter reverse engineering 
and these cases do date all the way back to the 1950s all the way up to the 2000s so they 
spanned many decades they come from across the world as I love to cover different places 
I chose that this is a worldwide phenomena so these are cases from across the United States 
Canada Africa across Europe Australia so over a widespread geographic area 
some of these cases do involve physical evidence of course Landing traces and in some cases 
physiological effects in fact in a couple of these cases people got close enough where they actually 
touched the craft not something I would recommend whether it's a genuine UFO or a reverse engineered 
craft certainly in the cases where people walked up to it they regretted it because they did get 
shocked or burned so yeah that's what I mean by these are really fascinating cases these 
are much more than a simple sighting of a distant anomalous light in the sky these are close enough where people cannot possibly misperceive these things they are right 
next to them and can see these craft which in most cases are classic flying saucers as we shall see 
but let's just get right to it I've got a dozen cases it's a lot of information some of these are 
super fascinating and the first case I'd like to talk about I call UFO landing at Amarillo Texas 
I love this case because it's a very early case from the 1950s it's got multiple Witnesses it 
has some interesting physiological effects as we shall see and it's also quite controversial 
because I think this might actually be a reverse engineered U.S craft but again you 
can decide for yourself this case occurred on April 7 1950 and the two main Witnesses are 
David Lightfoot age 12 and his cousin Charles age nine so their parents are siblings of each other 
and David and Charles decided to go fishing near their homes one of them lived on a River Road and 
the other on Bluebonnet Road and this is in North Amarillo Texas it was around 11 A.M and they had 
just started fishing when they saw what they first thought was a balloon flying overhead but as it 
approached they saw that it wasn't a balloon it was a small desk it actually decreased in speed 
came right over their heads quite low they said only a few feet above them circled overhead once 
and then disappeared over a small hill and that's when David the older of the two shouted out I'll 
bet that's one of those flying saucers Charles I'm going after it so David was quite a bit bigger he 
could run faster and he ran right up this hill and saw the object had actually landed he described it 
as blue gray in color and it showed no openings whatsoever except for a space between the top 
and bottom sections which glowed as he said quote real red like it was on fire in there or something 
so I just like to quote Charles Lightfoot directly because he gave a pretty good long 
testimony about what they saw as he says in his own words it was about as big around as 
a regular automobile tire and about as high as my knee maybe a foot and a half I could see it good 
when I first saw good the bottom was still but the top was spinning around real fast and on the top 
of the part that was spinning around there was a little Peak I had kind of a spindle sticking out 
of it the spindle was still too it must have been connected to the bottom part when I came 
over that Hill the thing was only a little ways away from me and I ran a ways and dived at it 
my fingers barely touched it and it felt slick sort of like I guess a snake would 
it was hot too before I could get a hold of the thing the top began revolving faster and it made 
a sort of whistling noise and took off without warming up or anything boy it just took off like 
it was on a string or something it didn't wobble or anything so it wasn't on the ground for more 
than a minute but as it took off the witness said it seemed to emit a gas or perhaps a spray 
which immediately irritated his skin he says it raised red welts on his arms and face 
so both boys were quite alarmed they ran home and told their parents and the fathers 
confirmed that the boys were in fact very excited and also confirmed his son's injuries 
as the father says when he left the house this morning his arms were just as white as could be 
there wasn't hardly any sunshine this morning and when the boys came running home talking about this Flying Saucer one of the first things I noticed was that his 
arms and face were red and there were welts on them so he applied a skin bomb to them 
and the welts healed pretty quickly but the redness did take quite a bit longer to heal 
they were interviewed by newspaper reporters it got quite a bit of attention 
however years following the incident Dr James McDonald a prominent UFO researcher and scientist 
interviewed David and says that there were some pretty significant inconsistencies in his 
testimony as to how close they were to the object whether it had actually landed or just hovered 
above the ground and even if they had touched it so he came away a little skeptical of the case 
but yeah certainly an interesting case so yeah Dr James McDonald went so far as to possibly just 
dismiss this case I'm not willing to do that it's clear to me that these two cousins The Lightfoot 
cousins did see something I mean their father verified the fact that this kid did have redness 
all over his arms and face and that they were very much excited and even a bit traumatized by what 
they had seen so it's certainly an interesting case and I do suspect that it's quite possible 
this was a reverse engineered craft given how close they got to it given how they described 
it and the fact that it was so small I don't know but it's certainly an interesting case 
and the next case I'd like to talk about is landing at Price City Wisconsin 
and this is a very interesting case where two young boys were out bow hunting and Came 
Upon A landed UFO actually saw it land saw it take off as well Landing traces the whole deal 
are really interesting cases we shall see it was around 4 P.M on November 3rd 1960 when 
two eight-year-old boys went out into the country to try out their new bow and arrow 
given to them by one of the boy's fathers this was Sheriff Gering the other boy was Douglas Fox 
so coming over a hill they climbed up it and then came down it and this is when they heard a 
high-pitched humming sound which they described as being very much like an electric motor 
and they also felt a blast of heat behind them so this was coming from behind them and turning 
around they saw that a metallic object quite large had landed on the small hill behind them exactly 
where they had just been and their description of this object was a classic saucer shape with 
a cupola or a dome on top they said they saw portholes several square or squarish Windows 
around the circumference and they could see this was unusual so they both ran towards it 
now they didn't get very close before this object promptly took off and after it took off the boys 
ran up to The Landing site and fell to the ground and they were amazed to feel that it was still 
warm and they were wearing mittens they could feel the heat through their mittens this was a 
very cold day so that really impressed them the boys ran home and told their parents and again 
one of them was the local sheriff of price County and he returned to the scene with a geiger counter 
he found no marks on the ground or any radiation but again the boys said that they did feel heat 
so that is a form of Landing Trace I guess but after interviewing the boys the investigator 
from the aerial phenomenal research organization Earl Gromit sort of correlated their testimonies 
together and estimated that this object was somewhere between 20 to 25 feet in diameter 
and according to the boy's parents neither of them had even heard of flying saucers so they weren't 
even using the word UFO they just thought it was something that they had never seen before clearly 
something really profound did happen in that case with the landing traces and the fact that one of 
the kids is in fact the son of the local sheriff I think that does lend some Credence to all of this 
but certainly an interesting case worthy of being well known you have all the cases in 
this collection I have to say that this next one is one of my favorite I call this one UFO landing 
at Val close Beach Australia and what I love about this case is the main witness is very credible 
he is actually someone very familiar with aircraft design worked at an aircraft company so if anyone 
should be able to identify a strange craft it would be this witness it was just after 
5 PM when Dennis Crowe Came Upon A landed UFO and again he's an ideal witness because he was 
employed as a technical artist or an English Aircraft Company he knows what aircraft looked 
like and he knows how to draw them which is one of the really cool things about this case 
so yeah he's just taking a walk along's Beach and up ahead of him he noticed a glowing object landed 
on the beach itself and as he got closer he could hear that the nearby dogs were barking up a storm 
and as he got even closer you could see that this was more than a light this was actually 
a saucer-shaped object resting on short Landing legs and as Dennis says in his own words its 
diameter appeared to be about 20 feet I estimate its height at nine feet including what appeared 
to be legs protruding from the bottom the rim was glowing a greenish blue while the 
top and bottom halves were a dullish silver gray a hollow in the top could have been a glass Dome 
so he knows aircraft you can see this one was very unusual he was very much intrigued so he 
slowly approached it and he says he got to about within 60 feet of it when this object 
rose up and very quickly in about 10 seconds it disappeared off upwards into the distance 
and as Dennis says it took off with a noise like air forcibly released from a balloon 
the noise was quite unlike any made by jet engines I looked around hoping to see someone 
else who saw what I saw but my only company was about a dozen or so dogs while the object 
was stationary they were all barking loudly at it after it took off they were all strangely silent 
so after he saw this he went home and immediately sketched the object as you can see here 
but he was reluctant to report it he wasn't sure if people would believe him as he says 
at first I wondered whether I should say anything about what I had seen the natural reaction of most people might label me as a crackpot but I could not keep silent I felt 
a moral obligation to speak of what I had seen so he did he reported it he made an official report 
and this did get a lot of attention in fact a geologist came to inspect the landing site and 
did find evidence of this object reportedly the plant life where the object had landed was now 
dead apparently exposed to high heat so this was a very interesting case because the report 
on this Landing made it all the way to the top of the government the Royal Australian Air Force 
who tried to debunk it and said get this that Dennis may have mistaken a tornado for The Craft 
now that's ridiculous and of course Dennis dismisses this completely so Dennis's account 
was published in local newspapers and as I said he received many commendations from readers who 
shared their own stories and Dennis himself says his phone rang off the hook a lot of people were 
calling to report their own you upload sightings or had interest in what he had seen he received 
letters as well so yeah he was definitely public about his sighting and as he says in his own words 
I suppose I'm sticking my neck out again but in the light of all the sightings reported 
from places like Latin America couldn't there be some sort of International Group to give 
instruction in the event of a fright I mean if people became trigger happy and one of these 
things got smashed up they possibly wouldn't come back for a hundred years I thought that was an 
interesting comment and of course there are many groups who are trying very hard even at that time 
to study these objects and provide guidelines on what to do if you should see one 
so I really have to give kudos to the main witness in that case Dennis Crow for Having the courage 
to step forward I know from personal experience having interviewed a lot of people most people 
don't have the courage to report their experience publicly especially if it's something as dramatic 
as a UFO landing but he did and I love this case for a number of other reasons there's 
Landing traces animal reactions as well and he got a really good response as it turns out his fears 
were somewhat unfounded all the people he told did believe him and even when the newspaper accounts 
were published he got a very good reaction and other people reported their own encounters 
this is another good reason why it's important for people to just find the courage and talk about 
what happened because you can bet other people out there are having these same sorts of experiences 
and here's another case that proves my point this one I call UFO landing at Carson City Michigan 
this is a case from mufon it's fairly brief but I like it because I have a long direct 
quote from the witness and uh firsthand eyewitness illustration of what they saw this case is quite 
brief again it occurred on March 1st 1966 and I am just going to quote the witness directly as the 
witness says on a clear day my cousin and I were both seven years old we entered a small enclosed 
field on the edge of town this is Carson City Michigan again and saw the craft on the ground 
there were some nieces there were some pieces of metal pig hut along the tree line from a tornado 
and at first I thought it was one of those we approached it and it zipped up in a zigzag manner 
it was silver and how little bit of a heat wave Shimmer I don't remember any features it happened 
quickly my mother says we came back very quote wound up so she went to look and found a flattened 
burnt area with holes like a coffee can shoved into the ground I don't remember being afraid 
but I was scared of the fuel oil tank on legs after that and kept dreaming about a long flat 
Chicken Coop back there I just painted a pick and decided to update a report I made a long time ago 
so yeah that's what's really interesting about this case is you can see this picture of it 
and it did have Landing traces I wish there's more evidence on this case 
but it is what it is and it's certainly a good report of a UFO landing yeah a very brief case 
but I think it's important because each case does add to our knowledge of what's going on here 
and there are so many Landing cases you know I'm just presenting 12 here but the fact is 
there are hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds I already did a previous episode on UFO landing 
Trace cases I'm not repeating any of those but if you're interested in UFO Landings you might 
definitely want to check that one out but here's another case and this one is super 
interesting because this is another case where a witness actually saw the craft land 
walked up to it touched it regretted touching it because he got a terrible shock watched it take 
off as well it was well investigated so it's a very interesting case this one does have some 
questions to it as to whether or not this was a genuine UFO or a reverse engineered craft 
I suspect the latter but can't say for sure and I will just present the case and you can make up 
your own minds about it this case occurred on March 29 1966 again in Hamilton Ontario Canada 
and the main witness is Charles cousins he's 13 years old 
and he says that he saw two small strange quote ships land in a field in of all places directly 
behind the Hamilton Police Station on Upper Wellington Street in Hamilton Ontario Canada 
you can see that here I suspect that this was much less developed back in 1966 
but Charles cousins said he ran behind a fence at around 9 15 P.M to the open grade that was 
behind the police station after seeing this quote flying ship come down closely followed by another 
he said the craft were white and luminous and he says about quote eight feet long four feet wide 
and three feet high with red blue and green lights set into the rim and flickering like a computer 
so Charles said the objects quote lit up the grass around and were making a buzzing sound 
he said that he actually reached out and touched them and that they were hard and unusually smooth 
to the touch as he says I could not feel hot or cold so they must have been about body temperature 
now one of these objects had what looked like an antenna and as Charles says it was thicker 
at the base and narrowed to the size of a nickel at the top now when he reached out and touched 
this object again I wouldn't recommend this but he touched the antenna and he received a pretty 
gnarly electric shock and a three foot flash of electricity occurred flinging his hand back 
so he immediately ran home and told his parents about the experience and his father noted that 
he did have a sort of curved burn on his hand now his father was James cousins and Charles wanted 
to call the police but his father James warned him that this was a serious matter to call the police 
but as James says about his son Charles was emphatic and could not be shaken so they did 
call the police and police Constable Arnold Reed was called to the home and he verified the burn 
mark on Charles's hand and it turned out that there were other Witnesses two other Witnesses 
teenagers Laverne and Owen Emery had apparently seen a UFO in the same area at the same time 
their father said that both of them were quote extremely shaken up by what they had seen 
and that the objects made a quote a whirring noise not at all like an aircraft so yeah this case did 
get quite a bit of attention in fact researcher James McDonald interviewed Charles firsthand and 
he had something to say about this case as James McDonald says on questioning both the boy and his 
father I was left with the impression that despite the unusual nature of the report it was described 
with both straightforwardness and concern and that it must be given serious consideration clearly one 
would prefer a number of adult witnesses to an individual boy yet I believe the case will stand 
close scrutiny yeah what I do like about that case is while there was only one witness to the actual 
UFO landing there were other Witnesses in the area who saw you up on the same night in the same area 
was also verified by researcher James McDonald who cited it as a particularly good example of 
the physiological effect as the result of a UFO encounter so that's really why I wanted to include 
this case and here's another briefcase which I call UFO landing at Anchorage Alaska and this is 
an interesting case for a number of reasons it is quite brief I suspect this does involve more than 
just a landing but as we shall see there's some really interesting memory problems with this case 
the witness completely forgot about it for years but did get verification from his brother who as 
it turns out saw it too and what I like about this case is this UFO landed right on the street right 
in front of the house and what should have been in full view of a lot of people though again this 
was around 2 or 3 A.M so probably everyone was asleep but yeah as we shall see a very bizarre 
case this case is very interesting because it's not complete it occurred on March 29 1966 but 
the witness says He Came Upon A landed UFO in the middle of the street in the suburbs houses lined 
both sides of the street and Elementary School was nearby the airport wasn't that far away now this 
sighting did take place around 3 A.M and here's where it's super interesting the witness says 
that he forgot about it completely for decades and I'll just quote him directly as the witness says 
my memory has me standing in the middle of my street in the winter time it must have 
been in the early morning hours there was no one around and very quiet it had just snowed and the 
reflection of the street lights on the snow made it very bright I was standing directly in front 
of my house I had no recollection of going outside but there in front of me perhaps 50 or 60 feet was 
this saucer-shaped craft it had an upper turret that rotated slowly it was approximately three 
feet across of two to three feet high that part had some windows that might have been eight-sided 
the shape of the craft was similar to a lid on a teapot the top being small and cylindrical it 
was supported by legs I think three it had a ladder from the center Underside down to the 
ground a distance of approximately four feet to the ground the total size of the 
craft was 12 to 15 feet across and maybe six or seven feet high it made little or no sound 
so that's all he really remembers this is just an isolated memory that came back to him he doesn't 
know how it began or how it ended but the witness later learned that his brother also remembers this 
he doesn't remember seeing his brother but he watched this object from the bedroom window 
and here's another interesting aspect to this case this witness says that he has huge gaps of memory 
from his entire childhood he remembers almost nothing before the seventh grade now this is 
well known to his family they could not explain it they all have memories of his childhood and their 
own childhood but yeah he doesn't so perhaps that's related to this somehow but certainly a 
very interesting Landing case now given that the witness in this case who is anonymous really has 
a lot of memory problems surrounding the whole event and his entire childhood for that matter 
I think that's a huge red flag here that this could be more than just a landing but there's 
always another case and here's another one that I really like I call this one UFO landing in Gleason 
Arizona this one isn't super close I wouldn't say it landed right next to them but certainly close 
enough to see what I do like about this case is these crafts stayed on the ground for hours 
and if the witness was able to view them through binoculars she wasn't the only witness there were 
multiple Witnesses and Magic traces as well and this case was investigated by professional 
researchers so yeah some really interesting aspects to this case for sure this Landing took 
place on August 26 1968. now the town of Gleason is just a little mining Community with only a few 
hundred people practically now a ghost town but it was just before 8 PM when Pearl Christensen 
who was then 71 years old was driving to her home in Gleason and saw a large silver saucer landed 
on the south side of the 7 200 foot high bronze Peak I'll just quote Pearl directly as she says 
I had just lowered the chain gate on the road to my house when I saw it I drove across the chain sat in the car for five minutes and wondered what I should do 
I looked at it though there were a train of Lights trailing from one side 
should I drive to Tombstone to report it no I thought maybe it would disappear so 
I drove on but it remained when I went through another gate I saw a second object very shiny 
and gold it was stationary and once in a while both would glow simultaneously 
so Pearl did talk to researchers and she insisted that she had good eyesight she 
didn't drink and in fact she was able to watch the objects through binoculars and she got more 
detail she said that the second object had a bright pink band around the circumference and 
another band around the circumference which changed in color from red to purple to gold 
she said the objects also seem to be slightly blurred in appearance but were very brilliant 
really bright as Pearl says in her own words it also hurt my eyes to look at its brightness but I 
was happily excited about the beauty of the thing I never was afraid I had no fear just excited 
so what's interesting about this is these objects amazingly remained there for almost 
four hours giving Pearl plenty of time to watch them as she says a few minutes before 
midnight they disappeared they seemed to back off into the valley behind the peak 
now investigators of course interviewed Pearl and they did contacts nearby Fort Huachuca army base 
and they refused to comment or investigate saying only quote the Air Force has that responsibility 
but they did learn that Pearl was not the only witness also seeing the light was Mrs Mayfield 
and she didn't really pay too much attention to it because she assumed at first that it was just a bright light reflecting off of her glass door 
and it wasn't until she learned about what Pearl saw that she really wondered so two days after the sighting Pearl drove up there with Miss Mayfield's husband Mr Willard 
Mayfield to investigate and they did find a burned spot it looked like it had been 
exposed to a very high heat and they also smelled a weird odor which as Willard Mayfield says 
it was queer acid-like it was nothing like our fuels smell gasoline or diesel or at least nothing 
like we know of rocks on the peak were also hot a terrific heat you couldn't hold your hands on them 
it was like a hot iron so they got a good look at this photographs were taken by researchers 
and they could see that the cactus plants at the site were badly charred at the base but weirdly 
not on the top and they saw really specific burn spots about four by eight inches in diameter 
but what's really interesting about this sighting this is very near the Copper Bell mine 
and there are many sightings of UFOs over mines particularly in Arizona I do suspect that that 
was a genuine UFO landing as we have seen there are a lot of cases involving UFOs over mines 
copper mines particularly in Arizona which is filled with copper mines in fact I did a whole 
episode on UFO's over copper mines I would have included this one but I didn't know about it 
but wow what a case and judging by The Landing trace evidence where they could 
see that this round was super heated uh yeah it looks like a genuine case to me 
and here's another really fascinating case which I call UFO landing at Mellon Wisconsin 
and this is an amazing case because the whole family viewed this object which landed right on 
their Road right towards the end of their driveway and they were able to see this thing from only a 
few hundred feet away and it stayed there for long enough that they got a really good look at 
it this is a real doozy of a case it occurred on March 13 1975 and it was in the evening 
when 15 year old Jane Baker decided to take the cats out into the garage for the evening 
something she normally does and that's what she heard a quote strange high toned noise and looking 
down on the street they could see a saucer it was a classic saucer silver in color with a domed top 
and a glowed yellowish White they were flashing red and green lights around the circumference 
and a yellowish Square along the side of the craft so Jane ran inside and got her father and the two 
of them walked to the end of their driveway and approached to about within 300 feet of this object 
they could hear sort of a weird banging sound of metal on metal coming from inside this object 
now her Father Phil Baker was very much impressed by this not being anything conventional and as he 
says in his own words I didn't believe what I was seeing it was circular about 12 feet 
across with red and bluish green lights running around the outside the center was a door with a 
brilliant light coming from inside it made a whining sound a sound I'd never heard before 
so they weren't the only ones seeing it back in the house 16 year old Monty and 12 year 
old John Baker and of course the wife Miss Baker watched from the window and after a few minutes 
of watching this craft Phil and Jane who were pretty close to it went back into the house to 
call the police and as Phil spoke on the phone there was a loud boom and the craft was gone 
so the next day they went out to look at the Landing site and looking over the swampy area of 
pine trees in the area she saw Jane what appeared to be the same object hovering at Treetop level 
this time it had no lights or glow or any sound at all she ran inside grabbed her coat was called out brought the family dog out the craft was 
still there she tried to get closer but the dog began yelping and whining and pawing at its ears 
so she took the dog back into the house and when she went back outside it was gone 
now here's where it gets even more interesting The Bakers later found out that the night of 
their first sighting of this landing at least six police officers in four different neighboring 
counties described what appears to be the exact same craft and in fact it's swooped low over one 
of the patrol cars causing the radio to go dead a fact which was in fact confirmed by 
Ashland under Sheriff George Ree and he was the one who actually responded to the baker's call 
now he didn't see the landed craft but as he left and drove to meet the other deputies he 
and other officers so I'll get this four objects darting around and changing colors 
police Witnesses said that they were bright enough to light up the area like day and these objects 
were Dart stand still and zigzag across the sky meanwhile numerous Witnesses were calling the 
police in fact Ashland County Sheriff Joe Crow Ted said quote telephones were ringing off the hook 
so a final interesting endnote to this case is the baker's case was eventually aired on the 
very popular television program in search of hosted by Leonard Nimoy and Leonard actually 
cited this case in particular specifically as one that he found particularly convincing 
so yeah quite a case with a lot of witnesses so there you go Spock Leonard Nimoy even thought 
that this was a super impressive case and he stated it as one that really convinced him that 
there is something true to the UFL phenomena another really amazing thing about this case 
is they weren't the only Witnesses while they were the only ones who saw it on the ground in that evening so many police officers saw this craft darting all over the place 
again with some of these these could be reverse engineered craft we cannot rule that out given 
that no humanoids were seen and this was not too far from a military base so it's entirely possible 
I can't say for sure but I think we have to be really careful when we're judging these cases and 
calling them extraterrestrial craft because they might not be however some of these other cases I 
think yes and this next one I really wonder about which I call UFO landing in Kuwait now you heard 
me Kuwait uh this got a lot of attention in the press and in fact went to the highest levels of 
government not only in Kuwait but in the United States we have the government documents as you 
shall see that prove this and I think the reason is is because this landed right next to the oil 
fields actually shut them down the the processing plant it's very good evidence a lot of witnesses 
a lot of activity both before and after this Landing even to the point where this craft 
was or a similar craft was photographed so yeah there's a lot to learn from this incident moving 
along this case occurred on November 10 1978. yeah in Kuwait and in fact according to seven workers 
one of who you can see right here of the Kuwait oil company they were working in the alcebria 
oil fields this is about 90 miles outside of the Kuwait capital of Umesh when a gigantic UFO landed 
now they described it as cylindrical with a dome on top and flashing red lights and huge about as 
big as a jumbo jet they said it landed about 250 yards away from an oil pumping station which was 
totally knocked offline with no electricity or Communications as soon as this object landed 
they said it was totally silent the workers said that they were quote Frozen with horror and were 
at first too afraid to approach it but the object remained on the ground for several minutes about 
seven minutes they estimate and they started to walk towards it and this is when it took 
off totally silent and as soon as it was gone the pump station automatically went back online 
so this got a lot of attention from high levels of government and in fact according to Kuwaiti security Chief Brigadier General Muhammad al-hamad it was the first UFO ever cited in Kuwait 
I'm not sure I would go that far but certainly this first to get a lot of attention like this 
and the sighting as I said went all the way to the top of the Kuwaiti government the minister of State Abdul Aziz Hussein told reporters that they were forming a 
committee of scientists Aviation officials and Ministry representatives to study the encounter 
and they soon learned that this was not a singular event there were numerous 
sightings in the area including both before and after the landing and they 
took this very seriously and in fact officials provided the Oil Workers with camera equipment 
and according to the Arab Times newspaper and I quote one man who had been given a camera by the 
oil company to record just such a reoccurrence managed to take a number of photographs of 
the object as it flew over a 20-foot Water Tower and hovered in the area for 30 minutes 
as with previous sightings all long-distance Communications were disrupted but internal 
phones continued to operate enabling Oil Company employees to contact their supervisor who rushed 
out in time to witness the object results of the photography have not been disclosed well 
they have now you can see the picture here it's not super impressive just a white light but yeah 
according to people who analyze this and talk to the witness this was a craft 
and it's the report says it's a disc with a dome protruding in the middle and it completely lit up 
rather like a neon sign or a fluorescent tube so yeah not the only sighting the initial one 
occurred on November 10 but sightings continued all the way into January of 1979 and they did 
get a lot of press attention in fact the U.S government investigated it quite thoroughly 
as we now know from documents released through the Freedom of Information Act so UFOs do seem 
to show an interest sometimes in technological installations that could be what's going on here 
I don't think that this was a reverse engineered craft given how our governments reacted to it 
again hard to say for sure with no humanoids being seen but yeah it put a lot of people on 
high alert and really went to the highest levels of government which I think is super significant 
and here's another case which was very nearly covered up by the witnesses parents I call 
this one UFO landing in Leeds England I like this one because again it's a multiple witness 
case they were really close to this craft it affected them quite a bit emotionally it's 
clear they're absolutely sincere about it that's also interesting because as is true in many of 
these cases there were Landing traces which were verified by investigators this case occurred on 
November 27 1978 and the actual specific location is Woodhouse Ridge this is in the Needwood Valley 
on the outskirts of Leeds England and it was a Snowy Evening around half past six when the 
two witnesses both 14 year old girls their names are Lindsay teves and Susan Pearson 
they were out sledding when they noticed a cluster of Lights hovering about 100 feet overhead and 
looking up they saw three green lights in a row and beneath that a brilliant red light they were 
shining down onto the snow and were so bright that the girls could just barely make out an oval 
shape with sort of fins Behind the Lights made no noise whatsoever and they realized instantly this 
was not any normal aircraft and they became quite afraid it seemed to sense their presence they said 
because as soon as they saw it this object began to descend in a spiraling Falling Leaf motion 
which is certainly what we hear in a lot of these types of cases at the same time they said 
it emitted a shrill whining noise as it came down it slowed its descent and the shrill whining noise 
train changed to a sort of a humming noise and it settled on the ground only about 30 feet away 
at this point the girls were too frightened and shocked to even move they said this object was about the size of a small car it appeared to be Metallica Gray 
both felt that there was someone inside this object observing them and that freaked them out 
they decided to retreat and they edged along and nearby wall hiding in its shadow you can see the 
landing site here uh then they ran and after running for about 150 feet they turned around 
curious and so this object was now Rising off the ground you could see its lights flickering and the 
object then actually moved towards them and got to within they think about a hundred feet making 
a wide sweeping turn and then descended down the edge of the slope and disappeared from View 
now they became very curious at this point and overcoming Their Fear Lindsay and Susan crept 
forward and saw that the object had actually landed again and was Now sort of perched on a 
steep incline about 90 feet away they watched it for two minutes at which point it began to wobble 
it Rose smoothly upwards and continued its Ascent until it was just a speck in the sky and was gone 
so they ran quickly to Susan's aunt's house and inside and said we've seen this object they told 
her aunt her name is Judy Pearson it was some flying thing it landed right near us it weren't 
a helicopter and I weren't an airplane now Judy thought they were kidding but it quickly became 
clear that they were sincere so she separated them and had them sketch a drawing of what they saw 
the drawings were nearly identical so she told the girls to show her where it happened 
and Judy Pearson went out there she didn't see any evidence at first but word did spread 
now the father didn't want this well known but investigators Mark and Graham birdsaw heard about 
the case they were alerted to it and they arrived and went with the girls to The Landing location 
and they said that they did in fact find a half circular depression on the hard ice along the edge 
of the path where the girls believed the UFO had first landed now they couldn't be entirely sure if 
this was caused by the object but when the girls showed them the second landing spot the birdsalls 
did find an e-shaped depression or cavity in the snow with a strange circular hole in the middle 
now near the spot they found a conical piece of ice so they picked it up and placed it in the 
hall and it fit perfectly so this little cone of ice was clearly pulled out by this craft 
these are good Landing Trace cases they did the research and later Mark and Graham Birdsall did 
find two ambulance drivers who reported seeing what was apparently the same object in the same 
general area on that night though of course the drivers didn't see it land they did also 
interview a Mr T A Hatfield and his wife who also described seeing a UFO on that night in that area 
now there was some interesting aftermath to this case because later a government official showed 
up unannounced to question the girls and they did describe the sighting now Lindsay's father Tony 
tabs spoke with this government official and asked him directly have other people seen these things 
the official said oh yes I can assure you they have Tony asked him do you believe what the girls 
say the government man said I can assure you they've seen something the father asked what 
makes you so sure the government guy said I can tell by their answers to the questions I asked 
I'd have found out if they weren't speaking the truth and the father Tony asked what did they see 
the government guy said I can't say at this state what it was but it will be best if you and the girls don't discuss it further we won't be bothering you again 
so not really a threat or anything but definitely a suggestion if you will to keep 
quiet and they don't know who this government man was so that in itself is a little unusual 
but Lindsay is absolutely convinced she saw a genuine UFO and as she says I still keep looking 
but I have seen nothing as dramatic I believe yeah quite an interesting case so I don't know 
uh genuine alien craft reverse engineered you can make up your own minds about it one of the things 
I wonder about you know given the possibility that these are reverse engineered is why are they 
flying around places where people can see them so easily I don't know but this next case I think we 
have a good reason why this craft landed this one I call UFO landing at transval South Africa 
and this witness actually was driving around the corner and Came Upon A landed UFO and you could 
see instantly why it had landed because it had a giant hole in the side it was apparently damaged 
so this is an interesting case in that regards only but yeah also had some other Witnesses some 
really interesting aspects to it in terms of I believe Landing traces as we shall see this case occurred on March 30th 1995 and the primary witness is Jan Pinar he's a farmer 
he was driving around 8 30 a.m along a country road between Coligny and Brock Sprout when this 
is in transval South Africa and He Came Upon A landed UFO right in the center of the road 
and I'll just quote Yan extensively because he he does give a really good testimony and as he 
says in his own words and I quote I came around a curve in the road and saw a black man shielding 
his face with his arm as though he wanted to ward off something at that exact moment the 
engine of my brand new small truck stopped I looked up and saw the most incredible sight 
roughly 80 meters on the road in front of me stood the huge craft that rested on three Landing pods 
it extended over the entire width of the road and was about eight to nine meters high 
the entire unit was translucent and lustrous as though it had been fabricated from a type 
of stainless steel it had the form of two inverted soup plates with a pudding bowl on top 
it appeared as though this upper level had seven windows or portholes 
a red violet green yellow glow emanated from somewhere and illuminated the hull in the sheen of 
the light I was able to recognize that the flying craft had problems because there was a dent with 
a hole of a little less than two feet on the seam around the edge I could not see any beings in the 
vicinity only the strange craft which buzzed like a gigantic electric beater I got out of my small 
truck but suddenly I could not make another step it was as though a magnet held me on the same spot 
stood like this for three to four minutes when the craft suddenly Rose into the air 
first it lifted up like a helicopter High into the sky and that sped away like lightning on a course 
towards heaven after a few minutes of composing himself Jan started his truck it started normally 
he saw this other witness bicycling away as fast as he could on his bicycle 
at this point Jan went to the closest nearby farm and called the police who told them that 
in fact there had been numerous reports from the night before in that same area 
so then Jan returned with another farmer to the exact scene of the landing 
and saw that the landing site was badly scorched and was in fact still burning hot to the touch 
they also smelled a weird odor like chloroform lingering in the air now it is interesting in 
that case that when he tried to approach it took off we do see that in a lot of these cases 
so uh yeah I don't know what happened to that craft but clearly it was damaged and it's truly 
an interesting and very well verified case now I get to the last case of the bunch which 
I call landing at Crossville Tennessee and this was reported to move on it comes from a 
good witness although if she is anonymous she is a teacher so well educated and this case 
is not a one-off as we've seen a number of these cases there are events following the major event 
so judging from what the witness said it's entirely possible she's having direct contact 
but what I'd like to talk about mostly is what she saw and yeah I like this case because there is an 
illustration showing exactly what happened and there's some interesting aspects to it as well 
it was around 5 30 a.m on April 10 2002 when a teacher had her really incredible encounter 
involving a UFO landing she did report this to mufan she's Anonymous a teacher 
and it was again yeah around 5 30 a.m and the witness was hoping to see some deer 
on the lake behind her house and instead she was shocked to see a bronze colored metallic 
looking octagon shaped object was quite wide she said 20 feet wide and it was actually resting on 
the surface of the lake so yeah that is kind of a landing and she watched it for a full minute 
during which time it made no sound or movement she saw what looked like eight darker colored 
circles around the edge of this craft and a dome in the center after watching this for 
just a minute or so she went to get her husband but by the time they got back the object was gone 
so a pretty brief sighting however not the end of the story because it was about one month later 
7 30 p.m May 3rd when she saw a weird light coming right up out of this little Lake behind 
their house and when they went to bed that night she heard the coyotes outside howling shared some 
weird banging against the house said following this she had a weird poltergeist-like activity 
and she also noticed a weird scoop mark on her leg of unknown Origins so possibly more than just a 
landing but certainly an interesting Landing case all right there you go that's 12 UFO landing cases 
and yeah again what I like about these cases is they reach back decades they're coming from all 
over the world many of these are multiple witness cases and when someone sees a UFO landing this is 
so different from a simple sighting of a light in the sky these are all clearly metallic craft 
in every single case and as I said in the beginning and throughout I think there are a 
couple of them at least two which in my judgment are probably reverse engineered government craft 
but again that's something that we just can't say for sure but absolutely we need to watch out for 
because it's entirely possible and judging from the huge number of whistleblower accounts 
we have reverse engineered this technology at least to a certain extent 
but yeah these cases coming from all over the world multiple Witnesses 
animal reactions electromagnetic effects in some cases Landing traces and a number of them 
and physiological effects so it's certainly not resting solely on eyewitness testimony 
as Skeptics would have you believe and what I find interesting about these cases is our 
governments are completely ignoring them they're just talking about simple sightings and saying we don't know what these are I think they do I think that this is just a diversionary tactic 
by talking about sightings they're ignoring all the landing cases cases of direct contact 
and people are not talking about the possibility of Crash retrievals so that's important because 
this does again point to the possibility that we have reverse engineered this technology 
so yeah that's the episode for today I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate 
it hope you learned something and also found it interesting but until next time thanks very much 
and as I like to always say keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth 
and please do make an effort to keep of having fun bye for now.
