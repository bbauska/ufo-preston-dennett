THREE INCREDIBLE CASES OF KIDS CONTACTING UFO CRAFT
Sep 30, 2022

Summary:
Sep 30, 2022
Did you know that children comprise a significant number of UFO witnesses? There are many reasons for this. One is that children are usually outside more than adults. Also, children are more likely to report their encounters than are adults. A third reason is that UFO contact often begins early in childhood. As evidenced by the many cases of schoolyard UFO encounters, ETs like to show themselves to children. Unfortunately, children are often disbelieved or not taken seriously. Therefore, it's likely that the actual numbers of kids contact UFOs is higher than most people think.

This video presents three incredible cases of kids who have had UFO encounters. Each of these cases involves multiple witnesses and various forms of evidence such as electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects and landing traces. Under the J. Allen Hynek system, these would be classified as Close Encounters of the Second and Third Kind. In other words, these are not simple sightings, but very close encounters in which the environment is affected in some way, and/or involve humanoids.

CASE ONE: THE CASA BLANCA ENCOUNTER. On the afternoon of August 22, 1955, a group of eight children were playing outside their homes in the Casa Blanca area of Riverside, California. Looking up, the children saw a silver spinning disc swooping down from above. As the children watched, the object disappeared and reappeared several times. Suddenly there were multiple objects of different shapes and sizes, some emitting a strange musical pinging sound. Without warning, one of the objects (described as the size of three homes) landed in a nearby field. A strange-looking humanoid being stepped out and began beckoning at the kids to go onboard. For the next hour or two, pandemonium ensued as the children interacted with the UFOs and the strange being. Some of the children came very close to going onboard, but were held back by their friends. Strangely, two adults were present for at least part of the encounter, but could not see anything! Reporters and UFO researchers converged to investigate the case. There was no evidence of a hoax, and the case remains unexplained to this day.

CASE TWO: KIDS BUZZED BY A UFO. On the evening of February 24, 1959, a young high school student was babysitting his little brother in their home in Victorville, California. Without warning, a weird buzzing sound filled the air, and the house began to vibrate. The radio in the house became filled with static and the dogs outside started to bark furiously. Running outside, the witness was amazed to see a large UFO craft swoop down directly over his house at a height of only ten feet. Moments later, the UFO returned, swooping down again, coming even lower. Terrified, the witness ran inside to grab his gun and protect his home. For the next few minutes, the UFO swooped down over their home at least five times before finally accelerating off into the distance. The boys' parents arrived home to find their children hiding inside, and their two dogs shaking and cowering in fear. They contacted authorities to report the incident. Air Force intelligence officers from Project Blue Book arrived, and after interviewing the witnesses, declared the case genuine. They discovered that the neighbors experienced unexplained static on their TV sets. Unable to explain the case, Project Blue Book labeled the case unidentified: Case #1140.

CASE THREE: THE LEMON GROVE UFO LANDING. On November 6, 1973, Richard T. and Daniel F (age eleven) were exploring the fields near their homes in Lemon Grove, California. To their amazement, they came upon a strange object landed in the field. It was metallic, saucer-shaped with a dome on top and covered with colored lights. Wondering what it might be, they walked right up to it and knocked on the side with their flashlight. The object immediately lit up and began to rotate and rise upward. Terrified, the kids turned and ran, but found that they were moving in slow motion. They watched the craft accelerate upwards and disappear into the clouds. Running home, they told their parents what happened. Investigators were called in who, upon examining the site, found strange landing traces. The hard-packed clay ground had strange holes in it, and the grass beneath the craft was swirled. Investigators then learned that several neighbors reported strange interference on their televisions and radios. Also, the phone lines in the area were fused together and had to be replaced. 

These three California cases show that a close encounter with an extraterrestrial can happen without warning, when you least expect it. If you would like to learn more about these cases and others, check out my book, "UFOs over California."

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today's episode I call three incredible cases of kids contacting UFO craft many people don't know 
it but children comprise a large majority of UFO Witnesses I think there's a couple of reasons for 
this one is that children spend a lot more time outside than do adults children also are less 
shy about reporting their encounters they have little fear of being you know disbelieved or 
ridiculed they're very open and another reason I'm speculating is that ETS enjoy contacting 
children many people who are contactees do report that their encounter started at a very young age 
so I think there are a number of reasons why there are so many children who are UFO Witnesses 
and that's why I wanted to do this episode today because children are often disbelieved 
and not taken seriously when in fact they are far more likely than most people to see a UFO and I've 
chosen three cases again that I want to present to you today and these are not simple sightings 
these are quite extensive encounters under the J Allen heineck system that would be classified as 
Close Encounters of the second or third kind each of these cases does involve multiple Witnesses 
each involves various effects such as Landing traces electromagnetic effects physiological 
effects animal reactions and so forth so these are all quite well verified and really unusual 
and I don't know if you've heard of them or not because there's a few at least two of them which 
are somewhat well known uh but I'm guessing you probably have not heard of these before 
at any rate they are very unusual and interesting and I think have a lot to say about the nature of 
the UFO phenomenon so let's just get started in the first case I'd like to talk about I 
call case one the Casa Blanca encounter this is a very interesting case involving a group 
of about eight children and at least a couple of adults it took place in the Casablanca area 
of Riverside California this is in Southern California and it took place over a period 
of about two hours from 2 to 3 P.M in the afternoon on the day of August 22nd 1955. 
and this was investigated by Major investigators such as Isabel Epperson 
and Ted blotcher and others and it really caused the near Riot following this event 
I mean it was quite a amazing encounter and was actually published in the local newspaper 
so let's just get started so again this case occurred on August 22nd 1955 it was around 
2 p.m in the afternoon when a group of about eight children ranging in age from four to five 
years old all the way up to 14 years old were playing in the backyard of Mr and Mrs Douglas 
of Casablanca in Riverside California we actually know the exact address of this location 
and how this all began was when one of the boys Ronnie Strickland had climbed onto the roof 
and he noticed a roof of one of the houses and noticed a spinning silver disc hovering overhead 
and has seen the other children looked up this disc like object disappeared and began to reappear 
several times and this is when they noticed that there were more than one object in the sky 
there were several orb-like objects which kept appearing and disappearing and they 
were of different shapes and each time they would make these weird sort of musical pinging noises 
so the children became quite excited and at this point one of these objects swooped down 
and actually landed in a field next to the house one of the witnesses said it was quote 
about as large as three houses put together and as he says it was very beautiful and colorful 
and at this point uh a humanoid being actually exited this craft and one of the witnesses was 
a child by the name of Kermit Douglas and he said and I quote a little man 
came out he said it was about three and a half feet tall and as he says it had 
quote big red eyes a big red mouth and four diamond-shaped things where his nose should be 
so this little being got out of this craft and began to walk towards these boys they 
said it was very short but they said about the size of a four-year-old child it wore a 
belt with a bright disc on top of it one of the kids said it was sort of shadowy in appearance 
and they said it appear had what appeared to be four arms and in two of these arms it was holding 
these gun-like instruments and at this point this space man if you will pointed one of these 
objects at one of the kids by the name of Ronnie Strickland and Ronnie suddenly felt himself being 
levitated as he says I just floated off into space from a house top and this was actually witnessed 
by one of the boy's mothers who came running out and said the boy turned bright red at this time 
and the boy's friends also saw Ronnie float down off the rooftop and land on the ground 
they came running to make sure he was all right and he was but at this point this same figure 
pointed one of these other devices at two of the witnesses rendering them temporarily paralyzed 
one of the witnesses Wayne Gardner described as being as a quote man with a funny costume 
another one of the children his name was Marvin Sims described how these UFOs would appear and 
disappear and he said and I quote that the spaceships sort of spiraled down and when 
they took off they pulled up off the ground and then disappeared with a whirling motion 
so while one of these objects landed in the field in a humanoid exited another seemed to land on the 
roof of one of the houses and another right on top of a walnut tree and actually broke off a branch 
and this was going on for quite some time the children were screening at least two 
adults came out and they said they did not see anything although they could see that 
the children were reacting so that's a very strange feature of this case 
a couple of the children's said that they were being mentally beckoned to go inside of The Craft 
and one of them who was seven years old fell into a trance and started to walk towards this craft 
and he was saying out loud out loud that it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen 
his friends became concerned and grabbed his arms and would not let him walk forward 
meanwhile two other kids said that they were being told to climb a tree and wait to be picked up they 
seemed to do this in a trance and they climbed right up this tree and the other kids tried to 
call them down and finally turned a hose on them which convinced them to come back down 
so at some point this little man quote scurried back into the saucer which took off and went away 
but again this went on for at least an hour the kids were interviewed by reporters reporter Bob 
Rhoden wrote an article for the Riverside Enterprise newspaper an artist was uh 
brought to the scene her name was Jean Roland and she did drawings of all these objects based 
on the kids descriptions and also drew the humanoid figure that these kids saw 
at one point one kid described how this disembodied like arm was beckoning at him 
they all described the various shapes and these weird humanoids uh and uh several adults uh were 
there at the time uh Miss Maddie Johnson her son was one of the witnesses she verified the 
event and said that her son came running to her and nearly knocked her down he was so frightened 
and in fact several of the kids were so frightened that they continued to cry for hours afterwards 
another one of the witnesses was Blanche Campbell 
she was a neighbor and she confirmed that all the kids reported this and were very much frightened 
but the weird part about this is that two adults were present when this was going on and the kids 
were pointing at the objects and the adults could not see it this does turn up in some UFO cases 
so I don't know what exactly is going on here but this does appear to be a display for the 
children or the children being contacted directly it afterwards the entire Street was in a near riot 
and reporters were called and did generate an article in the local newspaper as I said 
but what's very interesting about this case is there are eight Witnesses at least 
there are landing traces in the form of the broken branch on the walnut tree physiological 
effects one of the boys his skin turned bright red and they were at least two kids reported being 
paralyzed and kids receiving telepathic messages to approach the craft or wait to be taken on board 
there is no direct indication that this was in fact an onboard experience but it could have 
led to one if uh you know the other kids had not restrained the kid who was walking towards one of 
these craft so it's a very strange case which was a very well investigated very well verified and 
remains a classic in UFO history so as you can see that's a very well verified and very unusual event 
but now let's move on to case two and I call case two kids buzzed by a UFO 
this again is a multiple in this case involves more than just the two children this took place in 
Victorville California on the evening of February 24th 1959 this case was investigated by Project 
Blue Book which was not able to explain it this is case number 1140 which was labeled unidentified 
and this is a very unusual case involving animal effects electromagnetic effects and 
a very unusual type of behavior from these UFOs and how this all began was on the evening again 
of February 24th 1959. so this case took place in Victorville and what's really interesting 
is this was eight miles away from George Air Force Base directly south eight miles away 
so this was of great interest to Project Blue Book Intelligence Officers and how this all began was 
on the evening of February 24th again in 1959 and the main witness is an anonymous high school 
student who is described by the investigating Air Force intelligence officer as an average young man 
of average intelligence liked by his schoolmate and teachers and the main investigator for this 
case was officer Rudolph pastelosi and what's interesting about that is Rudolph pastelosi was 
himself a UFO witness he had seen UFOs earlier in Arizona near Davis-Monthan Air Force Base 
and he was apparently a contactee because he would later write a book called letters to you 
from balaran about his telepathic Communications with ETS so he was the main investigating officer 
and according to Rudolf testelosi the main witness the high school student was babysitting his 
younger brother and the two of them were alone in the house and they were just getting ready to go 
to bed at around 10 pm when he observed a quote bright white steady light that he said was much 
too intense to be a car the at the same time the family's pet dogs began to howl and run around 
in complete Terror begging to be let inside the house so the high school student opened 
the front door and he was shocked to see a 150 foot long egg-shaped object he said it was dull 
red in color and had purple tinges around the edges and was emitting an intense white light 
this object was only a hundred feet away and was moving towards him at Treetop level and he 
realized with shock that it was coming directly for his house and the space of about 10 seconds 
this object approached until it was directly over the house passing over the front yard at 
a height of only 10 feet so this is very low and at this point the high school student could hear 
a sound which he described as quote similar to The Hum of a transformer but higher in Pitch 
the investigating officers asked him could it possibly have been a sonic boom he heard 
and the kids said no absolutely not he's heard Sonic booms many times he's familiar with aircraft 
coming in and out of George Air Force Base and he said that this was not at all like them 
and in fact he provided a description of this egg-shaped object 
and the Blue Book officers actually Drew this uh object based on the boy's description 
and Drew what happened next because as this object passed overhead it seemed to disappear 
but the encounter wasn't over yet the witness returned inside to check on 
his younger brother and the dogs and when he returned outside again the object was bat back 
and this time it was just west of his house and was again at approaching even lower this 
time at about a height of only eight feet so this terrified the boy he dashed back inside 
at the time his parents were not in the house they were at night school so he felt like he 
had to protect his younger brother in the house and so he ran inside and retrieved the family gun 
while his younger brother looked out the front window and observed this object which was now 
hovering in place in front of the house the high school student took the gun and went outside and 
he saw this object hovering just west of the house and at this point it started to approach him again 
at high speed this scared him so he dashed back into the house and the two boys watched from the 
window as this object moved away turned around and came swooping down again directly over the house 
and it did this again 15 minutes later the object returned coming so low that the entire 
house vibrated so this object was clearly putting on a show it wanted to be noticed 
and was swooping over the house repeatedly and the witnesses noticed that each time the object 
passed over the house the radio which was on became completely blocked by quote intense 
static and at the same time they would hear this strange crackling noise coming from the craft 
so the two boys were quite frightened and they remained inside is this craft swooped over 
their house very low a total of at least five times before it finally left and their parents 
arrived home at around 11 p.m by this point the craft was gone for good but they listened 
to the boys they could tell that they were quite frightened very sincere and they did notice that 
both of their dogs were quote whimpering and shaking and hiding under the furniture 
so they reported it and this is when Blue Book officials arrived and Rudolph pastelosi 
the interrogating intelligence officer said that the witness was quote sincere and did not change 
his story although questioned several times on different points and seemed generally convinced 
that what he saw actually exists so again they did drawings of what the boys saw and 
mapped out the trajectory of these CR this craft based on the boy's eyewitness testimony 
and they also did a further investigation and questioned The Neighbors and at least two of them 
confirmed this incident and said that they saw quote something but they refused to elaborate but 
they did admit that they both had severe radio and television interference at about that time 
so again this took place very close to George Air Force Base and this caused some concern 
among the Intelligence Officers they were unable to explain it this was a case that involved not 
only animal effects but electromagnetic effects for at least three of the homes in this area 
it's quite unusual for an object to come that low and repeatedly Buzz a house over and over again 
the interrogating officers from Project Blue Book were very impressed so I can only imagine 
what that must have been like for these two boys and again Air Force Intelligence Officers 
were not able to explain this and labeled it unidentified case number one one four zero 
and now we move to the third and final case which is somewhat well known within the UFO community 
and I call this case a Lemon Grove UFO landing this was researched by prominent researchers 
such as Idabel Apperson Donald Carr who worked for apro the aerial phenomenon research organization 
San diego-based researcher Mel Podell also researched and verified this case this case 
involves a UFO landing as witnessed by two boys though there are outside witnesses as well 
and this involves Landing traces which have yet to be fully explained this is quite a remarkable 
and unusual case as we shall see this third case took place on a little dead end street 
called Crane Street and again this is in Lemon Grove in Southern California it was on November 
16 1973 when two 11 year old boys their names are Richard T and Daniel F uh their actual identities 
were withheld but they claimed to have had a very unusual experience where they witnessed a landed 
UFO it was around 6 PM they said when the two boys were exploring the neighborhood around their home 
and they just were crossing over a vacant property surrounded by a chain link fence that just passed 
a clump of bamboo and we were walking through this area with dried grass and hard clay ground they 
walked into this field and got the shock of their life and as I'll just read the report on this case 
which was written by Idabel Epperson and Donald Carr of the aerial phenomena research organization 
as the report on this case says and I quote after passing a clump of bamboo 
they came out into the open and saw an object sitting in a darkened field 
they slowly approached it and after about five minutes one boy who had a flashlight 
in his hand walked up to it and wrapped on it three or four times with the flashlight 
the object which the boys described as Dole gray immediately came to life 
the wrapping had produced a metallic sound a dome on top of the object about as high as its diameter 
became illuminated with intense red light which irradiated the entire area including the boys 
at the same time the object which had been about 18 inches off the ground rose up to 
about three or four feet a row of green lights around the peripheral rim of the object started 
to Blink in sequence and the object started to rotate making a not very high pitch sound 
the rate of rotation became very high with the red light blinking on and off then the red light 
went off momentarily came back on and the object Rose into the air still making the same sound 
now the investigators did ask the boys to provide a drawing and Richard T provided two 
drawings where he Illustrated exactly what this craft looked like and how they came right up to 
it and literally knocked on the door so to speak uh and as the report reads I'm continuing uh what 
was written on this case and I quote the boys started to run they felt chills tingly and weak 
they agreed that they felt as if they were going to black out and that they were running in slow 
motion they said that the object took off towards the southwest and they got up to the street and 
they saw it disappear into the clouds this is a very important point because there was some 
confusion about how long this lasted and the fact that they reported a distortion in time 
is something that does turn up in other cases this was reported in the Rua Zimbabwe Landing 
case where some of the kids felt like things were moving in actual slow motion and there are 
a number of other cases like that whereas there's this weird time Distortion effect 
so I found that very interesting so following this incident the boys were interrogated in depth 
and uh the investigators not only interviewed the boys but their mothers as well and everyone agreed 
that the boys were in fact telling the truth they went and checked the field for landing traces and 
Donald Carr did discover three holes forming a perfect equilateral triangle and in the same 
area where this craft had nearly landed there were the dead grass in the area were swirled and 
a counter-clockwise circular pattern again this ground was described as extremely hard dry clay 
so apro did uh provide a investigator by the name of Walter Walker who analyzed The 
Landing Trace cases although the results were not published as far as I know 
but investigators didn't stop there they started going house to house in this area asking the 
neighbors if they had experienced anything strange and as it turns out yes they did at 
least five neighbors reported intense and bizarre interference with their television sets one of the 
residents on this street Crane Street her name is Catherine Chase and she said this television 
interference occurred at precisely 7 20 p.m which was confirmed by the other neighbors so there 
again is some speculation about the possibility of missing time though this was never confirmed 
there was another kind of interesting aspect to this case when it was discovered that telephone 
service in this area had been impaired at the time and ultimately required two telephone lines to be 
replaced they were fused together another one of the residents her name is Judy Fergus she lived 
on Crane Street and she saw the landing traces and confirmed that the grass was all swirled together 
this is also confirmed by researcher Mel Podell who saw the landing traces and he called it a 
great case I agree it's a case involving Landing traces and EM effects and multiple Witnesses and 
has yet to this day to be explained so those are the three cases I wanted to present to you 
today and I think you'll agree they are quite striking very unusual very close-up encounters 
and again all involved kids and uh what I like about these cases is every single one of them 
does have adult Witnesses who verify it in to some degree in terms of experiencing electromagnetic 
effects or verifying The Landing traces and so forth I did Cover these three cases in my book 
UFOs over California so if you'd like to learn more about them you can certainly check that out 
but again I like these cases because kids do comprise a large majority of UFO Witnesses and 
often they're not believed and they're not taken seriously I think there's a message 
here that we should probably listen to our children when they come running inside and say 
that they're seeing a UFO so that's our episode for today I hope you've enjoyed it once again 
I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time 
keep asking for questions keep searching for answers and most important keep having fun.
