THOSE AMAZING USO'S!

Summary:
Mar 24, 2023
USOs! Unidentified submersible objects! For many years, there wasn’t much research into the 
subject of USOs. UFO research focused mostly on flying objects. But today UFO investigators 
have come to realize that our oceans are swarming with extraterrestrial craft. Mile for mile, 
one of the top producers of USO reports is the stretch of water off the southern California 
coast, known as the Santa Catalina/San Pedro channel. There are now more than 150 documented 
cases on record.

This video presents more than a dozen dramatic cases of UFO/USO activity in the Santa Catalina 
channel. These are cases involving multiple witnesses, radar confirmation, photographs, films, 
physiological effects and more.

Jan 28, 1953, Rex Hardy Jr, a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy and others observed four 
silver discs over Malibu, CA. They estimated that the objects were each the size of a B-36 
aircraft, and moved at about 1200 MPH. This was the first of several sightings in that area 
that would cause great concern for Air Force officers.

Dec 16, 1953, Clarence ‘Kelly’ Johnson, designer of the U2 aircraft was with his wife near 
Pt. Mugu when saw a strange object moving against the prevailing winds. At the same time, the 
crew of a Lockheed WV2 aircraft sighted the same object from Long Beach. Project Bluebook 
officers investigated the case and told the witnesses they had seen nothing but a “lenticular 
cloud!”

Mar 22, 1957, two UFOs were detected on radar at LAX Airport. When the objects approached to 
within ten miles, the Air Force scrambled F-89 jets, at which point, the radar station lost 
power. Minutes later, the objects appeared during a missile test at Pt. Mugu and were filmed. 
Unfortunately, the film was classified and has never been released. The next day, the objects 
returned and were seen by hundreds of people and again caught on radar.

2004, an anonymous civilian witness driving along the Pacific Coast Highway near Torrance saw 
three glowing objects only 400 feet over his car. A few months later, he and his entire family 
saw a disc-shaped craft while boating near Catalina Island.

Aug 8, 2005, a group of eight shark fishermen were off the coast of Newport Beach when the saw 
a bright object approaching. It hovered a few miles away only 100 feet above the water. Then it 
started to come closer, causing some of the fishermen to become concerned. One of the men, 
however, received a strong impression of positivity from the object.

Dec 2, 2006, a wedding party at Newport Beach were along the beach when an eerie silence 
descended over them. Looking up, they saw the shadow of an object they estimated to be about 
500 feet in diameter.

Jun 1963, the best man at a wedding in Laguna Beach was taking a nighttime walk along the beach 
when he saw a glowing object with portholes just beneath the waves. He first thought it might 
be a submarine, but realized that it was far too close to the shore.

1972, Robert Snyder was visiting his friends in Pacific Palisades when they all saw a disc-shaped 
object covered with colored lights approach from the north. As they watched, the object descended 
into the water and then began to move underwater faster at extremely high speeds.

Jun 1980, two people were camping at Point Mugu when they saw what they first thought were buoys 
with lights on them floating just offshore. Then suddenly, the objects rose into air, hovered for 
a half-minute, and darted away in the blink of an eye.

Mid-1980s, art director, Xander Smith revealed his sighting of brilliant lights offshore of Malibu. 
He first thought it might be a big-money production of a movie until the next day when he learned 
that more than a hundred people in the area had seen the “mysterious lights” and nobody could 
explain them.

1989-1994, Many witnesses along the coast from Marina Del Rey to Rancho Palos Verdes observed 
many objects floating under the water. In one instance, a very large USO was seen releasing 
smaller ones. In another incident, witnesses were warned off by mysterious government agents.

1996, Jason Brooks was with his girlfriend at Salt Beach in Dana Point when they observed what 
they thought was a boat. Then suddenly the “boat” took off straight up and began performing 
incredible darting maneuvers for 30 minutes. The next day, the USOs were back!

Throughout the 1960s, a resident of Rolling Hills observed numerous UFOs/USOs. Then one evening, 
an object hovered over her car, causing EM effects, then moved directly over her house. That 
evening, her father (who worked for the Navy designing ULF antenna) experienced what she believes 
was direct contact.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and 
the Paranormal got a pretty interesting episode for you today I think I call it those amazing 
Usos and Usos are of course unidentified submersible objects I've been studying 
Usos for a very long time ever since I started receiving reports in this one particular area 
this is the Santa Catalina San Pedro channel right off the coast of Southern California 
and up to today I've documented more than 150 cases in this one area 
so clearly something very profound is happening here that's what I'd like to talk about today 
I've got a bunch of cases over a dozen involving Usos UFOs and these are some really unusual cases 
a huge wave of sightings in over a period of days some cases involving direct contact some really 
interesting cases involve radar confirmation so these are some important cases for sure I think 
they provide some real good insights into the nature of the UFO phenomena and what's going on 
in this particular area so that's why I wanted to do this episode for you today or some really 
early cases some very recent cases and a huge variety like I said so let's just get started 
first case I'd like to talk about today occurred on January 28 1953 and this is 
right off the coast of Malibu the center of all this activity and on that day January 
28th Rex Hardy Jr he's a retired lieutenant commander in the U.S Navy and a photographer 
for Life magazine and a test pilot for Northrop aircraft so a very good witness a trained Observer 
and he was flying over Malibu with two other crewmen at about 2 20 P.M when these three men 
cited four separate unknown flying objects which they described as being about the size of a B-36 
aircraft so fairly large there were circular in shape and aluminum color they said and Lieutenant 
Commander Hardy estimated the speed of these objects I get this about 1200 miles per hour 
so they're moving quite quickly it was a really excellent sighting and what's very interesting is 
it was just under seven hours later and about 15 miles farther south when another incident occurred 
over the cities of Newport Beach and Long Beach which is again not that far away this was at 9 00 
PM when Personnel in the control tower at El Toro Marine base observed a UFO in the nearby vicinity 
at the same time that they were watching it from the tower at the El Toro Marine base employees 
at the Long Beach Airport control tower also observed what appears to be the same object 
and in fact Marine Jet Pilot major Harvey Patton was quickly scrambled after the mysterious visitor 
and he was able to pursue the UFO in his aircraft which was described as a quote large fiery red 
disc shaped object after about four minutes of pursuit major patent not surprisingly was unable 
to close the distance between himself and the object and the chase was ended 
and that's not the end of this amazing series of sightings at the same time as the above incident 
Blue Book Personnel Roger Blue Book of course being the Air Force's UFO study project 
Blue Book Personnel were alerted to further UFO activity occurring over Point Magoo which is 
located at the North End of the Santa Catalina Channel and it doesn't appear that I actually 
had any information about the other activity going on though they did declare this case unidentified 
is that 106 PM when Mr r.w loved owner of the love diving company and another witness Mr ferenti were 
engaged in retrieving radio-controlled drones on a boat about 1100 yards offshore just south of Point 
Magoo Naval Air missile Training Center and they saw a small object what they saw they described 
as a white flat disc with fuzzy or shimmering edges rapidly approaching from the Northwest 
and flew straight and level and actually overtook a jet aircraft flying at about 150 to 200 knots 
and it was very quick three seconds passed overhead and disappeared in the haze to the east 
so an interesting case that was a lot of sightings in one area at one time 
it was just six months later in August of 1953 there was another incredible sighting 
in this same exact area 1953 was a big year but in August of 1953 engineer Frederick Hare 
who would later become quite prominent in the UFO field writing about UFOs he witnessed a dramatic 
display of a UFO Fleet over Santa Monica and as he says in his own words twice in one day I saw 
saucers and witnessed a whole Squadron of them go through various Maneuvers lasting 10 minutes 
he says he observed quote brilliant white bars start very quickly across the sky suddenly they 
all came together and formed a diamond pattern he said around a somewhat diffused object 
so these are moving in ways no aircraft that we have can move and as he watched this Central 
object disappeared the surrounding objects began to Dart around and they also disappeared that was 
later that evening Frederick hair returned outside and observed another UFO outside his home which he 
described as looking quote like two Jupiters closely coupled so glowing spherical objects 
and he says they hung in the sky motionless for just a few moments and then disappeared so yeah 
1953 was a big year and there was a cluster of sightings and this one really sharply defined area 
here's another cluster of cases which I find super interesting because this occurred over a period 
of about two days in one area and it's amazing radar confirmation was March 22nd 1957 at 11 55 pm 
two objects were picked up on radar at Los Angeles International Airport 
if you've watched some of my previous YouTube episodes you know I did a whole episode on UFOs over LAX but this case is really interesting because these objects 
were appeared on radar and these targets appear to be rectangular and the size of 
a conventional Target but the speed of these objects was approximately 3 600 miles per hour 
they were first detected about 10 miles to the Northwest and were heading at a 320 degree heading 
and then they stopped at approximately 40 miles of range and then zoomed back towards the station 
to approximately 10 miles of distance and then stopped again so these things are moving all over 
the place and stopping the objects then proceeded on a 320 degree heading beyond the range of the 
radar so authorities dispatched two f-89 jet fighters from Oxnard just to pursue these UFOs 
and at 12 minutes past the beginning of the setting at around 1207 am the radar station 
mysteriously lost its high voltage and went off so I don't know if there's a connection 
there but it is what it is and what's important here is those objects were captured on radar 
and this was just the beginning because it's the same day this is at 12 10 p.m right after this 
other sighting ended it began up again and this is at Point Magoo which is pretty much the same 
area and a circular object described as having 16 equal sides about the size of a silver dollar in a 
in appearance and whitish in color was actually observed by Witnesses and did appear on film 
The Observer who saw this was actually watching missiles and there were other aircraft in the area 
now this film belongs to the Navy and they refused to release it because it they said 
it contains classified information this film was being taken in conjunction with missile testing 
the main witness was Raymond Wilson and they were doing tests with the regulus missile 
now there is documentation of this and the SSM n8a regulus was a ship and it had a submarine launched 
nuclear arm turbojet powered cruise missile deployed by the U.S Navy from 1955 to 1964. 
so uh it had a very interesting appearance and when this missile was ready for launch 
it was fitted with two large booster rockets at the AFT end of the fuselage 
so there's something clearly going on here I think with this UFO investigating what's 
going on with these missiles at any rate it was the next day when there was a bunch of sightings 
in fact on March 23 1957 the very next day thousands of witnesses over Long Beach cited four 
large solid round objects flashing brilliant red lights and some of these are really good Witnesses 
three Ventura County Deputy sheriffs and these objects were also tracked on radar and it was 
at midnight that Air Force personnelis actually made visual contact and when they did they sent 
out an f-86 spider in Pursuit at which point the objects quickly climbed upwards and moved away 
but the tower operator said that this object was quote moving much faster than anything I'd ever 
seen about 40 miles away it came to an abrupt stop and reversed course all within about a period of 
three seconds so again something that our aircraft cannot do and according to the radar returns these 
objects were moving at a distance of 30 miles in about 30 seconds or a speed of 3600 miles per hour 
the Air Force did quickly clamp down on the case and cover it up and major Donald Kehoe 
pioneering UFO researcher at that time was unable to receive any further confirmation 
but that was not the end of that sighting same exact day 11 26 pm a round red colored object 
with the apparent size of a grapefruit held at arm's lengths was cited by ground Observer 
Personnel on duty this object was at an estimated four thousand five thousand feet altitude and 
was heading west until it disappeared and the ground Observer Corps Personnel were not the only 
Witnesses many other people saw the object and called the police and the Pasadena filter Center 
but among the ground Observer Corps Witnesses was Air Force Sergeant Dewey Crow and he viewed this 
object through binoculars and they observed it for at least 14 minutes so long enough to realize 
that this was absolutely unusual it was that same year just a few months later in the summer of 1957 
that another Navy personnel uh became a witness to UFO activity in this same area 
I give him the pseudonym Austin Roberts that's not his real name he's anonymous but he had joined the 
Navy three years earlier and after completing boot camp he became a radar specialist and in 
1957 the year of the sighting he was assigned to training Duty aboard the USS Columbus 
at the time of this incident they had just departed from Long Beach and were off the coast of Catalina Island Catalina is the center of all this activity and as Austin says in his own words 
it must have been about 7 or 8 PM just after dark when a hard contact blip showed up on my screen it 
did not drift on the scope such as hard contacts do if you are passing or overtaking another ship 
it just popped up on the screen so he reported the contact bearing while other officers confirmed the 
blip on the other radar Scopes so this is clearly not a defect this blip was about 20 miles from the 
USS Columbus which put it Beyond the Horizon line and out of sight those still appearing on radar 
suddenly a second blip appeared followed by three more they all came together in a V format 
v formation so this sudden appearance without any visible approach on radar meant that these objects 
might very well be submarines and as the witness says certainly Subs surfacing could account for 
this however there's a problem as the witness explains and I quote five Subs in v formation 
would be very unusual so at this point while he and the other Witnesses were reading only the 
surface radar which showed the distance of the object but not their altitude officers in the 
air radar stations also observe these objects on radar and actually reported that they were 
hovering in a fixed position at an altitude of 5 000 feet and these objects remain in place for 
about 10 to 15 minutes and then began to disappear from the radar Scopes one at a time and were gone 
and as the witness says needless to say that event was the talk of the ship for a while 
All The Radars were checked and found to be operating normally and talking to some 
of the old salts I found out that they had similar experiences before on other ships 
so I think the point of this case is is that these sort of events happen regularly and the 
ones we hear about are just the tip of the iceberg we don't hear about most of them there's something 
going on in this area I'm telling you year after year decade after decade there's activity going 
on here and here's another case from a civilian witness which occurred in 2004 as Richard as I 
call them that is a pseudonym he was driving south on the Pacific Coast Highway towards Torrance 
and right after turning Inland he saw quote three lights moving out towards the West in the open 
ocean he says they were at a very low altitude but we're moving in a strange tumbling maneuver 
and they were actually coming towards him and soon they were only 400 feet above his car 
and he could now get a good look at him and saw that they were two black teardrop shaped craft 
and each one had one extremely bright light on the very tip and as he says in his own words it did 
not make any sense that these vehicles would be right there on the PCH the Pacific Coast Highway 
they were now interweaving with each other and boom they took off almost instantly this 
was so off the wall I could not explain it and they thought this would be a once in a lifetime 
event but it wasn't it wasn't long after the study got a Repeat Performance just a few months later 
he had another UFO encounter only this time he wasn't alone he was with his entire family 
and I will just quote him directly as he says we were coming home after a fishing trip to Catalina 
Island on the back side of the island it was getting dark so we decided to head home we were on 
a 22 foot center console fishing boat as we turned to the east side of the island and started heading 
towards Angel's Gate in La Harbor I looked to the west and noticed a circular craft in the air at 
approximately five thousand feet to the north side of the island so this is facing the mainland and 
as he says it had extremely bright lights around and on top of it so he and his family were very 
much perplexed by the side of this object and as it began to move Eastward along the front side 
of the island he called out shui's brother and to the captain piloting about saying hey look at that 
and he says the captain looked up and said that looks like a UFO and his brother looked at it 
and says I kept watching The Craft and before I knew it the craft shot straight up into the 
sky extremely fast and then disappeared so they were absolutely convinced they had seen UFOs and 
one of the witness later reported his sighting to new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center 
so many cases here's another that occurred one year later off the coast of Newport Beach 
this is a very popular fishing site in fact there's a lot of people who do who do shark 
fishing off Newport Beach and that's what the Witnesses were doing here this was on August 8 
2005 and a group of eight shark fishermen had a very close-up sighting of a UFO that was 
quite memorable was about 1 30 a.m and they were 12 miles off the coast of Newport Beach 
which is pretty much directly in the heart of the Santa Catalina Channel suddenly one of the 
men called everyone's attention to a bright light hovering get this about 100 feet above the water 
they estimated it was about four miles away it was just a bright light they couldn't see any kind of 
structure it was Southwest of them in an area of open water and was hovering in perfect silence 
and as the witness says in his own words then we noticed it started to get closer and bigger 
and some friends were getting a little freaked out but I felt only positive from it it's strange 
for me to explain but this is what I felt I knew we had nothing to be worried about 
so that doesn't surprise me sometimes people do get telepathic Impressions or messages but he felt 
this was a friendly object and that there was no reason to be afraid and as he watched as they all 
watched this object suddenly stopped hovered for about 10 minutes then reversed direction 
and moved off and Faded Away and he reported this sighting to newfork again and according 
to Peter Davenport the head of new Fork Peter Davenport says he sounded quite credible to us 
a lot of sightings off of Newport Beach there's another that occurred one year later approximately 
on December 2nd 2006. this is a very interesting sighting with some unique elements a large group 
of people had rented a beach house on Newport Beach as part of a pre-wedding celebration 
and it was around 10 pm that evening when eight members of the party were hanging 
out on the beach and suddenly this Eerie silence descended over the group followed by a dark shadow 
and everyone stopped talking and what they were doing and looked at each other in confusion trying 
to figure out what was going on and as one of the witnesses says in his own words and I quote 
it's difficult to explain but we all felt something was odd and stopped our conversations 
and tried to figure out what was different on the beach we all saw a huge object hover low above us 
it was just above the low-lying scattered clouds it was like an enormously big shadow 
that hovered from east to west over the ocean while it floated above us you could 
hear the silence it was too quiet it was like the noise of Life stopped we all knew this was 
real as we saw the shadow of this object on the water he estimates that it was about 500 
feet wide and even though he had seen UFOs a few times before this one really impressed him 
I think it's an interesting sighting because of this Eerie silence they're talking about all 
Life Sounds stopping this is what UFO researchers sometimes call the Oz Factor but it's interesting 
because this is often reported and it's as if the wildlife around not only senses the object but the 
silence becomes something that's really pronounced so there's something going on with the environment here it's an interesting case and here's another in this same general 
area this one is really unusual this is a definite Uso over uh in the Laguna Beach area 
this occurred in June of 1963 the main witness is anonymous I'll call him mark 
he was the best man for a wedding being held along the coast in southern Laguna Beach and he 
had just finished his current duties and decided to take a little nighttime walk along the beach 
now in this area there was a large wooden staircase that leads down the cliffs to the sand 
so he climbed down and found himself hidden from the traffic of the pretty busy Pacific Coast 
Highway you could still hear the cars kind of roaring faintly above him at the top of the cliffs 
but looking out into the water he saw something amazing as he says and I quote 
I saw a series of Lights glowing from behind the waves about five feet apart and eight 
inches in diameter they gave the appearance of being portholes on the side of a submersible 
so he was shocked by this site and for a second wondered if it could be a military submarine but it was far far too close to shore so he called it a quote unidentified submerged object 
what was it he doesn't know as he says I have no explanation there is an interesting endnote to 
this case later he heard a lifeguard from the same area being interviewed and the lifeguard was asked if he had ever seen anything strange in the surf and mark the witness was described 
to hear the life card say the same thing and he said he had no idea what it could be 
so yeah it's doubtful this was a submarine they don't come right offshore like that 
and it's one of many many cases and here's another case which occurred in 1972 
this is off the Pacific Palisades area this is sort of the Topanga Beach Malibu Santa Monica area 
and I like this case because it has something very interesting about it the main witness his name is Robert Snyder and one evening in 1972 they don't know the 
exact date he was staying in the home of his friend Jim lecron and lacron's family 
and their home is located on the hills of Pacific Palisades on Anoka Drive 
it has a large picture window which overlooks the Malibu and Santa Monica coastline 
it was that evening a Jim's mother noticed some unusually bright and colorful lights traveling 
down the Malibu Coastline heading towards them and as Robert Snyder says in his own words 
there was a telescope that sat by the large family room window and a pair 
of binoculars all of us took turns trading off between the telescope and the binoculars 
and what I saw was multi-colored white blue red yellow green constant Bright Lights randomly 
flickering around the sides of a thick disc shape so he estimates this object was about 200 feet 
high off the water line there and about 500 to 800 yards from the shore of Topanga Canyon Beach 
near a very well-known restaurant called The Chart House as you can see pictured here 
and as Robert Snyder says in his own words from our view we were looking down on the 
UFO at an angle it hovered there silently for a few minutes then abruptly went into the water and 
even with the naked eye you could see the greenish Illuminating glow from the craft being under the 
water it stayed there under the water for a few minutes not moving at all and when I looked at it 
through the telescope I could see the pattern of the Waves going over the lighted seawater 
so they knew this was very unusual at this point and lecron's mother became a little bit panicky 
and wanted to call the police or the Air Force but meanwhile Robert Snyder continued to view 
this object and it appeared to be turning or elongating and increasing in size he says 
so he started looking through this object not with the telescope which was being used by his 
friend but with his naked eyes and as he says in a split second it shot off at incredible 
speed from a standstill it just streaked toward Catalina Island now mind you this is underwater 
and it's moving at extremely high speed and at the time he tried to rationalize the setting as some 
type of secret military craft but he's changed his mind after reviewing it and as he says it 
was not military it came in slow it hovered it went underwater and shot away very very fast 
since then I have flown helicopters in fixed-wing aircraft and to this day there isn't anything that 
could even remotely function like that I know what we experienced was probably the most incredible 
thing I will ever see in my lifetime and I remember it vividly a really interesting case 
now I want to cover a few more cases off the point off of off of Point Magoo where 
there's so much activity and I like this case that is so unusual this case occurred 
in June of 1980 when two civilian Witnesses were camping at Point Magoo 
and I'll just quote the witness directly because he describes it quite vividly as he says 
we were walking along the beach and had stopped to watch what we thought were buoys bouncing on 
the tide there were lights on top which we did not find unusual as this is the case with many buoys 
they are frequently placed at a distance close enough for swimmers and far out enough for boaters 
and I was soothed by the motion of the lights after a few minutes I couldn't say exactly how 
many the lights lifted and hovered they stayed in that hovering position for about 30 or 40 seconds 
then flew off they took off to the left of us and were out of sight before I could even blink an eye 
I had never and Have Not To This Day seen anything that fast in my life so yeah they first thought 
they were buoys then we're shocked to see these things lift up hover and then Dart very quickly 
away so clearly not buoys but just to confirm the next day they did return to this spot to check 
and they did find buoys easily and saw that none of them had lights on them and that what they had 
seen was completely different as the witness says I had my doubts about UFOs at the time but they 
were quickly removed with that sighting I have never had another sighting but I would like to 
very interesting case and here's another one in the same area which actually caused some pretty 
big waves among the officials in the military who tried to cover this case up and debunk 
it unsuccessfully I think this again occurred off of Point Magoo it was on December 16 1953 
which again was a very busy year the main witness I love this his name is Clarence Kelly Johnson 
and he's one of the designers of the U2 aircraft a very smart guy a great witness very familiar 
with aircraft and he was actually at Point Magoo looking through a window at a beautiful sunset 
when he recognized a dark elliptical form in the sky in the direction of the point magu cape 
now at first he thought this might have been a lenticular cloud or maybe a smoke trail from a plane however it stayed fixed in the sky unmoving for several minutes 
so he called his wife over and asked her to bring him his eight power binoculars 
what she did he ran outside and when he got outside this object began to move 
speeding up in the direction away from him in an ascending path contrary to the movement of 
the clouds on the horizon so it's moving Against the Wind and at this point he could see that this 
object was pretty large he estimates about 200 feet long and it was shifting around he had no way 
to determine its precise Dimensions its distance or velocity it being an unknown object in the sky 
but simultaneously a Lockheed wv2 aircraft was being flown by one of his test Crews over Long 
Beach California now the wv2 is a massive four engine transport plane and it was loaded with 
equipment radar antennas and such constructed to fly long-standing patrols far off the coast of the 
Coastline there basically to deliver long-range recognition of incoming Soviet aircraft at any 
rate important here is the crew spotted the object at about the same time he did at about 15 000 feet 
altitude and they were able to get a closer look and actually proceeded towards this object which 
then took off at a great speed so he reported this officially and said and I quote I am now more 
convinced than ever that such devices exist and I have some highly technical converts in this belief 
now when the Air Force took a look into the this case they concluded remarkably that he 
and his wife and also the airplane team saw a quote lenticular cloud 
this is a ridiculous debunking explanation and I mean this guy is an aircraft designer 
he knows aircraft this was not a lenticular cloud despite what the Air Force says 
it's really unfortunate that they continue to cover up the subject when it's so obviously real 
here's another case mid-1980s which comes from someone who's quite well known Xander Smith he 
worked in La for 14 years as an art director and a prop master in the film industry and he had a 
very interesting sighting as he writes one night driving along the coast heading north in Malibu 
on the PCH Pacific Coast Highway I saw what I thought were barges with what looked like 10K 
studio lights stretched out for about a third to a half mile about 400 feet offshore on the other 
side of the beach houses I figured it was a big money production filming a night beach scene being 
someone involved in film that was his immediate go-to but he soon found out he was wrong because 
as he says and I quote the next day there was a big deal about some mysterious lights out at Sea 
off the coast right where I was the big deal was there was no filming going on or any other event 
and he learned that more than 100 people observed these lights either while driving along the coast highway or from their homes which overlooked the area and he also noticed 
that these lights were adjacent to the area where the continental shelf drops off to deep water 
the Santa Catalina channel is quite deep it's got an average depth of about 2500 to 3 
000 feet but parts of it are a mile deep about five thousand feet 
and so much activity in this area here's a series of cases which were investigated by 
Southern california-based researcher Bill Hamilton he's uncovered quite a few cases in this area 
and starting in late 1989 he interviewed several people in the Marina Del Rey area who are having 
repeated encounters with quote strange blue green lights in the water so this is really 
interesting because while there are many cases of fleets of UFOs this is one of the fleet view 
cases involving a fleet of Usos large numbers of objects underwater and as Bill Hamilton writes in 
1989 and again in 1990 Witnesses have seen as many as 20 events in an hour one large light appeared 
to be as much as 100 feet in diameter and this large light spawned babies no larger than 10 to 
12 feet in length these lights were seen to move swiftly under the ocean's surface some 500 to 1000 
feet from the coastline to Abalone Cove one of the lights was reported to have emerged from the water 
this is really interesting because you don't get a whole lot of cases of mother ships letting 
out little baby craft under the water that's absolutely what's happening here and this went 
on for years it was in 1994 that he received another case involving two witnesses who were 
walking along the coast of Rancho Palos Verdes at Abalone Cove this is in 1994 it's at night 
and they saw what they described as several quote glowing discs floating in the water 
and one of the witnesses returned shortly later some days later and saw the discs again 
but on this occasion he also saw several black helicopters in the area and he says that shortly 
later he was actually confronted by individuals who refused to name themselves but were clearly 
government agents of some kind and told him in no uncertain terms that this area was off limits 
so it's clear that our government or elements within our government do know about the 
activity in this area I just got a couple more cases I want to present to you today 
here's one from a gentleman by the name of Jason Brooks who contacted me directly after hearing about my research in this area and I'll just quote what he wrote to me as he says 
my name is Jason Brooks and I find the research you have done to be very interesting and I wanted 
to share with you a Uso UFO sighting eyewitnessed when I lived in Dana Point 
Dana Point lies along the coast at the far southern end of the Santa Catalina Channel 
and being a coastal resident Jason has spent a lot of time on various Southern California 
beaches and it was in 1996 while walking along with his girlfriend along salt beach in Dana Point 
that he saw something very unusual and as he says and I quote all three of us saw it I saw 
it first we were just sitting watching the waves and I noticed a light on the water to the south 
towards Camp Pendleton I didn't pay much attention to it as it was just sitting there I figured it 
was a boat that was until it shot straight up into the air and began doing Maneuvers that are simply 
Impossible by any known craft that I know of was doing impossibly tight loops and going from ocean 
level to maybe even thousands of feet in the air in seconds so this object this light was moving 
in tight darting motions and kind of reminded him of a laser pointer and as Jason says it continued 
doing this for about 30 minutes and then faded away slowly until I couldn't see it anymore like 
I said all three of us saw it I went back out the next night to see if it had returned and it was 
there again doing the same type of movements and after having this series of sightings and 
unable to explain it he decided to report what he saw I'm glad he did because most people don't 
and here's another Super interesting case because I think this one involves direct contact in a 
very unusual way this is the last case I want to present to you and this occurred over the Santa 
Catalina channel in the Rolling Hills area and I will just quote the witness directly this is the 
daughter of a gentleman who worked for the Navy and she and apparently he were having contact 
and as the lady the witness says all my sightings occurred at night and predominantly over the 
Catalina Channel which was the main view from our house and she says that throughout the late 
1960s she saw numerous UFOs over the channel she says almost all of the sighted objects appeared 
to pulsate primarily white light with beautiful laser-like oscillating red and green these objects 
would consistently move with almost instantaneous speed then at times maneuver in all directions 
so despite having red and green lights clearly not a plane in fact the movement reminded the witness 
of darting bacteria or protozoa she says it was very erratic yet very graceful at the same time 
and she feels like there was definitely an intelligence behind their movement because as she says on numerous occasions there were several UFOs in the linear formations with some objects 
blinking out while others suddenly appeared and From Within These formations much fainter and 
smaller objects perhaps Scouts would come out of the formation and re-enter it sometime later 
so these were mostly from a pretty good distance however she says on at least one 
occasion occasion she had a very close encounter she was driving home and was about a mile away 
from her home in Rolling Hills when she saw a distant light over the channel and in a matter 
of seconds the object was quote very rapidly overhead I was hovering right above her car 
and this is where it gets even stranger the witness says her body hair instantly began 
to stand on end and at the same time the entire electrical system in her car went haywire with 
the radio the horn and the car lights all going on and off and while this was all happening she also 
heard a low whooshing sound coming from the object so I think it's clearly doing this on purpose 
and after hovering over her car the object darted away and get this hovered directly over her house 
and it remained there for a few minutes and then resumed a position much higher up and further away and moved erratically for a few seconds and then as she says accelerated 
completely out of view at lightning speed on a diagonal tangent to the southeast 
so she went home she told about this experience to her parents and her mother was very interested 
because she said she had heard this same weird whooshing sound on multiple occasions 
but her father was skeptical now as I mentioned her father was in the Navy he was a theoretical 
physicist responsible for Designing ultra low frequency antenna for U.S Navy submarine contracts 
at the time of this close-up sighting she slept in the den where her father worked on his theories 
and one evening shortly after this encounter she woke up this is so weird to see her father 
come into the room in an apparent sleep walk and he began to quote write down equations on 
the large Blackboard on which there were very intense high order calculus equations related 
to his ongoing work now the next morning when her father woke up and saw the Blackboard he was not 
happy he did not remember writing this and as the witness says later that morning on his awakened 
discovery of the additions to the equation he was very irritated and demanded an explanation 
he was completely unaware of his contribution while in the trance-like state being a staunch 
non-believer in anything that would not pass his scientific criteria he certainly would 
never entertain any suggestion of any outside interventive assistance as a viable explanation 
so that's quite unusual but it certainly wouldn't be the first time a UFO contactee 
has produced Advanced equations or became very interested in mathematics and physics and quantum 
physics and all this stuff so the witness herself does feel like these were positive encounters and 
that his her dad was being contacted though he doesn't think so she saw him do this 
and as she says these sightings continued to occur over several years until we eventually moved I was 
always filled with a sense of friendship and Beauty from these objects and never felt any 
fear or threats I felt somehow almost a spiritual connection I think that's a very interesting case 
and I really wanted to include it because of this weird aspect to it those are the cases I 
wanted to present to you today and I think you'll agree yeah there's a lot of different types of 
cases there some really unusual ones some ones that provide fantastic evidence of UFO reality 
it always kind of makes me chuckle when people say there's no evidence for UFOs because there 
really is it's not hard to find these cases alone provide excellent evidence of the reality of UFOs 
that was the primary reason why I wanted to do this video for you today that because this area 
there's something really unusual about it I did Cover these cases in my book undersea UFO base 
so if you want to explore more about these cases and many others I would recommend checking that 
book out but yeah I love this area it's one of the major hot spots I think mile for mile the 
Santa Catalina San Pedro Channel produces more UFO reports than just about any other area on Earth 
more Uso reports I should say uh perhaps not the most but it's definitely in the top 10 for sure so 
that's the show today I hope you've enjoyed it I really appreciate you watching and until next time 
keep searching for the truth keep asking questions and most important keep having fun bye now.
