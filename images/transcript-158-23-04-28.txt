UFO LANDINGS & HUMANOIDS: SEVEN SPECTACULAR CASES
Apr 28, 2023

Summary:
Apr 28, 2023
Among the most spectacular of all UFO encounters are cases of landings and humanoids. These cases are not nearly as common as sightings, and yet they have been occurring all over the world for many decades. Encounters like these are very important because they are so close that any explanations of misperceptions or hallucinations become completely untenable. These cases also remove any doubt that UFOs are in fact craft occupied by living beings. These are the kinds of cases that answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon, such as what are they, where do they come from and why are they here?

This video presents seven dramatic cases, one from each decade, starting in the 1950s and moving forward to the 2010s. Each case involves a landed craft and humanoid figure. These cases also provide considerable physical evidence in the form of landing traces, physiological effects and even photographs.

Aug 25, 1952: Musician William Squyres of Frontenac, KS was driving to work early in the morning when he saw a metallic craft with portholes hovering alongside the road. To his amazement, he could see a humanoid figure in the front of the craft. When he shut his car door to get a closer look, the craft zoomed upward and was gone. He called the police and they returned to the site where they found landing traces. Project Blue Book came to investigate. They were unable to explain what he saw and officially declared the case UNIDENTIFIED.

Jul 21, 1967: Ronnie Hill (age 14) was in his backyard in Oriental, NC when a strange odor filled the air and the animals became deathly quiet. Looking up, he saw a UFO. Moments later, a smaller 9-foot white sphere began darting around. Ronnie dashed inside and retrieved his camera. Coming back outside, he saw that the sphere had landed. Then, to his shock, a small humanoid figure stepped out from behind the craft. Ronnie quickly snapped a photograph.

Jan 27, 1978: It was nighttime when four teenagers trespassed onto a farmer’s property in Frodsham, England to go pheasant hunting. As they hid in the undergrowth, they were baffled by the appearance of a metallic craft floating just above the nearby River Weaver. Without warning, the craft moved toward them and landed in a field a short distance away. A herd of cows became immobilized. The boys watched in fear as two humanoids exited the craft and walked up to one of the cows, placing a weird cage-like device around it. Fearing that they were next, the boys fled. Each experienced a strange and unusual physiological reaction as they ran away.

Mar 22, 1982, Donald Shallcross had just returned to his home in Slanesville, WV in the wee hours of the morning when his pets started acting up. Venturing outside, he saw what he thought was a plane about to crash in the fields near his house. Informing his family, he went to go help. Instead of a plane, however, he came upon a landed UFO and was confronted by a strange helmeted humanoid. The figure said he was a watchguard and had some important messages for all humanity.

Mar 6, 1996: Lloyd Karambakuwa (age 17) was woken up in his home in Chipadze, South Africa by a loud clicking noise. Going outside to investigate, he was frightened to see a short glowing figure with a strange uniform and odd-shaped head moving quickly around the property across the street. Realizing it wasn’t human, he ran back inside. Unknown to him, a nearby security guard was also drawn outside by the same weird noise, and also saw the figure. The next morning, Lloyd found very strange footprints at the site.

Mar 2001: After a day of fishing on the River Tocantins in Brazil, Vinicius DaSilva and Marta Rosenthal were driving home when they thought they had a flat tire. Strangely, nothing was wrong. But then Marta pointed to the right over the river where a large craft was hovering just above the river’s surface. A humanoid stood on a ledge and a hose-like device extended down into the water. It appeared to be sucking water up into the craft.

2011: World-famous archaeologist Klaus Honninger, his wife and several others were conducting a dig in the Ocucaje desert in Ica, Peru when a large UFO rose up from behind a hill and began to emit smaller orb-like spheres. After a few moments, the orbs returned into the craft which disappeared behind a hill. It apparently landed, because minutes later, Klaus was confronted by two tall humanoids with elongated skulls. They told Klaus to have no fear, that they had been on Earth long before humans were here, and they had an important message to share. Afterward, Klaus was able to actually photograph the object as it moved away.

Each of these cases provides a fascinating glimpse into the UFO phenomenon, providing both evidence of ET reality, and also warnings from the ETs themselves about how we are treating each other and our planet. With many thousands of cases like these, it’s clear that we are not alone.

Introduction
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal I call this episode UFO Landings and humanoids seven spectacular cases pretty
excited about this episode today each one of these cases involves a UFO landing and
humanoids these cases reach back all the way to the 50s up to the 2010s in fact I've included
one case from each decade one from the 1950s 1960s 70s 80s 90s the 2000s and the 2010s
it's one of the reasons I wanted to do this episode today because this will show that
this is an ongoing phenomenon one that's been going on for a very long time and is still
going on and I think it also shows that this phenomena is absolutely Global worldwide the
cases I'm going to present today come from all over the world and another reason I wanted to do this video is because many of these cases involve messages from the ETS interactions
conversations that people had with the extraterrestrials and it shows their agenda on our planet why
they're here what they have to say so these cases are pretty exciting some of them are
quite unusual I wanted to choose cases that I think have something unique or significant
to contribute to our understanding of this phenomenon so let's just get started the first
Frontenac Kansas
case occurred on August 25 1952 at 5 35 A.M this case occurred in Frontenac Kansas and
the main witness is William Squires he worked at a radio station as a musician and singer
and he was driving along Yale Road this is about a quarter mile from U.S Highway 160
and he was on his way to work and looking off to the side of the road William was amazed
to see a smooth but sort of weathered looking metallic cigar shaped craft hovering pretty
close about 750 feet away he estimates it was about 70 feet long 40 feet wide and he
could see it was unusual so he stopped his car and approached he's at this point he was
about 300 feet away and he could now see that this object did in fact have a row of large
portholes going along the edge and this is where it got really interesting because looking
inside he was amazed to see this pulsating blue light and at the very front the silhouette
of a man did not appear to be moving but in the midsection through the portholes you could
see all kinds of movement but it couldn't quite make out what was going on now this
craft was very low it was rocking sort of up and down is about 10 feet above the ground
and he was close enough that he could hear a low throbbing sound and here's where it
gets even stranger you could see what appeared to be small propellers on either end of The
Craft so he watched this for about one minute and one point he slammed his car door shut
and at this point the object suddenly increased in Pitch it made a louder noise in fact William
said sounded quote like a Covey of a hundred Quail taking off the craft then Rose vertically
and went up into the clouds so he went to his place of employment told everyone what
happened they believed him he's got a good reputation the police were called they went
back to the area that day and this is when they did in fact find what appeared to be
a 60 foot wide circle of crushed vegetation and this case did get a lot of attention and
in fact Project Blue Book headed by the Air Force sent officers to investigate the case
and as you can see here they had a big file on it and everyone that they talked to vouched
for William Squire's honesty and integrity Project Blue Book officers were unable to
explain the case and actually declared it unknown to one of very few cases involving
humanoids that they declared unidentified so he was apparently interviewed at length
by Air Force officers and as William Squires says in his own words they're not about to
make me retract this information I'm not going to let them give me shots or anything else
to make me say I didn't see it so this is an interesting case for a number of reasons
there's a humanoid involved there's Landing traces the Air Force showed a strong interest
in this case and what I'd like to do is play a little segment of audio tape where William
Squires describes his experience in his own words this is about three minutes long it's
pretty short but I think you'll find it interesting last Monday morning Bill Squires an employee
Pittsburgh Kansas
of radio station koam in Pittsburgh Kansas reported a very strange experience to authorities
today I spoke with him about a long distance telephone here is the story as he told it
to me
[Music] [Music]
ahead for me of
[Music] Above This Grass Queen to the bottom of the track not immediately because when I first
saw it I was north of its driver side of course and I looked through my right windshield and
saw it science [Music] [Music]
[Music] we now move to the 1960s in the case I chose for the 1960s occurred on July 21st 1967 to
Oriental NC
a teenager by the name of Ronnie Hill this is a pretty controversial case but so interesting
because it involves a photograph of an apparent humanoid Ronnie was in the backyard of his
parents home this is an Oriental North Carolina a tiny little town along the coast and he
says he was working in the garden when this happened this is around uh one o'clock in
the afternoon and Ronnie says in his own words I noticed a strange odor in the air which
smelled like gas which caused my eyes to water at the same time that he smelled this strange
odor he says all the animal sounds suddenly stopped and an eerie silence settled over
the area so he's looking around but doesn't see anything unusual so just kept working
but then something did happen as Ronnie says and I quote after about 15 minutes I heard
a buzzing sound and the increasing smell of gas when I turned my head I saw a strange
thing in the sky it looked like a black hat then my eyes caught a glimpse of something
moving it was a white ball about nine feet in diameter started to fly by itself I fell
to the ground all sorts of things dashing through my mind so as he watched this thing
was moving around and he realized this was apparently a UFO he could hardly believe it
but he did have a Kodak camera in his house so he ran inside grabbed the camera got out
and by the time he got outside this white sphere that he had seen darting around had actually landed he says on the ground and he's looking at it and as he says about five
seconds later I heard a loud noise which hurt my ears I was breathless because a little
man about three and a half to four feet tall came from behind the ball-shaped object carrying
with him a funnel-shaped black object in his right hand now Ronnie quickly took a picture
which you can see here and he said this figure wore a skin tight silvery metallic suit with
a blue belt around its waist it had a metallic helmet and he says he could see its face which
seemed to be sort of a brownish or bluish green in color he said it had tilted or slanted
eyes and as he watched this figure it seemed to walk in a way that he described it slowly
and wobbly on stiff legs it placed this black funnel which you can see in its right hand
briefly on the ground pulled it back up and then quickly returned into this sphere seconds
later the object made a loud noise a Blue Light Came from Beneath this object which
rose up this point a bigger ship reappeared the black object that he originally saw and
this smaller sphere went inside the bigger one so he ran inside told his parents what
happened they believed him he's got a good reputation and they developed the photo and
this is when they saw that he had in fact captured an image of this apparent E.T now
Ronnie's case was investigated by John Keel who was quite impressed he sent the photograph
to photographic analysts and they found no apparent evidence of hoaxing and they started
interviewing everybody and Ronnie's family his teachers and the adult leader of his local
4-H club all vouched for his honesty and they even signed affidavit attesting to this now
Ronnie was apparently a pretty good witness he himself was the president of his eighth grade class the president of his local 4-H club and the assistant patrol leader in the
Boy Scouts so this was very interesting he didn't receive any money for this photo so
apparently there was no reason for him to financially gain from this the family really
wanted privacy they did not want their location known however this case is not without some
dissenters later the group IQ fan run by Coleman Von kavitsky who himself has some detractors
he said that their analysis showed that this object wasn't nine feet tall that was probably
a smaller object they believed it was an egg and that the alien figure was actually a doll
wrapped in tin foil they did not really give any reasons why they came to this conclusion
over another analysis by a photographic expert Andre Duarte said that the height ratios described
by the witness don't match what is showing in the photo so yeah there are some who believe
this is a hoax uh and others do not it is a controversial case apparently the main witness
in the family have never retracted though they faded from the Limelight so you can make
of it what you will it's an interesting case either way now the case I chose for the 1970s
The Devils Garden
comes from British researchers Jenny Randalls and Paul wetna they've written a number of
books together this occurred on a cold night in January January 27 1978 and the main Witnesses
are four teenagers aged 17 to 19. they've insisted upon anonymity in this incident occurred when they decided to trespass onto
a farmer's property east of the small town of frodsham England they were going hunting
for pheasants in the chosen area alongside the river Weaver popularly known as the devil's
Garden pictured here and they were waiting in the bushes for pheasants to appear when
they saw a metallic sphere with flashing lights small squarish portholes and a round sort
of skirt or pan-shaped structure on the bottom section traveling just above the river's surface
maybe about 20 feet high and they first thought it might be some sort of satellite even though
this is very low and going right above the water there it was about 10 feet in diameter
they think and they said it was making a soft humming and whooshing noise as it left the
river and started moving towards them quite close they could see Flames coming out from
the bottom as it landed in a field just a short distance away now they could see this
violet light coming from the windows they said it was painful to look at it hurt their eyes and when this object landed there were some cows grazing nearby and they all became
completely Frozen setting absolutely still I couldn't say if this was just out of fear
if it was some effect from the object so this alarmed them and they became even more frightened
and amazed when a figure came out from behind the craft and this was a normal looking humanoid
they couldn't really tell what it looked like because he was dressed in a one-piece silver
suit they could see a headlight on the helmet emitting the same type of painful violet light
that was coming from the portholes of The Craft so it's dark it's hard for them to make out everything but they watched this figure walk around the area of the craft it appeared
to be surveying the scene making sure everything was safe it then re-entered into it and moments
later two figures came out and they were carrying something quite strange it looked the witnesses
says like a rectangular shaped metallic cage it was apparently not very heavy judging by
the way they were easily able to maneuver it and lift it and they walked over to one
of the cows which still stayed completely still it sort of adjusted this cage over the
cow and it looked almost as if they were measuring this Kyle they weren't quite sure what was
happening here however as one of the witness says we ran down to the bridge but two men
with funny lights on their caps came out and I got scared they had a cow in a cage and
were doing something to it I ran down to Ellis Lane another witness says regarding the contraption
it was a frame of aluminum or silvery metal and there were bars around the cow they were
measuring the height and length so yeah this kind of freaked them out and fearing that
they might be next they fled the scene and this is when they noticed a very strange effect
some of the witnesses when being interviewed were kind of reticent to talk about it one
said that they had a funny feeling pulling on them another said it was a strange tingling
but one boy was very graphic and he basically said he felt a strange tugging sensation on
his privates as they left the area and that afterwards his legs were red and sore as if
sun burned for a few days after the incident so yeah these are physiological effects and
quite unusual and yeah it's a strange case they ran over the bridge back into the town
of frodsham and left the area they were interviewed but they declined to be interviewed further
did not want to talk about it researchers Jenny Randalls and Paul wetna had some trouble
getting this case investigated and published they said that there are notes on the case
were mysteriously waylaid twice once they were sent through the postal service and apparently
became lost and several months later the envelope came back apparently opened and resealed so
they did a write-up on this case and sent it to the Flying Saucer Journal published in England and they said they never received it so they had to send it again and this case
was eventually published now there were apparently no other Witnesses who saw this but there
were in fact several other reports of UFOs in that month in nearby areas there was a
little bit of a wave going on apparently no one returned the actual site to check for
landing traces or missing cows and as the witnesses insisted upon anonymity and refused
requests for further interviews there's no more information on this case and now we moved
to the 1980s this is probably my favorite case of all of these that I'm presenting today
The Pilot
and this next case occurred near the town of Romney in West Virginia more specifically
in slainesville was March 22nd 1982 it was around 4 A.M and the main witness Donald shalcross
had been working the late shift at County Emergency Medical Services Donald is also
a former park ranger now he had just gone inside his house when his dogs and cats were
acting up and he thought maybe there was an animal or something in the yard so he went
outside and as he says I saw this purple light moving across the field I thought a plane
had crashed so I yelled at my wife and daughter to call the police and drove out to there
to see what had happened he hopped in his car and drove just a short distance towards
this light down this dirt road and his car engine conked out he didn't think much of
that he quickly grabbed a flashlight and went hiking into this field towards this light
at this point all they could see was a glowing light but he realized at this point probably
wasn't a plane he wasn't sure he didn't get a good look at it at first because his flashlight
was pointing down onto the ground so he could make his way through this field and right
in front of him he saw something very strange and as Donald says in his own words I saw
a pair of feet my light jerked up and there was a person standing there now he thought
at first that this might be the pilot who had crawled from the wreckage of this plane crash but he instantly changed his mind because this was no normal pilot as Donald says in
his own words suddenly a numb feeling overcame my body I realized this was no ordinary pilot
he was five feet three or four inches tall slender and wearing a silvery suit it covered
him all over boots gloves everything his head looked pretty normal except I couldn't see
any ears and his eyes and nose were covered by a visor like on a motorcycle helmet he
held a rod about the length of a baseball bat you can see a drawing here which Donald
did in fact approve as being accurate so he was beginning to wonder at this point who
this man was and what was going on and he asked out loud verbally are you okay the figure
didn't respond he acts again no response and man at this point this figure started talking
to him not out loud but telepathically and started answering Donald's questions as quickly
as he thought him as Donald says I saw things in my mind the words and images were just
there was not normal talking whatever he said came directly into my mind as if he were able
to convey his thoughts to me through mental telepathy and this is when a very interesting
conversation ensued Donald asked who this figure was and the figure said I am a watch
guard where are you from Donald asked the figure replied not from here have you been
here before Donald asked and figure said many times Donald asked the same ones and the figure
said others also before so this guy was not talking normally Not only was it telepathic
but according to Donald all the answers from this figure were very short very concise and
at this point he realized he was talking to an actual extraterrestrial an alien and he
asked him why haven't you made yourselves known the ET said we are known Donald asked
why are you here the ET replied there are things everybody needs to know Donald asked
what things and the ET basically said according to Donald that his people had been watching
Earth for some time and were very concerned about Artemis use of atomic energy and the
way we are disposing of atomic waste he said that it was quote creating problems we do
not know of the ET said that atomic energy should be used for power not for destructive
purposes or dominating others he also said that humans need to stop using up the resources
of Earth ET said that their craft do in fact use nuclear power but they know how to dispose
of the waste safely so I told them other strange things that there is technology stored and
hidden in the Egyptian pyramids and Donald's hearing all this and basically said to the
ET you know why are you telling me this I'm not the right person to talk to how do they expect him to fix these problems and the ET replied I will tell you how to dispose of
your wastes and your Atomic wastes so that they will not pollute the Earth now Donald
believes he was given more information some of this he remembered later he did ask about
God and the being said that yes God is real uh one of the reasons Donald became uh had
some trouble recalling all this is because at this point something very strange started to happen he found himself sort of floating along with the E.T towards the craft and this
caused him quite quite a bit of fear as Donald says we were moving the whole time I would
I would petrified I'm scared to death I was shaking so hard I thought I was going to vomit
all at once Donald says I was three or four feet away from aufo before it had only been
two lights off in the distance but now I could see this craft real close it was like a cereal
bowl with another turned upside on top of it linked by an inner tube was hovering about
five or six feet in the air there was no noise I could see a purple color on top the E.T
told him our people will return at this point a door opened in the craft emitting a purple
light which Donald said actually gave off heat he felt a burning sensation a little
ramp came down the figure went right up into the craft the door closed the middle band
surrounding the perimeter of the craft lit up and this craft went straight up and darted
away so Donald was pretty disoriented and amazed at this point he walked back to his
car and by the time he made it there it was surprised to see the police and a local Rescue
Squad waiting there for him he told them what had just happened all of them went back to
the spot where the UFO had hovered nearly landed but saw nothing uh the policeman did
say that at least two other people had called into the station that night reporting strange
lights or what they thought was a plane about to crash but they had declined to investigate
these reports too bad could have been more witnesses the next day Donald woke up to find
that his skin which had been exposed to this light was now sunburned and over the next
few days it actually blistered and peeled and he said that his eyes also became sore
and red so this case caused quite a sensation researcher gray Barker did an investigation
and as he says after interviewing him for hours I'm absolutely convinced he is telling
the truth it's one of the best context stories I've ever heard now he was given a lie detector
test by expert Carmen Pelosi of New York and of course he did pass this lie detector test
and as Caroline says this is basically the testimony of an honest man so Donald is standing
by his story he allowed himself to be interviewed multiple times and as he says I know what
I saw I have good Vision I don't drink either but it's too important not to tell some somebody
hopefully the right kind of people will see it he said this encounter affected him profoundly
not only did it change his world view and convince him that UFOs and ETS are real and
visiting our planet but he went on a quest to learn the meaning of his experience he
began to speculate on the possibility of an underground base in the area he developed a strong interest in pyramids and he says that his intelligence itself seemed to be
boosted and that he was guided to find the information he needed to explore his experience
it's really quite a remarkable case now moving along to the 1990s this next case comes from researcher Cynthia Hind and it
Chipazi
occurred in an area known as chipazi this is in South Africa near the town of mindura
this occurred on March 6 1996 and the main Witness is Lloyd AWA
and at the time he was 17 years old when this happened he was going to Hermann minor Secondary
School and it was on again March 6 when Lloyd woke up in his home in chipotzi was around
1am and he was hearing this strange clicking noise coming from outside now he was alone
in the house his mom was visiting his sister so Lloyd had no one else to help him out with
this and this sound was strange enough that he hesitated to go outside and investigate
it but finally curiosity overcame his fear and he stepped outside walked into the street
but at this point the sound stopped as he says the sound frightened me a lot so he went
back inside turned off the lights and lay in bed for about 10 minutes when the sound
started up again and this time he could tell where it was coming from it was coming directly
from across the street where there's a woman's Training Center so we crept outside of the
house hid behind the Hedge right in front of his house and looked across the street
and this is when he saw something that he said sent chills down his spine as Lloyd says
I could see this thing about two meters away from me I nearly died of shock I had never
seen such a thing I wish I had not seen it I saw a completely white short fast-moving
mysterious thing was about one and a half meters tall that's about four and a half feet
as Lloyd says when I first took a glance at the thing I nearly collapsed because I had
never seen such a person with such a head the head was like a rugby ball or an egg it
had a satchel on its back and attached to that was an aerial and a small red light and
he could see now this weird clicking sound was actually coming from this figure and they
watched it for just a few moments but became overcome with fear he ran back inside went
to his bed and actually hid under the blankets on the next morning he went out there and
found some very interesting evidence some strange circular footprints which were fairly
large there were five sets of them set in the soft sand so you could see that this thing
was walking around he went to school that day told his classmates and that's when he
learned that a security guard at the women's Training Center had actually seen the same
thing the guard is a Woman by the name of kambuzzai guesh and she confirmed that this
incident did occur somewhere between 1 and 2 A.M she also heard this strange clicking
sound and went outside to investigate and saw apparently the same short figure in a
white suit she said she described it as looking quote unpleasant so it scared her and as she
watched its body seemed to Glow with rainbow like colors and it was clear to her that this
was not human it didn't look human she said its face almost looked more animalistic this
frightened her so badly that she ran inside and refused to come out she actually quit
her job the next day she absolutely refused to do a nighttime guard Duty quit her job
as a security guard and went to work for the local Cotton Factory so this impressed both
Witnesses and Lloyd was not happy about it afterwards as he says in his own words I wish
I had not seen it even now that night still makes me feel timid if I think of all that
happened so yeah it can be quite a traumatic experience to see something that close up
Tocantins
now here's another case this one occurred in the 2000s and it comes from Brazilian researcher
Thiago Luis tichetti he's very well known for investigating cases in Brazil and this
one occurred in March of 2001 in Brazil there are two witnesses vinicius Da Silva and Marta
Rosenthal this is quite a briefcase but interesting for sure vinicius and Marta were returning
home from a day of fishing along the river tokantines pictured here when they felt a
bump in one of their tires so they thought they had a flat tire and vinicius exited the
vehicle inspected the tires but couldn't find anything wrong but at this point Marta began
screaming and pointing to the right and there only a few meters away hovering over the Waters
of the tokantine's river was a metallic object that small windows or portholes along the
edge and standing outside the object on a Ledge was a humanoid figure about 1.3 meters
in fi in height so maybe four feet tall or so and this figure was holding a hose which
reached all the way to the water and it was apparently sucking up water from the river
and into the craft so all this technically isn't a Landing part of this object is touching
the Earth or the water so I think it qualifies and they watched this for about two minutes
at which point the humanoid pulled up the hose-like device from the river re-entered
the object this craft then became very bright and shot away horizontally and upwards into
the sky and disappeared in the distance so this is one of many cases where UFOs are seen
taking water and I think it's interesting because this illustrates an a pattern of UFO
Behavior that apparently are interested in water and have uses for it which is no surprise
and now we get to the last case and one of the most interesting as well and this occurred
in Ika Peru more specifically in the okukahe desert this occurred in 2011 one evening and
the main witness is a university professor and engineer and a paleontologist by the name
of Klaus honinger he's quite well known as a paleontologist and he was sitting around
the campfire with several other scientists his wife was there it was a clear sky when
suddenly everyone in the group saw right about 300 meters away under a thousand feet on the
top of a small hill a bright light that was rising up from the ground apparently and into
the sky and according to Klaus this light was on a quote long object about 100 meters
in length so a big 300 foot long craft and this object or light remains stationary right
above the hill and they watched in awe as several smaller lights or orbs began to exit
this larger object according to the witnesses they counted about 14 of these smaller glowing
orbs or spheres which began to fly around in all different directions at very high speeds
and according to Klaus after a while one of these small orbs approached to within 150
feet of the group it then descended very close to them actually lighting up the desert floor
they have the impression it was searching for something just a few minutes later these spheres began to return to the larger object coming from all directions and re-entering
into it this point this larger object then descended behind the hill disappearing from
sight but apparently Landing because it was immediately after this that Klaus noticed
the presence of two strange beings that were not human and he walks partially away from
the group while these figures walked up to him and yeah they were not human as Klaus
says they had a long head it was a round head that ended a little pointed they were thin
with very long arms that reached almost to the knees I estimate that they would have
been around 2.2 meters to 2.3 meters high so quite tall over six feet uh six and a half
seven feet even and it really interested in because their skulls looked very much like
the elongated skulls that had been found in areas nearby and that he was researching so
he says he became extremely emotional while in the presence of these beings and he started
speaking to them telepathically at first he didn't remember the whole conversation but
those who were in the group did they could see him talking to these guys he did later
remember this conversation but he does remember asking these beings all telepathically where
they were from and if they were indeed extraterrestrials and they told him that they were actually
from Earth and had been living amongst us for thousands of years and that they had been
here long before humans arrived they told him we are your brothers and as Klaus says
in his own words their appearance was undoubtedly different from ours they had elongated heads
very thin with long arms and legs from the darkness we only noticed that they were a
light color we didn't notice a mouth or nose just very large eyes for some reason I can't
explain I approached about 10 meters from them and I had a mental communication I suppose
telepathic where they told me not to be afraid and that they were not going to hurt me and
for about 10 minutes there was a fluid communication that in short I was made to understand that
they did not come from another planet but lived thousands of years ago on Earth the
biggest concern they have is how we are destroying the planet and putting at risk the habitat
they have here so after this short conversation Klaus turned to his companions and said don't
be afraid that these beings are not here to hurt them however his wife was not a happy
camper because when she saw these figures approaching her husband she suffered an apparent
nervous breakdown and it was shortly after this conversation that both being stopped
they looked at each other briefly turned around and left so it was about two to four minutes
afterwards that these figures had disappeared that this craft or a similar craft from behind
the hill came up shot up into the sky and quickly disappeared from sight and here's
what makes this case even more interesting Klaus honinger managed to take a photo of
this craft so that is very unusual and uh as Klaus said he initially kept this Secret
but decided that he was going to come forward and as he says I am not interested if people
believe in the encounter or think I am crazy I had that encounter in 2010 with two beings
in the middle of the desert of Ika which I will never forget and I assume it as an important
milestone in my life before that the Extraterrestrial subject was not one that moved my interest
I assumed logically that there must be life on other planets but what I experienced confirmed
this assumption and he ended up the publicly lecturing and doing presentations on his experience
and his encounters because he did have more encounters after this with human looking ETS
and again yeah he wanted to keep quiet at first but decided he would go public because as he says for years I thought about the reasons why I was contacted and that this fact was
not to be left in a closed Circle but so that the people around me would find out about
it and open their minds to a reality which has been hidden centuries ago so he bravely
stepped forward and another very interesting aspect to this encounter is that following
this Klaus honinger became a fierce environmentalist that's certainly a pattern we do see in a
lot of these cases it's an incredible encounter
Conclusion
those are all the cases that I wanted to present today and again as I often say this is just
the tip of the iceberg there are literally thousands upon thousands upon thousands of
cases like these I love the humanoid and Landing cases because they do provide a lot of information
and as you can see again these cases are worldwide and ongoing for a very long time and I think
they have a lot to say about the UFO phenomenon and as you can see these messages are very
consistent the ETS are very concerned about our planet our use of nuclear power the way
we're destroying our environment the way we mistreat each other so these are good messages
and hopefully we will listen so thanks very much for watching I truly appreciate it and
until next time keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important
of all keep having fun bye now.
