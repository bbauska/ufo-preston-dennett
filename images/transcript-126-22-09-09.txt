INTERVIEW WITH A FULLY CONSCIOUS UFO CONTACTEE PART III: EXTRATERRESTRIALS I HAVE MET
Sep 9, 2022

Summary:
Sep 9, 2022
Dolly Safran, a nurse and Army D.O.D employee from Florida, has experienced a lifetime of UFO contact. While her experiences were initially shrouded in missing time, at age fourteen she experienced an encounter that would change her life forever. From that point on, Dolly remembered her UFO contacts fully consciously. She has since had thousands of contacts and experienced a wide variety of encounters.

In Part One of this series, we explored Dolly's encounters up to age fourteen. In Part Two, we presented the many UFO photographs and films Dolly was able to capture. Now, in Part Three, we now explore the many different types of extraterrestrials Dolly has encountered.

Among the most common type of ETs Dolly has encountered are the A.I. grays. These are small three-foot-tall biological android-like beings who function as workers. They assist in the transportation of humans to and from the ET craft and carry out many other duties. They are not living beings with souls, but they can function autonomously. They can also be used by the ETs as avatars.

Dolly has also encountered tall grays, mid-sized grays and small grays. These are biological beings, with genetics. They eat, sleep and have all the biological functions of human beings. Dolly's main ET liason is a tall gray she calls "Momma." Dolly met Momma when she was only six years old and is still in contact with her today.

Many contactees describe small blue troll-like beings about three-feet in height. Dolly has met these as well, and says that they are a variation of the commonly described grays. They often work with young children and help to reduce the fear factor often associated with UFO contact.

On one occasion, Dolly had the rare opportunity to see two dog-like ETs, very similar in description to the Egyptian figure known as Anubis. These beings were more than six feet tall, broad-shouldered, muscular and covered with fur.

On another rare occasion, Dolly was able to visit with cat-like ETs. Described very much as humanoid cats, these beings are short, covered with fur and quite solitary. Dolly had only a brief encounter with them, but it was quite close-up, and left a deep impression on her.

Periodically during her onboard UFO encounters, Dolly has interacted with the beings known as Tall Whites. These ETs are very stern and serious. They are tall and can reach well over ten or fifteen feet in height. They have only limited contact with humans and usually keep to themselves.

Dolly has had many interactions with human-looking ETs, often described as Nordics. These beings are very much like us, and have the same variations we have on our own planet. On several occasions, Dolly has interacted with Misha, a young girl from another planet. Misha, says Dolly, looks very much like the people from the indigenous population of Polynesia. 

Dolly has also encountered humanoid beings who spend much of their time in the water. They have webbed hands and feet and are able to remain underwater for long periods of time.

On a few occasions, Dolly has been taken to see third-dimensional light beings who are able to transcend the physical world and travel into the higher dimensions. These are very powerful beings with very strong paranormal abilities.

Another amazing encounter Dolly experienced was with a nine-foot-tall praying mantis being. This encounter occurred in the backyard of a rural farm in Georgia. The being told Dolly that they are the Watchers and that they came to check on her following a very delicate medical procedure that she had undergone days earlier.

Among the most fantastic beings Dolly has encountered are the so-called Anunnaki. These winged beings are very tall, strong and powerful. Dolly only met them once when she was a little girl, but the encounter was one she will never forget.

Dolly's case is one of the most extensive accounts of UFO contact on record. She has spent days and weeks at a time among the ETs and has learned vast amounts of knowledge from them. The ETs, Dolly says, are very much like us. Her experiences have taught her that there is life throughout the universe, and that we are only a small part of a vast network of living beings that exist among the billions of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
a very special episode for you today this is going to be part three of an 
ongoing series of interviews i'm doing with a contact he by the name of dolly saffron 
and i call this episode interview with a fully conscious contactee part 3 extraterrestrials 
i have dolly is the subject of my book symmetry and she tells her whole story of her lifelong 
contacts with not only grays but a wide variety of et's including tall whites short blue beans 
bird-like beings raw or the anunnaki as well dog-like beings cat-like beings 
light beings and more so that's what we're going to be talking about today 
hello dolly how are you doing this morning hi good morning i'm great good so yeah this will be our 
third interview together for my uh youtube channel we've already done as you know two one introducing 
your encounters and a second one talking about the photographic evidence which was actually a 
really popular episode one of my top ten i know you have a lot of other evidence supporting 
witnesses and medical evidence and so forth so today i thought it would be really interesting 
if we could talk about the different types of et's of extraterrestrials you have 
had the wonderful privilege and honor to meet and interact with so i know there's quite a 
few of them it's not just grays there's small ai grays there's the mid-size and tall grays 
there's tall whites there's lightnings catalog things dog-like things the anunnaki and so 
forth so i thought we'd just kind of go down the list and talk about some of these really interesting experiences you have had that are that we talked about in our book symmetry a true ufo 
adventure so how does that sound that sounds great awesome okay i know we did cover you know your 
experience at age 14 where you saw you know the ai graze and the mama the tall gray that is your main 
contact but i thought it would be fun just to go over a little bit about what the small a.i grays 
are like we'll cover them first because there's a lot of questions about these guys i think 
and so these are the short little guys right that don't necessarily have emotions or aren't alive as we would think of it correct um they are biologically built 
um they do support a a bone frame uh to walk them around but they don't have the same musculature 
that we do they're very short and they're very small very thin uh they probably weigh soaking wet
about 45 to 50 pounds each um they are vulnerable to uh anybody messing with them the wrong way 
uh i call them living dolls they are intelligent their intelligence is um able to learn 
they assimilate things well they follow directions and they can make independent uh 
decisions while they're completing their tasks they know how to interact with humans they have 
human rapport they have rapport with every other being in the universe and uh yes they do not 
really show emotion uh this may be my personal opinion it's what i've experienced with them they 
tend to have an odd quirky uh humor about them i'm not saying a sense of humor they don't tell jokes 
but they do things that make me laugh uh so i call it that um they'll look at me fun okay so they're 
they're autonomous but as well they can be sort of used like avatars yes they can be uh 
shut off they power down uh their skin is actually the electrical component that 
runs them they energize through their skin they absorb light and uh it powers up a 
type of uh central like we have a heart that's pumping blood they're um they have a core 
not where heart is it's a little bit close to the middle of their abdomen uh central power place that they use and it generates electricity for them uh 
talked about them being stacked up like cord wood you saw them on a craft so you've you've seen 
them basically being stored yes yeah yeah can you describe that when when they're turned off they'll 
walk into a place where we where we re store them i guess is the word you can use for it and they'll 
walk up to the the one in front of them the last one in front of them and they'll reach around 
and then we turn them off uh they power down and they stay like that standing up sometimes they'll 
lean in and they look like they're cord wood stacked up against each other but yes i've had one 
instance where i saw them laying down uh that was just once and i thought that was weird but they 
mostly stand up stored so so these are the guys that usually come to pick you up right yes yes 
right so in that regard you've probably interacted with them hundreds upon well thousands of times 
thousands and thousands of times yes yeah they're everywhere they are the workers of uh uh et 
they can take gamma radiation uh for longer longer longer periods of time they don't have dna 
per se that'll break down and hurt them and uh they do all the work in deep space 
the et like to make it to a planet as quickly as they possibly can it has magnetosphere because 
they're protected that way from huge amounts of gamma radiation so they spend as little time in 
actual open space as they can and so the ais are the ones that do all that work all right 
so that drawing you did is the main type is there just one type of these guys they all um yeah they 
pretty much all look the same it's whatever works you know the simplest is the best and that was it 
that's the best they have yes and they're like three feet tall yep just under three feet just 
almost three feet tall i've never they've always all the same size i've never seen any two a 
different height so yeah do they have names or anything like that or they're no no they just um 
they don't even refer to themselves as i am uh you just look at them and they know you're thinking of 
that particular one and you direct your thoughts toward it and it responds to you all right i know 
in the book you told one really interesting story where you landed and the a eyes went out 
sort of inspected and one of them i guess touched the side of the craft and yes it yeah he it burned 
him all the way up to past his elbow and it was bad and uh two of them ran up to him and helped 
him and they walked him in and uh he was brought in to be assessed to see if he could be repaired 
they shut him down right away they practically carried him in and uh unfortunately he didn't 
he wasn't repairable and that was a hard day for me because you work with somebody or even 
an autonomous being you know ai and you sort of adopt it and it becomes part of your life and it 
was one of my more frequent ai that i was around and i mourned for a day for him you know it's like 
dang you know i always wonder what how much they learn and how much they understand you know so 
it bugged me for a day all right so those are the short little ai greys yes i'm guessing this 
is what a lot of people do interact with yes absolutely they're the first they're the first 
line to come in uh to you if you're in a contact tee you'll see them before anybody else 
their eyes on hands on on deck i mean they're everywhere and they they do everything do they 
have genetics do you think um no it's mostly just biological organisms that comprise their uh 
their construction and it keeps their skin supple and able to absorb energy and it keeps them mobile 
and uh their eyes fluid because they do have fluid eyes and uh they can actually drink a type 
of fluid that helps everything keep going they don't go to the bathroom anything it's sort of 
you know how we evaporate they evaporated out they don't eat otherwise and they don't go to 
the bathroom or anything like that at all wow okay i think we've covered them pretty extensively but 
most people that i've talked to i mean i've talked people encounter all different types of beings and 
generally people who have extensive contact contact many different types of beings from 
you know man tids and grays and i don't like the term nordics human looking um so forth but yeah 
the grays seem to be certainly in my own files the most common and i know your main contact which we 
talked about in first episode part one was mama who's a tall grey right i wonder if we could talk 
a little bit about you know the grays and mama and you know the mid side grays and the tall grays 
sure mama is a tall gray she has four fingers uh when i was growing up i have memories of thinking 
why do i have five and am i gonna lose one of them no i also thought i'd lose my pinky toes and there 
was a thing out in the public where people said we were evolving away from our fifth finger and 
our pinky toes and i took that to heart and i was just waiting to be like mom i have only four um 
it may happen we i don't know it's part of our genome to evolve we have the same genome 
as they do we're human uh all beings have genetics dna including animals and plants 
and uh it is a constant throughout the universe literally that we're all uh human genotypes 
we dime out differently but our genetics are pretty much the same it's the base of all life 
genetics dna and so we're when i say that we are one with them we are we are all the same 
we all have genetic dna we're no different from each other even though we look a little differently and we have the same mind we eat we breathe we sleep 
we have uh we procreate we go to the bathroom all of it we have emotions and feelings all of it 
all right so can you talk a little specifically about mama herself like how old she is and your 
interactions with her and what she's like yes um well mama is from the iran cluster 
she is a tall gray uh she is a very very uh she's about 836 834 years she's never given me an exact 
number old um i know that she could live to another couple hundred years that's what she 
says she probably shaved off a few years people like to do that yes it's possible 
i'm kidding of course that's okay she is a um her job what she chose to do with her life is 
she is a a mother who is uh she helps with babies in her lifetime she's been a 
a nursemaid mother that kind of thing she's helped raise children she uh takes care of 
hybrids uh like me who are being worked with and watches over us and organizes our days for us 
uh she handles more than one of me i know that uh she said that there are about eight of us 
that she handles that's a lot of work for one woman but she does it um she is a uh selfless 
wonderful observant loving individual beautiful being beautiful mind 
she is well regarded by everyone who knows her and she has wisdom that is unbelievably deep 
and long and i've learned a lot from her a lot um you've had lots of long conversations with her yes 
yes in liaison she is my main liaison right um when when i was growing up you know how humans are 
we get in trouble from time to time we step on our tongue we do things that aren't quite okay that 
kind of thing and when i made boo-boos or outright uh she would just get really quiet and stare at me 
and i could hear it in her head what just happened you know and she'd stare me down and i think oh
well now you know and she taught me how to do in a self-assessment when i realized that i've 
walked into the sandpit so to speak i look at what i just did how appropriate was it or inappropriate 
whether i was being outside quote the the realm of moral morality standards that they observe 
and i had to figure out how to re-adjust myself what what could i do to fix myself and she would 
patiently wait for me to come up with what i thought was wrong how i was gonna fix it or make 
atonement for it and what was my next step in how i was gonna act and that's how they taught all ets 
teach this way they're young and i was brought up like that um i was lucky my father was a contactee 
because he kind of did the same thing there are a couple things i did that i got real bad trouble before but mostly same way some of those incidents in the book yes yes um so uh she was um 
she made sure that my schedule was right that i was uh getting enough rest enough food 
uh was i happy or not she would talk and play with me she would introduce me to other children my age as i was growing up and give me opportunities to interact with other 
different peoples that we were coming in contact with i was given free time where i was allowed 
to explore through the realm of where i was ets are very open to their children and everybody on 
board including human adults and they'll show you anything they're always good time for everybody 
and so if i had a question it was always openly answered as quickly as possible i was given free reign that way um it's pretty glorious experience with her and it still is she like i said she's she 
she'll answer anything if i have a question even now i can contact her mentally and i'll get an 
answer from her well she she's a tall gray how tall do they get like what's the tallest she's 
actually six foot two i understand that she's on the shorter end of it they get as high as 
seven five almost eight feet tall she's a little bit shorter um it's her genetics to be that way 
uh the grades are like us we have tall people in our genome short people we all you know it just 
depends on who your parents are and her parents were a little bit shorter so she's only six foot two i once talked to a guy he's like this grey that came into my room was eight feet tall yeah 
he looked really really old yes they can get yes i know i actually look older than mama now that this 
concerns me but you know uh she's very young looking um i don't know when they start to show 
their age so far it's very small amount on our uh someday it might become apparent uh but yeah they 
do get old they do pass away they have a lifespan just like we do and um yeah and eight feet is not 
uncommon i've seen that so there's lots of tall grays and there's mid-sized grays and short 
grays are these all the same or you know like here on earth we have short people and they're 
you know humans and we have very tall people and they're humans so these are all basically i mean we're all human right in essence but right guess my question is are those mid-grays and the 
tall grays and the short grays the same or in just kind of dialing out differently in their genetics 
just a little bit differently the mid grays the mid size uh the tallest one i've ever seen 
is about my height five foot eight um they have three fingers instead of four and they 
use prosthesis on their fingers to help them manipulate things it is their genetics to have 
that you know in our genome we have people who are born with six fingers it's not uncommon it happens 
it pops up every now and then well i think that's what's going on between the different grays 
from where they're at they it was three fingers for those that were there they're not from the 
around cluster they're from zeta reticuli they're a little bit different and then there are even 
shorter grays than that i call they're kind of um troll size they're between three feet four feet 
four and a half almost five feet tall we would have midgets that look like that you know we 
have that genetic component in our dna as well and their their skin cast is a little bit more 
they're gray but they're they have more of a blue flavor to it it's like a lighter shade of blue on them and you can see the delineation of blue markings on their skin in other words we 
have wrinkles their wrinkles are a little bit darker blue than their palette of their skin itself all right so my sister-in-law christine kisara who's you know the artist for a lot of 
my books actually drew an illustration of one of these small blue beings is that what you're 
talking about yes exactly i did see that and she nailed it she got it that's what they look like 
um they work with children they love children uh go figure they are they're teachers um they 
are uh soul teachers in other words they're very good at teaching children and even adults
to lose fear in other words if you've got a real fear problem they interact with that they try to 
bring joy to people here they try to understand what it is that you've got going on and how to 
best repair it almost like a little psychologist they're really good at that and uh they've worked 
with human beings as long as anybody knows yeah well it's interesting to say children because i 
talked to a guy not too long ago i haven't transcribed his interview but i can't wait to because he was from louisiana and he said he saw these same blue beings coming up to him 
in his bedroom over and over so yeah that fits in with you know the other interviews 
that i've done with people and so these are essentially just another form of grays or humans 
humans i guess right that's what i've been told by a lot of contactees and they talked like like 
who are you greys and they said well we are you you are us that is the most common message well 
one of them absolutely yes all right so um you've interacted with all different types of these grays 
and the little blue beans the mid-size the small grays tall grays what about tall whites 
um do they look human yes absolutely um they are giants though um they start shorter growing up 
i mean they're about 15 20 pounds when they're born they're pretty big babies we have this in our genome they are the giants of old that people talk about um
there are a couple ethnicities of them though and this is one particular ethnicity as well and they 
are tend to be lighter skinned lighter eye color lighter hair color they have red hair as well as 
white um they grow very quickly they reach six foot uh probably by the time they're 16 years old 
uh the closer they get to 30 they start growing again and they can hit seven foot eight foot at thirty and then again they can grow as high as fifteen to 18 feet tall 
18 18 feet tall yeah you would never see them on this planet they wouldn't be able to breathe here 
they couldn't handle our gravity at all uh when you see them they're younger under 30 or thereabouts and then they leave uh they're intelligent uh mathematicians they're 
like um engineers uh they're extreme engineers they can engineer anything including computers 
that we have stuff like that um they are uh they keep a lot of um they keep up with all the et's 
and what they're doing in other words they are if you've got a strategic issue in other words where 
am i how am i going to get there they'll know uh if i have if i can't find someplace that i'm 
going to go and i've been told i'm going there they'll facilitate me being brought there first 
by another et to show me where i'm going and then i come back and go out myself that kind of thing 
they watch everything they just keep abreast of everything they're also geo engineers they're 
they're mostly on this planet watching what's happening to it and keeping up with that and 
giving updates to everybody so appearance wise do they have hair and like normal eyes and yes yeah 
right yep um mostly blue eyed they do have blue green eyes and very white uh hair has the hair has 
no uh color no melon in it the follicle is clear 100 clear and people you know that i've talked to 
i don't have a whole lot of personal accounts i've certainly read about them um but people talk about them being somewhat i don't want to say non-emotional because they're not but very sort of 
what i put it's sober serious i used to laugh about star trek because mr spock 
even though he doesn't look like them embodies their mindset they're so logical and 
completely scientific and they're thinking that they appear not show motion or to be very stern 
uh they have a very rigid way of thinking and uh they don't go outside that at all in other words 
if you throw a curveball at them uh your curveball is going to go right by until they assess why it 
did that and then talk to you about it later that's how they are and they're very protective 
parents of their offspring and uh uh they have uh serious uh parameters of where they'll allow 
you to go with them they're very much in their own space do you have i don't want to put you 
on the spot but can you think of any specific encounters you've had with them that might be 
interesting to share i've transported um them and one of their children uh decided to come and see 
me up on deck and uh wanted to watch me fly and it was a little girl and her mother uh there's 
rules about how you walk around them okay and uh i wasn't on deck when they wanted to bring her up 
i had to walk right by him and i did a detour on my own deck and walked around the there's a wall 
in the back of our you know my seat and i walked around the wall and they came and sat in my chair 
and i had my hands open and up on my lap and she entered first the mother did and i 
said welcome to you welcome to my station and she said greetings to you and she said i have a child 
who would like to visit with you and sit with you and watch you fly would that be permissible and i said yes and she said will you observe my child's needs and i said yes and i knew exactly what they 
meant by that i don't touch her let her speak to me and ask me what she wants to know that kind of 
thing they're very weird that way don't want to upset her way of thinking and i said okay 
so we got on deck and i she sat in and her mother was in the doorway slightly out of it watching us 
and she looked at me and she said can we go for a flight and i said yes and i said do you have any questions before we go and it's a long story but it be that as me 
we got out went out i allowed her to fly that day showed her and she picked it up immediately 
amazed that you know what out of me she was enthranced and thralled and she acted just 
like i did first flight i ever took and i'm like i'm thinking oh my god this kid's gonna fly okay i 
could hear it in her head and her mother sitting at the doorway giving me this face she went
and i was like oh no they don't like this and uh she asked me she said straight to 
my face if i asked to be a pilot would i be allowed and i hear talata back there going 
yes say yes and i said yes and her mother was like okay and and i said you have to 
um learn many new things are you willing to do that and she said yes i said well that's great 
and as she got up to leave she freaking hugged me totally broke her own protocol wrapped her arms 
around my neck and hugged me tight and i started crying i could not help myself i was like oh my god oh my god oh my god i i brought one in you know and uh it freaked me out that was incredible 
i got touched by tall grain never ever ever before or all right all right well yeah tall excuse me 
yeah i mean it freaked me out i mean just freak me the heck out that's that's really special 
yeah i just want to remind all the people who are watching listening that dolly's main mission 
is flying flying these craft i actually want to do a whole episode on that dolly um perhaps 
that would be the next good episode because that story is very interesting and talata is the ship 
the the fantasy who well not the ship but the entity who embodies the [ __ ] all right so 
oh that's cool now i want to move to some of the other really cool beings that you've seen and one 
that really i mean we covered this in the book but i would love to talk a little bit about this would be the dog-like beings um yes not sure which all them they're like horus egyptian you know 
the egyptian uh deity horus yeah okay yeah those images called this that we can see yeah i'll put 
some up when when you describe them but uh yeah if you could describe that one encounter you had 
i believe you were on ship and walked right by them yes uh they have um uh you know what a german 
shepherd looks like right a black totally black german shepherd or a black totally black wolf 
uh their skin is um not as hairy it's very thin like a like a really short haired dog they have 
hair like that on their skin and they have tall ears and they don't sit on the sides they sit 
up and they can rotate them like a german shepherd did for sound um they have a very a much broader 
face than a german shepherd it's much broader and their eyeset is larger than a german shepherd 
uh their eyes are golden sometimes uh golden got green in it a little bit of green and gold 
not brown green and gold so you saw all this as you were walking by then yes i am a trained 
observer and i i marked them in my head are you kidding i looked at everything i went up 
and down yeah so if you could just describe that whole incident how it unfolded i was coming back 
to go to my quarters from something i was doing and it's a long hallway to my quarters and just 
as you enter this hallway they're standing right there at the opening two of them and they were communicating with one another and one was adjusting something on his arm and hold on so
i stood there flabbergasted when i first saw them i didn't know whether i should walk by them they are quite large they're six and a half feet tall each of them muscular powerful and they have 
hands like us but they're clawed okay and uh have incredible claws on their hands 
and i'm staring at that and i'm looking them down and i see they have feet that are kind of clawed and they're immensely huge and they have unbelievable achilles tendons on them in 
other words stood out and uh their legs aren't as straight as ours they have hawks and uh were 
they wearing anything yes uh they both had a skirt like a like an egyptian tartan you know egyptian 
tartan they were folded over and they had a belt a wide belt around them and i couldn't see where 
the belt lapped or looped or anything like that but it was on them uh they had a type of uh shirt 
over them it formed to them very tight fitting and they did not have sleeves 
it went up their neck like this you know like a you know ma uh men who wear t-shirts that 
have that you know and it comes tea in the back and uh but it wasn't like that it just 
form-fitted them i could see they had armbands or something or yes they had armbands on and uh 
he had an earring in one ear one of them and the other one he had i'm not sure what it was so some 
sort of a a medallion or something clipped to the side of his ear um they have teeth oh yeah 
he just sort of went like that at me when he saw me and i was like oh god there's canines in there 
and they have big noses and they both huffed me they went like that and i was like okay they know 
what i smell like now and i'm thinking do i keep walking and they both did this to me they went 
like come by okay i could hear it in my head so i slowly started walking by them and i 
i am not afraid to look but i was looking at the corner of my eye as i went by and uh i realized that their muscles can flex they were flexing in front of me and 
uh i could smell them oh just gonna ask that so you were like right right next to them would you 
say yes i got a whiff oh yes i did you're definitely powerfully smelling animals okay 
humanoid but i could smell them every et smells everybody else it is a is a form 
of communication for them uh new mothers will tell you this when their babies are born they have this overpowering need to smell huff their own child and they can pick their child out of 
anybody by their own smell mama knows and ets are like that their smell is very very developed 
um and they smell each other so it's a form of greeting actually when they huffed me i knew that it was okay they weren't going to attack me or anything 
i wouldn't expecting that anyway but when you see that for the first time here it takes you back 
their skin color is very very dark they are um black so the egyptian hieroglyph images are pretty 
accurate accurate very very accurate um they weren't carrying a staff or anything like that but 
they had sandals on their feet too their feet can't wear shoes like us they have sandals um they were flexing their toes in the egyptian times clearly must have seen these guys 
absolutely of course they did absolutely um i've run across them another time 
a few years back i was doing georgia ce fives and um one of our members uh is a very nice uh man and 
he he would call me well first thing that happened was i used to remotely meeting sometimes i was living in florida i'd remote view them because i couldn't be there and one 
time i remote viewed in and never there was one standing behind him literally standing behind him 
his name is robert and uh i was shocked when i saw it i'm thinking how what you know and 
uh it turned and looked at me and it nodded like yep you're looking at me and 
i was shocked and i didn't know robert that well he never spoke to me before that and after that 
the next meeting that we had when we were all together i asked to speak to him personally and found out that robert doesn't talk to anybody in the group really he sits outside the group 
he doesn't even enjoy the around during the ce5 he's just out there and when he started talking my 
it blew my mind he sounds like them i have heard them enunciate and it's incredibly deep throated 
not quite a growl but you know i suspect a lot of people are having contact but when it's really 
extensive and they often i mean they usually don't go public with it right they don't kudos to you 
for you know being willing to discuss all this i know there are people who are skeptical out there 
and uh there's a lot of people who are having encounters as well right i'm sure nobody should 
feel weird about it i i promise you it's not i'm not i don't get a lot of people uh who attack me 
over it or anything like that it's pretty good i'm happy about that you know well you know for the 
skeptics out there one day they they'll find out one way or the other truth takes care of itself
so those are the dog-like beings i personally don't have a whole lot of accounts i have run across it a few times so it's very interesting to hear you talk about it and 
the connection to the egyptian stuff is just fascinating to me when i heard you 
starting to describe that i'm like oh my gosh this is seen these before and images 
that's really cool but one i have heard a few times is cat-like beings yes people say that 
they're lyrans i don't know that that's true i talked to a lady by the name of sue describe this 
is my first account where she described a cat-like being that it was maybe three and a half feet tall 
covered with dark fur little cat ear cat a walking cat and she could she couldn't pronounce his whole 
name so she called it marie m-r-e-e but she had many many interactions with this cat-like being 
and i understand we talk about this in the book so you had an encounter with uh these 
this type of cat like beings i wonder if you could talk about that encounter and these cat like guys um i was on a mother ship and again i was going somewhere i was supposed to be on the ship 
and i was walking down a long hallway and there they were right there right in front of the door where i was going to go through sometimes i i uh i didn't realize it then but i realize that now 
that uh they deliberately were waiting to show themselves to me and uh there were 
two cats they stand up uh one had a long tail actually and the other one had a stubby tail 
um they were gray in color both of them but had white places on them uh they were short furred 
not long ford and their faces are more angular you know like a cat than a human and but they 
have the cat face and the nose with the nub nose you know the and when they smile uh their lips are 
just like a cat in other words it's the you know the the split and it does that but when they open 
their mouth you see the four small teeth in the front the big canines the second set of canines 
on the bottom as well and hardly any molars back there she one of them yawned and i saw the entire 
inside of her mouth i was like whoa were you able to touch them no uh i brushed by one on purpose 
so i could feel uh they feel like um mink they have that kind of fur minky 
very very uh wait not moist what's the word luxurious like a mink you know oil 
there's a a certain amount of oil in there fur okay and i think when they groom they're doing that or i'm not sure they do groom i know that's because of them at all 
um yes i tried to i said hello i said um my name is dolly and then i and she looked at me 
funny because she knew doug unwell that's not what they call me on board i'm ora okay and i said okay
she smiled at me at that point that's when i got to see the teeth and she yawned 
and i said uh where are you from and she's she she did this and she said same galaxy 
i went okay and she said orion like that and i don't know okay there are many different planets 
in the orion clusters and i think she's from there from one of them uh is that telepathic yes 
i'll telepathic they do talk and they purr this is what got me because i could hear her you can 
they can communicate and pray at the same time you know it's under their in their chest area you can hear it like that right and i'm like oh my god she's burning and uh i said beautiful beautiful 
like that to her in my head letting her know that i thought she was beautiful and they smiled and they nodded and i said i greet you and i must go and i walk by her and i brushed up on her 
used my hand i felt her like wow you know and uh about how old were you when this happened 
10 11 somewhere around there a little more spirited at that age a little bit more 
handsy you know and uh yeah they were amazing to me i went straight to mama in my head after that 
who what what you know and she said uh they've been on this planet for a long 
time they were worshiped as deities and she said they uh come and go here 
they're more interested in us as observers than as uh interactors and they like us which is amazing 
and i said is it like that where you're from and she said yes they're with us like cool cool 
i've never seen one on planet though where i was going to learn and stuff i never saw cat being 
again and i'm thinking where are they and she said they're in orion you know so that's all 
i know about them that's all i know they've been here they interact with us they like us 
okay i don't know we also believe once had an encounter with what we would describe as light 
beings yes um that encounter okay um there are corporeal light beings who are uh interdimensional 
as well that they're in the third you know the third dimension with us they sort of go back and 
forth they're able to interventionally travel on of their own accord of their own ability 
and uh they appear when they travel they become full light you know and you just see parts of them 
because they're so brilliantly light and they their auras zoom out you know in a certain way and they kind of look like angels 
um that's interesting and you you saw these yes yes um we were where was that
you know that when a et crashes um we're there within seconds to get them if we can 
if it's uh nobody's around it's and and we're able to excise them out we do it 
and these like beings assist because they're able to move a ship without uh us 
encapsulating it in some sort of energy beam or whatever they can actually lift the ship up and 
get it high enough for us to capture it that way they get it off the ground pretty quick if there are beings alive in the craft they evacuate them they are able to take them for us they're part 
of a rescue they have rescued humans i've seen them do all kinds of things on this planet yeah 
very cool all right gosh there's a few more i wanted to cover um you once i mean you 
described seeing i mean there's hybrids of course very human hybrids but what people call the nordics or human looking beings humans are throughout the universe is that correct 
yes and the human genome is a constant like i said at the beginning we all have dna and it's all 
pretty much the same type of dna it is the same it just dials up differently um it is infinite 
the combinations of dna that can occur they're all carbon based life forms nitrogen oxygen 
you know proteins all of that we all need light we all need a third uh dimensional place to be 
fully uh brought into existence here with the dna uh some take themselves out of it like the 
light beings they've already walked out of it but yes we're all human genotypes we all stand we all walk we all have fingers we all eat reach sleep procreate go to the bathroom yep all 
of it just jumping back to the grays too do the grays have an odor uh yeah they're very earthy 
uh they like the temperature to be uh higher than 77 degrees they go from 77 to 84 
86 87 every now and then but that's what they keep the craft at that they're on uh if you don't have 
hair you can't evaporate out uh properly you know your hair can't wick to keep you cool uh 
so they keep it a little bit warmer that's interesting you say earlier because whitley strieber had a couple of people at his cabin who both had encounters on the same night 
yeah dory and raven i think were their names anyway they one discarded is very earthy very 
woodsy and the other said very woodsy very earthy so you use the same direction yes yep exactly it 
says con whitley said it's almost a cinnamon like odor exactly he's got it that's it i like 
to say sandalwood okay it's somewhere between cinnamon and cinnamon but we all perceive smell 
a little bit differently than the other so my take is more cinnamon sandalwood but yeah it's amazing yeah so going back to the human-like ets um i do want to do a another episode where we 
talk about the various planets you've been to but there was one that was kind of a water type world 
with lots of water on it and you encountered some human looking beings there and one was a girl by 
the name of uh mia was it micha micha micha yeah i wonder if you could talk a little bit about 
what she was like miesha is a star person um we have people on this planet who are absolutely 
related to her um all the star people on this planet have some relation to where michael 
is from it's in the delphi system uh if you look at orion and you go through a line orion 
and you're flying out you'll run into the pleiades and if you pass the pleiades you go straight into 
those systems where delphians and everything that's how we fly through um the star people here have been taught that they're pleiadian or frumpy the pleiades it's not exactly that it's 
through the pleiades that's what they're trying to describe to them that's on the other side of it um but they're uh polynesian looking or native american looking in a wet looking 
you know uh slavic looking they all have the chinese they all have the almond shaped eyes 
to really high ridges in your cheekbones we're all related to that you have that type of bloodlines 
you said nietzsche had her hair was slightly different her teeth i think yes um mitcha had more 
teeth than we do they're a little bit more pointed and she had more uh eating meat she shaped fish 
a lot um she could tear through anything and her hair was much denser and thicker okay real heavy 
and dark and she had beautiful beautiful hazel green eyes you know with gold flecks on them 
and she was tan you know golden colored and she was absolutely stunningly beautiful 
and so was everybody else in her area we have all different types of hair here on this planet 
and skin colors and body types uh she's lived there her whole life she's been brought out and 
was taught like i was you know and learned but brought back and she prefers to live where she's at on the in the delphi system but there are other beings on this planet as well 
but miesha is um an artist mitchell loves music and she makes things that is her gift and she 
creates things she's very evolved and that's what she does you spoke with her telepathically as well 
yeah all right yeah that seems to be the general rule with people who are having contact telepathy 
is the universal language yes awesome because that removes you know lying or miscommunication 
or correct you can't you can't submit to anybody because they hear what you're thinking um um
for varication it doesn't exist between them at all and if you even think to do it you get nailed instantly it's like hmm they'll say what 
they don't that's why they don't storytell because they don't have it in them to do that they only 
tell the truth so any stories you hear from them are about real live things that have actually 
happened among them that's their storytelling and actually if you think if you go back to the time 
of early humans that's how we communicated to one another we told each other what happened 
that's how we learned by that type of communication i'm not sure when people started 
elaborating or painting new pictures but yeah all right and you also talked a little bit about 
beings who spend a lot of time in the water and yes they are water beings uh they're 
on the same planet with micha they're humanoid in that they have arms and legs but they only live in the water they can come out of the water but not for long periods of 
time they dry out and it's not good or healthy for them they are uh lactating 
human uh like we are and breathe air they don't have gills okay 
so when they go under they can hold their breath for long periods of time but they always come up 
they have a way of existing this way they eat fish they hunt fish and they're super 
intelligent beings they have sonar capabilities like dolphins and whales do 
they can image you by looking at you underwater uh they're psychic and their language is so complex 
it's almost impossible to learn it so i never really i listened to a few times they do the 
spread clicking and talking that way if i was brought up that way i might have learned it but 
i don't know if you can answer this but do they sleep in the water yes absolutely yes yeah 
you know a whale can sleep for two hours straight up and down in the water and they smell odds 
together they have the ability to lower their metabolism so do turtles so this any underwater 
air breathing creature and they have that ability do they have like webbed hands then yes 
they have webbed hands they have um extra like an appendage that webs out like this on their wrists 
so when they swish the water they really swish in the water they have a dorsal back there off their 
spine and where we would you know we have the tail thing going on they have another dorsal back there 
and they have them down by their ankles and their feet are wet as well and huge um have you ever seen the movie creature from the black lagoon do they look like that
a little bit but not quite they're grayish white color you know like a dolphin they're 
more whitish than grayish but yeah they have melanin in their skin and their heads are more 
you know grounded in the back they have a huge brain huge they have more than you know we have 
we have two hemispheres right we have an amygdala in the back they have two amygdala and uh two other hemispheres in the front they have four hemispheres they're big heads yeah 
got a couple of more types i want to talk about that i know you've encountered i do get a lot 
of um accounts i mean i get like three or four main types mostly people talking about grays 
certainly talk to me about uh human-looking et's the short blue beings uh many different types of 
humanoids but one i do get fairly regularly is uh the praying mantis type beings 
um who are usually described certainly to me as being very tall anywhere from six on the 
shorter end to double that nine feet i'd say is most common but up to 15 feet in a few accounts 
i'm gray gray sometimes green or white and usually very very intelligent and often described as 
watchers or people who don't don't direct something just bored and watch and super intelligent and i know you had an encounter with one of them uh right here on planet earth i wonder 
if you could just briefly describe that um i had a kidney transplant in 2016. it was in september 
and as i was recuperating i went to stay on a farm uh where my donor lived my kidney daughter 
were friends family friends and they had all gone off to go shopping and i was sitting in the living 
room and the front door was open but the glass you know the patio door to the front door was 
there it's all glass and i was talking to somebody on the phone i think it was you actually and uh
i'm looking across the field and there's a uh a big forest out there and and then there's 
some brush in the front and some down trees and stuff and i'm staring at it and i see the stump 
and i'm looking at the stump and i'm thinking what's moving something's moving over there now mind you i have really good eyesight i i can't see that's why i'm wearing glasses now i can't see 
from my hand to my face but i have 2010 vision and i can see way the heck over there and i'm staring 
at it and all of a sudden i realize it's moving and it's not anything i've ever seen in my life 
but when a cow won the sheep lamb nothing dear nope and i stood up and i walked to the door and 
i said i'll call you back i had a little motorola flip phone and uh i turned on the camera and i'm 
trying to use my my you know zoom which was almost non-existent on that phone to see it and i got it 
on camera so i could click click take pictures and i'm taking pictures of what i'm looking at 
and i see it above the stump i just see something above the stump and then it stood up and i went 
it was tall and i was like what am i looking at my brain would you know what am i looking at and i'm 
thinking oh my god oh my god and it it nodded at me and it turned and it started to walk away and 
i went on i went running out that door i'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt it's cold as what the wind is 
howling it's like icing out there and i chased it down and i could not catch it and all i got from 
it was we are the watchers i watch over you and it was gone it just took off like a bad at a boogie 
and i i was so did i mean i was like hurting because i just had a transplant trying to limp back to the house and i sat down and i replayed it in my brain to see what i was 
looking at it looked like a mantis a praying mantis you know it just didn't have the wings 
okay it had the hands you know the arms and the hands that went up like this and it was 
very you know agile with its wrists in its hands and it did extend somewhat and it had the longest 
freaking legs i've ever seen in my life and i'm not so sure it was exoskeletal though like a real 
prang mantis okay it had suppleness to it like it's actual skin on it and it was wearing a 
jumpsuit a long covered from the neck all the way down to its ankles so i didn't get 
perfect body detail so i'm not sure about that um it was cold outside and getting wetter and 
i'm sure it was protecting itself but it had the mantis head and the huge unbelievable manta size 
and the and the and the mouth you know and it didn't talk or open its mouth so i don't know 
about what was in there i didn't look just like a praying mantis to me and uh i have chum that one 
over my whole life ever since oh another one um yeah this is one of the things things i find so 
fascinating about you know contactees in general that they see such a wide variety of beings 
that's not true in every case but people who have extensive contact and you know are really gaining 
an awareness of it and becoming fully conscious i i guess like you've been able to do describe 
all different types of beings and i suspect this is because we've reached that level of 
telepathic ability or psychic ability where they you can communicate with them so they reach out 
to you and they're attracted to you i don't know very interesting to me that i'm among them quite 
a bit so i have more than ample opportunity to view or meet different you know uh people 
et's um going to mother ships a lot afford me that you know because they're constantly going back and 
forth and they move you know through on mother ships all right that brings me that's probably 
why last type of et i'd like to talk about which is kind of my favorite account because it's just 
we hear a lot of people talking about anunnaki and there's a lot of reference to them and ancient writings and such and egyptian hieroglyphics and these huge very tall winged 
beings so you had this really amazing encounter what we would term the anunnaki 
and this was such a fascinating account we did a big write-up on this in the book but i 
would love if you could just talk a little bit about that encounter because that's a 
amazing one um the first one i ever saw was very young probably seven six or seven and 
um i had been learning about them uh they're prevalent in our history this recent history 
and uh i had come up on deck of a mothership i was told to come and find mama she was up there 
she wanted me up there um i guarantee you that's why she wanted me to meet this being or see it 
and uh there are two standing there across the deck the deck on a mother ship is huge 
and i walked in the door and i was just amazed at what i saw uh they are very powerfully built big 
beings heavy okay on mothership on all craft that gravity is not as heavy as it is here that we have 
lighter gravity on board most of these beings are not used as heavy gravity as we have here 
and so he moved about elegantly freely he was animated and uh he had his hair was 
braided and plaited okay it was a plait it's not a regular braid it's a plait right it's like 
four and one i've done these braids and um he was wearing incredible uh 
he had a wrap around his waist it wasn't very high it was very short saw his knees he had boots on 
his feet a type of boot very soft leathery kind of boot and uh his chest was completely bare 
except for he had like a shawl on uh the front ways in other words went around his neck and it 
tied around the back of his waist so he's wearing a shawl in the front and uh but his wings were 
completely exposed and they're they're like this on his back okay i mean one went up this way one 
went up that way one went down that way and the other one went down that way and i'm staring at it and i'm thinking is that hair or are they feathers okay and i was staring and staring staring at me 
he looked over at me went you know like hey come on come on give it a try i was like okay 
i went running up to him and i just staring at his wings and i'm thinking that's either hair or wings 
and i i had to touch it i freaking had to touch it so i went like this i pet him i pet the wing okay 
just like this the one on this side you know this side this one i'm petting it and he shivered and 
i felt that ruffle and russell have you ever seen an egret ruffle its feathers that's what it's like 
okay he ruffled those feathers it's hairy feathers hairy hairy feathers they're densely packed and he 
ruffled him and i was like and i pet him again and he kind of enjoyed it i think he was letting 
me pet his feathers and and i was like oh my god and i stood back because i can hear mama stop now 
i did i realized that he had powerful back muscles unbelievably powerful back muscles he had powerful 
leg muscles and butt muscles i noticed that too and uh he had earrings he had five earrings in 
one ear and one earring and the other one i could see it from the back and uh i was like holy cow 
and um he spoke the same language as mama same language okay and i realized that there's 
something going on with that okay um and he spoke to me in that language i understood i was learning 
it then so i got most of what he said to me and he let me know that um uh said child to me said like 
please child or welcome child something to that effect and i was like i could think 
to say was honored i didn't know what the right response was so i just said honored okay and he 
turned back around and talked to the other one again i was dismissed okay and mom was like go 
like okay so i backed all the way out of there and i got out that was the most first time i'd 
ever really touched other than a gray okay and i won't forget that as long as i live i went through 
the rest of my life and still do a wish and i had wings like that but did they have you know 
legs and arms as well yes he had big powerful legs and beautiful arms and beautiful hands um 
i have really big hands i don't know if you can tell or not see the size of my head uh he had longer fingers than i would have but yeah they had giant beautiful you have big hands 
tall long hands uh oh my god it's beautiful yeah yeah there you go so um do they have their faces 
where they like beaked in um no uh the anunnaki have faces like us they're human looking okay 
now there are beings that are like raw that are bird-like okay the anunnaki are not birds they're 
depicted as birds sometimes but i think there's a confusion back then of who was who and what was what the anunnaki are uh uh looks sumerian to me okay i was confused about this so uh yeah they 
have human looking faces but there are bird-like beings as well are they are they winged yes also 
yes yeah not like the anunnaki it's a different type it's more like a um 
they have actual wings and i'm trying to think of what you could equate it to uh more like a huge 
they're more feathery than hairy wings okay and they only have two and they do go like 
this but yeah they're winged and they have uh you know all wings got to have the bottom part 
and it just comes straight down because the in the egyptian hieroglyphs i think you'll have to look 
look at them but i believe a lot of the what are termed anunnaki are certainly referred to as a rock show yeah there's two types there's the anunnaki and then there's the raw 
and uh they have a name but i'm not allowed to tell you it's just they're raw and they're very 
very very intelligent beings and they look like birds they're birds humanoid birds with arms and 
legs they eat everything yep and they're are they related to the what we call anunnaki um i don't 
know i think they're from near each other in this in that part of the galaxy where they're all from 
right so these are some of the many different types of et's you have met and 
when we were putting this book together i i put a whole chapter on this because i just think it's fascinating stuff i was originally going to call the book dolly among the stars which i think is 
quite descriptive we ended up using that for a chapter but uh you mentioned the title symmetry 
which i think really speaks to what we're talking about here today and that there's symmetry between all the beings live in this universe right we have that here 
if you think about it um we're we're all mostly human here okay we're all human this particular 
very specific narrow genotype right but among us are every other kind of animal that you could 
possibly imagine and they respond to us they hear us they know uh they're intelligent like we are 
and we can communicate with them if we want to um they're here to teach us we're here on this 
planet for a very specific reason and that's why we're supposed to be figuring things out 
right and so all these beings i mean we here on earth have some very violent tendencies and are not so spiritually evolved these are all beings who have moved beyond 
you know our our primitive thinking and behaviors we're not here to take wisdom 
knowledge and wisdom you attain the more ethically responsible you become become very mature and that level of maturity doesn't include acting out violently you're more 
capable of commanding your responses to everything and that's basically what you're 
supposed to be learning here about how you respond to everything not what everything is doing to you 
yeah this is why i wanted to do this episode to let people know that you know these are not aliens as we think of them they are us we are them we are all part of the same life that 
spread throughout the universe we're not hostile or here to take over or hurt anyone or scare them
i've written a lot about this and interviewed a lot of people who have had trauma and scary encounters and are somewhat fear-based in their thinking understandably because we're 
trained that way yeah i think that's what i really enjoy about your experiences and your you know 
take on all this is because you've you know being fully conscious and aware of what's going on and 
having so many interactions i think you've got a very comprehensive and accurate picture of what's out there as to a number of other people i've talked to but exactly 
the more conscious you are the more you realize all of this um i've uh and everybody that i 
experienced now throughout this journey of talking about things i've realized that there are people 
waking up everywhere all over this planet and their journey is literally progressing wildly 
quickly and they're all hearing hearing the truth and they're repeating it and that's very happy for 
me to hear that you know i get excited yeah i've spoken for about an hour which is perfect what 
i was kind of aiming for i really want to thank you but i wanted to give you the opportunity to 
give any closing comments or any you know think important information you feel people need to know 
about these different types of beings or anything you want to add that we haven't covered yes 
um it plays to what we experience here right now we have division among us on this planet we have 
actual uh thinking where if you're not the same or you're different there's something going on wrong 
and it's just not true we're all beings from the same place we all come from source they're all 
the same all of us and race is is a lie we are the same it doesn't matter what you look like we are 
all the same we are all the same ranks and uh e.t thinks that love will help you cancel that 
out learning to respect and love one another shows you the right way to see things as they really are 
and and that literally is is that just because of what you look like doesn't preclude you 
to think differently or be different that doesn't happen we're all the same we think 
the same we're all capable of the same things if you love one another through it that's awesome 
cool well i love that that's a great ending love is the answer that's what the betty andresen's contact quasiga said love is the answer for humankind 
all right well thanks dolly that's awesome i really want to again commend you and 
uh very impressed with your courage for coming forth and talking all about this i hope more 
people are inspired to do so because i know there's a lot of you out there uh so yeah thanks dolly i really appreciate it you're welcome it's an honor thank you all 
right until next time bye bye all right that's our show for today i hope you've enjoyed it we got to 
hear about many different types of beings i love dolly's story because she does not need hypnosis 
to recall all this she's not looking at it through the lens of fear i've interviewed many hundreds 
of people and i've shied away from hypnotic regression most of the people i've talked to have 
had you know fully conscious experiences but often there is missing time some people do have 
some fear but several also have had fully conscious contact and dolly's case is right there 
at the top of them it's again probably the most extensive case of ufo contact i've ever had the 
wonderful opportunity to research and investigate so i really want to thank you all for watching i hope you've enjoyed this show and 
learned something about the many ets that are visiting our planet in our relationship 
to them so thanks again for watching i truly appreciate it and until next time keep oh 
wait one more thing i did want to mention is that dolly's experiences are covered again in the book 
symmetry a true ufo adventure so if you want to learn more about what dolly's talking about 
it's all there in black and white and available on kindle in print and soon to be on audible 
so yeah again thank you for watching i truly appreciate it until next time keep having fun
