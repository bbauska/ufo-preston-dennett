<p><b>UFO and extraterrestrial encounters are known for their high levels of strangeness. Whether a sighting, a face-to-face encounter with ETs or an onboard experience, each case usually contains unique and unusual elements. Each case adds to our knowledge of alien contact. This article (and video) presents eight cases that illustrate the bizarre high-strangeness of UFO/ET encounters.</p>

<p><b>CASE ONE</b>: In <b>1976</b>, Kathleen Teti stepped outside her home in Norristown, PA to an incredible sight. A saucer-shaped craft hovered ten feet above her front yard. The dome atop the craft had huge windows, through which Kathleen could see two gray-type ETs. Even more strange, she saw two humans who had apparently been taken onboard. She was so close, she could see the consoles, chairs, and what appeared to be a red shag rug on the floor and walls!</p>

<p><b>CASE TWO</b>: In <b>May 1976</b>, Christina Bryant, her daughter and a friend drove late at night on a desert highway outside of Alamogordo, NM. After seeing weird lights overhead, they found themselves on a small dirt road confronted by a strange sight: a uniformed police officer with his cruiser partially overturned in a ditch. The next thing they knew, they were back on the highway missing hours of time. Later under hypnosis, Christina recalled that the policeman was actually an ET, and his cruiser was a landed craft. She and her daughter were both taken onboard.</p>

<p><b>CASE THREE</b>: On <b>Sep 9, 1976</b>, Bill and Lenda Pecha (and their children) were drawn out of their home in Colusa, CA by a huge craft with blazing bright lights drawing electricity out of the nearby powerlines, causing a power-failure. When the craft came over their house, Bill became alarmed; he could physically feel the electricity coming off the craft. The family ran to their car and drove off in a panic. The UFO chased them all the way to their friend’s house who also saw the object. Meanwhile, other witnesses in town observed the display. A weird after-effect is that the UFO caused a pear-tree which had already borne fruit to blossom again!</p>

<p><b>CASE FOUR</b>: Florida Malboeuf could hardly believe her eyes when, on <b>Jan 6, 1977</b>, she looked out her apartment window in downtown Montreal, Canada. A metallic, saucer-shaped craft was coming in for a landing on top of the roof of the building across the street. She watched in shock as two humanoids exited the craft and peered over the edge of the building. After the craft took off, her son went to investigate and found a circle of re-frozen ice on the building-top, along with odd child-sized footprints.</p>

<p><b>CASE FIVE</b>: On <b>Jun 27, 1977</b>, Edna Owens and her four children went shopping at the local market in the small town of Telford, TN. Returning home, they saw what appeared to be a shooting star. But then it began darting around and soon revealed itself to be a flying saucer. When the object came towards them, they fled into the house and turned off all the lights. The object hovered over the house and began circling it. Frightened, the family fled the house. The daughter got an electrical shock when she touched the car door. The family drove off and the object followed. The youngest daughter became so hysterical, she had to be hospitalized for a week.</p>

<p><b>CASE SIX</b>: On <b>Aug 6, 1977</b>, Tom Dawson of Pelham, GA left his trailer with his dogs to go fishing at the local pond. As soon as he arrived a saucer-shaped craft dropped from the sky and hovered just above the ground. Tom, his dog and a herd of nearby cattle became frozen to the spot. The craft disgorged a half-dozen short, bald, uniformed ETs who began to talk in a foreign language. Two approached Tom and conducted a weird physical exam. The case went from strange to bizarre when a voice came out of the craft, saying the name of a famous labor leader who had mysteriously disappeared a few years earlier.</p>

<p><b>CASE SEVEN</b>: On <b>Jan 3, 1979</b>, Meagan Quezet and her son Andre were drawn outside their home in Mindalore, Africa by the barking of their dog, Cheeky. Following him down the street, they came upon a landed craft. Out stepped several humanoid figures. They walked around the craft and appeared startled to see they were being observed. One approached Meagan and bowed in greeting. Meagan said, “Hello!”</p>

<p><b>CASE EIGHT</b>: In <b>mid-Jul 1988, witnesses at a wild animal reserve in Lugo, Spain were shocked to see a 250-foot-long craft with purple lights hover overhead. Without warning it sent down a beam of light onto a herd of elephants. To their absolute astonishment, 26 elephants rose up the beam of light and into the craft, which darted away.</p>

<p>The above cases show how truly strange and bizarre UFO encounters can be. They show that we are not alone in this universe, and that we still have much to learn not only about ourselves, but about the people we share this universe with. Earth is being visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrials. And the UFO contact experience is far more common than many people realize.</p>

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the 
Paranormal. Today's episode I call, "Beyond Bizarre: Eight Extraordinary Extraterrestrial Encounters". 
UFO encounters are known for their high levels of strangeness. But the cases I'd like to talk 
about today, I think, take this to a whole new level. I have eight cases and five of these 
involve humanoids. One involves an onboard encounter, three are sightings, yes, but they 
involve some very interesting physiological effects. And other details that you don't hear 
often. All of these cases have some unique and very unusual features that you don't hear a lot 
about. But I think provides some important insights into the nature of this phenomena. 
They come from all over the world; Europe, Africa, Canada, and all across the United States. 
And I think that they have some really interesting things to say about the UFO phenomenon. 
So, let's just get started. The first case I'd like to talk about today occurred in Norristown 
Pennsylvania in 1976 and the main witness her name is Kathleen tetty this is in North Eastern 
in Norristown Pennsylvania and I will just let Kathleen describe what happened in her own words 
as she says my husband had just pulled his car out of the driveway and I looked down thinking about 
doing my laundry then I looked up again and it was there just hovering at the edge of the drive 
now this was daytime and what she saw was a UFO a sort of flying saucer though 
more cigar shaped craft she says and I'll just quote her again as she says 
one whole piece with bubbled out windows from floor to ceiling from one side the ship appeared 
to be cigar shaped but I think if I could have seen all the way around it would have been round 
it's just hovered and never landed but if I had a six foot ladder I think I would have been able to 
climb on board there was no sound it had blue and white lights I couldn't believe what I was seeing 
so yeah this was broad daylight she was very very close close enough that she could easily 
see inside and inside she saw two aliens probably we would describe them as gray type but she also 
saw two human looking people a man and a woman and again I'll just quote her directly as Kathleen 
says there were two aliens they were about four feet tall with large heads and big round saucer 
eyes that were dark brown they had two holes for their noses they didn't have all the rest of the 
nose that we have they had a slit for a mouth but no lips they had very long fingers five on 
each hand but the third and fourth on each hand were longer than ours and they had pointy ears 
now according to Kathleen each of these et's wore a silver metallic gown which she said sort 
of rolled collars and cuffs and they were both completely bald now she couldn't tell whether 
they were men or woman but you could see the other two people and they looked totally human 
she said the woman looked quote like she was in a trance and kept looking in front of her 
she had on a printed dress with no sleeves had auburn hair and was very light complected 
the man had glasses a mustache and a cigar he wore a jacket with tiny checks a white shirt and a tie 
so she's watching this in stunned amazement right from her front doorway and as she's watching this object is just hovering there tilting from side to side and this allowed 
her to see into at least two or three of the ship's compartments and again as Kathleen says 
in her own words the first one consisted of white formica-like countertops with buttons on top each 
Button had hieroglyphics and the buttons were all different colors there were about three inches by 
two inches in size and were red blue purple orange green and pink there were two leatherback chairs 
with very high backs and there was a red shag rug on the floor and on the wall behind the chairs 
the compartment had an elevator door that opened to the side and had an arrow on it 
now the second compartment she said had four chairs situated in two rows close to 
the windows and kind of reminded her of the chairs you would see in a van 
now as Kathleen says regarding the ETS I could see no feet but the creatures floated and each had 
the woman under the arms to lift her up the man still proceeded to look out the windows and the 
lights were on and all three compartments inside so this went on for some time 10 or 15 minutes 
and this was when she realized that her nine-year-old son Paul was inside the living 
room so she called him outside and at that moment this object Rose jerkily she said it went over 
the water tower behind her house and left very quickly as Kathleen says I think the sound of 
my voice did it it just went whoop whoop whoop I ran to the back of the house but it was gone 
so she kept us quiet at first but was later interviewed by reporter Judy Baca of the north 
north town Times Herald and she admitted herself that her story was hard to believe but as she says 
it's part of History it's here and it happened I don't feel that it was a bad thing 
so she felt no fear at all at any point during this encounter but she did later get some confirmation of it she later learned that her older son had 
a friend who saw a UFO in or around the same area and she also learned that the daughter of 
a neighbor claimed that she saw a UFO in the same area at the same time that Kathleen did 
and so she later came forward Kathleen after reading a UFO article by Philadelphia writer 
Tom Cleary and he actually showed up at her house for a first to end interview and 
brought along with him UFO researcher David Jacobs PhD and they interviewed her together 
they asked her to draw what she had seen but she told them she couldn't as she says I told them I 
couldn't draw it but I would describe everything then they asked me to take a look at a book of 
pictures to see if anything looked familiar I was so amazed when I got to about the fourth page and 
saw the pictures they had in the book because of the creatures were what I had seen I told 
Dr Jacobs if he wanted to give me a lie detector test or some other kind of test I would be willing 
so after interviewing her Dr Jacobs was in fact convinced that she was telling the truth 
and I'll just quote him directly as David Jacobs says the key thing is to see does 
the report fit into the pattern of other reports another issue is The credibility of the witness 
tetty is not a lunatic or practical joker type this is not part of her personality 
this is something that happened once in her life it's not a pattern of events that she sees nightly 
she did not embellish or elaborate she is a good solid upstanding citizen not a 
person who is trying to make a buck off of it she's not telling it to gain fame or Fortune 
so you have to ask why in the world would someone bother to tell the story if it wasn't true 
so yes as you can see there are some very unusual elements to that case the fact that it occurred 
in broad daylight that the witness was literally only maybe 20 40 feet away from this object which 
itself was only about 10 feet high that you could see directly inside of it the strange things she 
saw inside this craft there's a lot that make this case very unusual and it's quite well verified 
having been investigated by David Jacobs and having there be other witnesses to UFO activity 
in that area at that time it's a great case and let's move on to our next one this case took place 
in New Mexico more specifically on a highway in Alamogordo New Mexico just south outside of 
Alamogordo and the main witness is 35 year old Christina Bryant Christina was driving along 
with her four-year-old daughter and a friend from Phoenix Arizona to Lubbock Texas when all three of 
them noticed a strange light in the star-filled sky now she wanted to keep her daughter amused 
so Christina sort of invented a game sort of talking to the lights and telling them to change 
colors to turn blue and red which to her surprise they did and this went on for about 45 seconds 
they would stop and the lights would go off next thing they know they had somehow left 
the main Highway finding themselves on a two-lane Back Road out in the boonies 
there was lots of wildlife around them they could see rabbits and deer appearing along the roadside 
and they came around a corner and this is when they saw something very unusual 
a police car with funny lights and what appeared to be a one car wreck this vehicle was tilted at 
a very steep angle and she said its battery was hanging oddly from the wrong side of the hood 
there was a policeman there he's carrying a flashlight and a clipboard but he seemed to be in parade uniform complete with braids and metals she felt was totally 
out of sync for a back Country Road and so she this officer actually reached out for her hand 
resting on the frame of the open window and Christina remembers a sudden chill going over 
her body as soon as he touched her and in fact it was so cold his touch that it scared her 
and she was also confused because there was no sign of any accident victim 
she remembers asking the officer about the wreck and he asked her if they had passed anyone 
so about 45 minutes down the road they turned onto a highway Junction truck stop and this is 
when they noticed that it was now 3 A.M and that they had were missing uh an hour or two or more 
so she continued her drive to Lubbock Texas and related the details to her mother 
who was surprised and actually produced a tabloid story with an article about a record number of UFO sightings apparently in the same area where Christina had been 
so she sat on this for years this was in May of 1976 but it wasn't until January of 1983 
before she's decided to do something to find out what happened during this missing time 
and doing some investigation she learned that people go under hypnosis to recover 
missing time and she decided to do this and under hypnosis a different scenario emerged Christina 
Bryant recalled that this quote policeman had opened the door and helped her out of her car 
he was holding her hand the whole time she said it was actually very nice very kind and gentle 
he looked like a normal guy five foot eleven about 170 180 pounds blonde hair blue eyes nice features 
but looking over at the police car she now saw that it wasn't the police car at all it was a UFO shaped kind of like a [ __ ] hat she says there was a little ladder 
and she followed the policeman up into this craft and she was motioned to a chair in front 
of a large window she saw what appeared to be numbers appearing across the top of the screen 
which she believed was some sort of directional finder with converging lines and the policeman 
she said became kind of playful pushing buttons that propelled them to fly against a rush of stars 
was very enjoyable as she says it was great I was fascinated I knew he was not going to hurt me 
so he told her that his name was Oran or Oran she's not sure but something along those lines and 
at this point the ship she thought was apparently an automatic pilot because he stopped piloting it 
and he led her to a doorway which she opened with a motion of his hand and this is when she 
became somewhat frightened because as she stepped through the door she saw another man and two women 
standing in front of a cabinet next to what looked like a operation table a surgical table 
she saw her daughter who was snugly asleep nearby on another table at this point that one of the 
women placed her hand protectively over the child she recalled seeing some other things 
such as white coats a round faced man of average height with no facial hair other figures girls 
with skin touch skin tight caps over their heads she said they all had very white Pasty complexions 
this point she said she was examined she saw one of the ETS holding a huge what looked like 
a syringe and a long silver cylinder with what looked kind of like a stethoscope like device 
she found herself being floated onto the table and she says the et's scraped her skin on her arm 
she saw them staring curiously at her stomach she says at one point they stuck an instrument like a 
needle into her back she said they took fluid from an eye and then apparently replaced it and while 
under hypnosis the hypnotist asked her to pay very close attention to the people who were examining 
her and this is when she got another flash of fear when she realized that these were not 
humans not people at all like she's used to she says she saw that they had very tight white flesh 
and who she thought were boys were not they were not quite human looking had a very small nose and 
mouth and huge large almond shaped eyes with tiny little mouths that didn't even look functional 
so it quite frightened her and that's basically what she recollected her Cates was investigated 
by Bob Morgan who at that time was head of mufan San Antonio Texas and he said I quote she's very 
sincere and you can tell she was awfully scared now she is a good witness she works for a major 
airline and really was reluctant to go public but thought it was important to do so and as she says 
I don't want to be called a crackpot I'm a level-headed fairly intelligent woman I don't want 
anyone saying oh There She Goes the crackpot I'd like to tell the whole world but I can't so that 
case is the one involving an onboard experience which I wanted to include because it involves a very strange screen memory I guess you would call it and it also I think is typical of many 
of these onboard cases which occur to people who are driving along a remote Highway late at night 
this does seem to be a pattern in a lot of these onboard cases and yeah some very unusual features to it let's move on to the next case I love this case it's 
quite involved it occurred in Colusa California on September 9 1976 and there are at least six or 
seven groups of Witnesses in three independent groups so very well verified the main witness 
is Bill pica he was watching TV at around 11 30 p.m at his home at 1650 Wilson Avenue in Colusa 
on the screen the television screen suddenly faded out the same time as air conditioner died 
he thought a circuit had been flipped in his Workshop outside his home and he went outside 
to check on it and this is when he felt all the hair on his body standing up from electricity 
so he's walking around in the dark and this static electric feeling started to get really strong 
and he thought it might be the underground cable but as he says the further I got past it I knew 
just about where the line was it was getting worse I mean it wasn't bad or nothing but it was getting 
heavier and looking up this is when he saw a very large object hovering over his house and barn 
as he says it wasn't making a sound and I couldn't believe what I was seeing and as I walked a little 
bit I took another few steps and then I was horrified I realized what I was looking at 
according to bill this object was about 50 feet above the ground very low he said the underside of the object looked almost like a glazed ceramic texture it had 
a round shape in the center and a translucent shaft of grayish white light coming out of it 
he also saw six wavy sort of lines or lights with what looked like Frayed Ends hanging vertically 
from the bottom of the craft and on either side there were two pincher-like appendages 
so the bottom yeah looked like white porcelain but he said it could have been metal with the light causing it to look sort of porcelain porcelain like and so he watched it for just 
a minute or two at which point this object started to slowly back off to the West 
and after it got about 150 feet away he said three or four things occurred at the same time 
first these cable-like things that were dangling from the bottom of it were pulled up inside of it 
disappearing the pincher-like things on either end swiveled upwards and inwards about halfway 
third two hatches on the south and north rims swung open and fourthly a spotlight came out 
of each opening so this quite alarmed him he ran into the house in a very excited state 
he looked out the dining room window and saw that this object was still backing off towards his neighbor's house he ran down the hallway and woke up his wife he wanted her to see this object 
so his wife her name is Linda she recalled him screaming at her get out of bed you gotta see this 
so she did she went up got out of bed down the hall meanwhile he went into the 
bedroom where his son Chris age 10 was sleeping she went into the dining room 
but from his son's bedroom window bill could now see two additional craft 
and these were hovering over the high tension electrical power lines not far away 
setting down beams of light that he believed were siphoning electricity off of the power lines 
he said the beams were bright blue and the whole area was completely lit up this point the UFO that 
was closest picked up speed and darted away over to the mountains in just a few seconds 
you could see the exact location because it was still sending down beams of light onto the ground 
he ran into the dining room and screamed at his wife Linda you don't know what I saw we have to get out of here it's Gonna Get Us 
now Linda thought her husband was flipping out because of overwork or exhaustion 
and as she says so I looked out the window again and it the UFO was starting to come 
towards us or I could see it getting bigger so this caused her husband Bill to completely panic 
and the UFO is getting closer it the beam that it was sending out had retracted now meanwhile 
there were other Witnesses a Miss Elaine McGowan was just a quarter mile away at 58 peock Street 
and she saw it too she says soon after I got in bed the electricity went off the fan went 
off in my room and I got up went to the living room and turned on the lamp the hurricane lamp 
and then I walked outside to see if anybody else's lights were out or if it was a fuse in the house 
so there was a huge power failure at this point point over the whole area 
and there was another witness Fred who was also watching this as he says 
so I went inside to get my big brother Mark I said come on outside Mark there's a UFO 
outside come on outside and watch it but he said he was too tired and went back to sleep 
so Fred went back outside to watch this UFO and as he said I made a Mad Dash back into 
the house to get my camera but I had no film in it so I went back outside and watched the UFO 
so meanwhile that back at the Pika House Bill Pica was becoming even more frightened 
and as Linda his wife says he was screaming at me again so I look up through the window and by this 
time this is when I see all the lights from the UFO on the Davis's house that's their neighbor 
well then with his screaming and what I saw up there I knew I better move to me I still didn't 
have any idea what I was looking at I really didn't know what I was looking at this light and 
it was scaring me but I could not imagine how come it was scaring bill so much more so she was more 
concerned about her husband's agitation than the actual UFO as she says Bill's screaming at me to 
get the kids out of the house and I was standing like I said trying to figure out why he was so 
upset and the minute I saw the Davis's place was lit up well that really scared me and I figured 
that between the state he was in and what I saw that light over there I'd better get moving like 
he told me to so I went down the hall and grabbed my daughter out of bed wrapped a blanket around 
her I just went right directly out the front door and into the pickup I guess when I went down the 
hallway bill must have followed me so yeah bill was in a complete Panic at this time uh he says 
and I quote what I seen what it was doing at Slim's house that's his neighbor I figured I 
didn't know what I figured I just figured that something drastic's happened to their house 
cause it was just glowing he says the two UFOs of other power lines suddenly shot into the sky in 
opposite directions and this scared him even more it says when it did this I was really petrified 
I told my wife we better leave so thinking that these UFOs were coming for him he grabbed a pair 
of pants and ran outside into the car he didn't bother to put on any shoes or shirt 
and as he says or his wife says he got to the front door and he screamed the power's on the 
TV's on they're gonna see us so she was already sitting in the car at this point 
he ran back inside and turned off the TV set and as he says the back of our house 
the windows were getting lighter and I knew it the UFO was coming closer and I was getting scared 
and as his wife says Linda he closed the front door in fact he slammed it I remember that 
on his way out to the pickup he was asking me if the key was in it I didn't even answer him 
he got in and he started it up so he's backing out and became alarmed that the UFO was going to see 
his lights on his car and he screamed out to her they're gonna see my lights my God they're gonna 
get us so we actually turned off the headlights turned off of his Street Wilson Avenue and started 
accelerating at very high speeds uh well over I think it was 90 miles per hour at one point 
uh Linda his wife yelled at him to turn on the headlights but he refused because 
he was afraid the UFO would see it it was a moonlit night so he could see to drive 
and he raced off and as they're leaving this object was apparently pacing their car 
this says I caught it out of the corner of my left eye was approaching us at a pretty 
fast rate but it wasn't catching up it was just staying there and his wife Linda says 
so we get down to the corner and he puts the brake on of course the brake lights come on and he starts screaming my God they're going to see us they're coming after us well I never did 
turn around and look because I still didn't know what was making my husband so hysterical 
so meanwhile there's other Witnesses about a quarter quarter mile away the mcgowans 
they saw this UFO and as Elaine McGowan says when we first saw it it was a bright 
white light and then when it started to move this is when I noticed the orange cast to it 
so yeah multiple people are watching all of this happen at this point lenda Pekka says regarding 
her husband he didn't even slow down for the railroad tracks I remember we sailed over them as 
we got to the tracks I remember him saying I gotta get to lesses I gotta get to lessison I remember 
thinking I don't know I'm still so confused because I don't know what's the matter with him 
well their friends Les and Gail arant lived at 8 46 13th Street not far away and this is 
really about 0.8 of a mile it takes them only a few minutes to get there and as Linda says 
so we come around this way and just directly into their driveway that's where he stops he jumped out 
of the pickup and left the door open and the next thing I know is he's beating on their door with 
both his fists screaming at them so yeah he is quite emotional about all this and at this point 
their neighbor Gail arant comes out and sees the UFO she noticed this power failure it was a really 
hot night and she noticed that her air conditioner had shut off and she thought that was strange she 
realized all the other lights were off and didn't think too much of it because once in a while they 
do have a blackout but she came out to the kitchen the dog was whining and she got a flashlight 
and this is when the electricity came on and her neighbor Bill Pekka was pounding on the front door 
as gay Laurent says at the time I got to the door he was pounding on it I opened it 
he was yelling at me to look up in the sky and when I looked up over in the West Was this 
large object with a very brilliant white light underneath you could see the outline of the top 
of it it was dark in the middle but you could see the outline and it reminded me of a saucer 
a cup and saucer but it was turned upside down and went from west to east bill and I were by 
ourselves on the porch now this object was close enough where they could hear a humming sound 
according to the mcgowans who were just a quarter mile away they said it was like a 
high turbine engine sound but there was like a whirling like a very high powered machine 
running at a very fast rate of speed so meanwhile the Iran's called the police 
and the police officers Bill Wheeler and Peter greevey showed up at the Iran's house 
and officer wheeler was surprised to see that bill Pica was so agitated and wasn't paying 
attention to him so he reached out on to touch his shoulder and this is when officer wheeler got a 
huge electric shock which quite surprised all of them it was quite obvious to everyone that bill 
is telling the truth because he was so emotional about it so Pika told them what had happened I 
explained it several times and this is when his wife Linda realized oh it's this UFO that is 
upsetting him so much he was so emotional that uh he couldn't drive she ended up driving home 
and it was later that day that they uh drove out to the power lines the ones that were 
glowing red when this UFO was over them they were expecting to find some Scorch marks or anything 
but they didn't see anything but there were other Witnesses investigators 
found several other Witnesses one strange thing was that the Neighbors at the Davis house 
so that their pear tree had bloomed about a week after the UFO sighting which was quite unusual 
because the fruit had already been picked but the tree was blooming again uh and this was verified 
by investigators who believe it might be related to this UFO sighting hard to say there was another 
witness who does not want to go public she just goes by Mrs S she decided to remain anonymous when 
this case was getting so much attention but it was investigated by the police department 
was investigated by people at the newspaper and later by professional UFO researchers 
so a quite well verified case and what I'd like to do is play a short audio clip of some of the 
witnesses first I'd like to play a clip from officer Peter greevy who came onto the scene 
and interviewed the main witness Bill pica UFO Reporting Center yes this is officer grevey with 
occlusive Police Department in Colusa California yes sir and we've just received two reports of 
UFOs and there were with one subject now and we figured it be easier if he could subscribe it to 
you or we've never called your number before so we really don't know what the procedure is on it but we just had a complete power outage in the county and when the fellow walked outside when 
he spotted that mess when this when another lady who was a reserve on our department also spotted it I say one party's with you right I'm calling from his home now and we thank you again very much 
for this and if we get any more information on it why we'll get back to you people and let you know okay and also the the power was out for uh three or four surrounding counties too that we monitor 
on the radio at the same time okay how long was that out you know I was out at my house for about 
five minutes went up five to one and came on about two minutes after because I was just getting ready to go to work for about seven minutes okay if you need anything else you can get a hold of 
us I guess yes sir we'll do okay and we thank you again here's another clip an audio clip of 
the main witness Bill Pica describing what he saw well I never used to believe in it but I do know 
um around one o'clock the power went off and I have power run for my shop to my 
house and I figured maybe a little fuse in there I've been watching television and I went outside very dark there's no lights anywhere and and this funny feeling like static 
electricity around me or something I don't know I couldn't figure out what was wrong I looked up behind the barn which is right behind my house and this giant object like an upside down cup 
was just there hovering not making a sound but weird looking lights 
and I ran back in the house to get my wife and it was already about like 5-10 miles away 
and it was coming back this time with three giant beams on the ground lighting up the whole surface of the ground and my neighbor has a crop Dustin outfit behind my field 
and uh it lit their their house up and it was shining these weird lights out like spotlights 
they went more not too far but they were quite apart far apart and uh it would come right for 
the house again so I grabbed my kids out of bed and we ran to the car and got in a pickup the damn thing followed it until we got to the cemetery and then I had to hit my brake light it was driving 
the lights to get over the hump and uh when I did that it took off like a flash off to Bill bright 
and went off towards the Sacramento area and there was more than one but I didn't have a chance to 
look at you and this one's too damn close you know yeah but it was hanging over the barn and it had this funny electricity stuff bothering you I mean it's like a like to get a tingle he was about 50 
feet and Counting the barn he was right above the bar uh well I would say within 100 feet from my 
house to the barn feet above it because at that point it was too many weird looking lights drawing 
your attention you didn't I just couldn't take time to look the whole thing that just scared me you know but I did look at it for a good two minutes I mean I stood there I was froze and it 
doesn't make a sound the years when it took off it looks like an upside down well I hate to say this 
but you know the movie they have on TV called the Invaders okay it looks identical to that 
but it didn't light the ground up on the barn until it took off over there and it stopped and it had Free Lights it lit up the ground under it in a huge big circle well this thinner one was a 
huge light that went straight down and then it had one out in front that went down on the ground with
the purples on the 2047 and it looked like it was shining lights red on those those Electrical uh 
of the transform and the lights was already out already old for the whole valley but it came 
when I called the wife of the window it was coming right at us again and it had these giant light but this time I only had one light there was a 
beam a huge big beam a big big couple 300 feet in diameter on the ground coming right at us 
and I panicked and grabbed the kids and we took off with no lights so I just fired it up and 
it's a Chevrolet you know it takes a little bit and I put it in reverse and backed out and after 
the backup lights come on and that scared me because I figured it's going to see us you know and it came right over Bailey Street which is next door neighbor to us and they are eucalyptus pretty 
tall and it just seems to know how to actively manipulate it you know on the ground maneuver 
and it doesn't make a sound that's what's weird we ran along the side of us within about 100 
yards from us and and I just made the turn on the main road and hit it towards town as fast as I 
could with no lights it was right there and I was getting pretty panicked and my wife was too but 
when I hit the railroad track there's quite a little hump over it and I put the brakes and the brake lights came on bright red and I figured oh Christ he's really going to find us now you know 
and uh it took off off behind us on the right of us and took off towards the Sacramento area and 
it just went away so fast you can't believe it can make any turns at once it turns soft blue I mean 
kind of a purplish blue when it took off when it takes off okay I seen a good look of it there at 
the barn right but the underneath got some weird looking things on it that's what startled me 
did it have any colored lights on it yes it's kind of a frosty light you know it's not 
they're just like a neon light right and there's a series of little teeny things that go through 
the light like like little neon two stars well see we have irrigation pumps on the canal oh 
yes and they're quite I don't know how many voltage but they're quite a bit and they're 
big huge Transformers so I don't know if it was just looking at them or if it's drawing energy from it looked like to me it's drawing something from them it was as big as around as my whole Barn 
and the barn is pretty old but it covered the whole top of it and the barn is probably like 
75 by Maybe 50. and it goes up pretty tall I didn't I call my neighbors because I was 
very worried about them when I got to town because it had to use right over their house and they own the airport and I called her and she said that they were asleep they didn't hear 
anything or nothing I told her it didn't make a sound and I didn't want to tell her that I was waking her up scaring her and she said she kind of believes in it too but she would keep an eye 
out do you said that there was more than one object yes there were three I I'm pretty sure 
there were three because there was the other two things going away is it coming towards us and that's when I figured holy hell's gonna break it with it I didn't you know I just 
was worried thick after it was there once that they was going to come back and get it okay now these the other two were they similar to the one by the barn they look like a smaller too small one 
okay what car were the lights on those they were they were uh uh they're a neon 
white neon light same same only they didn't have anything under them I couldn't see they 
would look like smaller ones I see the thing went away fast but they don't make no noise
I can't see where I've seen that big can't at least make something pretty interesting I think you'll agree and real quick here's one last little audio clip from another witness Elaine 
McGowan Elaine McGowan yes I'm calling for the UFO Reporting Center in Washington yes sir and 
we understand that you saw something in the sky last night yes sir I wonder if we could get a description of that there was no shakes whether we could see uh the uh it happened about oh I to one 
all the lights had gone out in town the street lights goes house-like and we walk out to the 
street to look up the street to see we could see any light further down and there was one big bright bite it looked like a street light was mounted up in the sky we watched it for 
approximately 10 to 15 minutes it was um Southwest of Colusa it was stationary for about 10 to 15 
minutes and then went in a northeasterly direction Northwestern Direction pardon me um for maybe oh a 
minute and then switch directions and went South East towards Sacramento the lights at that time 
came back on they were on for maybe a minute and a half and the object has disappeared and there was 
a world like a very very high powered motor would run a very fine Precision motor that would just 
have a hum to it yes you can hear this very very distinctly oh it was quite a ways away from us 
I you know uh it was the life that was hard to listen uh it was south of town I would say maybe 
a half a mile away from us would be at the closest point and it was still a very bright kind of a orange orange shade of light we could detect no shape except you know one circle of bright light 
yes now you say this was definitely circular then the light that we saw yeah just like somebody had 
a it'd be like an airplane landing in your yard the headlight of an airplane I see oh yeah but 
there was no Rays coming off of it I see uh when we first saw it it seemed to be oh maybe
200 feet in a year then as it was going in the north uh East pattern Northwest parent it went 
up you know as it was quite in other words it didn't go straight across the Horizon it went up on an angle yes and then when it finally shot the closest to us it was a lot higher oh maybe 
close to a half a mile up from us you know straight up in the sky and then it was going at a very rapid rate of speed
but when it started in motion uh and started from the Northeast and went to the south I 
mean to the Northwest to the southeast then it was very very pronounced okay we could hear it uh over the motor of pickup truck that had just driven by us 
well it was it did not stop after we heard the noise once we heard the noise it was a steady 
um it was like a almost like an airplane motor going you know but it had a much higher rate 
of speed even than what a jet would sound like okay now what about size can you compare that with anything all right standing on the ground and looking at it at a distance it looks like 
five street lights flopped together you know only one those Amber lights it wasn't Amber it 
was kind of a it was a white but it was we had like a pinkish cat or orangish cash to it I'm on the sheriff's department reserves and I sat there and looked at but if I tell them they'll 
think I'm an idiot believe it I have uh five sons that are always dreaming about them you know and 
uh they've been telling me Oh I saw this light and I saw that like well the one where was staring out there and yesterday was the 17th birthday and he was out of his mind look what I seen on my 
17th birthday you know so as far as it it seemed to like you know like I can't say that the light 
got any brighter or any dimmer it just kind of stayed at one um intensity okay now in your 
opinion was this thing under intelligent control definitely okay and your son also saw this yes sir
and that was the extent of the witnesses in our area right you know we sat there and watched 
it we didn't uh there was no one else around that time in the morning uh one pickup went by and then we were told today uh one of the police officers stopped by and visited 
with us and he said that there was four separate sightings before other individuals I reported it 
which made me feel better I think you'll agree that was one of the most dramatic sightings uh on record certainly involving so many witnesses a power outage 
the weird effects with the main witness feeling electrified actually shocking the police officer 
the fact that this craft was apparently siphoning electricity out of the power lines causing a power 
outage to me the most bizarre element is the fact that this pear tree which had already 
borne fruit started blooming again can't say for sure that this is a direct result of the 
UFO hovering over it but it certainly is unusual and having heard from the witnesses themselves 
in their own words I think it's a great case and definitely deserves a spot on this list 
so let's move to this next case which is equally bizarre this next case occurred in Canada this was 
in Montreal Canada more specifically at six four two zero cassgrain Street and the main 
witness is Miss Florida melbourf she's 58 years old and this sighting occurred on January 6 1977.
she suffers from insomnia because of a bronchial condition and it was around 1 30 a.m on January 
6th she was sitting by her window when she saw what she described as a big plate or a large 
oyster she estimates about 15 feet in diameter drifting in the sky and coming closer towards her 
she said it was silver gray and had lights on the base of it dazzling lights 
and as she watched it landed on the rooftop across the street only 60 feet away from her 
she could hardly believe what she was seeing she actually pinched herself and rubbed her eyes 
but yeah this object was there and she was watching it land on the actual Rooftop at 
which point two strange very thin beings quite tall about six feet five inches came outside of 
this craft he said they were dressed in a pale colored suit very tight no belts or markings 
and she said they looked very light as they seem to sort of bounce around or Glide very easily 
and as she washed they moved towards the edge of the roof looked down to the street look upwards into the sky and then they apparently went back in the craft because 
moments later it rose up again came to full View and ripped it off in a South Direction 
she said the whole incident from Landing to take off lasted no more than a minute it was really 
quite quick but it shook her up quite traumatized her she wasn't able to fall asleep and it was 
the next day that she told her 24 year old son Andre about the sighting and he didn't quite know 
what to make of it he thought she might have been the victim of a prank she was hesitant to call 
the police because she had no interest in flying saucers she said I didn't believe in it at all 
the event upset me so much that I would have much preferred never to have seen that 
but Andre her son could see that his mom was really agitated and that she had apparently 
undergone some kind of traumatic experience so he decided he was going to investigate 
he asked the neighbors none who had seen anything the night before he knew this building it was a vacant building and decided to go onto the rooftop but there was 
no way to get on top from the inside the only way to get to the top was through a fire escape 
so he made his way across this six foot wide Chasm using a ladder as sort of a makeshift Bridge 
and when he reached the rooftop it was pretty Amazed by what he saw there was a 20-foot wide circular sheet of ice covered by a thin layer of snow was obvious 
that some form of heat held melted the snow and the circle had subsequently frozen over 
and there was a two other sort of oval shaped ice patches a few feet away 
and smaller layers depressed in the center apparently what looked like footprints 
now uh seeing this he immediately called a newspaper to report what had happened 
and he also called Air Traffic Control nearby Doraville Airport 
and they were they told him that they would inform U.S NORAD headquarters both in Canada and the US 
and he was told that three other people had called to report a UFO in this area drifting 
over the nearby Rosemont subway station this was just moments after his mother's sighting 
so the next day newspaper reporters showed up including Gila La France they photographed The 
Landing site as you can see here her son called the police and two officers came to interview 
his mother and they conducted an unofficial investigation so this was published in the 
newspaper reports and created quite a scene a lot of attention and UFO researchers showed up to 
investigate they were also able to take photos of this Landing traces yeah it got a lot of attention 
so they walked up to the top of the building again and this is when they did find what they believed to be four peculiar footprints originating at the center of this ice mass and going towards 
the roof's Edge which is where Florida saw these beings so these imprints were quite unusual they 
showed that heel and toe marks of a boot but not like a normal boot these prints were only six inches long 1.7 inches wide so they couldn't have been made by an adult is also odd because it 
was very difficult to get to this rooftop and they don't think it could have been a child
so it was clear there was a weird connection here this was evidence of the humanoids that Florida 
malbuf had seen and it was clear that there was a heat Source just from this Landing Trace marks 
and also they found out that at the time she had her sighting the dog of a neighbor was howling in 
such a way that the animal's owner was unable to calm it down so yeah this was quite upsetting to 
her and all the attention afterwards and she said several times she wished she had never seen it 
I love that case although it does involve only one witness it's really unusual the fact that 
she saw this so closely right across the street and the fact that this craft actually landed 
on the roof of the building right next to her leaving Landing traces and footprints 
and it's very well investigated I think it's quite credible and unusual and just so bizarre but 
there's always more bizarre cases where that comes from and here's another one that's equally strange 
this next case is a bit briefer this occurred in Telford Tennessee a very small town 
it was on June 27 1977 Edna Owens and her four kids were returning home from having 
gone shopping when they saw what they first thought was a shooting star had just arrived home 
and as Edna Owens says it looked like a falling star but then it came down again 
and as they watched it hovered over a nearby Field about 500 feet from their house quite close 
and as Edna Owen says we got kind of scared and I said let's go to the house it started moving 
over to the house too so this is when they really got frightened because this object moved directly 
towards their house actually stopped and hovered over the pond between their house and their Barn 
this frightened them enough that they all rushed inside and turned off all the house lights 
and at this point this craft came directly over the house 
and as Ed Nolan says it was cloudy and dark outside but in two or three minutes the whole 
house lit up and I knew it was over the top of the house I was standing in the hall when the light 
started revolving around the house I could sense rather than see that something was over the house 
and they could see all the lights coming inside Through the Windows it lit up the whole interior 
and they could also hear it and it made a very strange sound as Edna says it's hard to describe was kind of crackling and popping like electricity I guess 
I kind of panicked then I told the kids we were getting out I told them not to look up or back 
her children one of them her name is Regina she's 16 years old she ran outside with her 
family to the car she said she was too scared to look up she just ran to the car and as she 
says I jerked open the car door and as I touched the handle I got a shock that really scared me 
so they all piled into the car and headed back into town 11 year old Donna Owen said 
it was over the house there were blue lights on it it was round and it followed us it was after us 
she screamed at her mom it's right behind us and on top of the car 
so this object left their house and followed them for a few miles until they reached the local store 
and as Edna Owens says it stopped about 200 feet away and stayed there for 10 minutes 
then it just disappeared it didn't go up it didn't go down it just vanished I know I sound crazy 
trying to explain this but what but I saw what I saw I never really believed in UFOs or took them 
seriously not until this happened to us a kind of sad endnote to this case is Donna Owens age 11 was 
so traumatized that she became uncontrollably hysterical she was unable to be calmed down and 
they actually had to hospitalize her she remained there for a full week before returning home I like 
that case because it involves four witnesses that had quite a strong emotional reaction 
what I found really interesting about that case was that one of the witnesses came out and touched the car and got a real bad shock I think that fits the pattern that we're seeing in some of 
these cases and what's also kind of interesting about that case is that one of the witnesses 
was so emotionally affected by it that she was hospitalized for a full week that's very unusual 
quite a dramatic case and here is another one that is probably the strangest of all of these on this 
list if it'll make up your own mind about that but I think you'll agree it's definitely bizarre this 
case is so weird August 6 1977 the main witness is a gentleman by the name of Tom Dawson 63 years old 
and he lived near Pelham Georgia this is about 20 miles north of Thomasville in Mitchell County 
uh it was around 10 30 a.m Tom who's a retired automobile salesman decided he was going to take 
a walk down to his favorite Pond to see how it looked for fishing that day and he brought his 
two dogs with him and just as he got inside the fence surrounding the pond he says a circular 
spaceship dropped down right in between the trees and hovered just a few feet above the ground 
and at this point he found himself his two dogs and 20 head of cattle all Frozen in place by what 
he believed was an unseen Force you described this craft as being about 10 to 15 feet high 
40 to 50 feet in diameter it had portholes all around it and a dome on top was totally silent 
but it was changing colors rapidly and as he watched a ramp came down and out stepped seven 
bald-headed white-skinned beings he said they were quote white is a flower sack they were quite 
short about five feet tall with pointed ears no visible necks small up to turn noses they looked 
basically human but look different it says there were five men and two women most of them were 
tight fitting one-piece suits but one male and one female wore nothing were absolutely naked 
they started talking in sort of a high pitched gibberish well she was not able to understand 
most of them started walking around those two of them stood by the hatch as if guarding it 
and a couple of others approached him and he was unable to move as they lifted up his shirt and 
pulled down his pants and conducted what he thought was a medical exam of some kind they 
placed a sort of skull cap like device over his head and a large hula hoop looking kind of device 
which was connected to a box and wires which they sort of passed up and down his midsection 
and here's where this case goes from bizarre to absolutely off the charts strange 
he heard a voice he says coming from this saucer saying three times the 
perfect English I am Jimmy Hoffa that was repeated three times it cut off at some point 
very strange at this point most of the figures returned to the craft except for two of the males 
who walked 10 feet away and appeared to have a conference between them he couldn't understand 
them he says their voices were very shrill and gibberish but at one point he thought 
he made out the word Jupiter uh he had the impression that they were debating whether 
or not to take him into the craft which quite frightened him uh he said they collected some 
leaves and stuff and we're about to go into the craft but one came over to him approached 
him and put his hand open Palm on Tom's chest and what he believes was a gesture of goodbye 
at this point they got on their craft it Rose slowly 75 feet upwards and darted off 
at this point Tom Dawson ran uphill was about 300 yards to the trailer where he lived 
and tried to calm down he couldn't as he later said I don't care what they say this is the truth 
as I know it I'm not crazy I wasn't drinking I've never had a mental condition this is the 
first time I've ever seen anything like this the whole time it happened my mind was alert I knew 
what was happening I have not doubted since that it happened I don't blame people who say I'm nuts 
I've heard stories like this before and I've said the same thing but I do know what happened there 
is no doubt in my mind that it did happen just as I've told it now he went directly to visit 
his neighbors Jimmy and Linda Colby pictured here they saw him directly after this incident 
and they could tell he was very upset as Linda Colby says he was in bad shape he couldn't talk 
at all I heard him coming and looked up to see him waving his arms and struggling for breath 
he was wheezing and rocking wild eyed he couldn't get his breath she later talked to reporters and 
told them oh it happened to him she said that he was a well-respected guy that described him as a 
good hard-working man not a boozer not a liar not prone to Wild Tales a good family man not rich but 
comfortable no reason to make up stories like this they were good friends they invited him over often 
helped him out with he helped them out with the garden so yeah they absolutely believe him but he 
was so upset they took him to the Mitchell County Hospital where the doctor also confirmed that 
Tom Dawson was very shook up both mentally and physically from his encounter with this UFO and 
its occupants he was treated for hysteria given a sedative to calm him down and later released 
Tom later said that he believed if he had been a younger man these et's would have taken him away 
but following this he remained very quiet about his encounter yeah I'm not sure what 
to make out of some of the elements of this case it's apparently quite credible the main witness 
Tom Dawson does have his neighbors who absolutely support him in his story and insist he's not lying 
the description of the ETS most of them walking around in suits but two not having any clothes 
on that's quite unusual I don't know what to make of the Jimmy Hoffa aspect of that case 
can make of it what you will this is what the witness reported hard to say but yeah a lot of really unusual elements to it and like other Witnesses he was 
so emotionally upset by it he had to be taken to the doctor a really remarkable case that I 
don't think is that well known but certainly deserves to be well known and now we move to 
another case and again it is just beyond bizarre this is the second to last case I'd like to cover 
and this occurred on January 3rd 1979 in an area known as mindalore Krueger's drop South Africa 
this was investigated by UFO researcher Cynthia Hind and it's an amazing case the main Witnesses 
Miss Megan quizet a housewife in her 30s she was sitting in her living room reading a book and 
she looked at the clock and saw that it was about 10 minutes to midnight and at this point her son 
Andre came into the living room and said that he was unable to sleep and did she want a cup of tea 
so she agreed and it was then that they heard their dog cheeky barking outside their dog 
cheeky had recently been hit by a passing car and had been badly injured and had only recently 
been nursed back to health so Megan was pretty concerned about him and watching him closely 
so when he started barking she went outside to call him and she realized that he had somehow 
gotten outside of the gates and that he was probably going to bark and disturb the neighbors 
she went to the front gate calling for him by this time cheeky had gone up the road so cheeky liked 
Andre better than her so Megan called out her son Andre to help get cheeky back into the garage 
he wanted her him to go find the dog now they lived at number 14 Saul Jacobs Street pictured 
here and about Midway up the street at the top of it there's a t-junction and a road there called 
Tyndall Road just beyond that a few feet away is another road that runs parallel to the road 
and it was newly made at the time and uh this is where they saw the dog running 
towards still barking frantically together with all the neighborhood dogs who were also barking 
and this is when Megan saw a bright pink light at the top of the road and said to her son 
Andre look they've got lights on that road up there and her son said no or there aren't any 
lights up there Mom and she said well then what's that very odd looking thing there 
and she pointed towards this pink glow that you can see just above the road and her first thought 
was that it was some sort of small plane that had come down on the road and this is what she told 
her son so worried about this they quickly started walking up to the road to this T intersection 
and she could think of no other explanation for this bright light other than perhaps a plane 
or maybe it was a police car but you couldn't hear anything and there was no siren going off 
so it was starting to look more and more strange and as they got closer they could see that this 
wasn't a plane and it wasn't a police car it looked odd now she's a former nurse and she 
thought if there was a plane accident she would be able to help but as she got closer she could 
see that this was an object encased by a very bright absolutely pink light it completely 
surrounded the craft she couldn't see any actual light it was just the whole thing glowing 
and as they walked up right close to it they could see that this thing was right on the road 
it was egg shaped from the top down and supported by four spider-like legs not very thick with a pad 
at the end of each leg each leg was about three and a half feet high she estimates 
and she estimates the craft itself was about 12 feet high and maybe 15 feet wide 
she felt no fear at this time she thought maybe it was some kind of government experimental craft 
and she stood there her and Andre speaking quietly together discussing what this might be and uh 
at this point as they're watching five or six men stepped out of the craft onto the ground 
and two remained near the craft and two others came close to where they were standing 
and they started talking and what she said was mono syllables the one that was talking at a 
very high pitched voice and you said the words sound a kind of sing-song she could not hear the 
actual words just the sound of it and Andre the sun saw one of the men on the far side bend down 
and start picking up sand from the Sandy bit off the edge of the road and they were talking 
and as she saw this man lifting the sand and letting it trickle down through his fingers 
Megan actually saw them bend down and touch the road and she says she could hear them talking 
she did not understand this language but it was kind of close to Chinese and very high pitched 
she couldn't see their faces very clearly but she says they were all dressed in overalls 
with only their faces showing except for two of them who had their heads uncovered 
and one of these two guys who are close to them approached uh he was one who had 
his head uncovered and according to Megan and Andre he had thick dark curly hair and a beard 
and uh suddenly they appear to be surprised to see that they were being observed these uh UFO 
occupants and seeing Megan and Andre they took a step back now Megan is five and a half feet tall 
and she said that these guys were shorter probably about five feet tall very slender 
uh the soup covered them from head to toe so she couldn't see any of their muscles or structure 
but she says the suit went right over their feet all the way up to their heads only their faces 
were visible she thinks the color of their suit was white Andre thought it was pink but she thinks 
no that was just the light from the UFO the craft itself looked sort of metallic lead it had no 
Contours to it no fins just totally smooth Megan realized at this point that the bearded man was 
looking directly at her and still looking at her he bowed low to the waist and it said something 
that Megan thought was a greeting of some sort and all this time his eyes never left her her son 
Andre said in a quote the man said something with three syllables in it I heard it quite clearly 
so Megan was impressed and she said a soft hello and laughed nervously and this man with the beard 
who she presumed was in charge she said he had ordinary black hair he was very dark-skinned 
Middle Eastern looking she thought sort of olive colored skin she couldn't tell the color of their 
eyes but she had the impression that his eyes were different kind of translucent almost looking 
so he bowed and greeted her and she just stared back and this is when she realized 
that something was not right this was not normal and she turned to her son Andre 
go and get Daddy and run please run so Andre realized that this was very unusual he ran he 
became frightened too and ran away he'd never expect to see anything like this 
and the next thing she knew these guys were jumping back into their craft 
she said they did it very easily and was floating up into it look the hatch to this craft closed 
and within seconds she heard this loud buzzing noise she said it was like quote bees in a hive 
suddenly the legs elongated to about three times their length the legs came from the 
bottom of the craft and elongated to the size of the craft itself in the meantime Andre who 
had been running away stopped when he heard this buzzing noise Megan herself stepped back she was 
a little bit afraid not knowing what was going to happen next or whether to run or not this point 
the object went upwards went slightly to the left the legs started telescoping back into the craft 
the craft hovered for a second or two and then shot off into the sky very quickly straight up 
into the clouds and was disappeared in about 30 seconds though she could see this pink color from 
the craft Illuminating the clouds for a little bit while longer after the craft itself was invisible 
she estimates the whole episode lasted about 10 minutes though she says it seemed much longer 
after it had gone they returned to the actual site and didn't see anything on the tarmac no 
marks or anything were found they did report it to investigators there was one who was skeptical 
but the rest of the team felt that these people were telling the truth and interestingly there 
was another sighting on that day at 11 50 p.m in the same general area this is in mindalore again 
and the second case involved apparently a missing time 
abduction a man and woman were driving in foggy conditions near a mine when they described seeing 
a gray cone-shaped craft with four legs and experienced a 20 minute lapse of time 
and they also recalled seeing humanoids I really like that case because it shows what often happens 
a witness is drawn outside by their dog barking in this case it was their dog cheeky their cheeky 
little dog cheeky who drew them outside and they ended up having a real close-up encounter with a 
landed UFO and occupants who were human-looking I like this case because it does have two witnesses 
a mother and daughter it's quite long lasting they were right up close to this object so there's no 
chances of misperception and the et's being very much human looking though not quite fully human 
it's an extraordinary case on many levels now let's move to one more case here's our last case 
this occurred in mid-july of 1988 at a Wildlife Reserve in Lugo this is near Galicia Spain 
and I got this case actually from two news clippings from England one of which 
was provided by English researcher Timothy good and yeah this case does sound bizarre and it is 
but it's apparently a serious report and was investigated by a team of researchers including Spanish researcher Jose Diaz Salazar of Madrid and Rex duta from England 
and yeah it was around mid-july in 1988 broad daylight at a Wildlife Game Reserve in Lugo I 
could not find the exact Wildlife Reserve spot but this area according to Witnesses was visited by a 
UFO which was described as about 250 feet long shaped like an upturned bowl with purple lights 
and according to eyewitnesses it sent down a beam of orange light over a herd of elephants 
and as they watched according to the report 26 elephants were pulled up in the beam of light 
and into the craft now one of the witnesses did give her name her name is Imelda Gil casares and 
she told Jose Diaz Salazar that she was driving through the reserve with her children when this 
incident took place she and her children watch the entire incident and as she says and I quote 
I thought it was some kind of staged managed stunt at first when I first saw the spaceship 
but when all those elephants went up into the air into the UFO I became frightened the children were 
screaming and laughing but I was speechless and according to her this episode lasted only about 
two minutes and according to researcher Jose Diaz Salazar who interviewed her he says it's one of 
many incidents involving more than 200 animals from various zoos and Safari Parks all over the 
world and he says the past six months and that governments are aware of it and researcher Rex 
duta looked into the case and he says after investigating this sighting and convinced it 
did happen this sort of thing isn't new it's been going on for many years space people are taking 
us and our animals and adapting them so that they will be able to survive in the future and I agree 
with most of that there are a lot of cases I've investigated some myself where animals are taken 
up into craft and apparently not returned rabbits deer crocodiles elk there's many cases like this 
now there was of course some Skeptics who pointed out that this craft was only 250 feet wide and 
how could 26 elephants fit inside this craft and researcher Rex duta pointed out correctly that the 
interior of UFOs are often described as being much larger on the inside than they appear on 
the outside and he also pointed out that ETS do have the ability to shrink objects which again I 
agree with because I investigated that myself it does happen so true or not this case does fit in 
with many other similar reports of animals being taken but yeah it's very bizarre you can make of 
it what you will yeah that's the last case and I think probably the most bizarre of the bunch 
you can make of it what you will I considered not including it except for the fact that there 
is a first-hand witness quoted and there it was apparently investigated and it's not the only 
case involving animals being taken on board a UFO I've documented many others this is the first one 
involving elephants so I don't know but absolutely fits the pattern we do see in other cases 
so those are the eight cases I wanted to talk about today and I think you'll agree these are 
all Beyond bizarre do have some very strange and unusual elements and in some cases utterly 
unique but they do for the most part follow the patterns we see in many many other cases 
and really each time you hear these cases you have to remember this is only the tip of the iceberg 
the vast majority of people do not report their encounters and that's especially true if they 
contain bizarre elements so I have to give kudos to each of the witnesses who did come forward and 
spoke about their encounters because that does take a lot of Courage so that's our episode 
today I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep 
searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye now.
