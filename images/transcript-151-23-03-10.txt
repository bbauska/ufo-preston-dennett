UFOS OVER AIRPORTS: SIGHTINGS, LANDINGS AND HUMANOIDS
Mar 10, 2023

Summary:
Mar 10, 2023
Did you know that airports are a powerful magnet for UFO activity? There are dozens of cases coming from across world, reaching all the way back to the late 1940s and continuing up to the present day. These are not just sightings; many involve UFO landings and humanoids of all types. These cases represent outstanding evidence of the reality of UFOs and the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. Many of these cases are widely viewed by professional observers, pilots, meteorologists, air-traffic controllers and more. Some involve physical landing traces. Some are confirmed by radar. And quite a few involve actual photographs of the craft.

It might seem surprising that UFOs would be attracted to a location that is not only crowded with people, but also contains radar arrays designed to detect incoming aircraft. On the other hand, these cases also have a certain level of logic to them. Airports are designed for aircraft to both land and take off. So, in a way, it’s fittingly appropriate that UFOs should be attracted to them. And as these cases show, they are, and in large numbers.

Mar 10, 1948: Chihuahua Airport in Mexico is visited by a hovering disc. A few days later, on Mar 10, four discs appear over Central Airport in Mexico City in view of hundreds of witnesses.

Apr 7, 1950: Multiple witnesses at Logan Airport in Boston, MA view a dramatic UFO display.

Apr 12, 1950: Serviceman B.G. Hunter observes an object land on the tarmac at Tradewinds Airport in Amarillo, TX. After staying for five minutes, the object departs, leaving burn marks.

Apr 16, 1950: a 6-foot-wide metallic disc is seen by multiple observers to crash on the runway at Laredo Airport, TX. A short humanoid exits and collapses on the ground.

Jul 1950: Claude Blondeau is at Guyancourt Airport in Yvelines, France when two discs land on the runway. Doors open and out step two human-looking ETs.

Aug 1950: Multiple witnesses at the Medford Airport in OR observe four metallic discs circle overhead for three hours.

Aug 27, 1952: A disc-shaped craft hovers over MacDonald Airport in Manitoba, Canada. When struck the light from the rotating beacon, the object darts away.

Oct 27, 1952: An object lands at Marignane Airport in France. Two years later, on Jan 4, 1954, another object lands at the same exact airport.

Sep 4, 1954: A UFO lands at the Santa Maria Airport in Azores. After landing, a blond human-looking ET exits the craft and approaches the airport guard.

Nov 25, 1954: Two objects hover for two hours over the airport in Cordoba, Argentina.

1954: A UFO with humanoid figures visible through the port-holes hovers over Bankstown Airport in New South Wales, Australia.

Mar 1955: More than 100 people observe two UFOs hover at 8500 feet over Quito Airport in Ecuador. Two months later, another display involving five UFOs occurs over Pisco Airport in Lima, Peru.

Nov 1955: A group of saucers descends to 1500 feet over Tejgaon Airport in Bangladesh.

Feb 25, 1969: Witnesses at London Airport over an unknown glowing object hover a mere 200 feet above the runway.

June 19, 1961: An airport in Exeter England hovers for more than an hour, appearing on radar and viewed by many witnesses.

Aug 2, 1962: Airport officials at Liberal Airport in KS are shaken when four multicolored objects descend over the airport, hover and send down beams of light.

Aug 2, 1962: The Cumba Punta Airport in Argentina receives international attention when a UFO hovers only a few feet over the runway.

Dec 22, 1962: A UFO lands directly on the runway at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina and is viewed by tower personnel and pilots.

Jul 15, 1965: Controllers, pilots and employees at Canberra Airport in Australia are stunned by the appearance of UFOs hovering 5000 feet overhead.

Jul 28, 1965. Grano de Oro Airport at Maracaibo, Venezuela is visited by three luminous discs which are tracked on radar.

Oct 6, 1965: An AF sergeant at Concepcion Airport in Hualpencillo, Chile sees a 90-foot-wide saucer land at the end of the runway. Shortly later, three ETs exit the craft.

Aug 26, 1967: Esteban Cova is at the Maiquetia Airport in Venezuela when he is approached by a 3-foot-tall figure with huge eyes who asks him, “Won’t you come with us? We need one more.”

These are just a few of the many incredible airport-UFO encounters all over the world. Among the most dramatic is the 2006 incident at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. So many cases! The question is why? Are they putting on displays? Are they checking up on our technology? Are they preparing for a worldwide landing? Many questions remain.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
Got a great episode for you today, I hope. I call this one, "UFOs Over Airports: Sightings, Landings and 
Humanoids". I first became interested in UFOs over airports when I found out that LAX (Los Angeles 
International Airport) had many many sightings and I did cover that in another book and in fact I did 
a YouTube episode about the sightings at LAX 
but at that time I did not realize that UFOs and airports had a strong connection but they do 
and I came to realize that after the very famous Chicago O'Hare Airport sightings in 2006. 
and when that happened I decided to take a deeper look into cases and see if there were others because I had heard of some over the years and boy was I shocked when I found out that 
airports all over the world are being visited and again it's not just simple sightings but a 
surprisingly large number of cases involving Landings and humanoids this is definitely a 
thing something very profound is happening here so that's why I wanted to do this episode for 
you today I want to take you on a little Journey Through Time starting with the Modern Age of UFOs 
in the late 1940s all the way up to pretty much the present day I have about let's see 40 cases 
of UFOs over airports that I'd like to present to you and yeah they're really astonishing I think 
you're going to be surprised how many cases there are how widespread this is and how many 
cases involved not just sightings but Landings and humanoids so let's just get started the first case 
I'd like to cover took place at Chihuahua Airport in Mexico and this was an early March of 1948 
right after the very beginning of the Modern Age of UFO encounters and at in that month Mexico is 
treated to a series of airport UFO encounters that were actually witnessed by thousands of people 
was the first week of March when about 20 Military Officers and Airport employees at Chihuahua 
Airport observed a pale cream-colored disc hover over the airport for about three minutes 
they sent fighter planes to intercept the object which promptly raced off to the Northeast 
but a flurry of sightings was reported over the next few days all across Mexico and then on March 
10 four discs hovered directly over the central airport in Mexico City in full view of several 
hundred Witnesses and in fact whether observers used theodolites to observe the object which were 
described as tiny white Globes now a theodolite is a telescope which is attached to sort of a compass 
and protractor to allow observers to estimate the altitude of an object and its size and 
triangulate its position so yeah this was very carefully observed and over the next four days 
these objects continued to appear over the airport sometimes hovering sometimes darting around and 
in fact they appeared so regularly that people actually gathered at the airport to watch them 
and this is how it all began and year after year airports all over the world were visited and in 
fact it was just two years later when the Logan International Airport in Boston Massachusetts 
had a very dramatic UFO display it was at 9 55 pm on April 7 1950 
when three air traffic controllers in cluding a lieutenant colonel in the era 
National Guard were on duty at the tower at Logan International when they saw this 
mysterious light swooped down over the airport and begin performing quote unorthodox maneuvers 
it would change in color from deep blue to a pure white and then back to a cherry red 
and it wasn't a balloon or anything because not only did it have lights but this object moved against the prevailing winds and then at one point split up into two separate objects 
now the controllers did view these UFOs using binoculars and they could see what they believed 
to be a solid Mass within the glowing lights and in fact as one of the witnesses says 
for obvious reasons no formal report of this incident was made to any source 
with so many reports rampantly developing from irresponsible or hysterical sources 
one hesitates to solicit ridicule but view of the close similarity of what I witnessed 
I feel it incumbent to submit this report in spite of this risk so even at that time 
there was a heavy duty cover-up being put into place which was preventing people from 
stepping forward and allowing their names to be used or even reporting these sightings at all 
it's one reason why I think there are so many other cases that we don't even hear of and here's 
a very interesting case and this one occurred at the Tradewinds airport in Amarillo Texas 
this was on April 12 1950 only a few weeks later after the above report 
the main witness was a serviceman whose name was b g Hunter and his testimony was of extreme interest 
to o s i agents office of special investigations and according to Mr Hunter he was on the airport 
grounds when a glowing object approached about 500 feet overhead and began circling the Airfield 
this point started getting lower and lower and he switched on the airport floodlights at which point this object actually landed on the runway about 300 feet from the main hangar 
and I'll just let Mr Hunter describe what happened next as he says it appeared to be flat 
on the bottom but otherwise elliptical in shape with a sharp cut off towards the rear it had a 
bubble sitting forward on top of the object which appeared to be about the size of a football helmet 
so this object was small he said estimates about eight feet wide and three feet high and 
was emitting a lot of heat and in fact the grass beneath this object actually began to smolder 
so Hunter decided to wake up another employee back in the hangar but strangely this man would 
not wake up so Hunter ran back outside and this object was still there landed on the field where 
it remained for the next five minutes or so and as Mr Hunter says while watching the object it 
suddenly raised a whining sound Was Heard accompanied by white Flames approximately 
three feet in length shooting from the rear after reaching a level of four feet it then took off in 
a southeasterly Direction with a terrific Roar and with a sudden burst of speed it was lost to sight 
after taking off I noticed the grass where the object had been sitting was still burning so yeah 
this is a good Landing case with Landing traces and one of many cases involving actual Landings 
and here's another case which I'm guessing you haven't heard of before and this involves not 
only a landing but a humanoid and this is one of the strangest of all UFO airport encounters and 
as near as I could trace it it first appeared the account of it appeared in the LA Aura which is a 
prominent and popular newspaper in Quito Ecuador though is also published in the United States 
this incident took place on April 16 1950 so that's just four days after the above case 
and this was at the Laredo airport in Texas the Laredo Airport so in the days prior to 
this numerous reports were coming in from both the U.S and Mexican sides of the Border then 
on April 16 a disc was seen buzzing the Laredo Airfield at a several thousand miles per hour 
according to the witnesses it circled the airport six or seven times slowed down 
and came lower and lower until suddenly it apparently crash landed on the runway itself 
firemen police airport Personnel rushed to the scene where they found this six foot wide crumpled 
disc and as they approached a two foot tall humanoid dressed in a silvery jumpsuit actually 
shot at them with some kind of weapon which didn't really hurt the witnesses but stunned them 
afterwards they approached the disk and found that this little man had lost consciousness 
they took this weapon and pulled the man from the disc and to their surprise despite the fact this 
little figure was only two feet in height they estimate he weighed about 300 pounds 
one of the firemen placed an oxygen mask over the little man which appeared to revive him and he 
jumped up and actually Struck One of the witnesses National Guard Sergeant Joe Gina knocking him down 
and everyone jumped back and watched as this short figure gasp for a breath and again fell 
unconscious so they revived him again at which point he again fought as Rescuers 
he ended up passing out twice more so meanwhile they were looking at this little disc and it had 
very little equipment inside but appeared to have jet-like openings surrounding the rim of The Craft 
reportedly this case was reported to the FBI and the disc and pilot were scooped up and 
transported to Washington D.C and that's the last of it so this story remains unverified 
but neither has it been disproven and given that there are so many cases like this I definitely 
wonder about it because here is another case this took place about three months later again in 1950 
and this involved humanoids and this took place at the gaian court airport and Evelyn France 
now this was investigated by UFO researcher Jimmy JIA and according to Gia at around 11 pm 
Air Force airport airport worker Claude Blondo was walking on the Airfield when 
he heard a strange whistling sound I'm looking for the source of the noise he saw two circular 
craft landed on the tarmac about 300 feet away another Landing case and it goes on from there 
there were these two craft which he estimates were about 16 feet in diameter and four and a half feet 
tall you can see small windows or portholes lining the circumference at this point an oval 
door opened on each craft and outstepped two humanoids they looked very much human 
each of them was about five and a half feet tall with brown hair and they were wearing either brown 
or Blue flight suits and they appeared to be repairing rod-like devices outside of The Craft 
so the main witness Claude Blondo says he felt some fear but approached the witnesses and asked 
if they were having any problems with their craft and the being seemed surprised to see 
him and replied in his native tongue in French yes but it will soon be all right 
and after about a minute they re-entered The Craft both the craft lit up inside at which point Claude 
Blondo was able to see what he described as a red dentist-like chair in the center 
and what appeared to be perhaps a control panel with weird knobs and stuff 
and what looked like an odd steering type device so the doors to the craft were still open at this 
point and he inquired about these devices and one of the beings replied saying only one word quote 
power so at this point the door is closed both craft began to Glow around the edges they rose 
up assumed a vertical position and whooshed away at high speed so I think that's an important note 
that they turned vertical because this is what we see in a lot of genuine UFO cases 
the year of 1950 was a big one for airport encounters the next one occurred in August 
and this was at the Medford Airport in Oregon airport employee Dennis bratner was talking 
with the airport manager Johnny Applegate when the traffic controller exited the tower he approached 
both bratner and Applegate and pointed upward and said look look at those things up in the sky 
so Dennis bratner is the one who reported this case and as he says we looked sure enough there 
were three things in the sky they were like shining silver discs in the bright Sun very 
high and seemed quite tiny they went around and around in a great circle and just about evenly 
spaced as to the distance between them their speed was relatively slow perhaps 100 150 miles an hour 
there appeared to be almost circling lazily our puzzlement Grille what were they were we really 
seeing flying saucers the only thing we agreed upon was that we were actually seeing something 
so they called out to the several other people there which included two airplane mechanics two 
pilots a group of passengers a travel agent and the airport meteorologist and for the next hour 
which is a long time everyone stared Upward at these four discs which continued to Circle 
overhead right over the airport so although these objects remained in view after several minutes 
of watching them the witnesses began to slowly disperse they became bored with watching these 
and Dennis bratner had to work on filling up a gas tank on a plane 
so he did that and afterward he looked back up and these objects were still there and 
as he says and I quote then I went into the airport snack shop for a sandwich and a Coke 
when I came out I again looked up the things were still there circling circling forever circling 
they had been there for at least three hours finally and without warning the objects 
departed as he says as I watched the things suddenly broke out of their circling formation 
they formed a line of three in tandem they picked up speed tremendously and went off in a 
southeasterly direction toward Nevada in a matter of less than a minute they disappeared from sight 
so these appear to be classic UFOs judging from the way they moved or certainly not balloons 
and uh definitely targeted this airport for three hours a very long time 
the next airport case that I could find occurred at the McDonald airport in Manitoba Canada 
and this is actually released from the official documents from project project magnet which is 
a Canadian government UFO study this case took place on August 27 1952. and as the project magnet 
report on the case reads a disc shaped object with shadows on it as if it had an irregular 
surface was seen by two meteorological officers at 4 45 a.m at McDonald Airport 
the object made two turns about the field and when struck by the light from the rotating Beacon made off towards the Northeast and was out of sight within a second 
there was no sound whatsoever the object glinted like shiny aluminum when the beacon Struck it 
so another very interesting case involving the classic observables that we see from genuine UFOs 
and again all over the world here's another case which took place at the marignon airport in France 
this is a very interesting case this occurred only two months later on October 27 1952 at 203 am 
the main witness is customs officer Gabriel goshinard 
and he observed a cigar-shaped Object Land briefly on the Airfield about 100 meters away 
he said it made a dull sound so the object was dark in color with four bright windows 
and he ran towards this object at which point it released a shower of bright Sparks and 
took off with a swishing noise and what's really interesting is it was just two years later January 
4 1954 when the same or similar object we turned to this same exact Airport it was at 9 00 pm at 
night on this occasion a round luminous machine coming from the south landed again on the Airfield 
the main witness in this case was monsieur chesna he's an airport fireman and he watched as the 
subject land and he immediately telephoned the control tower at which point this object took off 
and in confirmation of this report later that evening a nearby resident reported 
seeing a large reddish fiery orb overhead and the next morning the runway was inspected where 
the craft had landed and allegedly there were a few pieces of metallic debris found 
though there's no word on what this debris was or what became of it but it's another amazing case of 
a UFO landing at an airport it's amazing how many cases there are that same year September 4 1954. 
when there was another amazing UFO incident this occurred at the Santa Maria airport in the Azores 
this was at 9 45 pm an airport guard by the name of the Torino lorenco Montero says he saw 
a pecan-shaped object metallic blue actually land on the runway about 50 feet from him 
said it was pretty small about 10 feet wide and 5 feet high it had a clear transparent 
nose and you could see a doorway the subject he said made a sort of humming whining noise 
as it landed and at that point outstepped the figure a blonde man about 5 feet 10 inches tall 
he exited the object and approached Montero and this figure says he's spoken a strange language 
according to Montero actually patted the guard on the shoulder then returned back into the object so 
according to Montero this figure appeared to put on sort of a harness-like device pushed a button 
and the object took off upward leveled out then climbed vertically disappearing into the distance 
and as you can see from the documents here this case was in fact investigated by Project Blue 
Book Intelligence Officers who seemed to show great interest in montero's testimony 
I really like these cases because they're so worldwide here's another case which took 
place at the Cordoba airport in Argentina this airport would have in the future more 
visitations but this one occurred at 5 25 a.m on November 25 1954 when an airport weatherman 
and an air traffic controller observed two glowing objects hovering over the airport 
and this is why I think it's a thing because these objects remained over the airport for two full hours before finally moving off another case which also took place in 1954 
was in yet another country this was at the bankstown airport in New South Wales Australia 
and in this case two people were working late at the airport it was just after dark 
when they observed what appeared to be a classic Flying Saucer it had portholes all 
around it and they could actually see shapes inside that appeared to be moving around 
was hovering directly over the control tower they could hear a low humming sound at which point this 
object shot up into the error changing colors as it did so and moved with great velocity so a 
pretty short case but again a very interesting case involving what appears to be humanoids 
one year later March of 1955 more than 100 people at Quito airport in Ecuador 
observed two metallic discs hovering quite high up about 8 500 feet overhead 
they stayed there for an hour at that point they did move away with quote incredible velocity 
what's very really interesting is it was just two months later when a nearly identical display took 
place over the Pisco airport south of Lima Peru Pilots airport personnel and civilians viewed 
five UFOs circling the airport for no less than two hours so again quite a long sighting 
here's a very brief case this took place at the tejgan airport in Bangladesh in November of 1955 
but it's an interesting case nevertheless because a group of saucers descended to 1500 
feet directly over the airport they zoomed over the airport airport for about one minute lighting 
up the whole airport area in bright light so this does appear to be an intentional display
many airports across the world are experiencing this and the next one that I could find occurred at London Airport in England on February 25 1959.
and this involved police officials air traffic controllers and many others at the London Airport 
who observed a quote bright yellow light varying in intensity some 200 feet above the ground 
so that's quite low and as often happens in these cases it stayed for a long time it 
hovered for about 20 minutes in full view of the witnesses and in fact this setting was so widely 
viewed that the error Minister Ward actually released an official statement saying and I quote 
a pale yellow light was seen by officials at London Airport above one of the runways from 
725 to 7 45 on the evening of February 25. there was no corresponding response on the 
airport Radars or on-air defense radars the light was not identified there was insufficient evidence 
to determine what the cause of this light could have been so after hovering in place for about 
20 minutes this object was observed to quote climb away at high speed and disappear from View 
the next case that I found occurred at an airport in Exeter England 
and this occurred on June 19 1961 as a good example of a UFO that's just so Brazen so showing 
itself off that officials have no choice but to admit to the truth of the incident 
so this flying object was reported to have hovered for more than one hour above the airport 
and according to officials and I quote we do not know what it is it was seen on the radar screen 
and we have had it under observation for some time we think it's pretty big it appears to be 
shining brightly and is about 50 000 feet up so this was not super low level but it's important 
because we do have official confirmation of it and it apparently was seen on radar 
now here's a really interesting case which took place at the liberal airport in Kansas 
on August 2nd 1962. this was an event that actually left the pilots in airport Personnel 
somewhat shaken up numerous UFOs were being reported in the area when around 8 PM brilliantly 
lit objects of different colors including white green blue and orange quote lit up the runways 
this was viewed by more than a dozen of the employees at liberal Airport 
and there were at least four of these objects one of which hovered directly over the airport and actually shined down a beam of light the objects were also viewed by Captain Jack Metzger 
who said that they moved faster than any plane he had ever seen so being a pilot he's familiar 
with aircraft he's a trained Observer so a really good witness it's a great case 
and it's just one of many many cases here's another this took place actually on the same 
exact day August 2nd 1962 but across the world at the camba Punta Airport at the tip of Argentina 
and what happened was an unidentified spherical object actually dropped down and hover get this a 
few feet above the runway at which point it began emitting powerful blue green and orange flashes 
of light so this event got a lot of publicity with the newspapers saying and I quote we do not 
believe the true explanation of these occurrences can be kept secret much longer so we see this with 
some of the airport encounters were so obvious so Brazen they simply can't be kept secret 
and here's another case which also took place at Argentina this was at the Aziza airport in 
Buenos Aires and this occurred at 2PM on December 22nd 1962. and a UFO actually landed on the runway 
it's really interesting that it actually land this was viewed by a technician by the name of Horatio Alora and a control tower employee by the name of Jose desuti they were in the 
middle of guiding in a Pan-American plane for a landing when this object which they described 
as football shaped landed on the runway it was also seen reportedly by the pilot of the plane 
but shortly after this the object Rose vertically to about 1500 feet and flew 
off horizontally disappearing Over the Horizon there would later be more incidents at Aziza 
airport it was a very famous one in 1995. so what we're seeing is these airports are 
not only having UFOs land on them it's happening repeatedly here's another very interesting case 
this took place at the Canberra airport in Australia and this was on July 15 1965 
when air traffic controllers Aviation experts and Pilots at the Canberra airport observed quote 
mysterious glowing objects hunk suspended at about 5 000 feet for 40 minutes 
so the sun was actually glinting on these strange craft this was during the day making them highly 
visible to all the onlookers finally they decided to send out a plane an Air Force 
plane was sent out to investigate at which point the objects quote zoomed out of sight 
it's amazing how long lasting some of these sightings are and it was just 13 days later and thousands of miles away when there was another really 
dramatic case at the Grano De Oro airport this is in America Venezuela occurred on July 28 1965 
when a group of student radio operators and their instructors at the airport observed quote three 
luminous discs in addition to visually observing these discs they actually tracked them on radar 
these objects were described as quote elongated objects with a bulge in the center 
amazing and what's most interesting to me are the humanoid cases and here's a really good 
one which took place at the Concepcion airport in hual pencil Chile this occurred just a few 
months after the above case this was on October 6 1965 when an Air Force Sergeant was in his plane 
on the runway at the Concepcion Airport and suddenly His Radio mysteriously malfunctioned 
so he exited his plane to investigate and this is when he saw that a glowing saucer had landed 
at the end of the runway about 1 000 feet away he said this craft was 90 feet across and almost 
10 feet high and as he watched three figures wearing what looked like diver's suits exited 
and began to walk around the craft so the sergeant stood motionless and just watched and after about 
three minutes these figures returned to the craft which took off vertically and flew away 
the next day the area where this craft had landed was inspected and there was a small circle visible 
just a few feet across on the ground so again another apparent case of Landing traces so 
perhaps these UFOs are landing at airports because this is what they're designed for hard to say 
it does appear that sometimes they're putting on displays um I don't know there could be a number of things going on here as we'll see it was just a few months later when there was another incident 
and this occurred at the maltin airport in Toronto this is in Ontario Canada this is in the winter of 
1965. this is a pretty unusual case two pilots had just landed and had steered their planes Off 
The Runway they were exiting their planes and cleaning the snow off their windshields when 
suddenly a bright light appeared between their two craft just about 10 feet away from the witnesses 
that hovered there for just a few seconds then quote drove off into the wind that's an important 
point because that proves it's not a balloon or anything in fact this object was described 
as a fiery white round ball about one foot in diameter so perhaps a probe or something it's 
very unusual but it was silent and steady as it moved off and disappeared into the distance 
here's another case involving a humanoid this is so unusual this took place at the maikisha airport 
in Venezuela and this was on August 26 1967 at around 2 am the main witness is Marine private 
Esteban Cova he had exited the airplane hangar at the airport when he says he was confronted 
by a three foot tall figure with a large head bulging eyes and a body covered with wiry hair 
so kova spoke Spanish and this being speaking in Spanish actually asked this Marine Mr kova 
won't you come with us we need one more at this point Esteban kova fainted and when he 
awoke the beings were gone I don't blame him for fainting that would be pretty alarming if a little 
ET walked up to you and said won't you come with us we need one more but it's amazing how many cases there are involving humanoids 
and here's yet another case at an airport again all over the world this one occurred 
at the airport in waipukurau in New Zealand this was on October 30 1969 
and an object described as circular with lights was seen hovering directly over the airport for 
some moments and it the security guards decided they would shine a spotlight on it at which point 
this object made a high winding sound and darted away at high speeds so we see this 
in a few cases airport officials will shine a light on the object at which point it Darts Away 
year after year this is happening moving along the next case I could find occurred over West Palm 
Beach International Airport in Florida and this was on September 14 1972. this is a well-verified 
and pretty dramatic case this object was tracked by two air traffic controllers we know their names 
CJ fox and a W brown both from the FAA the Federal Aviation Administration and as A.W Brown says 
about this object quote it was like nothing I've ever seen so meanwhile in the control tower FAA 
super supervisor George Morales viewed this object with binoculars and he described it as being quote 
cigar-like and soon more confirming reports began to pour in Eastern Airlines Captain B 
Ferguson police officers and several other civilians all reported seeing this object 
and this object was also reportedly being tracked by FAA operators at Miami International Airport as 
well as radar operators at nearby Homestead Air Force Base so at this point Homestead scrambled 
to f-106 interceptors after the object at which point it promptly disappeared 
so this was publicized in newspapers and following this incident Major Smith was actually one of the 
pilots sent to intercept the UFO admitted during a press conference that there was quote something 
definite in the sky and that it had been independently confirmed on two radar stations 
an official Air Force spokesman later added if it had proved hostile we would have destroyed it 
well I highly doubt that I don't think we have the capacity to do something like that nor do I think 
these things are hostile but that's neither here nor there it's just another interesting 
case of a UFO right over an airport and here's another involving a landed UFO and humanoids 
and this one occurred one year later on June 1st 1973 at the pennix airport in Mexico 
so this involved four students and a radio operator who were amazed to see a large 
glowing UFO land on the Airport runway at this point a being described as get this 
12 feet tall wearing metallic clothes emerged from this object walked around briefly on the 
tarmac then returned to the object which took off at high speed and disappeared 
amazing these objects appear to have no fear of being seen that's certainly what happened 
in this next case which occurred at Great Falls airport in Montana this was on December 11 1975 
when an oblong UFO was seen hovering a mere 10 feet over the runway at the Great Falls Airport 
interestingly two days later at 6 a.m on December 13th an object described 
as quote egg-shaped actually landed briefly on the runway and quickly took off and left 
so it's just astonishing how many cases there are and here is another case which I already 
mentioned the Cordoba airport in Argentina but it was visited again and this one caused a total 
shutdown of the airport this occurred on June 14 1980 and at the time there was a huge flurry of 
UFO sightings reported by many witnesses including airport personnel and meteorologists in fact these 
sightings received extensive newspaper coverage these objects were appearing singly and in fleets 
and were described variously as luminous oval spherical objects or a spinning top or 
quote a spindle shape or a sphere that emitted an intense luminous Ray that illuminated the surface 
of the river so different objects so at Cordoba airport a UFO caused operations to be stopped for 
several minutes as it was observed following the landing pattern of an aircraft towards the airport 
amazing here's another case Hartford International Airport in Connecticut 
8 10 pm September 28 1989 as dozens of motorists watched 
a huge object with six to eight very bright Amber lights moved silently above the highway same or 
similar object was seen by several airport workers who described it as quote a large Boomerang shaped 
craft that descended and hovered directly above an unused tarmac area of the Airfield 
and as these Witnesses watched a blue beam of light Shone down from the bottom of this object 
toward the ground and five humanoid figures then apparently glided down within this beam of light 
one of the witnesses gathered up his courage and actually chased one of these creatures but it quickly went back up into the blue beam of light into the craft which took 
off was just one and a half months later when an airport in Hungary was visited 
it was on November 13 1989 when this incident took place but a few days before that Hungarian 
Air Force jets were reportedly followed by a strange spherical orange object but then 
on November 13 1989 two soldiers were on duty at the airport when they saw a four foot tall 
glowing green figure walking around a plane it lifted one of its arms at which point a 
cone-shaped beam of light appeared overhead and it disappeared into this beam of light and was gone 
so many cases here's another one this occurred at Indianapolis Airport in Indiana 
this is around 7 30 pm July 5 1992 when two witnesses two brothers were on the second story 
balcony of their apartment building located about three miles Southwest of the Indianapolis Airport 
and they said they saw a circle of white light with a flashing red light underneath it moved 
towards the airport from the East this object stopped and then appeared to hover near or above 
the airport for about 10 minutes they watched as another aircraft a plane approached the airport 
at which point this object moved upwards and dimmed its lights now when this plane passed 
the object moved back down hovered for another three minutes and then this object moved back 
towards the east they estimate that this sighting lasted about 15 minutes in total here's another 
case occurred three years later December 1995. you can see there are many recent cases 
and this one involves a UFO covered with colored lights that flew alongside an aerolinus argentinus 
commercial jetliner actually coming so close it caused the pilot to make evasive maneuvers 
at which point this object approached the local airport causing all the electrical power at the 
airport to black out so these are electromagnetic disturbances which we hear about a lot in UFO 
cases and reportedly this incident made the front page of several Argentine newspapers and was also 
picked up internationally in newspapers in London and Paris strangely in the United States the 
story was barely mentioned the editors at Art Bells publication UFO news right and I quote 
no U.S Electronic media including CNN presented even a blurb on newscasts 
Los Angeles Times gave it a single sparse paragraph typical of U.S media policy 
UFO news world report staff cannot help but wonder what if this had occurred at say LAX 
that makes me laugh because I know of about a dozen cases which had did occur at LAX and 
they still got no publicity so most of these cases are going unreported completely I suspect 
here's another pretty recent case this occurred at the Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta Georgia 
and this was on February 17 2000 a man and his family were waiting for the arrival of his parents 
at the airport and this is when a UFO showed up luckily the witness did have a video camera ready 
he was going to film his parents as they arrived but before the plane arrived he and his family saw 
a UFO hovering over the airport and in fact in his article quote strange lights at Georgia airport 
the Georgia mufon state director wrote this particular light was pulsating and began to 
change position by moving and darting up and down in a dramatically noticeable fashion the witness 
then began to videotape the bright light as it loitered in the same general airspace recording 
its unusual movements so this is how we know it's a UFO because it's moving in ways no plane can 
or a balloon or anything for that matter at any rate the witnesses observed this object for about 20 minutes at which time it appeared to change shape the object then zipped away rapidly 
vertically leaving only a streak of light and according to mufon field investigator 
Michael hit who interviewed the witnesses and viewed the videotape he said that this object 
appeared to have a red light in the center and he believes it shows a genuine UFO this videotape 
apparently this is not the only case involving strange objects over this Airport 
because Mouton investigators contacted officials at Hartsfield Airport 
they denied any knowledge of anything unusual but Tom sheets of Georgia mufon wrote and I 
quote mufan Georgia has investigated several solid cases involving unknowns and relative 
close proximity to Hartsfield Airport and of course the various FAA Personnel knew nothing 
amazing I just have a few more cases I'd like to cover uh here's one which occurred at the 
Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi India again all over the world this occurred 
at 11 55 p.m on April 8 2000 when a yellowish orange cigar-shaped UFO approached the airport 
it flew at high altitude halted over a cargo terminal hovered descended 
wobbled around and then vanished amazing it does appear that they want to be seen 
now here is probably the ultimate UFO airport case if you know anything about UFOs I'm sure 
you've heard of this incident which occurred at Chicago O'Hare International Airport in Illinois 
this occurred on November 7th 2006. and this is no small airport and in fact Chicago O'Hare 
International Airport is the world's sixth busiest airport transporting millions of passengers each 
year this was a daylight sighting that occurred in the late afternoon of November 7 2006 when an 
object described as gray egg-shaped or saucer shaped was observed hovering directly over 
Gate C 17 at Chicago O'Hare Airport and among the first of the witnesses was a ramp employee 
who was communicating with UA flight 446 at the time the object appeared United Airlines 
and this OB this employee pointed it out to the United Airlines 446 crew it was around 
this time that many others noticed the object now this case was almost effectively covered 
up and if not for a reporter by the name of John halkovich who actually interviewed the witnesses 
it probably would have been covered up and none of us wouldn't know about it but John halkovich 
of the Chicago Tribune did interview the witnesses and as he writes and I quote the disc was visible 
for approximately five minutes and was seen by close to a dozen United Airlines employees 
ranging from Pilots to supervisors who heard chatter on the radio and raced out to view it 
so this object was apparently photographed as well though these photographs have never 
been fully vetted at any rate a lot of witnesses United Airlines flight 0878
was in the area again this is around 4 pm their plane was descending to land 
and the crew is attempting to obtain a visual observation of the airport as they 
were passing through the clouds there was a low cloud ceiling at this point and there's a report on the case reads when they cleared the cloud level the pilot immediately saw 
the airport and gradually noticed a gray round object there was a definite moment when they 
were above it a moment when they were level and a moment when they were below it was elliptical 
in shape dull gray with no visible markings there were no openings for Windows or doors 
and as they landed he lost sight of it but saw it again as the plane was turning on the tarmac 
so this object was very low the overcast was about 1900 feet so we know it was lower than 
that and it remained visible for quite a long time at least several minutes and was observed by not 
only Pilots airplane passengers but people on the ground baggage handlers and several 
mechanics and various United Airlines ground personnel subject had no wings or lights it had 
a metallic surface but had sort of a soft luster that according to one witness shown like a pearl 
a few of the witnesses reported a strange haze around the bottom of this object like heat waves 
coming off of a hot Road and one witness who was in in an airport parking lot so that the object 
appeared to be spinning counterclockwise and she said that a small crowd of fellow observers were 
pointing up the object and that several were taking pictures with digital cameras 
another witness just outside the airport described it as quote a blatant disc shaped craft 
so this object eventually disappeared straight up through the overcast by reportedly punching a 
hole right through the clouds and this was a hole that remained visible long after this object had 
Departed an observer descriptions of this object and its departure are remarkably consistent 
while there has been no confirmation of radar returns new Witnesses and photos continue to 
surface and as one Anonymous witness says back on November 7 2006 I was near Chicago O'Hare 
International Airport when I was witness to what was arguably one of the most important UFO 
incidents in modern times I witnessed a gigantic UFO hovering over the airport at precisely 4 32 pm 
the UFO was a dark hazy metallic disc slash cigar-shaped craft was at a height of roughly 
750 feet above the ground completely silent Frozen still and was well over 100 meters in length 
I managed to film the UFO on my cell phone for one minute I observed the UFO for a 
further minute after which time it took off and went upwards at tremendous speed and was gone 
so this was a really widely viewed case and the FAA First told John hilkovich from the 
Chicago Tribune that it had no knowledge of the alleged incident but they quickly reversed their 
position after the newspaper filed a Freedom of Information Act request and now the agency 
claims that the November sighting was some sort of unspecified weather related phenomena 
officials from United Airlines continued to deny the incident entirely despite the fact 
that several of their own employees told reporters that they filed written reports 
on the sighting with their company including drawings United Airlines employees said that 
they were actually explicitly instructed by their employer not to discuss this incident 
however in defiance of the company gag order one United mechanic told the Tribune 
it was definitely not an Earth aircraft so this citing and subsequent publicity had a huge 
impact on the media became a classic case it even appeared on the television program Boston Legal 
the storyline was about a therapist at a hospital who was fired for saying he saw a UFO over O'Hare 
and described this sighting in detail so yeah a really classic case 
and here's another one which actually shut down the xiaoshan airport in hangzhu China 
this occurred four years later on July 7 2010 and the Shoshan airport was apparently shut down apparently due to this UFO was around 8 30 PM when 
the crew and passengers of a plane preparing to land saw a strange light hovering over the airport 
this was apparently photographed uh they contacted the control tower the airport was then shut down 
and flights were delayed and diverted and in fact 18 flights were affected before 
this object finally flew off and uh went away now officials have denied the presence of any 
UFO at the airport though as you can see there are some apparent photographs of this object 
and there's always another case here's one that occurred three years later on April 26 2013 
and this occurred at the control tower of Aguadilla airport in Puerto Rico 
again at 10 22 PM April 26 2013 when a Customs and Border Protection Caribbean air and Marine 
Branch Maritime Patrol aircraft a dhc8 was on a routine Patrol when it encountered a UFO 
immediately after takeoff this object was spotted visually by the pilot the captain of the aircraft 
and by the control tower operator in Aguadilla airport this object had a strange red light on it 
and the Customs and Border Protection crew thought that the aircraft might be a Smuggler so they 
actually began to follow the UFO and recorded it on infrared video this video is quite famous 
you can view it online this UFO circled the Aguadilla airport and made its way to the ocean 
initially the UFO appeared with the shape of what looked like sort of a flying horseshoe 
but then as it made its way to the ocean it changed its configuration to what appeared to 
be more of a spherical shape and this object skimmed the top of the ocean and actually 
submerged and appeared to be totally unaffected by the hydrodynamic forces 
so I guess you could call this a Uso as well now just a few more cases two I would like to cover 
these cases show no signs of stopping I mean the next one occurred at the 
Mexico City International Airport a huge Airport and this occurred on April 14 2018. 
and according to Alfonso Salazar who was uh working at the Mexico City International Airport 
as he writes and I quote a luminous UFO flying over the airport this Saturday 14 April 2018 the 
time being nine in the evening I Alfonso Salazar and the company of three Aviation technicians 
witnessed a very bright flying object flying over Mexico City International Airport 
the UFO was flying from west to east and beyond our atmosphere according to calculations 
it radiated in intense white light the sighting lasted some 15 seconds before 
the UFO simply dimmed its lights becoming a shadow moving across the sky now this was 
photographed about five minutes later another object passed projecting an intermittent white 
light flying from north to south at an altitude of 50 feet this is the one that was photographed 
these were UFOs as the witness says without question atmospheric conditions were very good 
so another amazing case and here's one final case I'd like to leave you with another very 
recent case which occurred at the Jorge Chavez International Airport in Peru on February 27 2019. 
this was viewed by numerous staff and employees at the airport and photographed it involves two 
unknown objects which hovered over the airport for more than an hour this was also observed 
by Personnel from the control tower and in fact flights had to be delayed due to the presence of 
the UFOs they did also appear briefly on the radar scopes this object objects hovered over Runway 33. 
where they were observed by ground crew from two separate planes and according to officials from 
corpak the Peruvian Corporation of airports and Commercial Aviation they made an official 
statement regarding the event and released the photographs which apparently clearly show this UFO 
so again this is just the tip of the iceberg it's clear there's a strong connection here 
and as fact as researcher Lauren gross writes the evidence certainly seems to suggest that UFOs are 
fascinated with what would be their mechanical peers since the strange objects stocked airliners 
dog fought military warplanes and loitered near airports not only loitered but landed and as we 
have seen many cases involving humanoids those are all the cases that I could find I expect there are 
quite a bit more than the ones I've presented here and as you can see this is a worldwide phenomena 
I did Cover these cases in my book not from here volume 4. and I do think they have some really 
profound insights into the UFO phenomena the fact that they're so interested in airports I 
think shows that we are dealing with people beings who are very much like us and I've got a couple 
of theories as to why they are so interested in airports one is that they are just simply 
checking up on our technology of course this is pure speculation but we do know that UFOs 
do show an interest in nuclear power stations and of course dams as I did in another episode 
military bases anything technological so perhaps that's what's going on here but I think there 
might be layers to this for example this could be another case of UFOs putting on displays 
we see this a lot of times UFOs seem to brazenly show themselves wanting to be seen and what better 
place than airports which have millions of people around them radar and all these different types 
of things that make it very hard for us not to notice them so perhaps that's what's going on here 
hard to say again that's pure speculation just seems like there's no least likely place for a 
UFO which is trying to hide other than an airport I mean you will be noticed so yeah perhaps they're 
putting on displays I do have another theory which was actually given to me by a contact 
and she says that it's possible that these are actually practice events for a future 
worldwide Landing I hadn't even thought of that the fact that there are so many cases involving 
Landings yeah that could be true I guess time will tell at any rate I do think as I said that 
these cases do have something really important to tell us about the nature of the UFO phenomena 
and their agenda on planet Earth and that's why I wanted to do this episode for you today 
I hope you found these cases interesting and until next time keep looking for answers 
keep searching for the truth the most important keep having fun bye now.
