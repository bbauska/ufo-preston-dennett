30 UFO LANDING TRACE CASES
May 20, 2022

Summary:
May 20, 2022
There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face contact, onboard UFO encounters, crash/retrievals and more. UFO skeptics often say that these cases rely solely on eyewitness testimony with no supporting hard physical evidence. But this is simply not true.

Most sightings have multiple eyewitness testimony. Some are supported by lie-detector tests, radar-returns, photographs and films. Many encounters display a wide variety of evidence such as electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects (injuries and healings,) angel hair, implants (which appear on x-rays and MRIs, and have in some cases been removed and subjected to scientific study) and more. There is a lot more evidence for UFOs than most people realize.

One of the most compelling types of evidence is known as UFO landing traces. Close Encounters of the Second Kind are those cases which affect the physical environment in some way. The ultimate example of this are the UFO landing traces cases. 

There are thousands of reports of UFO landings. And there are hundreds upon hundreds of these which involve hard physical evidence in the form of landing traces. 

Landing traces come in many different forms including crushed vegetation, swirled grass, accelerated growth of vegetation, gouges in the earth, compacted soil, burn marks, soil that shows evidence of having been exposed to a high heat source, radiation readings, and more.

This video presents a chronology of more than thirty UFO landing trace cases. They come from all across our planet, reach back many decades in time, and are still occurring today.

Some of these cases are very well known, such as the Socorro, NM UFO landing in 1964; the Tully, Australia UFO landing in 1966; the Delphos, Kansas UFO landing in 1971; the Langenburg, Canada UFO landing in 1974; the Trans-En-Provence, France UFO landing in 1981; and the Voronezh, Russia UFO landing in 1989, to name a few! However, the vast majority of UFO landing trace cases have received almost no publicity whatsoever.

This video presents these well-known cases, and many which are not well-known. All of these cases provide hard physical evidence of UFOs. Many of the landing traces have been studied in scientific labs. 

The cases presented here are only a small portion of the actual number of cases. The time for skepticism is over. These landing trace cases provide conclusive proof that we are being visited by UFOs and extraterrestrials. To ignore them would be wholly unscientific. 

Where are these cases taking place? What actually happens when a UFO lands on our planet? What do these cases have to say about the nature and origin of the UFO phenomenon? The answers are here!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode 30 ufo landing trace cases there are many thousands of cases on record in 
which ufos have landed on earth much smaller are the number of cases in which they leave 
actual hard evidence these are called landing traces and they come in many forms these include 
crushed vegetation swirled grass indentations on the ground burn marks 
radiation readings in some cases unusual elements there's many different types of ufo landing traces 
but these cases have been occurring for a very long time many decades 
and are still occurring to the present day they have occurred all over the world and what I like 
about these cases is they provide hard evidence of the reality of ufos skeptics often say if ufos 
are real where's the evidence well here it is and what I'd like to do today is present to you 
a chronology of some of the best cases and I've got a lot of them so let's just get started the 
first case I'd like to talk about is probably the most famous case of a landing trace and that is 
of course the socorro new mexico ufo landing this occurred on april 24 1964 and there are actually 
a number of witnesses to activity at that time there were two gentlemen paul keyes and larry 
kratzer who apparently saw a ufo while driving along highway 60 moving towards the area where 
socorro police officer lani zamora would see this ufo land at the time lani zamora was in pursuit of 
a speeding motorist when you heard a loud roaring sound and looking towards the source of this noise 
he saw a bright flaming object descend behind a small hill near the location of a dynamite shack 
and he thought that perhaps the shack had exploded so he drove to the top of the hill 
and to his shock he saw a small shiny object landed next to the road and two short figures 
standing next to it he said they appeared to be working on this object he first assumed that there 
had been some sort of auto accident and he radioed headquarters that an accident had in fact occurred 
meanwhile he continued to drive towards this object approaching to within about 
100 feet and I'll just quote lani zamora from his notes following this incident 
as lonnie says it looked at first like a car turned upside down thought some kids might have 
turned it over saw two people in white coveralls very close to the object one of these persons 
seemed to turn and look straight at my car and seemed startled seemed to quickly jump somewhat 
at this time I began moving my car towards them quickly with the idea to help object 
was like aluminum was whitish against the mesa background not chrome seemed like oval in shape 
and I at first glance took it to be an overturned white car the only time I saw these two persons 
was when I had stopped for possibly two seconds or so to glance at the object 
those persons appeared normal in shape but possibly they were small adults or large kids 
so lonnie drove up to the top of this hill and as he drove up this hill the object 
went out of view behind this hill but as he got to the top of the hill the figures were no longer 
visible he could see this craft which appeared to be sitting on landing gear seconds later he 
heard two thumping sounds and a loud roar this craft rose upwards emitting a blast of flame 
zumarro jumped behind his car for for protection and he says this craft rose up and barely 
cleared the dynamite shack the flame then became extinguished the roar stopped and a whining sound 
began and the craft flew away in a bobbing motion at very low altitude and as it left lani zamora 
observed a strange red-colored symbol on the side of the craft and it was moments later that his 
partner police sergeant sam chavez arrived and they went to the site of where this object had 
been on the ground and both of them discovered landing traces where this craft had rested 
they said there was four deep indentations on the earth a burnt mesquite bush and charred grass not 
only that the rock where this craft had sat also appeared to be melted and fused and according to 
researchers and ruffle and william moore within 45 minutes military personnel were on the scene 
they took away samples of the melted rock the burns soil and vegetation lonnie zamora as it turns out was friends with dr lincoln lopez the famous astronomer 
so he heard about this sighting very early on and air force investigators converged on the scene 
jay allen heineck also investigated the incident shortly after it happened and he measured these 
landing marks determining that the center of gravity of this object corresponded exactly 
to the location of the burned foliage at this time heineck was still somewhat skeptical of ufos 
but after investigating this case he was baffled and later wrote that this incident was one of 
the quote major ufo sightings in the history of the air force's consideration of this subject 
so this object was not far away from the local socorro airport and heinek was surprised it was 
not caught on their radar but according to researchers jim and coral lorenzen who also 
investigated this incident they learned that the airport radar had been shut down and they 
speculated that perhaps the facility at white sands which did have their radar on was tracking 
the object and this would explain why military officials showed up within hours of the incident 
so this was not only investigated by the air force but also by the fbi we know this because 
of documents released through the freedom of information act fbi agent d arthur burns was 
one of the investigators and he and air force captain richard t holder interviewed lani zamora 
and zamora speculated that perhaps this craft was a secret government craft whereas air force 
captain richard holder suggested that lonnie might have been the victim of a hoax lani zamar 
disagreed with this and despite captain holder's comment it's clear from declassified documents 
that fbi agent arthur burns took this case very seriously and in fact in his notes he wrote that 
lani zamora was quote a well-regarded industrious and conscientious officer and not given to fantasy 
so what's really interesting about this particular case is it does not involve just 
burnt rock depressions in the ground and burned vegetation but there is also what appeared to be 
metal fragments because this craft did land in an area of very sharp volcanic rock and in the 
holes made by this craft's landing gear there were allegedly metal streaks left by the craft 
this is according to stanton friedman and dr james mcdonald who interviewed a lady by 
the name of mary mays mary mays at the time of this incident was working on her master's degree 
in radiation biology at new mexico university and she told stanton friedman and dr james mcdonald 
that she was actually asked by the university to investigate the landing traces she visited 
the site confirmed the melted sand the burned vegetation she took samples which she studied 
in a lab she found no evidence of radiation but did say that the plants were scorched and 
that there were also two organic substances which she was unable to identify afterwards 
she was ordered to turn in her report all the samples and to quote keep quiet about the case 
j allen heineck was very much impressed by the case and as he later wrote the soccoro case 
was basically a single witness sighting although several other more distant witnesses to the object 
were reported but the witness was a policeman whose character and record were unimpeachable 
physical traces were left on the ground and as I personally observed some of the grease wood bushes 
in the vicinity had been charged major quintanilla then head of blue book was convinced that an 
actual physical craft had been president maybe there is a simple explanation for the socorro 
incident but having made a complete study of the events I do not think so it is my opinion that a 
real physical event occurred on the outskirts of socorro that afternoon of april 24 1964. later 
major quintanilla of project blue book did try to explain away the incident as a test flight of 
a secret lunar module there's no evidence of this and the socorro incident became the only case in 
blue book files that was labeled unidentified it's blue book case number eight seven six six 
jim and coral lorenzen also investigated this case in detail and according to them 
they found many other witnesses to ufos before and after the time of this incident and in fact 
there may have been a lot more witnesses than many people realize recently another witness to 
this incident came forth her name is sally hageler she was a socorro chamber of commerce volunteer 
and she says that she saw the same object between her home on lopez road and the m 
mountain according to her jay allen heineck told her that there were about 
400 other witnesses who had also seen the same phenomenon along the mountain 
so that is a very impressive case of a ufo landing trace one of the most famous 
but certainly not the only one and over the next decades there would be many many more 
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred in barnesville minnesota on may 5th 1964. 
the main witness is alfred ernst and he saw a small glowing object on the ground in the field 
next to his home about 1500 feet away according to alfred this object was about four feet across 
and looked about the size of a washing machine except it had a rounded bottom 
uh he was driving at the time it was about eight am bright and sunny but this object was so bright 
it hurt his eyes and as he watched this object took off and disappeared into the clouds making 
him quote uncomfortable so he continued to drive away and he returned later to the site 
to investigate and this is when he found a three-foot crater-like depression in the field 
and not only was there a depression the ground was much drier than the surrounding terrain and there 
was a weird white substance surrounding the crater which when analyzed turned out to be alkaline 
some researchers thought that perhaps ball lightning was responsible but 
physicist atmospheric physicist dr james mcdonald looked into the case 
and he disputed the ball lightning theory and to this day this case remains unexplained
another excellent case one of france's most famous landing trace cases occurred in june well actually 
july but uh in 1965 in valon seoul france the main witness is maurice mass and he is a lavender 
farmer at the time and he noticed that someone was stealing his lavender plants this was on june 30th 
but the very next day at 5 45 a.m on july 1st 1965 
maurice was in his lavender field checking on the plants when he caught the perpetrator red-handed 
and his encounter began when he heard a strange whistling sound and turning around he saw a strangely shaped silver object landed in his lavender field 
and next to this object stood two short figures with huge bald heads and large eyes and they were 
collecting samples of his lavender plants so maurice mass began to approach these figures 
at which point one of them pointed a tube like instrument at him leaving him temporarily unable 
to move the creatures then hopped into their craft and departed fifteen minutes passed before 
maurice was physically able to move and recover and he reported his encounter to investigators 
and his story gained widespread attention largely because where this object had landed 
in his lavender field all the lavender plants died and no vegetation would grow 
so while maurice mass was happy to finally discover who was stealing his lavender plants 
he became quite upset when hundreds of curiosity seekers trampled his field to see these famous 
landing traces left by this craft it's a very well-known case of a ufo landing trace 
here's another very interesting case which took place in pretoria south africa on the 
night of september 16 1965. there are two witnesses both police officers constables 
by the name of john lockham and kuz de klerk they were driving along the pretoria highway 
when they came upon a disc shaped object resting right on the highway itself they described it 
as being copper colored about 30 feet in diameter and on the top of it was a small dome and as they 
approached this object their car engine failed it died and this object stayed there for just a few 
moments and then without warning it lifted up off the road and beneath it was a very powerful flame 
coming from what appeared to be two tubes on the underside and as officer john lockham says 
its liftoff was quicker than anything I have ever seen these flames came out from underneath the 
object but they were so hot so powerful that they actually caught the road itself on fire 
and these flames were at least three feet high and remained burning long after this 
object zoomed away and was out of sight a later investigation showed that this part of the road 
was actually partially caved in evidently from a very heavy weight from this object and the 
gravel itself had been separated from the tar in a severely burned area about six feet in diameter 
constable john lockham drew a sketch of this object this did capture the attention 
of the military and in fact the district commandant of pretoria lieutenant colonel 
jb brits told newspaper reporters that this event was considered quote as being of a 
highly secret nature and an inquiry is being conducted in top circles 
so this did of course capture the attention of ufo organizations such as nycap the national 
investigative committee of aerial phenomena and they learned that this road service surface 
was being analyzed by a leading scientific agency in south africa and they attempted to 
get copies of the analysis reports but were unable to do so and the analysis has never 
been made public nevertheless it's a very well documented ufo landing trace case one year later 
half a year later actually on january 19 1966 there was a very famous case in australia in tully 
australia and this landing trace became known as the tully saucer nest this incident began 
when a banana farmer by the name of george pedley was driving an electric tractor near his farm 
along the neighbor's farm actually when the engine began to misfire at the same time he 
heard a strange hissing noise and without warning a large saucer-shaped object rose from the ground 
near him and took off at high speed he said it was a silvery gray about 25 feet wide nine feet thick 
and silent except for this hissing noise and upon examining the sight where this object had risen 
he saw that the six foot tall reeds were swirled into a counter-clockwise circle and some of them 
were actually missing he also saw what appeared to be four inch long footprints leading from the 
landing site into a plowed field and I'll just quote george pedley about what he saw in his 
own words as he says suddenly an object rose out of the swamp when I glanced at it it was already 
30 feet above the ground and at about treetop level it was a large gray saucer shaped object 
convex on the top and bottom and measured some 25 feet across and nine feet high while I watched 
it rose another 30 feet spinning very fast then it made a shallow dive and took off with tremendous 
speed climbing at an angle of 45 degrees it disappeared within seconds in a southwesterly 
direction I saw no portholes or antennas and there was no sign of life either in or about the ship 
so this case caused quite a sensation it became very well known investigators 
were very much interested in this case it's a very well known well verified landing trace case that again became known as the tully saucer nest 
now we move to one of australia's most famous sightings this occurred in melbourne australia 
at westall high school on april 6 1966. this was during the early new or around 11 a.m 
when two or three saucer shaped objects showed up over the school and some of them actually began to 
land and one perhaps two of them landed in a grove of trees behind the school known as the grange 
this caught the attention of the children on the playground and before long some 200 to 300 
children at westall high school and teachers and school officials all saw these objects as 
they were darting around shortly later little planes showed up and started circling the area 
when some of the kids saw that this object had actually landed on the ground they jumped the fence and ran towards it and a small handful of kids came upon this landed 
object they said it was quite small featureless silver about the size of a small sports car and 
it was giving off an intense heat it was just on the ground for a few moments before it lifted up 
turned vertical and darted off this whole incident lasted about 20 minutes so a fairly long time 
and after this object left the witnesses who were there saw that it had left a circle of crushed grass and according to some witnesses the grass itself was also 
burned and it appeared to have been exposed to a high heat source uh the children 
were ushered back into the school the press showed up as the military a cover-up was enacted 
and this was covered up successfully for some time but eventually became very well known 
and as I mentioned earlier it's probably australia's most famous ufo incident of all times 
researcher shane ryan is the lead investigator to this case and he has interviewed many of the 
witnesses in fact he has interviewed more than 100 of the witnesses who actually saw these 
landing traces it's a very well documented case new information is still coming out to this day 
and it is definitely deserves a place on this list as having some very interesting 
landing trace evidence another case that really deserves more attention than it's gotten 
occurred in gwynner north dakota this was on september 13 1966 at 7 30 a.m when 12 year old 
randy e rotenberger was waiting for the school bus outside his home and as he was as he was waiting 
he saw flashing lights in the sky approaching and as it came closer he could see it was actually a 
saucer your classic silver disk and as randy says it looked like two bowls put together 
he could see three protrusions of some sort on the bottom and what looked like an antenna 
on top is that it had red and green lights and it appeared to be about eight feet thick 
and as he watched this thing came down for a landing he was very impressed and 
he did what anyone should do is go get more witnesses and he ran inside and got his mom 
and told her and as his mom says the tone of his voice convinced me there was something wrong 
he was scared so they locked the front door and she quickly went to call the police at that point 
this object made a very loud sound and as randy rotenberger's mother says I could hear a noise 
over the phone it was a whirring sound they went outside but by this point the object was gone 
randy and two friends inspected the area where this object was seen and they found quote some 
burnt marks and tapered holes each were about a foot in diameter and five inches deep these 
holes formed a triangle one side measuring 26 feet the second 23 feet and the third 22 feet 
these landing traces were examined by many other people among them was cliff melro who was the 
president of the melro manufacturing company and as he says I've been around equipment all my life 
only a heavy piece of equipment could have made these prints something made these holes other 
than someone trying to be funny this did quickly catch the attention of the military and in fact 
general homer goebbel then commander of the fargo north dakota air national guard base
examined these landing traces and pretty much ignored randy rotenberger's testimony 
and gave a very debunking explanation he said and I quote there was a light rain 
at the time there could have been ball lightning this was not at all consistent with ball lightning 
and later the air force agreed that this was not ball lightning it was unexplained and in 
a letter to the national investigative committee of aerial phenomena nycap 
major james h eichman said the depressions in the ground were compacted solidly 
for this reading for this reason the sighting is carried as unidentified in air force files
so year after year there are cases like this the next one I'd like to talk about occurred on may 7 1967 in edmonton alberta canada there are two witnesses uh both young teenagers 
it occurred at mount pleasant cemetery a 14 year old ricky banyard and his friend glenn coate saw 
a ufo hovering over the graveyard they said it looked like two bowls attached together 
and it was sending beams of light down into the graveyard they didn't actually see it land but 
an inspection of the cemetery later yielded several unexplained rectangular black streaks 
on the sand and gravel paths leading among the graves so rocks and pebbles 
seem to be charred but none of the grassy area or trees appear to have been burned 
this uh was very interesting because investigators actually interviewed the cemetery foreman joseph 
laforge who verified that this these markings had not been there before 
so they were apparently made by this object over this cemetery it's a very interesting case 
another case occurred that same year on october 9 1965 in tucson arizona 
this was in the evening when a 13 year old boy by the name of richard who was the son of a prominent 
businessman in the area was riding his bike around the neighborhood and he came upon an eight foot 
tall metallic cylindrical shaped object resting on the ground about 50 feet away from him this 
was in a little creek bed this object stood on two legs each of which ended in a large circular pad 
richard could see that this object was unusual and wondering what it was he approached closer 
and when he got to about 35 feet of this object it suddenly made a deep low-pitched hum and took 
off straight upwards disappearing into the night sky he approached where this object had landed 
and saw obvious imprints in the soil so investigators were alerted and 
dr james mcdonald showed up and investigated the case and interviewed the witness 
he photographed and examined the landing traces and determined that these two landing 
pads were 42 inches apart and 13.4 inches wide and they were made in hard packed soil 
and because these imprints were a couple of inches deep it was clear that this object was quite 
heavy james mcdonald was very much impressed by this case so much so that he decided to contact 
air force officials at nearby davis-monthan air force base and informed them about the incident 
and they were very interested and sent out blue book air force personnel to conduct an 
investigation and they returned one week later to examine the landing traces unfortunately by 
this this time there had been a rainstorm and the landing traces were washed away however air force 
colonel raymond sleeper later wrote a 60-page report on this case and he labeled it a hoax 
dr james mcdonald vehemently disagreed as did jim and coral lorenzen and they believe that 
this boy had seen a genuine ufo so it's a very interesting case with landing trace evidence
next case I'd like to talk about occurred two years later on may 11 1969 
in chapeau this is a little town near pembroke in ontario canada this occurred at 2 00 am 
when an anonymous couple was alerted by their dog howling they went outside to find 
a brightly lit object hovering just a few feet above the field near their home the husband 
approached at which point this object dimmed it made a low purring sound and he could now see that 
it was in fact a dome-shaped object it promptly took off and disappeared into the night sky 
he went back inside but the next morning they went out to investigate where this object had landed 
and they found three circular depressions equally spaced to form a triangle with a 
rectangular depression one to two inches in depth near the midpoint of the base of the triangle 
other weird rings were found landing trace expert ted phillips said that yes there was this trace 
but it was actually only one of four such markings that he found he found several circles he said 
that there was one circle which was 32 feet in diameter another which was 28 feet in diameter 
another which was 28 and a half feet and a fourth that was nine feet in diameter 
so these circular marks showed depressed grass crushed grass and one of them had three 
quote pod marks arranged in the center of the grass which formed a perfect triangle 
so this was a very well verified case of ufo landing traces in that there were multiple 
witnesses who actually saw this object land in the field and investigators were able to confirm 
that these depressions were there in the fields exactly where this craft had landed there's so 
many cases it was just two months later on july 13 1969 when there was another case in van horn iowa 
this occurred at 11 pm when a high school girl and her cousin were having a sleepover 
and they were up at 11 p.m when they heard this weird sound outside their home and looking out 
the window they saw an object hovering above the field across the road it was less than a 
mile away this object appeared to be a gray metallic disc there were no lights on it 
except for an orange red band of light around the circumference and this was bright enough so that 
the girls were able to see the shape of this object clearly which they described as quote 
a shallow inverted bowl with a curved bottom they saw no portholes no protrusions of any kind 
and as they watched this object came directly over their farmhouse and in fact so low the 
vibrations rattled the bedroom windows the parents in the house were asleep at the time 
did not wake up according to the two witnesses this object was about the size of an automobile 
and was rotating counter-clockwise and off it went into the night sky 
the next morning they told the parents what had happened and they were initially not believed 
but later that morning the father was out walking in the fields and came across a 40-foot diameter 
circle of dried out soybean crop which of course had previously not been there this was a perfect 
circle and it was in the exact location where the two witnesses had seen this ufo and according to 
the report on this case all of the leaves of each plant were hanging wilted from the stalks and 
the ufo researchers who investigated this case hypothesized that these soybean plants 
had been quote subjected to intense heat so it's not clear whether this object actually landed or 
if it was just hovering above the area because the plants themselves were not broken off or crushed 
but there's great photos of these landing traces ufo investigators arrived on the scene 
shortly after occurred there were investigators from both the mutual ufo network mufon and the 
aerial phenomena research organization apro they interviewed the witnesses and 
confirmed that these landing trace cases did actually exist dr j allen heineck visited the site 
and he says and I quote I still don't know what the hell this thing is all about 
it looked as though a big heater had been held six feet above the ground investigators later learned 
that the neighbors said that their dogs were making a racket on that evening and this case 
was considered one of the best landing trace cases on record at that time 
because it had multiple witnesses and investigators arrived on the scene 
shortly after and were able to interview the witnesses and confirm the landing trace cases
so these cases again occur all over the world and the next case I'd like to discuss occurred almost 
exactly one year later and on august 30th 1970 at lake anton sweden uh the main witness is richard 
johansen actually it's his property where these landing trace cases were discovered he himself 
did not see anything but when he went outside that morning he found all these weird marks 
in his backyard so he alerted investigators who conducted a very thorough investigation they took 
samples of these landing traces and tests showed high levels of gamma radiation and while richard 
johansen didn't see anything investigators learned that there were in fact dozens of witnesses to 
ufo activity in that exact area on that night there's a road that passes by johansen's property 
and witnesses were stopping their cars and watching these red lights hovering at treetop 
level dropping down behind the trees someone said they saw these objects sending down beams of light 
and this went on for a couple of hours on the evening before these landing trace cases were 
discovered by the owner of this property so yeah nearly a dozen witnesses saw ufo activity 
and then there are these very prominent landing trace marks that are directly where this object 
was hovering it is a great ufo landing trace case one year later june 25 1971 
there was a very interesting case which took place in allsays a little town in france 
this occurred in the evening at about 11 p.m there were two witnesses 18 year old joel schweitzer and his friend who wants to remain anonymous they were returning home 
after visiting a friend when they saw a light in the distance to the northeast they first thought 
it looked like an electric flashlight was quite distant from them but it started to get closer 
and they realized it was strange and began to look at it they said it was very bright it appeared to 
be spinning and as they watched it came down over the girls private school in this area and getting 
closer and closer and as it got very close to them they could see that it was in fact a disc 
one side of this disc was completely flat and the other was bulged and as this object approached 
it was in a vertical position to the meadow and they said it was about 45 feet overhead 
this disc then stopped hovered in a vertical position for about two to three seconds 
and slowly began to dim in brightness but it was still bright enough where it lit up the whole area 
this object then performed a reversal maneuver and basically went horizontal 
and the flat side of it tilted to face the ground and it still felt like this object was rotating 
very fast like a children's top and they could now see that there was a white light beacon on 
the top of the object which was blinking and after a few seconds this object descended to the ground 
very slowly they did not hear any noise there were numerous dogs in this area who did not react 
at this point the two friends became a little bit frightened and were about to run away then they 
saw this object had actually stopped and remained stationary about 75 feet away they said it looked 
like it landed in the field and if not landed it was very close to the ground within a foot or two 
it lit up this whole area they could not see any feet or landing gear because it was so bright 
and this object remained in place for about a minute and a half then went up vertically slowly 
and started to rotate again moving off slowly and then suddenly started off at high speed in a 
horizontal position they estimate that this object was about 24 feet in diameter and about six feet 
high metallic and the next day in the morning they went to this spot to see if there was any 
evidence and they found landing traces in the grass where this object had been 
as it turns out this was a meta which had been mown cut down a few days before the vegetation 
which was mostly alfalfa was about 6 to 12 inches in height ufo investigators converged on the scene 
and they measured these traces photographed them the traces were a circle up just over 
18 feet in diameter and in the center of these traces there was a very prominent h symbol which 
was about six and one fourth feet long they also found three circular marks just under three feet 
in diameter and a small square hole so again they took photos they drew the marks made a diagram 
according to the witnesses and the investigators this grass was flattened and appeared to be 
blackened but not actually burned it appeared as if it had been exposed to some source of heat 
they speculated that the blacking marks were actually set this case is quite controversial 
there were accusations of a possible hoax largely because of this h which was very much like an 
h in a normal alphabet and very similar to a standard helicopter landing pad 
so it's hard to say the witnesses do not think this was a helicopter it made no noise 
there was no wind and there was no evidence of any helicopter flight but these marks are very 
prominent and were investigated by researchers so it is a very interesting landing trace case and 
again not the only one it was just a few months later that same year when one of the most famous 
landing trace cases in all of ufo history occurred this was on november 2nd 1971 in delphos kansas 
the main witness is 16 year old ron johnson and he was outside his home in dolphos 
with his dog's snowball when he saw a metallic object hovering only a few feet 
above the ground in his backyard this object was making a very loud noise and was blindingly bright 
so bright in fact that it caused after images on his retina and as this object began to leave 
ron ran inside and got his parents who came outside just in time to see this object 
moving off and now looking down where this object had hovered they saw a glowing ring 
which they said and I quote felt strange like a slick crust as if the soil was crystallized 
ron's mother bent down and touched the soil which she said caused her finger to be numb 
she rubbed it off on her leg and her leg became numb this numbness lasted for some time 
it rained that night but in the morning the strange rain was completely dry that was weird 
and it remained in place for quite some time when snow fell later in the winter the snow melted 
everywhere but on that ring so investigators converged on the scene soil samples were taken 
and sent to a lab and there were some weird results there was a substance in these samples 
which was an organic organism related to actino mycetalis which jacques valet a very well-known 
investigator described as an quote intermediate organism between bacteria and fungus this is 
a material which can fluoresce under certain circumstances so they speculate that perhaps the 
radiation or energy from this object affected the organisms that were already in this area at any 
rate police and reporters did show up on the scene confirmed the presence of the ring investigators 
did as well it's still there to this day and later there was another witness in the area 
who said that he saw an object descending towards delphos at the time of this incident 
this case has never been explained as anything other than an actual ufo landing 
and is considered by many to be one of the very best verified landing trace cases on record 
and here's a little clip I'd like to play about this case
this is a small portion of the soil taken from a ufo landing site in delphos kansas the 
soil in the ufo landing ring is extremely dehydrated and is unable to absorb water
instead it simply floats soil taken only a few feet away that was not part of the ufo landing ring behaved normally
within a few seconds it absorbed the water that we poured on it
besides being unable to absorb water ufo affected soil cannot support sea germination and plant life 
soil taken a few feet away does support normal plant growth
all right moving along another very interesting case occurred on november 12 1972 
at the rose mead high school in middleburg south africa it was around 9 30 p.m and that evening 
when two police officers noticed a glowing object over a nearby hill they watched it 
through binoculars and said as they watched it it actually changed color and shape and while they 
were watching it there were other witnesses in the area four men who had been hired to guard the nearby petrol dump next to this hill and they watched this object descend and hover 
or land directly on the fenced in tennis courts of the rose mead high school two of these witnesses p 
k nell and s j rousseau said that the red lights were directly on the court itself 
moving in a circular pattern and as one of them said and I quote it looked as if someone in a car 
without headlights but with taillights burning were riding around in circles on the tennis court 
this is what they told the police who later investigated this case the lights then disappeared after which the entire petrol dump became illuminated by a strange 
incandescent light meanwhile there were other witnesses the principal of rosemead high school 
harold truder lived next door to the school and the tennis courts and he and his family observed 
weird lights what they described as a beam like a searchlight coming down from the sky 
they watched it for several minutes after it left he went outside to examine the area 
and realized that they were right over the tennis courts which had been severely damaged 
and huge chunks of tar had been gouged from the courts and this was very strange 
because these tennis courts were guarded by a tall chain link fence and secured by a locked 
gate which was not disturbed so he went the next morning to investigate more closely 
confirmed that the skate was still locked the fence was undamaged the floors of the tennis 
courts however were almost completely torn up in fact he found several lumps of tar stuck high up 
on the fence this is when he called the police who arrived that morning and began an investigation 
and they searched the area and found lumps of tar from this tennis court on a hill some 
distance away and what was really strange was while the tar on this court had been torn up 
none of it was actually overturned so theories ranged widely as to what could have caused this 
anything from a gas explosion or a whirlwind but these theories had to be discarded it did not 
account for the ufo sightings and one gentleman a astronomer by the name of mr e van zyl he examined 
the tennis courts and found no evidence of heat or melting and according to one source there were 
in fact different sets of symmetrically placed imprints found on this tennis court 
there was further evidence that something had been there because following this incident a large blue 
gum tree located right next to the tennis courts showed signs of damage possibly scorching 
because the green shoots at the base of the tree mysteriously died off and some of the leaves had been torn off and the foliage itself was withered these landing traces became 
very well known they were viewed by hundreds of people people crowded around these 
tennis courts nobody was able to provide any explanation other than that a ufo of some kind 
had caused them so why this ufo landed on these tennis courts and tore them up remains a mystery 
perhaps it left this evidence on purpose sort of a calling card to announce its presence 
i I can only speculate but it is an excellent landing trace case
one year later october 6 1973 mr and miss nr of saint matthias deshambly in quebec canada 
were taking a walk near their home when they saw a brilliant light rising from the field and the next 
the next morning there were still activity they saw smoke rising from this field in the same area 
and looking they saw this yellow dome-shaped object and as they watched this object 
emitted another object a smaller object came out of the larger one at this point they saw 
five small figures and at first they thought that perhaps they were boy scouts but it was very 
strange because these figures each wore bright yellow suits and what appeared to be a helmet 
and they were moving very quickly carrying something between these two objects 
so they watched this for about 15 minutes at which point they turned away and when they looked back 
this object was gone so they were quite puzzled uh wondering was this boy scouts or what uh they were 
very much puzzled because there was no roads to this area and uh investigation from 
researchers later revealed that their neighbor had seen what was apparently the same object 
take off from this area it was their daughter who first went to investigate 
where this object had landed and she found a 45 foot circle of burned and crushed grass 
and apparently there may have been some radiation because after leaving this area she became quite 
ill with a headache nausea and vomiting this was not verified scientifically but nevertheless this 
remains a very intriguing landing trace case and there are quite a few in canada it was just one 
year later not even on june 25 1974 when mr and miss l of saint cyril de wendover in quebec canada 
saw a red glowing object making a loud thrumming noise just outside their trailer home it was very 
close about 15 feet from their window and looking up they also saw four six foot tall 
robotic-like figures examining the empty trailer next to theirs these were not normal people these 
figures had what looked like glowing red rings around their torsos they floated rather than 
walked and the object itself they said was domed and had red and white lights on top and orange 
lights around the base and was casting yellow beams of light onto the ground investigators 
converged onto the scene and discovered and photographed three sets of tripod imprints 
presumably left by this dome-shaped ufo on the far side of the creek these landing traces 
showed that the grass in this area was swept in a quote nest fashion later this area was mowed down 
and the grass in this area grew twice as high as the other grass nearby 
there was other evidence found including several flat pieces of a quote strange substance of white 
color it was similar to plastic and was found where these robotic like creatures had been seen 
there's no other information in this case but nevertheless it's a very well verified and 
interesting case of a ufo landing trace just a few months later that same year 
also in canada on august 16 1974 three young boys aged 7 to 10 were returning to their homes 
at port coquitlam in british columbia canada they heard a high pitched whining sound 
and saw an object moving over some trees and starting to land in a nearby field 
one of the boys david bates was holding his pet cat the cat became very frightened when 
this object appeared and squirmed and eventually left from david's arms it 
ran just a short distance then dropped in its tracks mysteriously and was unconscious 
the boys looked up at this object they said it had a red light on top and green and white flashing 
lights on its edges it was very very loud making this loud whining noise so loud it hurt their ears 
as this object landed the cat woke up david scooped up his cat again and they approached this 
object to within 150 feet close enough that as it landed they could feel the heat and a blast of 
dust coming from this object they could also see landing legs and blue sparks coming from 
underneath the object the object they said was saucer shaped it had a weird 
chain like markings around the circumference and as they watched they could also see a doorway 
and seeing this doorway was enough to frighten them away they fled the area in fear and ran home 
ran inside said there was a ufo outside they slammed the door closed locked it ran to the 
windows started closing all the shutters no one believed them until the next day when 
they returned with the neighbor and found landing traces indentations on the ground and burned marks 
one this neighbor actually touched the landing traces and she said her hand instantly became numb 
they called ufo researchers who investigated this area and based on the size of the landing 
trace cases they determined that this object was about 20 feet in diameter 
and not only was there crushed grass but they also found a chalk like dust they brought 
out a radiation detector but found no evidence of radiation one interesting detail was noted 
the mother of one of the witnesses david bates mother said that her clock had mysteriously run 
one hour ahead on the night of the incident she couldn't explain it this was something that 
never happened before or since so there are some very interesting details to this case but most 
important here are these landing traces all right moving along still that same year again in canada 
just two weeks later actually and september 1st 1974 is one of canada's most famous cases 
of all the main witness is a farmer by the name of edwin fuhrer of langenberg in saskatchewan canada 
he was out in the fields next to his home he grows a crop called rape and he 
saw a bun shaped metallic object hovering one foot over the crops in his field 
and there were four other objects hovering slightly higher nearby and he's walked around 
this object he approached right close to it and he could see that the grass was being swirled 
in a clockwise motion and seeing that this object was spinning and swirling this grass 
he became alarmed and stepped back a little bit but still observed it from a very near location 
and watched these objects for about 15 minutes and finally after 15 minutes this one object 
lifted up emitting a vapor or mist and a strong blast of wind and it left followed by the four 
other objects he called the police the constables who came and verified the incident 
according to edwin fur his cattle did seem to react to the presence of this object 
and police investigators later found other weird landing traces circles 
in this same area and according to constable mourier and I quote they took me out to where 
they'd seen these things in the grass I saw the rings something was there and I doubt 
it was a hoax there was no indication anything had been wheeled in or out and mr fuhrer seemed 
genuinely scared it's a very well verified case of a ufo landing trace 
and here we go with another one also in canada this occurred on july 6 1975 
in an area known as mount pleasant in ontario canada this is also a very famous case 
the main witness is a tobacco farmer by the name of joe borda who saw what looked like a silver 
dome-shaped object land in his tobacco field and his first thought that was that it was perhaps 
his neighbor's irrigation truck those neighbors said no that could not be because they were not in 
that area at that time and of course this object didn't look like a tractor with silver and domed 
and joel started to approach it when he heard a voice say to him do not pay attention 
go away which he did and when he looked again this object was gone but investigating 
where it had landed he found a circular depression about 20 to 30 feet in diameter 
some of the grass in this area was burnt some of the tobacco plants rather 
a greenish blue oily residue was also found police arrived they took samples and they told 
joe that they believed the marks and the residue were caused by lightning strike something which 
joe borda disagreed with it was a ridiculous debunking explanation he called ufo researchers 
and together they tried for years to get the results back from these scientific labs but 
were never able to get them later what appeared to be intelligence officers from the u.s arrived 
and they seemed to know exactly where this ufo had landed because they went straight to the 
landing site and gathered samples joe borda ran out ran out there confronted them and basically 
ordered them off his property but they already got their samples and they were gone so this is a case 
that has never been solved an investigator has written a book about this case and it is another very well verified case of a landing trace and again these occur all over the world 
one year later in february of 1976 there was an excellent case in kettering in tasmania the main 
witness is anonymous a 39 year old man who was woken up by his young child crying in his home 
and looking outside he saw what he first thought was a plane coming down from the east towards the 
shore of little oyster cove and he could see a widespread glow emanating from this area so 
thinking that it was a plane accident he quickly approached this area still dressed in his sleeping 
clothes and from a little hill looking down he had an unobstructed view about 75 feet away and saw 
a dome-shaped object it had little portholes around the object which were giving off a bright 
light he said the exterior of this object looked like aluminum with ribbing or ridging going down 
from the top of this object and below the windows there was a small ledge that led to the base with 
a short vertical side there was three or four win windows and through these windows you could 
see a tall cylindrical shaped feature which looked very much like a ship's compass mounting he said 
he also saw motionless grey shapes which he thought were perhaps seats with head rests 
or perhaps even entities he did hear a humming noise like an electric motor 
and he heard this as he approached this object and at some point this object rose from the ground 
the noise became much louder it gained elevation slowly and once it got up into the sky it darted 
off at high speed was a little dot in the sky and was gone the witness estimates this whole incident 
lasted about seven minutes and when morning arrived he went back to this spot and found 
that the rough grass in this area appeared to be scorched in a circle where the object had landed 
all this grass later died and here's where it gets even more interesting following this incident in 
the months later the area where this object had landed the grass grew much tougher and higher 
so the tasmanian ufo investigation center visited the site and verified this landing trace 
area and could see that the affected area stood out as much greener than the surrounding area 
and they could find no significant differences in the thermoluminescent content of the soil 
but the results indicated no large doses of ionizing radiation 
one case which occurred later that year in june of 1976 and actually for many years 
beyond that is a very controversial case and one of the most famous cases in the world it occurred 
in an area by the name of hinwell switzerland and the main witness is a farmer by the name of billy 
meyer billy meyer is of course most famous for taking numerous very clear photographs and films 
of ufos billy meyer says he's been in touch with human looking ets which he calls pleiadians 
or pleijarins his main contact is semyazi this case again is quite controversial there have been 
accusations of a hoax and some evidence of a hoax but a lot of the evidence has never been explained 
there are metal fragments which were investigated by scientist marcel vogel who said were quite 
unusual there are also literally hundreds of witnesses who have seen these ufos in billy 
myers presence which have never been explained so this case did somewhat divide the ufo community 
there are some who insist it's a hoax and some who say no it's absolutely valid but interesting here 
there are many examples of landing trace cases that have never been explained these include 
circular depressions and a triangular formation of swirled and crushed grass as well as melted 
ice and snow there are numerous books about this case written primarily by wendell stevens who 
is a big believer in this case researcher gary kinder also wrote the book light years and came 
away convinced and there are other books on this case many people still stand behind billy meyer 
i present this case for what it's worth because it does involve numerous landing trace
evidence which occurred not only in 1976 but 77 78 and in the years beyond this 
so make of it what you will and it's certainly not the only case another very impressive case 
occurred on october 8 1978 in jenkins missouri this occurred early in the morning at 7 00 a.m 
when a farming family noticed an unusual object in the field south of their home it was about 
185 feet from their house so they couldn't make it out too clearly and at first they didn't realize 
it was unusual and they speculated that perhaps a large piece of trash or something had been 
blown over to this area the previous evening so while they did see it and saw that it was unusual 
sort of dome-shaped they did not at first go to investigate it there were six family members 
five adults and a teenager who continued to glance at this object over the next two hours but it just 
stayed there in place it was around 9 00 a.m when the owner of the house was leaving the house to 
do some chores and at that moment he watched as this object rapidly rose from the ground 
to a height of about 30 to 50 feet everyone else in the house ran out to watch 
and they all watched this object move slowly and silently to the west ascending rapidly it turned 
twice and gradually flew away and as they watched it they saw a second larger and more distant 
object also in the sky and these two objects came close together and moved off in tandem 
they described this object as looking like an oval or egg shape it was white when it was on 
the ground but when it went into the sky it appeared to be more silvery and reflective 
and they estimated that its size was about four to five feet on the longer dimension 
and three to four feet in the other direction they also noted that one surface was darker in tone 
and they could they knew this because they could see that this object was in fact rotating so after 
it left they immediately called the sheriff's department a deputy arrived that afternoon and 
went to the landing site he took pictures as well as soil samples and he could see a noticeable 
trace on the ground which measured four and a half feet long and three and a half feet wide 
and this these landing traces were described as depressed vegetation crushed vegetation 
not burnt nor dried and the soil moisture in this area was normal this object did not 
appear to be very heavy because the ground itself was not affected just the vegetation 
radiation readings were taken and there was no evidence of radio activity 
this was investigated by ufo trace expert ted phillips however as time went on there was 
other effects noted and in fact the area where this grass had land 
or this object had landed the grass deteriorated in exactly this area 
also the grass in this area was also swirled the case was investigated by mufon and qfos 
and they verified these landing traces and said that the grass appeared to be 
slightly burnt or perhaps discolored like a spot which had been over fertilized 
they did take samples sent them to a college laboratory which showed no unusual chemicals 
or volatile organics or solvents or fertilizer or anything it was not a balloon because they asked 
the farmer and he said oh yeah he had recovered weather balloons previously and he knew very well 
what these looked like there were cows in this area who did not react to the presence of this 
object but nevertheless it's a very well verified case there's multiple witnesses landing traces 
which were tested in a lab and verified by police and ufo investigators so yeah it's a great case
next case I'd like to talk about occurred in west lothian scotland and has come to be known as the 
dechmont woods incident this occurred in the dutch mount woods on november 9 1979 the main witness 
is forestry worker robert taylor he had gone into the detriment woods he parked his truck and walked 
with his dog into the forest about a thousand feet into the forest to pick some saplings 
and that's when he came upon a clearing inside of which there was a 20 foot wide silvery object 
he said it was silvery gray rough textured metallic and had some weird protrusions on it 
and he said it looked almost camouflaged so he approached closer to investigate at which point 
two small three foot wide metallic spheres came out they reminded him of sea mines and they made a 
weird plopping noise as they rolled towards him along the ground and before he could get away 
they attached themselves to his legs to his pants and began hissing and emitting a terrible odor 
which he said was like burning automobile brake linings this caused them to cough and gasp for air 
and these little circular objects started to drag roberts towards the larger object 
and at this point he lost consciousness he woke up an undetermined time later 
he was quite weak he was unable to speak he had a powerful headache and he was very much disoriented 
he made it back to his truck and drove home didn't make it all the way home he crashed his 
truck into a ditch and had to walk the rest of the way but he finally made it home stumbled into 
his house his wife was absolutely shocked to see his condition and she wanted to call the police 
but robert was hesitant to do that because he didn't think they would believe him so they called 
a friend and a doctor and the next day robert taylor and his friend returned to the site of 
the event and discovered strange indentations on the forest floor one of these sets of indentations 
was described as looking very much like rungs in a ladder while the other indentations which numbered 
about 40 in total were suspected to be tracks left by these smaller objects these round spheres 
there were no scorch marks seen on the forest floor this was eventually investigated by the 
police the staff of the livingston development corporation also took photographs of the scene 
ufo researchers became interested and interviewed robert taylor and also investigated the area 
the only tracks found were these weird markings on the earth and this case has now become very well known and is in fact one of scotland's most famous cases
another very very famous case occurred in the late days of december 1980 over a period of days 
actually and this has come to be known as the bent waters incident or the rendelsham forest incident 
this is in england and it was a days long event involving dozens of witnesses multiple 
objects some sent down beams of light and at least one of these objects landed 
in the forest itself there were witnesses who were able to approach and walk around this object or 
even touch it some did experience physiological reactions as a result 
there was a lot of other witnesses in the area who lived around who saw these strange lights 
many reported animal reactions there was official confirmation from the government 
that this object did in fact land and was seen by many many of the military officers 
so it's a very well verified event there are over a dozen books on this case it's a very complicated 
case so I won't get into all the details other than to say that there was landing trace evidence 
the area where this object had landed they found little holes where these apparent 
legs or landing gear had landed also radiation readings were taken and were 
found to be significantly higher where this object had landed than in the surrounding area 
so many people know about this case but what is not well known is that there are landing traces 
which were scientifically verified just days later france's best verified ufo landing trace occurred 
on january 8 1981 the main witness is a man by the name of renato nicolai and this 
occurred in an area called trans on provence in france and renato nikolai was outside his home 
when he heard a whistling sound he turned around and saw that a classic metallic saucer 
had landed in his field this object took off almost immediately but looking where it had landed 
he saw burn marks and significant depressions on the ground he immediately called the police 
and ufo investigators also arrived and this soon became one of the most studied landing trace cases 
really in the world samples were taken multiple samples and studied in multiple scientific labs 
french investigators studied these landing marks and determined that this object must have weighed 
about four to five tons and heated the ground to a temperature of about an estimated 570 
to 1100 degrees fahrenheit so very very hot inside this ring where the object had landed 
the soil was crushed and the chlorophyll and the plants and vegetation were largely destroyed there 
was possible radiation the plants themselves appeared to have been aged as if their growth 
was accelerated and judging from how deep the soil was depressed yeah this object was very very heavy 
four to five tons it's quite amazing it's one of the most studied and best verified ufo landings 
not only in france but in all of ufo history and is definitely france's most famous landing trace 
case next to the maurice mass case in valencia
now I'd like to move on to another case which occurred in the united states on june 30 1983. 
the main witness is debbie jordan cobble she was also known as kathy davis and became the 
star witness in bud hopkins book intruders this occurred in a small town outside of indianapolis 
indiana but is often labeled the copley woods ufo landing it's quite a complicated case 
uh debbie jordan on that evening saw that the door to her pool house was open and glowing with 
a weird light she checked again and saw that the light was now out and the door was closed 
she was going off to her neighbor's house but her mom called her back and said that there was 
this weird glowing light outside so debbie came back and went into the backyard to investigate 
and walked straight into one of the most traumatic ufo encounters of her life it was this incident that woke her up to the fact that she was in fact a lifelong contact tee 
what she remembered on this particular evening was being branded blinded by a very bright white light 
she saw other lights this was quite an involved experience but at one point she saw an 8 to 10 
foot egg-shaped object landed in her backyard and there were six short figures with large heads 
lined up alongside it who entered into the object at this point debbie's memory became somewhat 
shrouded in amnesia she returned to the house to find that she had been missing and her mom was 
quite concerned was about to call the police and as debbie says and I quote it seemed I was gone 
about two hours but I only remembered about 15 minutes worth of the experience but her memory 
was quite clouded at this point she didn't realize how unusual this event was did not remember 
and shortly after it occurred she and other family members decided to go swimming and this is when 
they first noticed something very unusual and I will just quote debbie directly as debbie says 
as we walked through the backyard to the swimming pool my neighbor's daughter suddenly jumped up 
and yelled ouch she said something she said she had stepped on something that made her foot burn 
and now her foot was getting numb by the time we reached the pool she said her foot felt numb 
all the way to the knee but yet she could walk on it we weren't in the pool more than 10 or 15 
minutes when we all started feeling nauseated and my eyesight started getting real fuzzy 
even though I had not had my head underwater I could see halos all around the outside lights 
and it was making me dizzy the girls left and I went to bed
the next morning debbie woke up to find that her eyes were swollen shut she was rushed to 
the hospital and sent to see a specialist and as she says the doctor was stunned at the extent of 
my injury he kept asking me if I had looked into the ark of a welder's torch or the sun I had not 
i was given several tubes of cream and some drops to try to heal my eyes according to debbie it took 
several weeks for her eyes to recover and to this day they are sensitive to light 
she's farsighted and still her eyes will burn and turn red and she still has problems with it 
a few days later for the july 4th celebration they went into the backyard 
and this is when they really noticed the landing traces and again I'd like to quote debbie directly as she says my nephew was the first to notice the marks in the yard 
it was an eight-foot circle with a 20-foot swath coming off it the swath ended in a perfect arch 
and was exactly two feet wide all the grass in this mark was brownish gray and wilted 
the dirt was gray and hard the first thing my mother said when she saw that mark was 
oh that's where our ufo landed I just looked at her like she was nuts and I thought to myself what 
is wrong with her suddenly as I looked at this mark I began to panic I could feel my pulse race 
and the sweat beating on my brow I started feeling faint and I started remembering without hypnosis 
so she began to recall seeing this craft had landed figures and so forth and this caused a 
great deal of consequences for several years she got sick and stayed sick for over a year 
she developed life-threatening allergies rashes fevers swollen glands diarrhea bleeding gums her 
hair started falling out her fingernails grew thin and more she had irregular heartbeat panic attacks 
daily for a long time also her dog became very sick and died two months later significant here 
are these landing traces and as debbie says the mark in the yard remained there for nearly five 
years every year snow melted off of it animals would not walk on it there were no bugs in the 
soil even when the grass finally did begin to grow back the grass in that place was thick rubbery and 
kind of a bluish green color the dandelions that grew around the mark were three times the size of 
normal ones the tomato plants my mom had out by the pool were the size of grapefruits 
but when you tried to eat them they were so acidic the skin on your lips would peel off and the vines 
were as big as round as my forearms the leaves on a patch of trees behind the mark withered 
turned brown and fell off and the power lines above the mark shorted out and blew 
a transformer melted the wiring and blew out the tubes on the heath kit ham radios in the basement 
of the house which was right next to the place in the yard and that's not all debbie later found 
out that her neighbors saw literally hundreds of orbs of light in the trees that night and again 
her case was investigated by bud hopkins who debbie says spent an enormous amount of time 
and money doing a very thorough investigation and debbie was subjected to an array of medical and 
psychological tests she passed a lie detector test and bud hopkins again wrote the book 
intruders the incredible visitations at copley woods and debbie jordan cobble has since written 
a few books herself most notably the book abducted and very recently another book called 
extraordinary contact it's a very well verified landing trace case not to mention 
the pretty alarming physiological effects and all the other eyewitnesses
this next case caught the attention of the entire world when the russian tass 
news service announced that on september 29 1989 a ufo had landed in a park in veronese russia
at the time several children were playing in the veronese park when they observed a pinkish glow 
approaching them in the sky and it got closer and closer and they could now see that this was a deep 
red ball shaped object there were several kids who saw this including lena cerro kina vasya surin
sergey makarov and yulia sholokova and they watched as this object flew around in circles over 
the park for a few minutes and then it disappeared it left moments later it returned hovered briefly 
and began to descend very close to the ground got about a foot or two off the ground when a hatch 
opened up and a very tall wide figure appeared it had very tough long legs very long arms 
and a very small head that's being moved around slowly looking around and 
the children said this figure had what appeared to be three luminous eyes with the middle one 
moving around like radar they also saw a shield like object on its chat on its chest 
this being then closed the hatch and the object landed gently on four legs 
the hatch opened again and three identical huge humanoids again with small 
knob like heads stepped out these ones were silvery overalls and had bronze colored boots 
and they were followed by a fourth figure a strange boxy like robot 
and all four of these figures began to walk around the object 
several times at one point a beam of light was emitted from one of the being's chest it 
hit the ground creating luminous triangles the children thought it was trying to communicate 
they were also surprised when at one point the craft and the beings themselves became 
invisible and then reappeared at one point the one of the children one of the boys 
screamed in fear and at that point he was unable to move and then one of the beings looked at a boy 
and pointed a tube-like instrument at him and this boy disappeared when this luminous beam hit him 
and uh other children described this craft as having a weird h-like symbol 
which interestingly had been reported by other people in different ufo incidents 
after just a few moments the figures returned back to the craft closed the hatch and 
it lifted off the ground at which point the boy who had disappeared reappeared and 
that was the end of the incident a huge investigation followed and it turned out 
that people had seen ufos in this area prior to the incident and afterwards 
and during this incident there was another witness a police lieutenant by the name of sergey matveyev 
and he said he saw a strange object flying in the sky at the time of this incident 
there were landing traces several different kinds according to generic cilonov who was then head 
of the veronese geophysical laboratory he talked to investigators who identified the landing site 
and they described a circle with a diameter of around 20 feet there were also several dents in 
the ground imprints in the ground that they said looked like elephant footprints there were holes 
in the ground there was crushed grass there was also a poplar tree that appeared to have 
become tilted as a result of this landing radiation detectors were were brought in 
and this area was found to have an above average presence of the radioactive isotope cesium this 
was disputed by some people who thought that perhaps these readings were due to the chernobyl 
nuclear power station accident some three years earlier nevertheless this is a very interesting 
case with multiple and hard physical evidence in the form of landing traces 
next case I'd like to talk about occurred in canada this was in mid-november of 1990
and the main witness is ivan mccoleman he lived in spring bay ontario canada 
and at the time of this incident there was a lot of ufos being seen in the area he himself did not 
see any ufos but when he went out to examine his property he found several weird marks in his field 
and I'll just quote ivan nicoleman directly as ivan says I always go up to my property up there 
which is a hundred acres of ranch and I generally go up once a week to check it I think it was 
the latter part of september when I went up one morning around 10 o'clock and went into where they 
are now located these circles and I found them I could see them before I even got to them there was 
something there that wasn't there before when I got within 20 feet I noticed that the gravel which 
was always there and was packed very tight there had been sucked right away in two different places 
and the diameter of both circles would be about six feet I guess and the gravel was sucked 
right away right down to the bare rock I looked at them for I suppose 15 or 20 minutes 
i had no idea what they were although I've heard about these markings from other places 
this was the first one I had ever seen that I found on my own property 
so while he did not see any ufos in this area he did see the marks and other witnesses 
in the area had seen ufos so it's a fairly well verified landing trace 
case and another case occurred some years later on october 24th 1998 the main witness is anonymous 
her name is miss h and she lived in an area known as grand mare quebec 
looking outside her home late one evening she noticed two strange figures in 
her neighbor's vegetable garden she says they were dressed completely in white and looked like 
astronauts wearing helmets they were leaning over and picking something up off the ground 
she said they floated rather than walked she also said that there was a strange glowing 
fog surrounding them she watched for about three minutes at which point she realized how unusual 
these were they probably weren't human and she became quite frightened she turned away and when 
she finally got the courage to look out the window again they were gone she called ufo researchers 
who were very impressed and according to the report by the investigators and I quote 
when visited by our representative ground traces were noted and photographed 
there were four of them two measuring twelve inches in diameter and two ten inches five 
identical holes of two inches in diameter by eight inches deep were discovered photos were taken some 
footprints which seemed to correspond to club feet were also noted soil samples were collected 
and members of the team noticed a great difference in the texture of the dirt 
the dirt found inside the holes seems to have been completely sieved and was brown in color while 
the dirt outside the holes from one to twenty feet away was of a thick consistency and rich 
like normal garden black earth so again and again we see it's not only affecting the soil 
it is causing deep depressions it's affecting the vegetation sometimes burning it sometimes 
causing the vegetation to grow in weird ways many different types of landing trace cases
another very interesting and relatively recent case occurred on august 11 2003 
this was in cesinic poland and again occurred on august 11 2003 at 5 00 a.m when a man by 
the name of lek chasinski was driving down the road and he saw three strange figures standing 
on the shoulder of the road ahead of him they were wearing uniforms that reminded him of an astronaut 
and they were standing in a perfect triangle formation and as he drove up to them he could 
see that these were not normal people they weren't astronauts and he stopped his car and these three 
beings moved right in front of his car still keeping in the same triangular pattern and one 
of these beings raised his arm as if signaling uh lek to come to a complete stop which he did 
and he heard no audible voice but he did hear something in his head to let it telepathically 
mentally telling him to stop and he says at this point he felt almost paralyzed and these beings 
were right in front of his car so he could see them fairly clearly through their darkened helmet 
he could make out no real facial features except for big black eyes on the top of the helmet there 
was a weird device that he first thought might be a communications device he wanted to run away 
but before he could a strong beam of light came up from the top of one of these beings helmets and he 
heard this question mentally do you hear us and he mentally answered back yes he got out of his car 
and these beings started to ask him questions the first question they asked him was what type of material is your car made of and he did his best to answer 
he now got a very good look at these beings and he said that their suits were bluish in 
color the shoes had a metallic look and on the chest of these beings there was a rectangular 
device that looked electronic because it had lights moving on it and these beings began to 
ask them all kinds of questions such as what kind of material are your clothes made of 
how does your vehicle work what kind of fuel does it use lek answered these questions 
telepathically and then they told him that they had come to deliver a message to the inhabitants 
of earth and what they told him was that we should care about our planet our water our atmosphere and 
our air and they told him if we neglect our environment this will cause our destruction 
and finally towards the end of this counter lectricinski asked one of the beings a question 
asking them where do you come from and they gave him a kind of strange answer and said eight galaxy 
at this point the three figures began to float up into the air and levitated towards their ship 
which was parked about 300 feet away off in the field by the road and 
a beam came out of the bottom of the ship and struck the three figures at which point 
they were taken inside the craft a strange fog or mist appeared around this object 
lek could see that this object was sitting on three legs and had multi-colored lights all over 
it the ship rose up into the air about 50 feet high and disappeared from sight and this was 
when he saw what looked like crushed circles of grass beneath where this craft had landed 
and it's a very interesting landing trace case these landing traces came in the form of a large 
circle of crushed or swirled grass with six smaller circles situated in a perfect triangular 
formation around the circumference of this craft it's a very interesting landing trace case
and the last case I want to talk about is somewhat controversial 
but it's very interesting and quite recent so I thought it deserved a place on this list this occurred on october 8 2005 in the city of sarajevo this is located in the federation of 
bosnia and herzegovina this case comes from a gentleman by the name of rudolph bosniak 
and what's very interesting about this case is that there was a news reporter who was being 
interviewed and the cameraman actually caught videotape of this ufo that was hovering in the 
area shortly before these landing trace evidence was found a short distance away in sarajevo 
and I provide a link to this video in the notes on this channel uh on my youtube channel 
if you'd like to take a look at the video and you can make up your own mind about it 
but what's very interesting as you can see in this video this round saucer-shaped object you can see 
witnesses looking at it and pointing and according to rudolph bosniak it left landing traces 
as he says the ufo left traces as landing points in front of the people's theater in sarajevo 
and this was apparently taken quite seriously and was published in newspapers in sarajevo 
so it's quite an interesting although controversial case so there you go 
that's more than 30 cases involving ufo landing traces that's a lot but it should only be 
considered a representative sample because there are a lot more than I presented here 
these cases reach back decades cases I presented here reach back to the 1960s but 
i do know of cases that predate that and they are still occurring to the present day another 
very interesting aspect of these cases is how widespread they are occurring all over our planet 
what's also very interesting about the ufo landing trace cases is the variations of the types of 
landing traces it's not only crushed vegetation and swirled grass there are indentations in 
the ground gouge marks sometimes the soil is pressed down what by what appears to be a very 
heavy weight some of these cases involve soil that's been exposed to a very high heat source 
some involve radiation and in fact we see physiological effects in some of the witnesses 
who have gotten ill with what appears to be some type of mild radiation poisoning 
people talk about their fingers becoming numb after touching the soil also very 
interesting are the cases in which there has been alterations to the plant growth not only are the 
is the vegetation being burned but in some cases the vegetation appears to be have accelerated 
growth so that is also very interesting I think an important takeaway from these cases is that they 
show that this phenomenon is physical these objects are altering the terrain in a way 
that this could not possibly be explained as a psychological phenomena which many skeptics have 
tried to do also very interesting are these cases sometimes involve a wide variety of evidence it's 
there are multiple witness sightings sometimes there are humanoids being seen 
some of these cases have photographs animal effects there's a wide variety of things 
going on here so this the most important aspect of this case is that it does provide hard physical 
evidence and skeptics really don't have a leg to stand on in these cases because they prove 
ufo reality and I wonder if that is why these landings are taking place this is pure speculation 
but why are these objects coming in for a landing most of these cases do not appear to involve what 
we would term onboard ufo encounters or abductions sometimes they're coming out to perhaps pick 
flowers or dig in the soil but sometimes they seem to just land and take off and I'm wondering if 
they are doing that as a sort of display to prove their presence and provide hard physical evidence 
for all of us again that's pure speculation I don't know but it does raise an interesting point 
but most importantly this is hard physical evidence that deserves a lot more attention 
than it's getting and that's really why I wanted to do this episode for you today I hope you've enjoyed it I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until 
next time keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most importantly keep having fun.
