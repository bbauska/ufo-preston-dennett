THE WHITE WITCH & GHOSTS OF THE INDIAN BURIAL GROUND
Sep 16, 2022

Summary:
Sep 16, 2022
A ghostly encounter is one of the most commonly reported types of paranormal experiences. Ghosts can manifest in a wide variety of ways, including opening and closing doors, moving objects, turning lights on and off, phantom footsteps, cold-spots, unexplained odors, full-color apparitions and much more. Sometimes a home or specific structure is haunted, but other times a haunting can encompass a much larger area.

This video presents two cases of large-scale hauntings, both involving numerous firsthand witnesses encountering ghosts over a wide area with a large variety of paranormal manifestations.

The first case has come to be known as "The White Witch." This case takes place near the Oakland/El Sobrante area of northern California. There are a few different versions explaining the actual origins of the haunting, but most people report the same type of manifestation: a ghostly apparition of a tall glowing lady who wanders the areas of Alvarado Park, Tilden Park and Joaquin Miller Park. Although the case has become something of a local urban legend, there are numerous reported accounts of people who claim to have seen the apparition.

One group of witnesses involves five young men who had a hostile encounter with the White Witch in 1990. It was an encounter that left them badly frightened and convinced them forever that the White Witch is very real indeed.

The second case in this video is "The Ghosts of the Indian Burial Ground." This case takes in place Topanga Canyon, located in the Santa Monica Mountains adjacent to Los Angeles, California. The center of the haunting is at the entrance of Topanga State Park, the former location of a Chumash Native American settlement and alleged burial ground. The haunting has affected at least six separate homes and a part of the Trippet Ranch/Topanga State Park. The haunting activity reaches back several decades and is still going on today. The activity includes strange noises, moving objects, ghostly footsteps, weird presences, apparitions and more. The haunting is very well-known among the local residents, most who have remained quiet about what is going on.

These two locations are good examples of on-going active hauntings, and if anyone wants to experience a ghost, both locations are open to the public. To explore more about these hauntings and many others, check out my book, "California Ghosts: True Accounts of Hauntings in the Golden State," published by Schiffer Books. Now available!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today I'd like to talk about the Paranormal more specifically ghosts 
I have two very interesting ghost stories to tell you today and I call this episode the White Witch 
and ghosts of the Indian burial ground these are two very interesting haunting cases which 
I find interesting because both are taking place in a very specific area both have had activity 
for a very long time and both involve multiple Witnesses and a wide variety of manifestations 
I think they have a lot a lot to say about the nature of the Paranormal and ghostly phenomenon 
so let's just get started in the first case I want to talk about is the White Witch 
this is a very well-known Haunting in the El sobranto Oakland area it's somewhere around 
Tilden Park Alvarado Park some say it's taking place in Joaquin Miller Park it has become 
something of an urban legend and there's quite a bit of variations in the story about how this 
haunting began and has manifested but as we get into it you'll see it's quite an interesting story 
so there are a lot of stories about the White Witch there's quite a bit of variation and what 
I would call contradictions or discrepancies and how this haunting began some say it was the cause 
of a lady whose daughter died in a fire after a handsome sailor tried to seduce the daughter 
others say that the lady died in a carriage accident there appears to be a number of differing 
testimonies about how this haunting actually began but what got me interested in this case was that 
I was able to interview a group of five young men who were first-hand witnesses to this ghost 
so this is a very famous Haunting in the El sobranto area something of an 
urban legend as I said which has now been supported by numerous eyewitness testimonies 
there is in fact a full-length book written on this case it's called Juanita Miller the White 
Witch and some people believe that it is in fact Juanita Miller the daughter of Joaquin Miller who 
is the source of this haunting others feel that it might be a different entity entirely at any rate 
there are numerous people who have seen a ghostly figure in the Alvarado Tilden Park area and uh in 
the book written on this case there are numerous first-hand accounts there are many accounts also on the internet I do know of one account involving two ladies who are riding horseback 
on the back roads of the Foothills in this area when they reportedly encountered the White Witch 
there are writing police peacefully when they heard a strange noise behind them and they turned 
around and saw the tall white form of a ghost hovering behind them they became very frightened 
and took off out of gallop and to their surprise this ghostly figure easily kept up with them 
they slowed down and the ghosts slowed down they sped up and again the ghost matched their speed 
and after a long hair-raising Gallop that went on for several minutes the ghost stopped the chase 
however the two women kept Galloping away and that is their testimony but some of these testimonies 
are quite bizarre numerous people have reportedly seen this figure wandering around the trails and 
the back roads of this Park area but there are a few accounts of people who have reportedly 
seen this Apparition riding on the backs of cows so this does sound like a strange urban legend 
but it's very well known many people have seen this one lady she reported about it and 
said that there's a lot of fog in this area now perhaps that's what people were seeing 
but after talking to some first-hand witnesses it's clear to me that this is in fact a real case 
I was able to interview five young men who were all members of a newly formed heavy metal rock 
band these were boys who ranged in age from around 17 to 22. they were all residents of El Sobrante 
they were friends of a family friend and that's how I heard about this case and one summer evening 
in 1990 they were searching for an inspiration to write some new songs and that's when one of 
them brought up the legend of the White Witch they lived quite near Alvarado and Tilden Park and none 
of them really believed the stories though part of them wondered if the White Witch was actually real 
so one of them got the idea to go on an impromptu Ghost Hunt they talked about it for a while and 
being young and brave they decided why not let's go out there and see if we can call forth this 
ghost because according to some of the accounts the ghost is attracted to young blonde men and 
one of them was blonde his name is John and they decided the kids decided that they would 
use John as bait for the ghost so the five of them waited until past midnight when the ghost 
was reportedly supposed to appear they then piled into their truck and set off towards Alvarado Park 
and none of them expected this idea to work they were just out there having fun they were more Curious and playful about the idea and weren't really expecting to see anything 
so none of them were at all prepared for what was about to happen to them they pulled up to 
the park got out of their truck and hiked up to a little bench near the center of the park 
and they sat there for about 15 minutes and just as they expected there was no ghost disappointed 
but not surprised they decided to leave and they all stood up and began walking back to 
their truck and it was at this exact moment that the White Witch made a dramatic appearance and as 
soon as it appeared they all completely panicked John who was bait for the Ghost says and I quote 
we started walking up the path to go back up towards the truck and she started walking up on us 
she meaning the White Witch and as John says everybody started racing for the truck our 
ex-drummer turned around and looked and then we all looked and it was like ah and we ran 
so as they ran this ghostly figure chased them and it was about 10 feet behind them 
another one of the witnesses Tom remembers the incident vividly and it's he says 
we were just ready to leave the place when she came out and started coming towards us 
so we kind of split real quick we saw her and then she started coming toward us and we kind of bugged 
so this ghost was so close they couldn't help but get a pretty good view of her and as Tom says 
she was white and she was pretty tall she was almost six feet and she kind of hovered above 
the ground there were no feet just her and her dress following behind her it was really 
trippy I was kind of worried about getting out of there so despite the close proximity of the ghost 
most of the guys there admit that they were too frightened to carefully observe it and as John 
says all I really saw was a big white flash because I turned looked and ran and the other 
three pretty much said the same thing but it was Tom who got the clearest View and as he says you 
could kind of see through her especially at the end of her dress she put off a pretty bright glow 
so all five witnesses ran screaming towards the truck and as soon as they reached it they piled 
in and raced away not even looking back all of them admit that they were pretty frightened by 
this and after a few minutes of racing down the narrow streets at top speeds they finally stopped 
the truck and began excitedly talking about what they had just seen there was no doubt in any 
of their minds what it was they had absolutely encountered the infamous white witch in all her 
Blaze and Glory none of them could even believe their own eyes but their hearts were beating fast 
they were scared and uh yet at the same time they began to doubt their eyes had they really 
encountered the White Witch and because it seemed so easy they just went out there and there she was 
and none of them really wanted to admit to each other that they were actually scared and peer pressure being what it is the five boys soon found themselves deciding to head back deeper into the 
park to see if they could provoke the White Witch into another appearance so despite the fact that 
none of them really wanted to see it again they turned the truck around and drove back into the 
park where they had just encountered this ghost this time they decided not to leave the car at all 
they stayed in the truck but it wasn't long before they got the confirmation they were looking for 
the White Witch appeared without any warning and again this experience proved more terrifying 
than they expected as they were sitting in the truck suddenly the White Witch appeared 
and then disappeared and appeared in another location and started flashing all around them 
and there was no doubt in their mind that this Apparition whatever it was knew exactly 
where they were and was either trying to scare them or they felt getting ready to attack them 
and it was only then that they realized that they were probably dealing with something a little more powerful and unpredictable than that they had bargained for 
so at this point their priorities changed ghost hunting suddenly lost its charm and 
the only thing the witnesses wanted to do was leave the area as quickly as possible and I'll 
just let Tom describe how this went down as Tom says we went deeper into the park kind of where 
she always hangs out I don't know if it's true but we stayed there for a long time it took us 
a long time to get this close but we took a detour Road and we were resting up and she came out again 
she appeared and disappeared then appeared somewhere else we saw her a couple of times 
and this time John who was the original bait for the ghost got a better view of the White 
Witch and as he says we went to Tilden Park and we were kicking back in the car watching the stars 
and stuff and then we started hearing these dogs barking so we started looking and she came out of 
the Bush we left we didn't stop to look at her she was just a white woman with a long white dress I 
didn't really look at her very well so just like the first time they quickly started the car and 
raced away as fast as they could John however kept his eye on the ghost as they drove away and was 
able to make out more details according to him she was very bright and looked almost physical 
as he says she was pretty solid really bright as long as we drove away I kept my eye on her 
we had a lot of people with us who saw it we all saw it so they drove off and went back home 
having all seen it they were solidly convinced of the white witch's existence but following 
this their desires to continue ghost hunting had vanished and they actually never went out 
there again not late at night they just felt that this Apparition was hostile and it was too scary 
so they rushed home told their friends and their family who I talked to some of them 
and their friends said they were all very excited and obviously telling the truth 
um one of them clearly remembers how scared they all were as they explained what happened 
and as hard as it was for her to accept the White Witch was real it was clear that these 
boys felt that they had encountered her I also talked to John's older sister who 
verified their story and as she says uh my dad wasn't there so I didn't go along I didn't feel 
like being hunted they used my brother for bait because he's blonde and it worked when the boys 
went out there they said they saw her in three different Parks they saw her five times one of 
the times she actually split up into different people because there were five guys that went 
and they were going she's over here no she's over here no she's over here and they were all right 
so what's very interesting about this particular case is that a large number of people have vouched 
for the honesty and the Integrity of these five witnesses there's a little doubt in my 
mind that this incident happened exactly as described so it's a pretty interesting case 
involving so many witnesses who are actually able to provoke this ghost into an appearance 
so this is one of the more famous hauntings in California not only is 
there a full-length book written about it it's become something of an urban legend and those five witnesses who I interviewed will tell you that they will never forget 
what they saw on that summer night in 1990 and needless to say they all now believe in ghosts 
so that is the story of the White Witch a truly bizarre and unusual case of ghostly activity 
in the next case I want to talk about is what I call the ghosts of the Indian burial ground 
this is taking place in Topanga Canyon California more specifically in Topanga Canyon State Park 
this is along Entrada Drive and what's interesting about this case is it does involve numerous 
Witnesses all of whose homes were apparently built on or near a Native American burial ground 
so this is presumably what led to a lot of this activity but as we go through the cases you can 
make up your own mind about it so Topanga Canyon is a small community nestled in the 
Santa Monica Mountains in Southern California it's perhaps best known for the huge amounts of 
UFO activity but what many people don't know is that it also has a lot of ghost activity 
and in fact Topanga Canyon is well known for having been a meeting place for various Native 
American tribes most prominently the Chumash gabriellano Indians and the chuna Chumash name 
for Topanga was where the mountains meet the sea but there are several well-known settlements in 
this area in fact the center of Topanga Canyon where all the shops are built was reportedly a 
settlement the caves above Santa Maria Creek not far from where I used to live as a child 
uh was definitely an area where they hung out there are many caves and you can see 
little rounded grind holes used for grinding buckwheat into flower they're in the stone caves 
uh so there's a lot of evidence of Native American settlements stretching back a few thousand years 
at least but the main area of activity in terms of Haunting activity is up near the entrance of 
Topanga State Park this is about halfway up the street called Entrada near the cross section of 
entrata and another road called Colina so this is located on the actual Chumash settlements 
and I know this is true I had a friend who lived up on Kalina and when we were little kids we were 
playing around with Matchbox cars and we dug out a perfectly shiny very sharp Arrowhead so there's a 
number of artifacts dug up from this exact area so what I found interesting about this case is there 
are at least four or five Homes located almost adjacent to each other and this one exact area 
all of which have reported all kinds of ghostly activity and some of these are built on the 
settlement itself and a few are allegedly built directly on the Native American burial ground 
and uh the first people I interviewed I call them the Hendersons they do not want their real 
name used so that's a pseudonym and they live there in their home right along the edge of the 
Native American burial ground for about three years but it was one day in 1973 when they had a 
very dramatic incident occur it was daytime and Miss Henderson and her four-year-old daughter 
were standing at one end of the living room nobody else was in the room and they watched 
and stunned silence as a pillow on the couch rose up by itself and flew across the room towards them 
as Miss Henderson says the one thing that was really strange was when my daughter and 
I were in the living room and we were maybe eight feet away from the couch and a pillow flew off our couch and onto the floor you know it's the strangest thing I've ever seen 
there's no accounting for it at all it was on the couch leaning against the back of the couch and 
it just flew across the room and landed on the floor it came right near where we were it was 
like somebody had thrown it just like that it was unbelievable it was like did that really happen 
but my daughter saw it happen too I mean I couldn't have imagined it because we both saw 
it happen and she still remembers it she still remembers the color of the pillow it was really 
weird and I keep thinking about that did that really happen yes it did I'm sure it happened 
so this incident marked the beginning of a series of unexplained events in their 
home that left the entire family baffled as to what was going on was shortly after this pillow incident that they began to hear strange noises in the basement 
they said sometimes it sounded like Furniture was being moved around upstairs when nobody was there 
and more often it was this strange tapping noise on the basement wall 
which would happen over and over again usually at the same time every night and they searched and 
searched for the source of this mysterious knocking noises but could never find it 
and as Miss Henderson says we used to hear tapping noises down in the basement wall at night and if 
you were down in the basement it sounded like our chairs were being moved it sounded like that 
but the tapping on the wall that was weird it happened about the same time every night 
we slept in the basement and we were convinced that something was going on in that house 
the tapping it could have been I don't know the pipes but no it wasn't the pipes 
we would have heard it if it was the pipes I don't know what that tapping came from 
so this usually started around eight o'clock it's always this tapping sound 
and usually three TAPS in a row and uh they were skeptical that their house was haunted but 
still they had no explanation for these weird noises or the levitation of this pillow 
so finally after you know going through this for months on end they decided to ask their 
neighbors if they had experienced anything strange or unusual and to their surprise they 
found out that at least two of their neighbors were experiencing similar Paranormal Activity 
the neighbors immediately next door to them so that they were occasionally interrupted by the 
sounds of footsteps traveling through their home and they would rush to see who was there but the 
room would always be empty and a few times the footsteps came when people were actually present 
in the room and they were able to track the footsteps as they actually walked across the room 
but whoever was making these footsteps they were completely invisible so that's one house and the 
next house down the road also experienced an event that the residents feel was unexplained 
one day an upstairs window completely shattered under very mysterious circumstances 
they tried to blame the accident on weather or perhaps pranksters or something but were unable to do so or figure out what had shattered the window 
because it appeared to have come from the inside of the house so alone any of these events might 
seem inconsequential but together they form a pretty alarming pattern the Henderson Family 
had moved into a brand new house nobody had ever lived there before so nobody had died in the house 
there had been no tragedy there but when they found out their neighbors we're also having 
unexplained experiences they decided it must be the area itself and the only thing they could 
think of was that the Chumash Indian burial ground was a mere stone's throw away from the house 
few years later they sold their house and moved out they knew that the new residents had remodeled 
the house and added on a room but as far as they know the new residents did not experience 
any unusual activity however that I asked around I know a lot of people in the canyon and I found out 
that there are in fact other homes right in this exact area that are experiencing haunting activity 
another lady I interviewed I'll call her Pamela Mitchell again she does not want her real name 
used she was only nine years old when her parents moved into a house along Entrada this is just a 
few houses down from where the Hendersons lived and although they only lived there a short time 
it was long enough for Pamela to grow to hate the house when they purchased this property 
their home was little more than a shack with a garage but they knocked the entire house down 
and built a large two-story house and to pass the time Pamela used to go into the backyard and play 
and what she didn't realize at first was that her backyard was directly over the Chumash 
Indian burial ground itself there were all these little uh Stones piled up in various formations 
and at first she thought they were kind of cool and enchanting but for some reason she didn't fully understand at the time it also scared her at this point she 
did not realize that this was in fact the chunash Indian burial ground but several times she would 
be out there playing it would be overcome with the feeling that someone or something was watching her 
although she never actually saw anything she felt like it was an ominous presence that would 
permeate the area and it would get so bad that she would jump up and run as quickly as she could 
to the safety of her home and as she says and I quote on Entrada just beyond second Encina was 
our house and Cena is a road just below Kalina which is where all this activity is taking place 
and as Pamela says on the Land There was a little area of rocks pointed ones of different shapes 
ways to go and play in The Rocks right where there was that little rounded area of rocks 
where the burial ground was and boy did I used to run it was more like a feeling I would always 
feel like they were there and I would run I was eight or nine years old and I would just Jam 
so this occurred several times until she became frightened of the area and avoided it however 
that didn't stop the problem because Pamela began to sense something strange about the house itself 
again this house was new and there was nothing wrong with it in terms of you know someone having 
died there but Pamela couldn't figure out why but this house this house actually terrified her 
it began with just a creepy feeling she didn't like to be left alone in the house her parents had not reported any experiences and when she told them about it they attributed her 
fears to an overactive imagination however she believed that this house was in fact haunted and 
when she was alone in her bedroom at night she began to have a very spooky experiences 
as she says and I quote my bedroom was way on the other side of the house and I was 
so frightened in that house that I would sleep in the living room almost nightly I would wake up and scream and I used to think I saw things I would wake up and scream and nothing 
would come out of my mouth I'd be so freaked out about it so Pam quickly grew to hate and 
fear this house and she was tremendously relieved when her parents decided to move 
and uh she thought perhaps they had had activity too but they never admitted it 
but what's so interesting about this case is it does involve many witnesses and I followed 
yet another witness who was hiking in that area she's quite psychic and she had the sense that 
there was a group of very unhappy or angry Native American Spirits who wanted her out of the area 
so needless to say she left I talked to another witness who went out to the park to meditate 
and she sensed the presence of a small Indian girl looking at her with a very sad expression 
and I talked to yet another witness who said that he was jogging in the state park when he also 
sensed the presence of Native American Spirits who seemed angry that he was intruding on their area 
so after collecting all these accounts I decided to speak publicly about them at the zapanga 
community house they would hold monthly meetings there and I asked to speak and I went up on stage 
and told all these accounts and to my surprise there were numerous people in the audience 
who not only believed it they had their own stories to share there was another 
man who lived on the entrance to Topanga state park right in the exact area where all these 
incidents were occurring and he said that he on numerous occasions he and his whole family saw a 
full color apparitions of Native American Spirits wandering through their house and some of these 
were on horses and some of it was quite violent and that there appeared to be a skirmish of some 
type between the Native American Spirits and white people who were in the area and there was 
at least two other people who came up on stage to share their accounts of similar haunting activity 
and I later learned from a second-hand source that there were other cases in this 
area and in fact a parapsychologist from the UCLA parapsychology Department went up to do research 
so whatever the case it's clear that there is a lot of people reporting ghostly activity in 
this very sharply defined area at the entrance to Topanga Canyon State Park 
so those are the two cases I wanted to share with you today as you can see they're both quite 
impressive in that they do involve a large number of witnesses a lot of different types of ghostly 
manifestations taking place over a long period of time these areas are both really good places to 
go if you want to see a ghost and experience this for yourself that's another reason I really wanted 
to do this video for you today I did present these cases in my book California ghosts and 
uh yeah I think they've got a lot to say about ghostly activity so I hope you've enjoyed this 
episode I truly appreciate you watching thank you very much and until next time keep having fun
