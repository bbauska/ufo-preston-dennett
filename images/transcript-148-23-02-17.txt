INDEPENDENCE DAY UFO ENCOUNTERS
Feb 17, 2023

Summary:
Feb 17, 2023
What’s the most common day to see a UFO? The answer may surprise you: the 4th of July! That’s right, Independence Day produces more UFO reports than any other day. The question is, why? Are people mistaking fireworks for genuine UFOs? Or is something else going on here?

An examination of the UFO reports made on the fourth of July shows some interesting patterns. Many do involve fiery glowing orbs, or what may very well be sky lanterns, also known as party lanterns. These are small paper balloons set aloft with a small candle. They can rise up to 4000 feet and from a distance, look very much like a UFO.

But the fact is, there are literally hundreds of cases where this explanation simply does not fit! Some do look like orbs, however, sky lanterns fizzle out after fifteen minutes, and many of these orb sightings last much longer. Also, orbs cannot turn at right angles, stop still in the sky, or accelerate at high speeds, as many of these orbs do. Furthermore, many of the Independence Day UFO encounters involve structured craft, metallic saucers complete with portholes and multicolored lights. Some cases also involve actual humanoids. Clearly the fireworks explanation doesn’t fit. 

There are so many cases involving UFOs seen on the Fourth of July that it is clear something very profound is happening here. Fireworks appear to be a UFO magnet. Many of the witnesses have come to the conclusion that UFOs are coming down to watch the fireworks show. ETs love fireworks!

But it might be more than this. Remember, on the Fourth of July, millions of people all across the United States flock outside at night and stare upwards. Could it be that the extraterrestrials are aware of this and are using this day as an opportunity to announce their presence. The answer appears to be a big YES! Because many of these reports involve UFOs that not only watch the fireworks show, but they put on a show themselves. They will flash their lights, dart around, and put on a fantastic display for the stunned audience.

This video presents dozens of cases in which UFOs have appeared during fireworks shows all across the United States. Here is what some of the witnesses are saying:

“We were watching fireworks, which were to our east. I noticed the UFO to the north, but said nothing to no one. I observed it for two minutes as it moved silently eastward, then suddenly reversed direction as it picked up speed. Then assuming its original course once again, it moved slowly upwards and out of sight.” –1963, Greensboro, NC.

“There was a tremendous flash of lightning at the same time a firework went off in the sky. I looked up and saw an absolutely huge saucer-shaped object sitting right over the ‘mountain’ we were next to.” –1965, Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY.

“When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft. It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street, where we were all gathered.” –1977, Federal Way, WA.

“[It was] a disc-shaped object displaying multicolored lights in a circle, hovering at what seemed to be 100 feet above us and the gathering crowd.” –1978, Nashua, NH.

“It made no sound. I was scared to death…I wanted to hide under the car…I wanted to scream, but couldn’t. I realized I was not supposed to remember this happening. I kept telling myself, I will remember. The craft’s size was huge, bigger than the fairgrounds bleacher area.” –1980, St. Paul, MN.

“My brother was watching the fireworks when all of a sudden he went as white as a ghost. My mother shouted out, ‘Oh, my God!’ I went to see what was going on…it was the weirdest thing ever, a disc-shaped with small portholes going around its midsection.” –1982, Hermosa Beach, CA.

“Most people don’t get to see a craft that close and distinct. I even saw the molding around the windows…Three Nordic-looking men in white, with blond hair, staring at us as if we were mere cattle. I could see them from the belly up, not sure if they were standing or sitting. They had no apparatus on at all. I never took my eyes off it until it was gone from sight.” –1999, Lancaster, PA.

There are too many cases to deny. The aliens are coming down to watch the fireworks shows, and they are also putting on displays themselves. And in fact, these are more than just simple sightings. Every single one of these cases are actually Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind! Fireworks are evidently an effective method to call down UFOs out of the sky.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
got a pretty interesting episode for you today I think I call this one Independence Day UFO 
encounters so this episode is actually all about people who have seen UFOs on the 4th of July 
as it turns out according to UFO data centers like the National UFO Reporting Center New fork 
and mufon the mutual UFO Network the single most common day of the year to see a UFO is actually 
the Fourth of July when I found that out my first thought was well people are seeing fireworks 
there really is no worse day to see UFOs I thought than on the 4th of July because nobody's going 
to believe you they're just going to assume that you've seen fireworks perhaps the only other worst day would be of course April 1st April Fool's Day but after hearing about so many people 
claiming to see UFOs on the 4th of July I thought I'd take a deeper look and boy was I shocked to 
find out that this is the most common day to see a UFO according to these UFO Reporting centers 
they get about 10 20 cases a day but on the 4th of July it's closer to 50 or 100. 
so clearly is something is going on here and what I did was dive deep into these cases that 
occur on the 4th of July trying to see if people are seeing fireworks or not and I have to tell 
you I went through thousands upon thousands of cases trying to figure out what's going on here 
and it's clear to me that in a good number of these cases people are seeing what we call 
sky lanterns or party lanterns these are little paper balloons that you put a tiny little candle 
in and send them Aloft and they can go up to about 4 000 feet they last for about 15 minutes or so 
and from a distance they look quite impressive they do look like UFOs they can appear to hover 
moving Tandon guard around at fairly high speeds uh and basically mimic a UFO however a lot of 
these cases were clearly not sky lanterns and even some that appeared to be sky lanterns could very 
well not be so it was a little puzzling but after going through the thousands and thousands of cases 
I came to the conclusion that yes the 4th of July is in fact a really good day to see a UFO 
many of these cases involve objects that are moving at very high speeds starting at 
right angles some are clearly structured objects metallic with portholes or colored lights on them 
and it's really interesting because some of them will stay for hours 
many of the witnesses feel like they're these UFOs are coming to basically watch the fireworks show 
and it's really interesting because in some of these cases it's as if the UFO occupants are 
not only coming to watch the fireworks show but know that people are out there watching and will put on a little show themselves like you want to see something spectacular in the sky watch this 
so after examining all these cases I thought this is a really interesting aspect of UFOs 
ufology that hasn't really been explored before and I found about 40 cases I'd like 
to present to you today which all took place on the 4th of July over a period of decades 
so we're going to start from some of the early cases and move to the later ones and see what's going on here so I've got a lot of cases let's just get started
the first case I'd like to talk about took place in Greensboro North Carolina on July 4th 1963 
an anonymous gentleman was with a group of young boys watching a fireworks show on the grounds of the Starmount Forest Country Club in Greensboro 
while watching the fireworks their attention was diverted to a very strange looking saucer-shaped 
object a glowed orange and had a row of about 30 small red lights along the circumference 
so clearly not fireworks and I'll just quote the main witness directly here as he says when 
I saw this UFO I was with a group of boys we were watching fireworks which were to our East 
I noticed the UFO to the north but said nothing to no one I observed it for two minutes as it moved 
silently Eastward and suddenly reversed direction as it picked up speed then assuming its original 
course once again it moved slowly upwards and out of sight was very large and was yellow or orange 
with a row of red lights at its perimeter the sky was clear and somewhat lit up from the fireworks 
the UFO was about a mile away at Treetop level I don't claim that the UFO was extraterrestrial 
but its size and pattern of flight would suggest that it was not a conventional craft 
so this witness was so convinced of the object's strangeness that he actually reported the setting 
to the Air Force's Project Blue Book and provided a detailed report and drawings 
according to the witness it moved away in a zigzag pattern accelerating quite quickly Project 
Blue Book however did not include this in their list of unidentified cases unexplainable cases 
now all these cases took place on Independence Day and this next one took place 
at a farm in Cornwall On Hudson in New York 
this was in 1965 a 13 year old girl who I call Catherine that's not her real name was there watch 
watching the fireworks was a somewhat stormy night with thunder and lightning however the instance 
of fireworks began Catherine was shocked to see something else in the sky and as she says there 
was a tremendous flash of lightning at the same time a firework went off from the sky I looked up 
and saw an absolutely huge saucer-shaped object sitting right over the mountain we were next to 
now this mountain is really just a large Hill locally known as Round Top in fact Catherine had 
hiked up to the top of this hill before because it offered a good view of the local Hudson Valley and 
she said that this object actually hung directly over this hill not very far at all away from where 
they were and again as Catherine says it was huge it was hanging there not moving at all 
there was what I thought to be a window which wrapped all the way around the saucer which was 
opaque there were no pains in the windows or any kind of Divisions but there was an orange 
strobe type light which went around inside the window in a rotating or pulsing fashion after I 
looked up and saw the craft I looked at it briefly turned my head away looked back up and it was gone 
Catherine and her friends who also saw it were shocked and a little bit frightened and as Catherine says after seeing the object my friends and I all almost at the same time decided it was 
time to leave the area although we really didn't discuss what we had seen and come to think of it 
this topic was never discussed amongst us in any of the remaining years we were together at the 
age of 13 I was pretty unnerved by what I had seen and had to walk home alone needless to say I ran 
most of the way and when I got home I told my mom and dad what I had seen but they didn't believe me 
so Catherine this this is not uncommon for parents not to believe their children this did affect her 
profoundly It's Not Unusual for people not to talk about a sighting after it occurred 
and Catherine believes that many other people had to see this object because it was quite apparent 
three years later 1968 there was another sighting in Arlington Massachusetts 
Jessica that's again a pseudonym and her future husband her fiancee 
now we're driving around in the town of Arlington looking for a good place to watch the fireworks 
but as Jessica says we saw something we didn't expect it was a curved string of lights set on 
at an angle just above the rooftops and it was moving uphill at the same speed that we were 
it popped in and out of view as it went behind the tops of trees and houses along the street 
then it began to pick up speed so we accelerated until we were going 70 miles per hour uphill then 
it went faster and faster until we couldn't keep up and it disappeared now Jessica is the only one 
who saw this her boyfriend was driving and had to keep her eyes on the road however she's absolutely convinced she saw a genuine UFO as she says I saw something very odd and the fact that it was 
at Treetop level and accelerated more quickly does seem to point to something very strange 
so yeah there's something going on here here's another case just a few years later 1971 
a gentleman I call Steve and his girlfriend we're hoping to see fireworks uh near their 
home in a Liberal Kansas there's a little Lake there unfortunately the walk to the 
lake took longer than they expected by the time they arrived the fireworks show had finished and people were getting ready to depart the fire department was securing the area he says 
so they missed the fireworks show but they were just in time for an even better show and I'll 
just quote quote Steve here directly as he says we along with numerous kids and adults were about to 
leave when a cigar-shaped object with shining multi-colored lights underneath appeared over 
the lake it hovered for what seemed like 15 or 20 minutes very low over this small Lake 
so all the witnesses who were there remained to watch this until someone exploded a loud m-80 firecracker and at that moment the object left quite quickly 
as the witness says the object raised up a few feet and then swish it was gone 
so this seems to be a good example of a UFO putting on a display to an audience 
and here's another case exactly one year later to the day of course July 4th a young girl I called 
Beth was in the back seat of her parents car along with her older sister her dad was driving and her 
mom was in the front seat and they were on their way home after a fireworks show at Rehoboth Beach 
in Delaware the show had just ended the road was crowded with traffic from other people who had 
seen the fireworks show when without warning Beth and her entire family observed a quote 
silver metallic saucer it hovered him in complete silence only 25 feet above the highway and really 
only about six car lengths in front of them and as the witness says we had a very clear view there 
were three horizontal Parts the middle horizontal part of the craft rotated slowly with red yellow 
and other colored rectangular sections the top and bottom parts were not rotating after a few minutes 
the craft shot up and away at high speeds at about a 45 degree angle again no sound or vibrations 
so another case of a clearly structured craft could not be fireworks
the next case took place exactly one year later in Patterson New Jersey and this is a case that 
does involve an object that looks very much like a sky lantern except it clearly wasn't 
the witnesses included a family that was standing on their porch to watch the nearby fireworks 
display was something they had done for many years however this year something different happened 
as one of the family members rights we casually noticed a bright venus-like object slowly rise 
over the horizon and appearing to move towards us it appeared to grow somewhat larger as it 
approached and after a while it appeared to have stopped dead in the sky in our Clear View 
as Darkness set the fireworks started after about 45 minutes to an hour the 
display ended and we continued to sit on the front porch we then noticed that the object appeared to be floating away back in the return direction from which it had came 
now could this be a sky lantern the movement's definitely consistent with one however there's 
a problem to this Theory and as the witness says I estimate that from the time we first 
noticed the light and the time it finally disappeared it was probably about two hours 
so sky lanterns last only 15 minutes so clearly not a sky lantern
and sometimes yeah it is the length of the sighting that proves these objects aren't sky lanterns but other times it's the way they move 
consider what happened to a husband and wife in a campground in Rio Grande New Jersey 
it was around midnight July 4th 1975 when the husband noticed quote hundreds of star-like 
objects he said they were flying in intricate formations across the sky his wife saw them too 
as the husband says and I quote hundreds of Starlight objects in one formation 
flew intricate military-like flight patterns from Horizon to Horizon they flew in perfect 
synchronization changing direction and speed so as they're watching this they discuss what they were 
seeing and agreed on the details did not appear to be any types of fireworks or laser show but it 
was really the Maneuvers that impressed them the most because as the witness says after a 
few minutes the objects separated into multiple groups and flew different patterns in quadrants 
each group was still in perfect sync with their group then they reunited into one formation and 
zoomed away beyond our visibility so this could be sky lanterns but it doesn't sound like it 
and here is yet another case one year later July 4th 1976. this took place in O Sable 
Forks New York and this involved a group of at least 50 people who were watching a fireworks 
show and all at once everyone's attention was drawn to a large glowing orb at high altitude 
and as the main witness says the object moved quickly across the sky and stopped instantly 
from super fast speed to a full stop it hovered for some time and then started moving again 
it made a 90 degree turn in mid-flight without losing any speed and continued its flight 
so they watched this for at least 15 minutes but it's the movement that really gives it away 
especially the way it left as the witness says it just warped out I don't know how to explain it any better it just instantly zipped off into outer space if it had winked out I'd be a little 
more suspicious that's not what the witness is describing and here's another case one year later 
again I'm picking and choosing there's a lot of cases to choose from these are some of the best 
and the main witness here was seven years old watching fireworks from his backyard 
in Federal Way Washington and he saw what he first thought was a small plane approaching 
it was well above the fireworks but too low to be a jet and as it came close he saw its true 
shape as the witness says when it finally reached us I saw it was a circular craft 
it hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street where we were all gathered I could see the bottom of it it hovered there with a quiet humming sound but not like any engine 
it had different colored lights on the edges and the bottom it was close 
so this object hovered for about 15 minutes in full view of everybody and then left in a very 
dramatic fashion as the witness says it started to ascend upward somewhat slowly and then suddenly 
it just shot extremely fast straight up above the Earth and became like a small star within 
just a few seconds and then I lost sight of it I've never seen or heard of any mechanical 
thing moving this fast in my life ever since I saw that so this is showing all the observables 
of a genuine UFO craft strange sound strange appearance strange movement strange accelerations 
uh definitely not a sky lantern or a firework and here's another very interesting case 
this occurred in Granby Massachusetts on the exact same evening and the fireworks were about to start 
when a saucer-shaped craft appeared from the East hovering about 500 to 800 feet in altitude 
and as the witness says it was quote close enough to see at least two figures through the window 
that ran around the edge of the saucer craft so yeah these are not just simple sightings sometimes 
humanoids are being seen and the witness estimates that this craft was about 40 feet in diameter 
it hung in place for about three minutes and tilted slightly and zipped off to the southeast 
30 seconds later two jet fighters appeared and went in the same direction so apparently 
chasing this craft which does happen in some of these incidents even more interesting there's 
an interesting endnote the main witness says that this incident did in fact make the newspapers and 
that more than 50 people had seen the object and he later read a follow-up article in the 
same newspaper where he learned that West over Air Force base and a nearby airport had been 
contacted about the incident and were allegedly refusing to release any radar records for that day 
so year after year this is happening one year later Independence Day 1978 two siblings had 
parked their car east of the local General Motors plant in Danville Illinois so they could watch 
the company fireworks shop it was a clear night a soft wind was blowing from west to east and about 
15 minutes into the show the brother and sister noticed a strange looking object on the horizon 
moving Against the Wind from east to west had no lights on it and I didn't really see it until the 
lights from the fireworks actually illuminated the objects they happened to have a pair of binoculars 
and took turns looking through them at the object and they both agreed on the appearance of this UFO 
as one of them says the object looked like three Spears connected together by a Y type structure 
one sphere was attached to each end of the Y and the object appeared to rotate 
and it actually moved low enough over the GM Factory that the lights from the plant illuminated the object itself and this is when they got a really clear view of its shape 
and after about two minutes of observation it moved off into the distance 
here's another case the same exact year or same year same date some distance away 
this occurred in Nashua New Hampshire and this involved a craft that hovered an apparent full 
view of a large crowd of people yet only a few people saw it or may have seen it not remember 
the main witness in this case I'll call Henry he was with his family at the Holmen Stadium to 
watch the annual fireworks show the sky had just gotten dark and the show had not quite begun when 
suddenly they saw a quote disc shaped object displaying multi-colored lights in a circle 
hovering at what seemed to be 100 feet above us and the Gathering crowd stayed for 30 seconds and 
then shut off at an angle towards space and in an instant it was gone it made no sound 
so this is very interesting what are UFOs doing hovering over crowds around the time of 
a fireworks show so this was an amazing sighting in and of itself but it was the aftermath that 
left the witness really baffled as he says the odd thing about it is that only one sister and myself 
recall the event the rest of my family although I know they looked right at the object in Wonder 
can't remember seeing it I know for a fact that multiple people saw this UFO has everyone 
forgotten well as you may know if you know anything about UFOs and UFO encounters missing 
time Amnesia is a common pattern so that could be what's going on here it's really quite strange 
here's another case from Sherman Oaks California this occurred in 1979 a family we're all lying on 
the roof of their house to watch the fireworks they lived less than a quarter mile away from 
a community park where fireworks were launched each year the rooftop gave them a fantastic view 
of this fireworks show and the son was watching the fireworks when he saw something else as he 
says I noticed a semi-transparent blimp-shaped object moving very slowly from north to south 
I had to look for a few seconds to figure out that there was an object actually there so this 
was off in the distance it appeared quite large but was hard to see because it seemed to blend 
into the sky but there were no running lights or anything that's associated with normal blimps 
and was also very low he estimates about 1 000 maybe 1500 feet and it got stranger as the witness 
says as it moved close to us I alerted my family to look and they all turned and saw it there were 
four of us on the roof at that moment and two more people in the backyard it came directly overhead 
and then stopped at that exact moment it lit up as a very bright solid white light that appeared to 
be rectangular shaped I would roughly estimate it to be about the size of one or two football fields 
after it became stationary small glowing bright red lights began to shoot out from all around the 
craft they moved out in all directions in straight lines at a rapid rate of speed until each was out 
of sight maybe 20 or 30 total I guess you could call them orbs but they seemed too large to Me 
Maybe the size of vws after they stopped coming out the mother ship blinked out and appeared to 
be gone and the whole experience lasted about 20 minutes so this does not sound like a UF 
or uh fireworks or anything like that sounds like a genuine UFO uh certainly the Witnesses 
believe it was unexplained and as the main witness says it is quote a mystery to this day 
so every year this is happening I'm picking the best case that I could find for each year because 
there's so many and here's one which occurred at the State fairgrounds in Saint Paul Minnesota 
Rebecca that's a pseudonym was with her ex-husband and thousands of other people to watch the fireworks show at the State Fairgrounds people were sitting in bleachers uh 
Rebecca and her husband ex-husband had parked their car out in the surrounding fields to 
enjoy this show free of charge as had many others and we're watching the fireworks when 
a gigantic object abruptly Approach at very low level right overhead from east to west 
as the main witness says when I realized something was happening I couldn't move it was so low you 
could see how it was riveted together the seams of The Craft and all the lighting it made no 
sound I was scared to death and finally leaned to the right and fell off the car I wanted to 
hide under the car I could only get near the tire and wanted to scream but couldn't I realized I 
was not supposed to remember this happening and I kept telling myself I will remember 
craft size was huge bigger than the fairground's bleacher area where they hold concerts and races 
so this craft finally passed overhead and it was weird because Rebecca said that everyone seemed to come out of some sort of hypnotic trance and as Rebecca says it started to rise 
up while heading west and after a period of time I heard a launch of fireworks then slowly another 
and little by little people started moving and talking the oohs and Oz I was able to slowly 
get up and ask my ex if he remembered it he said yes but he acted like he was in a trance 
so Rebecca did feel like she wasn't supposed to talk about the sighting or even remember it and she fought this feeling and insisted that they both draw what they had seen and as the years 
passed she would remind her ex of the story and still think about it but still had that weird 
feeling that she was not supposed to remember this was very prominent in her mind as she says 
I know I am not supposed to remember this but I do it's simple I know what I know 
I expected it to be on the news and in the paper nothing I would have thought it would have showed 
up on radar or something for years I have wondered if someone who was there just like me remembers 
and here's yet another case July 4th 1982 the location as that Hermosa Beach 
in Southern California what I like about this case is that the witness came close enough to 
make misidentification nearly impossible as the witness writes this happened around nine o'clock 
my brother was watching the fireworks when all of a sudden he went as white as a ghost 
my mother went over to him to see what was the matter and then she shouted oh my God 
I went to see what was going on it was the weirdest thing ever a disc shaped with a small 
portholes going around its midsection it just sat there for a minute and then went over the 
house and disappeared it was so close about 100 feet away and a hundred feet in the air 
if we had a camera it would have been the best picture ever taken I can remember that I got a very weird feeling looking at it like fear
so many witnesses do feel that the UFOs are there to watch the fireworks but some cases have 
other elements to it that make it look like it's more than just a simple sighting 
this next case occurred in North Pontiac Michigan in 1983. a young girl was out in the parking lot 
with a large group of people to watch the local fireworks and as the fireworks were all going 
off she observed a blimp-like object approaching from over a group of trees she estimates it was 
about 50 feet high and actually looked kind of disc shaped and maybe about 30 feet wide 
so she screamed out look and as she says everyone that was there saw it we all looked at it in awe 
it was silent it came closer so even a blimp it makes noise and a blimp is not going to be 50 feet 
overhead right over the trees when fireworks are going off and Stacy remembers that it did have red 
lights underneath it her mother viewed the object and was quite alarmed and went to call the police 
the police were not receptive and said that you were probably looking at helicopters 
and here's where it gets weird while the witness remembers the object arriving she 
has no memory of it leaving and nor does she remember anyone ever talking about it 
as she says it just seemed to not have happened and later after remembering 
the incident she asked her mother about it who recalled very little except calling the police 
and she contacted another witness who became angry with her and told her it was just a blimp and that he remembered this blimp had the words happy Fourth of July written on it now the main 
witness doesn't remember that at all nor does she believe a blimp would travel that low among 
the fireworks definitely not a helicopter as she says it was so close maybe 100 to 200 feet away 
she wonders now if she had missing time and as she says I really want to be hypnotized to remember 
everything I'm desperate not knowing consumes me sometimes and I just want to know I'm not scared 
I just want the walls in my mind to be taken down it's in there I know it is I really want to 
remember I've had many dreams about ships and them so very interesting and here's another case just 
one year later night or actually five years later in 1988 this case took place in Glenn Mississippi 
and to celebrate the the holiday uh Glenn who is just a teenager went on to the front 
yard of his home and began shooting off Roman candles and bottle rockets while his mother 
watched from the porch I love this case it's really interesting because after shooting off 
a number of these fireworks he was shocked to see a sort of triangular shaped object with 
a light on each Apex suddenly swooped down out of the sky and fly along with the bottle rocket 
and a few minutes later four additional triangular objects showed up and began to put on a fantastic 
display for the witnesses as the witness says they were chasing each other like a tag a game 
they moved so fast going from side to side up and down and just staying still no noise at all 
my mother and I were standing in the driveway watching this for at least a half hour 
these objects were low enough that we could see the bottoms just fine they were all about the 
same size about two full-size pickup trucks so after watching this obviously intentional 
display for about 30 minutes they heard a loud rumbling sound of approaching aircraft 
they rushed inside and as the witness says out from the Treetops a group of helicopters came 
flying by the objects were still in sight and they all left together very fast straight up so again 
as we have seen not the only case where military aircraft show up to chase these objects away 
but this sighting left a deep impression on the witness as he says it is something I will 
never forget to this day I look up into the sky every day and night but I have never seen them or 
anything of this nature again so many cases here's another case same exact day and year though this 
occurred in Tacoma Washington quite some quite far away the main witness is a pilot so a good Witness 
and he was watching a fireworks display along the Tacoma waterfront 
a fireworks show had just ended people were beginning to go home when his attention was drawn to a strange quote ring of lights in the sky said it was very low maybe 200 feet 
and totally silent and as he watched this object moved North East along the shoreline 
until disappearing behind the bluff he's absolutely convinced he saw something unusual 
so in some cases it does appear that the UFO occupants are aware that many people will be 
outside watching fireworks and they purposefully show themselves as if announcing their presence 
consider this case which took place one year later in Los Angeles
so they were out there watching the fireworks and as the witness says the next thing that I 
remember is a large saucer-shaped craft with a slight Dome on the top appeared right in front 
of me from nowhere on top of the craft was a red light and around the Dome was what I 
would describe as arched windows now these windows appeared to be opaque but they did glow brightly 
the object was no more than a hundred feet distant and 75 feet high and she estimates about the size 
of a large bus it hovered silently and rotated slowly and as the witness says I ran to get my 
mom and brother who came out to watch the rest of the event we all watched The Craft move toward us 
fly over the right side of the house we all went into the back garden and watched The 
Craft move off and disappear another 50 feet away they're convinced it was a genuine UFO as 
the witness says this was not from this Earth so yeah it's clear something is going on here 
's a case which took place just a few years later again July 4th 1991.
this is a very interesting case which took place in Wichita Kansas 
the main witness was 16 years old she had just had a baby and was that her father-in-law's house 
her husband was with his dad fixing the car while she cared for the baby and her little sister-in-law and they were watching the fireworks through the back door of their home 
in Wichita when suddenly she saw a triangular shaped light flashing multi-colors Vivid Blues 
Reds yellows and other colors not only looks strange it was moving in strange patterns and 
appeared to be showing itself off on purpose as the witness says I was like hypnotized 
I don't know how long I stared and at some moment I thought that whatever it was it 
knew I was watching because it started doing all these moves up down side to side then suddenly 
just like a shooting star all I saw was a line of colors and it was gone so she was very much 
impressed by this very curious she quickly put her baby and young sister-in-law in the car and 
drove around looking for what they had seen and after a few minutes of driving they saw it again 
and like before she felt that whoever was inside this object knew that they were being observed 
and were allowing themselves to be seen as the witness says was like it was letting me see it 
she was amazed to see these little Windows around the craft and then she received a kind 
of impression that the occupants of The Craft were not happy because she was coming too close 
she became consumed with fear and quickly drove away only to discover that this object was now 
following her over her car and she says that was hysterical and my sister-in-law was crying and 
my baby crying a mess suddenly without warning the object darted away and was gone she calmed 
the kids down and drove home she later told a few people about the encounter nobody believed 
her except her mother who revealed that when she herself was a little girl she had seen a 
saucer in Mexico and had an encounter with a glowing entity so the witness reported her and 
Connor and she writes I'm not lying why should I I don't want anything but I know what I saw 
so this is occurring all across the United States mostly here's another case from Barnegat Bay in 
New Jersey this occurred in 1992. a couple was standing on the deck of their home which 
overlooked the bay a nearby fireworks show was in progress when they saw three quote 
distinct gray discs in a triangular formation and the wife describes what happened next 
she says they were kind of translucent but could clearly be seen
they hovered and it seemed to be three separate objects off in the distance a star-like object 
was moving up and down seemingly very far away the three discs seemed much closer 
both the star-like object and the three-day gray discs remained in place for several hours 
it was almost as if they were watching the fireworks display all of a sudden the star-like object dipped below the Horizon then shot up at amazing speed 
three discs remained for a while I did not notice them leaving but all of a sudden they were gone 
as the witness says lots of people had to have seen them 
so these are very interesting cases and some have very high levels of strangeness and in fact 
humanoids and here's one this occurred in 1996 in a pastoral area of Fayetteville Arkansas a 
group of family and friends we're celebrating the holidays on the Family Farm they shot off a bunch 
of fireworks and then decided to take a small walk a short walk into the woods near their Farm and 
as they approached the Grove of trees they saw a light in the woods about 300 feet in front of them 
and as one of the witnesses says in their own words as we approached this is what we saw 
three triangular shaped craft were sitting in a break in the trees lights were pointing down 
off each point of the triangles the strange beings that piloted these ships were conferencing outside 
they were tall and very thick hair that covered their bodies and seemed to speak tonally 
as we approached they smelled the air and glared in our Direction although they never saw us they 
sensed and smelled danger and quickly ran to their ships and exploded Into the Night I used the word 
explosion but there really wasn't any sound it was just an instant burst of light and then we were 
knocked to the ground but I got a glimpse of The Craft as they sped from sight and they seemed to 
elongate as they accelerated we kept the encounter to ourselves and have rarely spoken of it 
so as these cases grow in number it's becoming very difficult to deny that UFOs are in fact 
attracted to fireworks displays consider what happened in 1997 to a mother and her 
her two children who were driving to their home in O'Fallon Illinois when they decided to stop along 
one of the back roads to view a fireworks display going on about a mile away and after watching it 
for a few moments the mother noticed a strange light shining on the car but didn't see any other 
cars around them so they began looking to this source of the light and as one of the witnesses 
says we were starting to worry then out of the corner of my eye I saw something both amazing and 
terrifying at the same time a large Blue something was in the sky above us and a little to the left 
the object was shaped sort of like a saucer with a tail we only saw it for a brief moment 
they're quite frightened them and they took off and drove back home they're unsure what they 
saw but they know it wasn't fireworks it's not a balloon a helicopter rocket meteor satellite or 
anything conventional in fact the next morning they saw an article in the Saint Louis Post 
Dispatch describing the object they had seen down to the tiniest detail apparently hundreds of other 
people had seen it including the reporter who actually wrote the article and as it turned out 
officials at the nearby Scott Air Force Base were contacted but denied any knowledge of the incident 
and this case is only one of many that occurred that year 1997 and in fact hundreds of people 
across Illinois and Missouri reported seeing a green blue light shoot across the sky 
now there have been some who said that this could have been a meteorite or Fireball but 
most Witnesses disagree as one witness says another witness in myself saw a blue green 
light move across a large field of view in the sky and then disappear at impossible speeds 
was under the clouds because the light from it reflected off the clouds so most of the witnesses 
describe it this way as being far too low to be a meteorite and if it was that low it should 
have crashed much sooner and not been visible over a wide area in fact one way to describe 
the object as a quote blue bullet shaped light that appeared 200 to 400 feet above ground level 
and another witness said our family was directly in the path and we were all illuminated blue we 
looked up into the light they moved off towards the woods north of the house it's amazing how 
many cases there are here's another one which occurred in 1999 in Lancaster Pennsylvania 
this is one of the most interesting sightings because it does involve humanoids I call the 
main witness Jeff that is a pseudonym he was with his ex-wife and two children visiting a relative's 
home to watch the fireworks and he was standing out in the backyard alone while his family stood 
about 40 feet behind him near the house and there were a lot of people there at the party almost 100 
went without warning a green triangular shaped object approached at about 45 miles per hour 
the witness estimates it was about 2 000 feet high it had blue and white lights and he says emitted 
a soft quote whizzing and whooshing sound most amazing however is he saw windows or portholes 
in the object and as he says most people don't get to see a craft that close and distinct I even saw 
the molding around the windows mostly however he was impressed by what he saw looking at him 
through the windows of this craft or rather who as he says in his own words three Nordic looking men 
in white with blonde hair staring at us as if we were mere cattle I could see them from the Belly 
Up not sure if they were standing or sitting they had no apparatus on at all I never took my eyes 
off it until it was gone from sight at that point his son ran up to him and said dad was that a UFO 
and he said I don't know what the bleep that was but it ain't ours now he's an army veteran and has 
been around a lot of aircraft and he is absolutely convinced that what he saw was extraterrestrial 
in origin especially because he saw these humanoids and no one else seemed to notice it 
this says what gets me is everyone saw it there and there was almost 100 people 
but strangely nobody seemed to be that interested in the sighting so we'd see this in some of 
these encounters he still remembers the way the Nordic beings looked down at him and as he says 
that image stayed with me and grew over time and now it's been bothering me so much and details are 
getting stronger I can't get that one guy in the middle staring at me as if he could see me like a 
calf in the field alone it's damn near haunting so on and on this happens here's another case which 
occurred in Des Moines Iowa this was the year 2000 hundreds of people had gathered to observe a large 
glowing red orb hovering overhead at an estimated altitude of 3000 to 6 000 feet so this was of 
course during a fireworks show and this attracted a lot of attention because it was very widely viewed and in fact UFO researcher Beverly trout studied the incident in detail and learned that 
there were literally hundreds of witnesses from get this 27 different locations across Des Moines 
She interviewed more than 48 Witnesses and turned out several people have actually videotaped the 
objects the object they reported that this UF file moved back and forth several times at one 
point it released a smaller Red Orb which left the main one and began turning at right angles 
as one witness said this ball of light hovered for the one hour time we were 
there and was still present when we left so clearly not a sky lantern and the next day 
there were in fact several newspaper articles and also television reports about the incident 
the Federal Aviation Administration was contacted they reported no blimps or laser shows in the area 
and couldn't have been a balloon because this object was reportedly moving Against the Wind 
over the city in a kind of a horse shoe pattern though sometimes stopping and hovering 
so what was this if it wasn't a genuine UFO 
and consider this next case I believe this is the same year Pacific City Oregon 
200 people were spread out along the beach to watch the fireworks show at Cape kiwanda 
and as one of the witnesses says in their own words just before dark we saw a light 
coming down from the sky with unreal speed and pause way out on the horizon 
then it zipped back up and out of sight this thing traveled hundreds of miles in seconds it 
was amazing myself my wife my brother-in-law and a stranger next to us all saw it 
there's a good chance more people saw it but it was only there for five to ten seconds 
I remembered as a white round light quite big considering how far away it was at first I thought 
it was a falling star but it was faster and then it paused and I was thinking what the heck then it 
zipped off nothing I have ever seen can move like that it had to be an advanced light form for sure 
I'm sure I saw a real alien aircraft so very interesting and here's another case which is 
quite involved this occurred July 4th 2001. it was a large group of people at a campground in 
Big Pine California a very beautiful area and they could actually see two Fireworks shows 
and uh what's really interesting is you know they were camping along the Owens River was a 
clear night watching these Fireworks shows off in the distance and around nine o'clock the fireworks 
show stopped and this is when the main witness and his girlfriend saw what they call a quote strange 
object hovering about 500 to 800 feet above the top peak of the nearby White Mountain Range 
as the witness says the object had a three layered disc shape similar to a hamburger 
shape around the middle of the object were a series of revolving lights it turned in sequence 
yellow orange pink red white Etc they hovered over the mountains for 30 minutes during which 
time it darted sporadically from place to place accelerating rapidly then gliding to a stop in 
diagonal horizontal and vertical movements and at one point the object came closer to our campsite 
at this point his Rottweiler a dog named tank became aware of the object and stood in full 
guard position watching the area and they were conversing with the other campers about this UFO 
and as they watched it moved closer and actually sent down bright beams of light onto the Mountainside as the main witness says the pattern appeared very clearly on the 
ground consisting of about 20 to 30 white circles spaced out and forming a hexagon in its entirety 
the lights moved over the ground and the side of the mountain like a Searchlight and at one 
point actually lit up the tree just above where we were sitting in the bed of my truck 
the witnesses felt like it was almost surveying the mountain in a grid pattern they watched it emit red beams of light and finally it moved back up towards where it had first appeared at 
which point a second craft appeared emerging from the top peak like the first craft had 
and as it drifted upward a third craft appeared and began to follow the second all three craft moved exactly or had the same exact appearance they slowly gained an altitude 
at one point they turned off their colored lights and became just a solid white color 
they continued to move slowly upwards until they took on the appearance of stars but remained in 
view in a triangular formation for at least a few hours apparently masquerading as stars and 
the Witnesses were so impressed that they remained awake all night the objects stayed there all night 
by the time morning came the Sun was shining they had taken on a kind of shiny metallic appearance 
but when daylight finally arrived the objects were no longer visible but looking up to the 
Mountaintop they saw what appeared to be a trail of smoke rising from where the objects had been 
they decided to get some sleep at this point but just a few minutes later were woken up by two 
military jets flying low through the valley and circling the Mountaintop where they had seen these 
objects take off from earlier and these fighter jets left and returned several times throughout 
the day and as the main witness says it was a very strange Fourth of July for me and one that my 
girlfriend and I will never forget uh on the same night as the above case but quite far away and 
Narragansett Rhode Island a group of five people had an equally interesting holiday when they went 
to watch the local fireworks show from a cliff by the ocean shore they were setting off a few 
fireworks themselves one of them had just launched a Roman Candle when as we have seen in other cases 
a UFO showed up right alongside it and as one of the witnesses says I saw a trapezoid-shaped black 
object moving slowly and silently at an altitude of no more than two thousand feet I called out to 
my two sons a friend and my nephew who all watched with me as this object continued to move East out 
over the ocean between the haze and dark clouds at a speed of no more than 50 or 60 miles per hour 
the object then accelerated to about 150 miles per hour and seemed to vanish within the clouds 
we were all deeply awed and all of us reported the same shape height and speed of this object 
we all dismissed it as too large to be a stealth fighter or bomber or even a large dirigible we 
estimate it to be about 80 to 90 feet tall and about the length of two football fields 
it's amazing how many cases like this there are and here's another case which took place one year later in 2002. this case occurred in Howell New Jersey 
a family was celebrating the holiday as they always did by watching the local fireworks show 
however this year that they this fireworks show had the added attraction of a UFO 
and as the father says a saucer-shaped craft appeared from the Eastern sky and hovered 
within a five mile radius from us I'd say 300 feet up and at least 30 feet in diameter the 
colors seem to be silver and had a pulsating white light at the bottom he grabbed his camera 
and managed to film this object before a military aircraft appeared and apparently chased it away 
a briefcase but very interesting here's another interesting case also brief a gentleman was in his 
apartment in southeast Manhattan New York which looked over the East River there was of course a 
fireworks show going on and after about 15 minutes a triangular shaped glowing object appeared as 
though waiting to watch the show so the witness actually began to film this object and as he says 
in his own words it was a glowing red triangular body with green on the edges like an inverted top 
with white lights rotating at the base I also noticed portholes just above the rotating white 
light and smaller portholes underneath it hid behind the clouds before the fireworks began 
so he sent his footage to Peter Davenport who heads the group National UFO Reporting Center and 
after viewing the footage Peter Davenport writes we are grateful for the report and the images 
the object is triangular nature with several lights on the bottom we do not know what it is 
so yeah I'm in case after case after case here's another very brief case which occurred 
in Henrietta Oklahoma this is in 2004. it's a good sighting though 
a family was having a picnic watching the fireworks show and as one of the witnesses says 
we all looked up and the sky was full of stars moving in circles shooting from side to side 
and darting across the sky crazy they would change direction in a moment there were lots of 
them everywhere I don't know how many all of us just stood there watching it was as though they 
were giving us a Fourth of July show I really believe they were so yeah as we see sometimes 
the UFOs not only watch the fireworks but put on a little show for the witnesses themselves 
here's another case which occurred in Texas in 2005. a gentleman was watching fireworks off in 
the distance when a UFO appeared it actually rose up from between him and the fireworks 
and he says it was a metallic triangular shaped object with rounded corners and had a dark strip 
running down the center of the object and as he says it just materialized out of nowhere and then 
two more identical objects followed close behind it my heart raced when I saw it and I doubted my 
vision for a long time but I am convinced of what I saw and would stake my life on it 
what I believe I saw was an interdimensional craft coming in and out of our Realm 
moving along same year actually 2005 my father and son were watching a fireworks 
show from the rural home overlooking Granite Falls Washington when they saw an orb of white 
light moving in ways that no Sky Lantern can it appeared to be like a satellite at first 
but was moving extremely fast from the West to the Southwest as one of the witnesses says as 
we watched it started to move about unlike any conventional aircraft we've ever seen 
dread left at extraordinary velocity then right then arched in a rainbow type trajectory at 
incredible speed Maneuvers completely unseen and probably impossible in any traditional aircraft 
we both watched this ball for about 60 seconds after which it darted behind a mountain 
they were both very much impressed and called this sighting quote a very remarkable holiday 
and here's another one from 2005 that I just had to mention this occurred in Davey Florida 
a witness is watching the local fireworks show when he noticed a saucer-shaped light hovering 
just north of the Fort Lauderdale airport at an elevation he estimates of about 2 000 feet and I 
will just quote him directly as he says I noticed it when I looked outside to see the fireworks and 
wondered what it was I had never seen a craft in the air that was stationary for so long 
I checked every half hour or so to see it sitting in the air at exactly the same place 
when the fireworks slowed down I looked and it was gone I did not see it leave it appeared to 
be watching the fireworks and left before they ended so it stayed there a long time he estimates 
about three hours one year later July 4th 2006 a family was on their boat in Key Largo Florida 
the fireworks show had just ended when a gray triangular shaped object flew at very low 
elevation overhead and as one of the witnesses says it was directly over the boat and moving 
south the object was triangular in shape like an elongated Crescent and was completely silent 
when the back of the object became visible a single centered small orange light could be 
seen and observed for only 10 seconds before the object swiftly ascended out of vision 
so I think you're getting the point here this is quite common I'd just like to mention a few more cases here's one which occurred in Michigan actually in 2007. 
and this one you might think was a skylant turn it was a little Bright Light which dropped out of 
the sky and right above the fireworks for about 10 seconds but then it shot back in this in the sky a 
different way than it came from so this does not appear to be a sky lantern because as the witness 
says when it took off it moved very fast it looked to me like it was seeing what the fireworks were 
I can't tell you how big it was but it seemed to be not that big maybe the size of a small car 
it looked just like a bright star but no star moves like that another real briefcase Fort 
Knox Kentucky 2007 a family was watching the fireworks from their backyard and none of these 
firework shows were close they were watching from a distance when something approached much closer 
to them what they described as a large quote black triangle as one of the witness says in 
their own words the craft was moving slowly low to the ground and with no noise coming from it at all 
I describe it as having white lights at the corners of it and alternating red flashing 
lights was so creepy it flew in a straight path sort of leaning in my direction as it flew 
there isn't any craft I know that could fly that low and not make any noise it had to be a UFO
okay here's yet another case very recent 2008 this occurred in Colorado in the suburbs 
the witness was attending a neighborhood block party when he saw quote a strange 
Ripple in the sky this was directly over the two-story homes across the street 
and again I'll just quote him directly as he says something weird caught my eye looked kind 
of like when one sees a hot air on a highway in the summer and this Ripple was something that 
had pale blue lights the lights did not blink and appeared to sort of outline this object 
all of this was very dim and it was very difficult to make out exactly what it was 
the object was completely silent and moving slowly I watched it pass over all the people dancing in 
the street I was just mesmerized by this thing and did not want to take my eyes off of it in 
case I could not find it again so the only reason according to this witness that he was able to see 
this object was because the air was very smoky and that seemed to make the object become more visible 
he says this because after it moved out of the Smoky area it disappeared blended into the sky 
so I don't think in this case it wanted to be seen it was perhaps just looking at the fireworks and was only in view for about 10 seconds
here's yet another very impressive case same year same day this also took place in Colorado 
North Glenn Colorado the main witness and his wife were watching a fireworks display 
in Northglenn when they saw a quote in Orange oval shaped light it was moving at a downward 
angle and he thought it might be a plane when quote it just stopped and sat in place 
at this point a second orb swooped in from the right side very quickly as the 
witness says and stopped instantly directly next to the first light in a vertical line 
so the witness's wife tried to videotape the object but couldn't get the camera up into video 
mode in time meanwhile a third object arrived as the witness says it stopped suddenly next 
to the other two and the three lights formed a vertical line so clearly not sky lanterns and 
again after about a minute two of the objects began to quote Chase each other or playing tag 
while the Middle Light remained Motionless so they're a little unsure what they saw but don't 
believe it was a plane and as the witness says currently there are no aircraft that can move like that to my knowledge they moved very quickly in tight patterns and stopped instantly I can 
tell you it wasn't fireworks because they can't stay in the air and form perfect vertical lines
okay now I just have let's see two more cases I'd like to present this next one occurred in 2008 
again this was outside of Buffalo New York the main witness was outside our home this was around 
10 30 pm and she was just lying in bed watching the fireworks from her bedroom window when looking 
out she was shocked to see a pulsating shiny disc shaped object as she says just sitting there 
watching the fireworks I assume and it looked almost star-like but then began to zigzag and 
move closer to both her and the fireworks at this point she could see it at a pulsating green light 
and it stayed there it stayed in place for about two hours when it was suddenly joined by three 
other discs Each of which had little lights around the circumference and the lights on this object 
became very difficult making them difficult to see and some even seemed she said to become invisible 
and this is when a fleet showed up without warning the main witness says 10 additional crafts zoomed 
down from the Lake Erie area and hovered next to the first disc now at this point she was jolted 
fully awake she says because she had the feeling these objects were there to watch the fireworks 
show and they remained in place till about 3 A.M and at this point she became too tired to stay 
awake but as she says I thought to myself how nice they like all the fireworks too what's interesting 
about this sighting is the main witness did receive some interesting mental impressions 
like many witnesses she felt that the UFOs were watching the fireworks but she had some other 
Impressions that she felt may have even come from the occupants of this object he felt as though 
the first craft came first scouted the area and chose the best location to begin the viewing party 
because when this other craft these other craft arrived the first craft moved back and stopped moving allowing the other craft to view the fireworks from a closer location 
and she had the distinct impression they came from an underground or undersea base perhaps 
in Lake Erie and she also got a very interesting impression that they were going to have to leave 
their base soon and weren't happy about it she was really surprised that during this whole 
sighting she became quite emotional she was very excited to see the craft she began became angry 
that she could not see them any closer and a few times she became a little bit frightened 
however at the same time she was also worried and felt a feeling of quote protection for them 
I think one final case will cement in the fact that this is definitely a thing the Fourth of 
July is a good day to see fireworks or the 4th of July is a good day to see UFOs because it was one 
year later on July 4th 2009 that UFOs showed up at La Conner Washington clearly to view the fireworks 
as the witness says me and about a thousand people maybe more saw a dozen lights fly in a pattern 
from east to west they flew above the fireworks and then went up out of the atmosphere two crafts 
at a time would come in from the West Skyline Ascend to the area above the fireworks as if they 
were interested in what we were doing lighting off the fireworks and then left the Earth's atmosphere 
this went on for about two hours so they watched these objects until midnight and at one point they 
saw what appeared to be a large black object about 400 feet wide with two flashing lights 
on either side so clearly not a conventional object those are the 40 cases that I decided 
to present to today in which people have seen UFOs on Independence Day on the 4th of July and I can 
tell you there's a lot more than I presented here I decided to stop at some point because it starts 
to get a little repetitive but it's absolutely clear to me that fireworks do attract UFOs 
I did Cover these cases in my book not from here volume 4 which is all about the stranger and more 
unusual cases of UFO contact and I think these cases absolutely qualify and what I think is going 
on here is a couple of things yes UFOs et's are attracted to fireworks there's no doubt about that 
I think it's clear that in some of these cases that's why they're there to watch the fireworks 
certainly the witnesses feel that way but I think it's more than just this I think 
actually ETS are using the Fourth of July as an opportunity to basically announce their presence 
there is a type of encounter known as a UFO display these are cases when UFOs et's basically 
put on a display a little publicity stunt a way of announcing their presence we see this in UFO waves 
and the schoolyard encounters I did an episode on driving movie theater encounters it's the 
same sort of thing they know there are millions of people outside at night looking up in a good mood 
and I think they use this as an opportunity to say hey hello here we are and we see this so while 
many of these are what we would call Simple sightings Close Encounters of the first kind 
I think probably it could be more accurately called Close Encounters of the fifth kind 
ce5s human initiated encounters because basically what's going on here is they are being drawn down 
by these fireworks so this is in essence a good opportunity to study UFOs in a laboratory setting 
these are human initiated encounters that's certainly one way to look at it and I think that's 
an interesting Factor so yeah there's a few really interesting things going on here I think these 
cases do have a lot to tell us about the nature of the UFO phenomena and ETS they are curious they do 
appreciate the beauty of fireworks and they do apparently want us to know that they are there 
so that I think is a really important factor I think these cases also show us how important 
it is to be discriminating and really investigate these cases because it's clear to me some are sky 
lanterns but perhaps they're not because from a distance a Skyline turn does look like a UFO 
and the ETS may be aware of this so it's an opportunity for them to sort of hide in plain view 
but what I think is most interesting about these cases again is it provides a wonderful opportunity 
for people to study UFOs very hard to predict sightings 
but you can predict that on the 4th of July there will be a huge spike in sightings so if you want to see a UFO the 4th of July presents a wonderful opportunity 
so get your cameras ready be prepared and who knows you might just have an encounter 
so that's the show for today I hope you've enjoyed it it's quite an unusual one but until next time 
keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun.
