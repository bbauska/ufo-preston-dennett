ETS CURE KIDNEY DISEASE: TEN TRUE CASES
Aug 5, 2022

Summary:
Aug 5, 2022
ETs are healing people all across the world. With more than 300 documented cases, it is clear that healing is a regular facet of a UFO encounter. Most major researchers have multiple cases involving cures. These cases not only provide good hard evidence of extraterrestrials, but they also show a benevolent side to UFO encounters. But with a fear-based media and an active UFO cover-up, these kinds of cases are not getting the attention they deserve.

This video presents ten true cases of healings of one specific type: the kidneys. These cases show how truly advanced in medicine the ETs are.

December 1965: Swedish construction worker Richard Hoglund encounters a landed UFO and human-looking occupants. After indicating that he has a problem with kidney stones, the ETs agree to cure him.

In 1965, health-food distributor Ludwig F. Pallman meets a human-looking man claiming to be an ET. Skeptical, Pallman is invited onboard a UFO in Peru. After being hospitalized for kidney disease, the ETs arrive to help.

October 25, 1974, oil-field worker Carl Higdon is out hunting elk in Rawlins, Wyoming. Upon encountering a landed UFO, he is taken onboard and healed of two conditions: tubercular scars in his lungs, and kidney stones.

July 17, 1978, Carmela is taken from her home in Cayey, Puerto Rico into an ET craft. She sees different types of ETs, who issue dire warnings about the future of Earth, and then heal her diseased kidneys.

In August of 1980, Hector Vasquez of San Juan, Puerto Rico is suffering from a bad case of kidney stones. Luckily, his friend is a UFO contactee. And on the way to the hospital, the ETs arrive on a healing mission.

In early 1985, Veronica of Ontario, Canada finds herself being escorted onto a UFO which had landed in her alley. Doctors had diagnosed her with kidney disease and told her she needed surgery. Then the aliens arrived!

In the summer of 1985, an anonymous woman from British Columbia, Canada meditates to relieve her severe kidney pain. Without warning, she finds herself onboard a UFO with tall humanoids, and they want to help.

April 2, 1991, a peasant in Tenjo, Colombia is riding his donkey to work when a craft lands nearby. Next thing he knows, he's being pulled onboard and taken to a large mothership where he is cured of kidney stones.

January 26, 1997, abductee Andrew from Texas finds a gray alien in his bedroom. After an exam, the gray asks him if the strange object in his kidneys is supposed to be there? No, he says. The grays agree to help.

In July 2006, Ms. E.A. Sabean is diagnosed with chronic renal failure. She prays for a healing and finds herself surrounded by short, brown-skinned ETs who heal her. Later, the ETs warn her, stop drinking diet coke!

These ten cases, most of which are verified by doctors, show that ETs do have an agenda to heal people. These healing cases reach back nearly a hundred years and come from all over the world. The cures cover the gamut of injuries, illnesses, conditions and diseases. The kidney cures presented here are likely just the tip of the iceberg. The evidence can no longer be denied. ETs are healing people. And with hundreds of more cases like these, it's likely far more common than most people realize.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today's episode is called et's cure kidney disease 10 true cases as many of you may already know 
i've been studying cases of ufo healings for many years in fact i've documented more than 300 
cases stretching back over 100 years and occurring to the present day coming from all over the world 
these cases are far more common i think than people realize that's why i wanted to do this 
episode episode for you today because people don't realize just how many cases like this there are 
and furthermore i think it shows a very benevolent side to et contact that is often overlooked 
and these cases today focus solely on people who have suffered from kidney conditions 
and have been cured as a result of a ufo encounter these are all types of cases from something as 
simple as kidney stones to total renal failure what's great about these cases is they provide 
really good evidence of et intervention the majority of these cases have been verified 
by doctors so these are very important cases and i think you'll find them quite 
interesting i certainly hope so so let's just get started the first case i'd like to talk about 
is it involves a gentleman by the name of richard hoglund who was cured of kidney stones 
in december of 1965 richard hoagland a swedish construction worker and rock blaster 
encountered landed ufo and humanoid aliens near the town of udavala this was an icy cold morning 
and hogland feeling restless decided to take a drive to nearby grind halt lake at the time he 
was suffering from kidney stones and was actually scheduled to have surgery the following day 
he had suffered from this condition for 15 years he parked the car by the lake and began to walk 
along the ice-covered surface of the lake with his dog lizzy he heard a strange whining sound 
above him and looking up saw a small metallic craft descend and land next to him on the lake 
moments later an opening appeared and four figures floated down from the craft and levitated a few 
inches above the ice and looking more closely you could see that these figures were human looking 
except that they were completely hairless had very smooth unblemished skin large unusual eyes perfect 
teeth pointy ears and were wearing transparent plastic light suits that did really little to 
hide their bodies he also noticed that each wore a strange black bracelet with a yellow button on it 
and hoaglan says that there was four of them an older man two boys and a girl so we thought at 
first that they were foreigners perhaps russians until they approached him and he realized that these were not normal humans but they seemed very friendly and curious and they began to communicate 
with him through gestures and sign languages they seemed particularly interested in hogland's thick 
hair on his head so he approached them and tried to touch them but each time they backed away 
and as they tried to communicate hoglan indicated that he was experiencing pain 
in his kidney the e.t man returned to the craft and exited holding a microphone like object which 
was about three inches in diameter he then moved behind hogland and pressed this instrument against 
his back hogland says he felt a strange force enter his body at which point his kidney pain 
disappeared afterwards they talked a bit longer and the ets returned to their craft which promptly 
departed the area and the next day hogland showed up for surgery at the udavala hospital 
in sweden and as is standard procedure immediately prior to the operation he was x-rayed but the 
x-rays showed no trace of the kidney stones a fact which was confirmed by hogland's physicians dr 
hartman and his colleague dr carl eric svensson so later hogland would experience another encounter 
during which he was healed of an apparent tumor but as we will see removal of the kidney stones 
is the most common kidney healing treatment performed by the ets the next case i would like 
to talk about is fairly well known and involves a gentleman by the name of ludwig f palman 
in 1967 palman was hospitalized in the maison francaise hospital of lima peru at the time he 
was experiencing severe pains that were diagnosed as kidney problems several years earlier however 
in 1965 ludwig was traveling through europe his career as an international health food processor 
and distributor made him as he says a perpetual globetrotter and it was while in india he met a 
person a normal looking person by the name of satu ra and after several weeks of friendship 
satu ra told ludwig that he was actually an extraterrestrial 
although initially skeptical ludwig was soon given reason to believe because actually invited 
ludwig aboard a ufo and he of course accepted and became a ufo contactee 
and like many contactees he learned many things and he later received a healing he was in the 
wilderness in lima peru when his kidney pain first appeared he sought treatment and was very happy to 
be in the maison francaise hospital which was well known for its expert doctors in modern equipment 
the doctors told ludwig that he would have to undergo an operation to alleviate his kidney pain 
and he agreed as his fever was getting worse and the pain had him totally incapacitated and 
it was while he was in the hospital that ludwig awoke one night to find a visitor in his room 
and he recognized the person as ziti who was sat to ra's sister whom he had met earlier aboard the 
ufo so she wasted no time and immediately began treating ludwig for his condition 
she began by passing her hands over his body and then gave him a small pill to eat 
as quickly as she arrived she departed and within minutes ludwig's condition made a complete 
reversal he was free of pain his fever broke and as far as he could tell he was completely healed 
the doctors were called in and they were stunned they could see that ludwig was now healthy but they could not explain why so this is another 
case that is pretty well verified by doctors and uh as ludwig writes all of this may be checked by 
any of my readers i became the miracle patient of the famous maison francaise hospital in lima peru
so following this healing his doctors demanded that he undergo a whole battery of tests 
and the tests verified the obvious that he was perfectly healthy and as one doctor told him you're fit as a flea this is really baffling yesterday 
you were a very sick man and today you seem to be a different person 
ludwig did write a book about his encounters uh he was given alien artifacts he was able to take many 
photographs it's quite an interesting case another very well verified case is one i have covered 
before but i think it's worth mentioning again on october 25 1974 oil field worker and hunter 
carl higdon of rawlings wyoming was out hunting in the wilderness of the medicine bow national forest 
and to his delight he saw five elk he raised his gun aimed it at a large buck and fired 
to his utter surprise this bullet floated slowly out of his gun and dropped to the ground about 50 
feet away at this point carl noticed that he had a visitor he saw a six-foot man with yellowish skin 
no neck no visible ears small eyes a slit-like mouth straw colored hair and what appeared to 
be two antennas coming out of his head he was dressed in a one-piece jumpsuit with a large 
belt so this figure gave higdon some pills and encouraged him to swallow one 
which higdon did he's not sure why but his next memory is being inside a strange craft 
strapped to his seat a helmet was placed over his head and strange images filled his mind he 
saw futuristic cities and other bizarre structures next he underwent a physical examination he also 
saw three other normal looking people aboard the ufo as well as several animals including the elk 
he says the craft was much bigger on the inside than it appeared on the outside and after this 
whole experience he was set back down outside he radioed for help and blacked out search parties 
were sent out to find him and they found his truck mired in a field several miles from its original 
location there were no tracks around it also some members of the party saw unexplained lights 
hovering in the sky so there are corroborating witnesses higdon was finally found but it was 
only under hypnosis that he was able to recall what he saw on board the ufo he underwent hypnotic 
regression with dr leo sprinkle but what's interesting here is prior to his encounter carl 
higdon suffered from a persistent and painful case of kidney stones but after the encounter 
his problem with kidney stones was completely gone he was cured and that was not the only 
cure he received he also had a tubercular scar on his lungs from a previous bout with tuberculosis 
which also disappeared and he attributes both of these healings to his encounter
now we move to another case this is a very interesting case which took place in puerto rico 
and this occurred in the city of caye around 10 pm on the evening of july 17 1978 carmella that's 
a pseudonym and her family were preparing for sleep in their home suddenly a bright light shone 
through the window carmelo's husband went to check on the children while she stayed in the bedroom 
suddenly she saw two four foot tall figures at her doorway they had large heads 
huge dark slanted eyes two tiny holes for a nose and a slit for a mouth they wore tight fitting 
silver suits so this appears to be the typical grays one of these beings approached carmella and 
touched her causing her to relax this being then led her outside her home and into a hovering craft 
inside she saw a metallic hallway and was led into a stainless steel looking room and placed on a cot 
a strange instrument with a screen dropped from the ceiling enabling carmela to see all her organs 
inside her body this is something i've heard many times the humanoids pointed to the screen 
and then placed a strange box-like device with multi-colored lights on carmella's head 
a taller figure human-looking with dark hair and almond eyes and wearing a silver 
uniform came in and he proceeded to conduct a full medical exam including taking samples 
he talked extensively with carmela and told her that she had been cured of her kidney disease then 
gave her warnings about the future of humanity and our planet and returned her to her home 
many cases here's another one that's very well verified was originally investigated by researcher 
virgilio sanchez osejo in august 1980 hector vasquez of san juan puerto rico 
was awakened at 2 am by severe side pains that had previously been diagnosed as kidney stones 
and he knew he would have to go to the hospital so he sent one of his children to get his friend 
david del mundo to drive him david del mundo is an ordained minister and also a ufo contactee 
and after seeing many ufos he had a face-to-face contact with a short almond-eyed figure wearing a 
jumpsuit who said he was from the orion star cluster and this began a series of contacts 
now david del mundo had received no healings of his own so he had no reason to expect that his e.t 
friends would assist his earth friend but when you heard the news about hector's illness he jumped up 
to drive hector to the hospital and on the way to the hospital they had a close encounter with 
quote an orange glowing luminous disk they could see it hovering above the road ahead of them it 
then flew alongside the car paralleling its course then flew back in front of the car 
in a strange darting pattern at this time hector vasquez was lying in the back seat 
doubled up with pain and when his friend david del mundo said that a ufo was hovering outside 
hector didn't believe him at first but he insisted that hector look and to his surprise 
david was right and by the way this object was moving it was very clear to both of them that 
the ufo was very interested in them both of them wondered why this object was moving so strangely 
around the car but by the time they had made the 20-minute drive to the hospital they had their 
answer hector vasquez's crippling kidney pain was completely gone but still fearing another 
attack he insisted upon a medical examination at the hospital the doctors checked him out and 
pronounced him in perfect health his previously diagnosed kidney stone was nowhere to be found 
on the way home the two men saw the same object again that had hovered around their car earlier 
and hector vasquez believed that he was healed of his kidney stone by this ufo how they did it 
it's hard to say they had no on-board experience or missing time as far as they know so perhaps 
this ufo just sent some sort of energy it's a very interesting case which again is verified 
by doctors here's another case which comes from canada and was reported on by canadian researcher 
chris rutkowski this occur occurred in early 1985 to a lady by the name of veronica she lived next 
door to a hydro station in the suburbs of toronto ontario and one morning a few hours before sunrise 
she was shocked to see a ufo land in the back alley near her window 
the next thing she knew human-like figures appeared in her home and took her out the window 
into a long black limousine which made a strange whooshing sound and she now 
found herself on board the craft the ets said that they were not only going to examine her 
but then proceeded to perform surgery she thinks to remove her eggs at the time she was suffering 
from painful kidney problems that her doctor said needed surgery to fix and the itis apparently 
agreed and performed surgery on her kidney and so they put in an implant to ease her pain 
they showed her a room filled with tanks each containing a human body at some stage of growth 
they told her that it took them four days to grow a fetus to adult size but that the body contained 
no spirit veronica complained about this but the et's told her that humans treat animals much worse 
and they lectured her about the way humans spill or waste our seed pollute our atmosphere 
and treat others with disrespect at some point during her experience veronica was looking at 
what she thought were human-like et's and realized that their human appearance was really just sort 
of a screen memory and she instead saw them as the typical grays with the large bald head and 
wrap around eyes following her experience she kept quiet about it she went to her doctor who 
told her that there was a foreign body showing up in the ultrasound readings of her kidney 
the object however later disappeared and was apparently flushed out through her urinary tract 
but veronica as a result of her experiences was spiritually transformed she became a part-time 
minister and a vegetarian and she later went public with her account so another case which 
also occurred in canada shows again the wide variety of ets who are performing 
these healings on one evening in the summer of 1985 a woman from vancouver in british 
columbia canada was suffering from pain due to a kidney infection she decided to meditate to 
relieve her pain when a tall humanoid appeared suddenly in her room without warning she found 
herself inside a circular room surrounded by several seven foot tall humanoids with blue eyes 
she lost consciousness and when she woke up she was dismayed to find mysterious blood stains 
on her sheets but she later discovered that her kidney problems had vanished so it's a short case 
but yet another case involving a kidney cure here's another case which occurred in 
ten ho colombia on april 2nd 1991 this is a brief case which comes from researcher louis e 
mejia this occurred on april 2nd 1991 the time was 4 00 am when a local peasant in colombia 
saw a large metallic cylindrical shaped craft land nearby as he rode his donkey on his way to work 
a blinding light enveloped him and he felt himself being lifted up and taken on board this craft 
inside his head telepathically he heard reassuring words telling him that he was not going to be 
hurt he then met four four foot tall humanoids that he couldn't get a look at they almost seem 
to be covered in mist the object then entered a huge mother ship and on board this larger craft 
the peasant was examined on a table and cured of kidney stones he says a little implant was 
placed in his left shoulder and he was later deposited back on earth at a location almost 
600 miles from his home so that's hard to explain but it's another very interesting case 
another really well verified case of kidney stones comes from researcher constance clear this 
involves a gentleman by the name of andrew from san antonio texas who has experienced a lifetime 
of abductions most of these were unpleasant and sometimes painful but in october of 1996 
andrew had a procedure in which a mole on his face was removed it was a few months later that 
he started to experience persistent pains in his side he went to the doctor the doctor ordered a 
sonogram and confirmed the presence of a kidney stone and andrew was scheduled for treatment it 
was just a few months later on december 27 1996 when andrew's kidney stone was really bothering 
him he placed a heating pad on his body and went to bed it was around 2 a.m when he felt this 
burning sensation and thinking it was the heating pad he got up and applied some aloe vera he went 
back to bed but suddenly found himself encased in a beam of light with a gray alien standing next to 
his bed and the e.t explained that they had just taken him and were now returning in to his bedroom 
and they apologized for accidentally scratching andrew on his body andrew fell back asleep when he 
woke up he saw a large red welt on his side but it was one month later on the evening of january 26 
1997 when a gray appeared in andrew's room and began to examine him he looked at andrew's side 
and said that the previous procedure hadn't worked there had been a problem and they would 
have to take him back into the craft he found himself on board this ufo he was undressed this 
gray applied a strange gel to his body in a patch around his side where his kidney was 
and then placed him in a plastic-like floating bubble below his body was a strange piece of 
equipment andrew described it as square with a round dome on top and a telescopic like laser 
and he watched the gray turn on this machine at which point the dome filled with electric sparks 
and a beam of light shot out from the telescope part and shown on the patch on andrew's side 
they're being told andrew that they've been working with his kidneys because they found something but they don't know what it is he's said that they thought everything in the body 
served a purpose and wanted to know the purpose of this stone in his kidney and if it was part of his 
quote filtering system andrew told the grey that no the stone served no purpose the grace seemed 
confused and asked him how he got the stone in his body and would harm him if they removed it 
andrew told them that the stone was not necessary and that it would hurt more if they didn't remove it so the gray then attached a tube to the patch on andrew's side 
and removed the stone he warned andrew that he would experience some pain for a while 
but then then it would fade away and that there would be no markings andrew was then returned to his home andrew woke up with vague flashbacks of being inside 
this ufo encasing a plastic bubble like a container his side also felt painful 
he scheduled an appointment with constance clare and under hypnosis this above scenario emerged 
intrigued constance claire had andrew draw the medical device he had seen which cured him of his kidney stones and as constance clear 
says at last andrew had derived a health benefit from one of his encounters 
the kidney stone his doctor had previously confirmed with a sonogram was gone without a trace 
so following this constance clear took andrew's drawing of the alien medical equipment to 
a radiologist and this is when she got very interesting confirmation as constance clear writes 
he was intrigued with the medical equipment when he saw the box with the dome that the aliens 
used to remove the kidney stone he said that's lithotripsy he went on to explain that we have 
portable and fixed units which focus an ultrasonic wave to shatter gallstones and kidney stones 
he said we've had this technology for about 10 years and that the beam has to be very carefully aimed so that's a great case and very well verified 
probably my favorite case involving kidney cures involves a cure of chronic renal 
failure this occurred in july 2006 to miss e a sabine from canada who actually wrote 
a book about her encounters ms sabine was having a pretty bad year her father had passed away she 
was feeling sick herself her feet started to swell and as the weeks passed her feet remained swollen 
and the inflammation spread up to her legs and lower back she started to feel nauseous and weak 
was losing her appetite and found herself unable to urinate so she went to the doctor 
and the doctor was shocked and said she was having chronic renal failure that her kidneys 
were failing causing edema and toxins to spread throughout her body he advised her that she have 
immediate dialysis or a kidney transplant this doctor said she had to be immediately hospitalized 
at this point she was also suffering from a pretty bad fever so before she went to the hospital 
miss sabine decided to go home and pray she called everyone her family she emailed her 
friends she told her employer told them all to pray for her and as she lay in bed that evening 
she fell asleep and at one point woke up to find herself surrounded by quote brown creatures 
with hooded robes on she was shocked at what happened next as she says these strange 
creatures massaged my kidneys all night and by saturday morning my kidneys were working again 
even before i felt totally safe that i was alone in my room i had to go use the bathroom this was a strange feeling since i had been able to use the bathroom for days 
i was amazed that my kidneys were apparently working again and when i went back to the hospital 
on tuesday for another blood test i was feeling much better the tests showed that my kidneys were 
indeed working now and my doctor was amazed when i asked him how this was possible when 
he already told me that it was impossible for kidney function to be restored he just shook his 
head he said it was possibly a misdiagnosis on his part i didn't tell him about the creatures 
i didn't tell anybody for a long time my sisters and my friends were amazed at my recovery and i 
simply told them that the angels came in the night and healed me i left it at that i didn't want to 
tell them the scary details and at that time i was so frustrated if people didn't believe me
so while the beings did cure her of renal failure she still felt some sensitivity nevertheless 
she was thankful and she says i decided these creatures must be angels or something if not then 
why on the night that every person was praying for me did they show up they did not harm me 
in fact they healed me apparently they were obviously not of this dimension 
and i heard them speak in a manner that was obviously not of this earth regardless i was left distressed and traumatized by the events of that night 
although always thankful that my kidney function had been restored sabine's unusual experiences 
weren't over yet was one year later when she had what appeared to be a checkup and this time 
she was taken on board what appears to be a ufo as she says i dreamt i was in the circular white room 
that was a strange type of medical exam room according to ms sabine she sat on a stool while 
an unseen doctor held a tool against her kidneys and in front of her like other contactees who have 
had these procedures she could see a full-color three-dimensional living model of her kidney 
displayed on a table in front of her as she says i was amazed at this technology 
then i saw my liver it was all black the doctor told me this is what was happening to my liver 
from drinking diet coke and i needed to quit drinking it because it was damaging my stomach and 
my liver so there you go there are 10 true cases of people who have been healed of kidney disease 
i did of course cover these cases in my book the healing power of ufos and as i mentioned in the 
beginning of this episode i think these cases are very important because they provide really good 
evidence of et intervention and they show a very benevolent side of et contact i think they also 
show how truly advanced ets are and i think these ten cases are probably just the tip of the iceberg 
the vast majority of people who experience a very extensive encounter don't report it 
so i am guessing there are many more cases involving cures of kidney disease alone 
but with 10 cases i mean that's pretty significant and i think again it shows just how truly common 
these et healing cases really are so i hope you've enjoyed this episode today i 
want to thank you very much for watching i truly appreciate it and until next time keep having fun.
