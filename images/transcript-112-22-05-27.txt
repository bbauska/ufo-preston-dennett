WHEN YOU WISH UPON A UFO (AND OTHER TOPANGA CANYON ENCOUNTERS)
May 27, 2022

Summary:
May 27, 2022
Located west of Los Angeles, California, nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains, the small community of Topanga Canyon has long been known as a UFO hotspot. In fact, on June 14, 1992, numerous people called the local police station and newspaper office reporting UFOs. And for the next two years, a wave of encounters inundated the area. Sightings, landings, UFO-car chases, bedroom visitations, abductions and more occurred at an unprecedented rate. This became known as the Topanga Canyon UFO wave.

But this wave was not an isolated event. Encounters occurred before this wave, and they continued to occur after it. This video presents a selection of ten of some of the more interesting and unique UFO encounters in this very active area. They show how strange and unusual the UFO phenomenon can be, and provide some profound insights into how UFOs behave and interact with people on Earth.

For example, there is the case of Ethan Holtzman, who was experiencing a powerful feeling of deja-vu when suddenly a blazing red UFO dropped down from the sky over his vehicle.

Or the case of Dr. David Philips (a college professor) who was woken up in the early hours of the morning to hear helicopters hovering over the canyon, sending down searchlights as if looking for something. A few minutes later, he saw what they were apparently looking for: a shiny silver disc evading the helicopters and scooting south down the canyon.

Or the case of Bruce Merrifield and Reyna Massey, who while driving through the canyon, were confronted by an enormous metallic craft studded with colored lights hovering a mere twenty feet over the nearby ridge. As soon as they saw it, the craft turned up on its side and flashed its lights at them.

Or the case of Samantha, who was driving near her home adjacent to Topanga State Park when she saw a mysterious red orb zipping across the sky, appearing and disappearing, turning at right angles, and drawing weird geometric shapes in the sky. Afterwards, Samantha began to have memories of being taken onboard a UFO.

Or the case of Taylor, who had just moved into the canyon, and began to see fleets of UFOs and even a mother ship. The UFOs appeared so many times and came so close, that Taylor ended up moving out of the canyon a short time later.

Or the case of Valerie Dennett, who looked out her window to see an exceptionally bright star in the sky. She made a wish upon the star when suddenly it blinked out, and in its place was an object with blue and red lights. Looking outside, Valerie saw two other identical objects hovering in the sky. Feeling like the object was watching her, and feeling concern for her newborn baby, Valerie tried to wake up her boyfriend. But her boyfriend could not be awakened.

These are just a few of the many unusual extraterrestrial encounters which have occurred (and continue to occur) in Topanga Canyon. It's one of California's most active hotspots, producing virtually the entire range of UFO encounters. If you want to see a UFO, this is the place to be.

Intro
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode when you wish upon a ufo and other topanga kenyan encounters 
topanga canyon is located in the santa monica mountains just west of los angeles along the 
southern california coast it's a huge hot spot with encounters stretching back really to the 20s 
and 30s 40s all the way up to the present day but on june 14 1992 there was a huge wave of sightings 
and encounters of all kinds and in fact this wave lasted for at least two years 
i ended up writing a whole book about it and i've done several youtube episodes on this already 
most notably the night of the ufos but also missing time on grand view drive 
there are a few others where I mentioned encounters in topanga such as conversations with 
aliens but in this video i'd like to do a sort of sequel to these a follow-up of the many encounters 
that occurred throughout this wave before and beyond as I said this is a huge hot spot and 
the encounters i'd like to cover today are some of the more interesting ones that have occurred there 
and involved some very unusual elements which is why I wanted to do this video for you today 
and one of these encounters actually involves my own sister so I hope you find this interesting 
and i've got ten cases i'd like to share with you today so let's just get started and the 
first case i'd like to talk about I call it was there all night kim smith's encounter 
"It Was There All Night" Kim Smith's Encounter OLD TOPANGA CANYON
this occurred in 1974 over the old topanga canyon area this is in the center of topanga canyon and 
kim smith is actually one of the people who had missing time on grandview drive and was part of 
the previous episode which I already mentioned but she did have another encounter some years later 
and she was out watching the stars late into the night and saw this bright star-like object 
which was much brighter than all the stars around sort of a planet looking thing she says 
but the problem was it wasn't moving at all it just hung there in one spot and at one point it 
did something which made kim realize that this was very unusual and I will just quote kim directly 
and let her describe her own sighting in her own words as she says it was a pretty big bright light 
a planet looking thing when dawn came this light that looked like a star just z back and forth at 
really fast speeds and just took off out of the atmosphere it wasn't a shooting star it moved in 
straight lines but like a zigzag really fast speed and then out it wasn't anything i've ever seen 
it's a thing I just don't tell people about I saw it and it was unusual and as far as i'm concerned 
it was a spaceship so this was basically a very short sighting of an anomalous light and that is 
probably the most common type of ufo that people see what's interesting about this one is that 
it stayed there for so long and she's absolutely sure that this was anomalous because not only did 
it stay there in one spot for so long but when it finally did move it moved in a zigzagging fashion 
and then accelerated at super high speeds far faster than any conventional aircraft can do 
so yeah a simple sighting but interesting nevertheless and some of these cases that i'd like to tell you next get increasingly interesting I think 
and the next case I want to talk about I call anomalous lights at night johnny's encounter 
Anomalous Lights At Night Johnny's Encounter CENTRAL TOPANGA CANYON, WHERE MOST OF THE UFO ACTIVITY OCCURS
again this is the most common type of sighting and i've got many many of these in topanga canyon 
so i'm just going to share a few of them with you this one also occurred in 1974. 
johnny and his friends watched a group of star-like objects darting overhead and what's 
interesting about this is that these objects were putting on a display that lasted for several hours 
and again I will just quote the witness directly this is johnny talking and I quote I and some high 
school friends saw some lights off in the distance that were doing things that planes don't do 
turning at right angles and just making weird right angle turns I don't think a helicopter 
could have done it they would just appear and some of these lights would just sort of go off and on 
go at right angles and things like that i've seen lights directly overhead that covered the sky 
within five or even two or three seconds really really quick so this is a type of ufo behavior 
that is quite out of the ordinary ufos are generally speaking very evasive but occasionally 
they will put on displays and dart around for hours and that's what they were doing here 
i find this sighting interesting also because these objects would disappear and reappear 
that is another type of thing that they apparently have the ability to do 
again a simple sighting but interesting nevertheless and here's one more sighting of an anomalous light at night which I think you might find interesting 
and I call this one u-turn ufo eric andrews encounter this occurred two years later in 1976 
U-Turn UFO Eric Andrews' Encounter
in a very rural remote area of topanga canyon certainly back then it was rural and it's called 
henry's ridge this is on the west edge of topanga canyon and eric andrews 
was with his friends four-wheel driving and they got stuck and had to walk all the way home 
and this was very late at night so they were out there around 2 3 am when they had this encounter 
and I will just quote eric andrews directly as he says we saw a big bright light in the sky moving 
real slow kind of hovering and then it was moving around kind of hovering for about a minute or 
so it wasn't anything i've seen before and after about a minute that we were checking it out it did 
a big u-turn then it took off an incredible speed it kind of left a trail behind it something like 
i have never ever seen and i'll never forget it I think it was a ufo and the guys I was with we all 
think it was a ufo the way it took off it did like a quick u-turn a big horse shoe turn and left a 
trail behind it and it was gone it was a chilling experience it gave me goosebumps I totally believe 
in ufos i've seen one this was just way too out of the ordinary it was really bizarre 
so this looks like another ufo that's putting on a display and I like these cases because they 
really demonstrate how ufos can move in unconventional ways so let's just move along 
because some of these encounters get really strange and have very bizarre aspects to them 
such as this next case which I call the deja vu ufo ethan holtzman's encounter 
The Deja-Vu UFO Ethan Holtzman's Encounter
and while a lot of these earlier sightings I just mentioned were fairly high up in the sky that is 
not true with ethan holtzman's encounter he saw this thing come down right down to ground level 
this was on september 22nd 1992 during this huge wave of sightings from 1992 to 1994. 
ethan holtzman was heading north on topanga canyon boulevard highway 27 in the center of the canyon 
about one mile south of old topanga canyon road and again I will just quote the witness directly 
and this is ethan talking as he says I went around the corner I was having deja vu then I came upon 
the straightaway and right up there on the left was where two people had died on a motorcycle not 
too long ago I had seen the bodies there and right there I was having a big flashback or something 
like i'd seen it all before and then I looked up and there was this huge red ball of fire and it 
looked like it just fell it wasn't a shooting star it was about 500 times the size of that 
i don't know if it was a fireball but it was red and it just fell straight down and disappeared 
i just stopped it was really weird because I was feeling so strange just before I saw it 
i don't know what it was I saw a solid mass it looked about the size of the sun it was a deep red 
i didn't hear any noise and while ethan was alone in the car he was not the only witness 
he saw someone else on the side of the road who also saw it and completely freaked out as ethan says I saw a hispanic guy running the opposite direction after it I didn't stop though 
because I was freaking out I thought the aliens were abducting me so it is possible he had missing 
time because he did not see this object leave it just came down and disappeared and this is 
something I have heard from other people who they later found out they were in fact taken on board 
ethan has no direct evidence of this i've since lost touch with him so it's very hard to say 
but I like this case this multiple witness case because it's quite unusual with this 
deja vu aspect not unique though i've heard other people say that they've had a very strong impulse 
to run outside and that's when they saw ufo or had weird feelings that something was going to show up 
and then it did so there's a very weird aspect a spiritual aspect to a lot of these encounters 
so I wonder if perhaps ethan had some kind of precognition of this at any rate it's a very 
interesting encounter now this next encounter is really why I wanted to do this video 
i call this next case when you wish upon a ufo valerie dennett's encounter this involves my 
When You Wish Upon a UFO Valerie Dennett's Encounter
little sister three years younger than me and her name is valerie and her encounter occurred 
on march 7 1993 during this huge wave of sightings at the time valerie lived in the heart of tapanga 
on a road called observation drive which is quite high in elevation and sort of overlooks the canyon 
and she had just had a baby her baby was four or five days old at the time of this encounter and 
this is when a ufo showed up it all began around 9 30 p.m when valerie and her boyfriend went to bed 
he fell asleep but valerie was having trouble sleeping and as she was laying there in bed 
she looked over at the window and the window had curtains on it which were almost fully closed but not completely there was a little crack in the curtain showing the outside 
and this is when she saw a star or a star-like object through this little crack in the curtains 
and as she says I was laying in bed looking out the window and I saw a bright star out of the 
crack of where the curtains come together and I wished i'm the star like I do sometimes it was the 
first star I saw that night it just looked like a star it didn't move so time passed she got up 
to feed the baby she lay back down in bed and this star-like object was still there in the same spot 
which she thought was odd but she didn't really think much about it and she eventually fell asleep 
however the next night the same thing happened again the curtains were still mostly closed 
except for a tiny little strip there and she was laying in bed and saw this star or this 
star-like object in the crack of the curtains and she made another wish she said starlight 
star bright first star I see tonight I wish I may I wish I might have this wish I wish tonight and 
this is when something really unusual happened and i'll just let valerie describe it in her own words 
as she says right after I wished on the star again the star started moving up and down the crack of 
where the curtains came together up and down real slow in a straight line and then it started moving 
sideways horizontally in a straight line and then it went back to the crack and the light 
went out and the little red light came on and the little blue light came on a little bit below 
and these two lights were moving sideways across the sky it went on pretty much all night I fell 
asleep around 3 30 am am it was making me kind of nervous I thought it might be watching me 
it was right in between the curtains it was freaky so this went on all night but at some point 
she did get up check this out she looked outside the window to make sure that this wasn't a weird reflection it clearly wasn't this got her curiosity so she went outside to take a 
better look and saw two more of these objects so it wasn't just one there was three of them 
and as she says they were red and blue lights it didn't look like a helicopter or a plane plus 
it moved back and forth in the same place an airplane wouldn't do that 
at this point valeria also noticed another very strange and I think significant detail 
as she says I looked out the window at the other houses and all the other lights were out in every 
other house usually there are lights on I guess everybody was out of town or something I don't 
know so this really started to make her nervous I mean her baby was just five days old and she 
felt like this ufo was watching her so she tried to wake up her boyfriend and this is when things 
went from strange to truly bizarre he would not wake up no matter how hard she shook him 
he wouldn't wake up it was as if he was in a psychic sleep or something and this is definitely 
something i've heard when someone is being taken on board and i'll just quote valerie directly as 
she says I tried to wake him up because I got nervous I thought it was watching me it stayed 
there and then it moved sometimes I thought it was watching me and I thought that maybe it was 
going to come down and take me away or my baby because I just had the baby five days before that 
i tried to wake him up but he wouldn't wake up so as you can see there are many weird aspects to 
this sighting the fact that it appeared right in the crack of the curtains where she could see it 
the fact that it's moving in a straight up and down and horizontal fashion in ways that conventional aircraft can't or don't do the fact that her boyfriend wouldn't wake up 
the fact that all the houses around had their lights off which was very unusual 
and especially the fact that she had just had her baby because this is a pattern i've seen in 
many cases the ufos will show up when someone is eight months pregnant or have just had their child 
i've got several cases of this and I think this speaks towards the et's interest in reproduction and I honestly think valerie may have had a more extensive encounter 
she has no evidence of this no weird dreams no scars on her body but of course that doesn't 
mean anything but really the fact that I mean her boyfriend couldn't be woken up this thing is very 
close low down in the sky all the other lights are off it's there for hours her baby had just been 
born all these things start to add up and I think this may be more than just a simple sighting but 
the really most interesting aspect I think is the fact that this object reacted to valerie making a 
wish that really impressed her and as she says I don't know I was looking at it it was right after 
i wished on it because I thought it was a star starlight star bright first star I see tonight 
i wish I may I wish I might have this wish I wish tonight well I didn't wish for a ufo and it was 
just a few months later on october 18 1993 that valerie did see another object swoop low through 
the canyon below the canyon walls which planes are helicopters don't do it's far too dangerous 
this object moved very quickly and it was gone but when someone has repeated sightings that's another 
strong clue that they are at some level at least a contact d I think valerie would deny this 
and asked her why she didn't call me and she said she didn't want to sound like you know she was a 
scared lady calling me in the middle of the night I told her please just call me next time I will 
come down there I want to see these things but that has been her last encounter to date 
but there are other weird encounters occurring in topanga canyon telling you if you want to see a ufo this is a great spot to do it and this next case is really incredible 
it involves a great witness and a very interesting series of events I call this encounter helicopter 
HELICOPTER-UFO CHASE Dr. David Philips' Encounter
ufo chase dr david phillips encounter this occurred in september 1993 and dr david phillips 
was then professor at santa monica college he lived on fernwood drive not far really from 
where my sister lived quite high up in the canyon at about two thousand feet elevation with a great 
view of the center of the canyon and he was woken up at around 2 30 a.m by the sound of helicopters 
very low in the sky and he got up to check it out and see what was going on and looking east 
from his home he could see that these helicopters were hovering over a very well-known landmark 
located in topanga state park this landmark is called eagle rock i've been there many many times 
and in fact all the locals know about it it's a really cool place with all kinds of caves 
and this is where these helicopters were hovering there were three helicopters all quite low in the 
sky one was hovering at about two thousand feet he estimates so it's really at eye level to him 
and there were two other helicopters that were much lower and were crisscrossing the area clearly searching for something with their searchlights and not only that he saw 
a park vehicle or perhaps a law enforcement vehicle that was barreling down the fire breaks 
in the state park this had to be an official vehicle because this area is off limits to 
any other vehicles and in fact there are locked gates that prevent anyone else from going inside 
and what really impressed dr phillips is that this vehicle was moving at a very high speed 
with its headlights bouncing up and down crazily this is quite dangerous because 
these fire breaks are not smooth roads by any mean any means they are quite rough 
so he was wondering what the heck was going on he was very much intrigued and I will just quote 
him directly and let him explain what happened next because it's really incredible 
as he says and I quote I sort of watched with great curiosity I thought well it's the sheriff 
or somebody's after bad guys in the park I couldn't figure out what it was 
i was standing there watching it then from left to right going down right over to panka creek where 
the boulevard is going down the canyon towards the ocean this craft just went by in my field of 
vision it probably lasted one or two seconds that's all it took to go from left to right 
it was very light and the helicopters were behind it and this thing just scooted down the canyon 
silently I couldn't see any lights on it it was just a bright silver and light it was kind of 
a disc shaped with sort of like a little bubble on top a luminous silvery object it looked like 
shiny metal it just transferred very quickly it was very clear it was absolutely silent 
and it just went down the creek over the highway with the hill in the background he's absolutely 
convinced this was not a normal aircraft it was totally silent it was far too low he estimates 
that it was about 60 feet in diameter and moving fairly quickly 60 miles per hour or faster 
he's absolutely convinced it was a ufo it had an almost silvery mirror-like finish 
and he knew there was ufo activity going on at this time and he was quite surprised to see it 
himself and it was apparently other people had seen it including authorities because 
he believes that these helicopters and emergency vehicles were looking for it 
and I did get calls that night from other people who said that helicopters were hovering in the area all night long so it's a very interesting case and more evidence that our 
own government was fully aware of this ufo wave of sightings that was going on in topanga canyon 
just cannot go one mile in this area without a report being there and here's another case 
i'd like to talk to you about which has some very interesting elements to it and I call this case darting red light on mordoggo road samantha's encounter 
Darting Red Light on Muerdago Road Samantha's Encounter Muerdago Road, Topanga (location of Samantha's Encounter)
samantha moved into topanga canyon in late 1993 that's not her real name 
she did not want to reveal her name she was quite nervous about being interviewed 
had no idea that topanga was a ufo hot spot and after she saw this ufo she actually saw my flyer 
on the local bulletin board at the little country store there in the center of topanga canyon 
and she called me to report her sighting she did not call from her home she was too nervous 
she actually called from the local telephone booth to tell me her sighting and I had to reassure her 
that I wouldn't use her name and that I was very much interested in what she saw 
and her encounter occurred in february of 1994 on murdago road this is just off entrada 
very near topanga state park and the location of many other encounters in topanga canyon 
and like I like to do I will just quote samantha directly and let her tell you her story in her 
own words as she says and I quote I was driving home around midnight up in trotter road along 
murdago there's one place that has a curve a panorama a really good view of the sky I 
stopped my car and looked up and I saw a red light bobbing up and down just floating and bobbing 
and then it would disappear and it would reappear it was like it was coming in and out of dimensions 
into this dimension and then it would cross really fast and I would just see this red 
stream of light where it would cross and it would appear again just kind of bouncing and blinking 
appearing and disappearing the main thing that blew me away was how it could move that way I 
knew a plane couldn't move that way it was moving really fast hopping appearing and disappearing 
was really beautiful to watch it moved in straight lines and it was making patterns 
it looked like it was almost drawing like something from geometry or something it challenged 
my whole thinking that something could move that way was just mind-boggling but it didn't scare me 
she had seen a ufo before but not like this it was the way it was moving that really impressed her 
the way it was sort of making these geometric shapes and according to some contactees they're doing that because they're following the magnetic lines of our planet 
and are just doing their best to navigate but she felt like it was almost showing itself off to her 
and she was really impressed so it would disappear and reappear this is something again we hear over 
and over again as in the previous encounters and she said it would move so fast it would leave just 
a streak of light that's another thing I hear quite often but her encounter didn't end there 
it went on and in fact persistent questioning revealed that she might be in fact a contactee 
as she says I wouldn't be surprised if I was abducted and i've been suppressing it I wouldn't 
be surprised if i've had encounters since i've been here I have memories of it vague memories
all right that's samantha's encounter and now let's move on i've got another very interesting 
case i'd like to present to you which I call a fleet of ufos taylor's encounters this man 
A Fleet of UFOs Taylor's Encounter
did not want his real name used and he only agreed to talk to me because he was moving out 
of topanga he had just moved in there recently along the north edge of topanga near the what's 
called the top of tapanga area and he started seeing ufos almost immediately 
in fact after he moved in he told his friend that he had moved to topanga and his friend said oh 
did you see any ufos up there and he said no and his friend said well tell me when you do so that 
struck him as odd and then when he started seeing ufos he realized his friend must know about the 
sightings in this area he was shocked because he did not know that this was a huge hot spot 
and his encounters began around march of 1994 and he saw ufos several times 
um often they'd be little objects which he first thought were helicopters except they made no noise and they were kind of swirling around and darting in strange patterns 
but he didn't really take much notice of him of them until it kept happening and a 
few times he saw a much larger object and these littler objects were sort of darting around it 
like it was a mother ship or something and i've heard this from other witnesses and on one time he was driving along heading south towards the center of topanga 
and this is when he saw a very large object with 10 smaller objects swirling around it and it came 
right over his head on this ca occasion and this time he heard this larger object and as 
he says and I quote I heard like a humming sewing sound I heard like a humming sound like um that's 
what it sounded like when I saw this I thought wow there must be a lot of people seeing this 
they were going down there by the ocean they were coming down low it had some speed but not much was 
so big that you'd think it would have to have more speed to get enough lift it just kind of cruised 
and went by and it was gone I was getting all scared when I was watching it it was weird 
looking it was strange whatever it was it would have been like a disc that's not really round 
it looked like some kind of flat thing but it was long to me it looked kind of like a bus 
but flatter not really tall mostly it was just lights it had colored lights on it he pointed it 
out to his wife she saw it too and again they saw these on several occasions he's absolutely certain 
now that these were not planes because they were far too low below the canyon walls as he says 
jets don't come up through the canyon not that low it was just going right up through 
the middle of the canyon it was above me but it was below the mountaintops it was in the canyon 
and after seeing them several times he became increasingly nervous and absolutely convinced 
that these were ufos as he says I believe they're from another planet I believe there's 
other people coming here other space people do I think they're ufos yes I think they're ufos 
so when these encounters continued taylor couldn't take it anymore and he moved out of topanga canyon 
it's just not something he wanted to deal with that is something i've heard from other people and in fact samantha who I mentioned earlier also ended up moving out of topanga 
and now I want to move to another case which is not lights it is a metallic craft 
and again it's got some very interesting elements to it and I call this sighting 
something I never thought i'd see bruce merrifield and rayna massey's encounter 
this occurred on july 16 1994 about the same time as taylor's encounters 
and they bruce and reyna were driving south through topanga they had just entered the 
canyon itself from the san fernando valley side the north end and were driving right through this 
beginning of the canyon there when they came upon a massive craft hovering very low 
and I will just let them describe what they saw here is bruce's testimony and I quote 
i saw this thing with a bunch of bright lights all of a sudden it was appearing over the side of a 
hill and then it just stopped pitched itself sideways and all I saw was the bottom of it 
it was kind of strange it was only like a hundred feet above the ground and it didn't have any noise 
and we have a convertible and the top was down so we would hear it it was really bizarre it was huge 
and it had a weird shape to it it was like the roof of a house but it tapered to the bottom when 
i first saw it it had like 16 lights on the bottom and then as I turned around to figure out what it 
was they quadrupled in number when we saw it it stopped it just stopped cold where it was and then 
it turned up and all we saw was just the bottom it just stopped there for like 15 or 20 seconds 
there was absolutely no noise for something being that low you would hear it I mean it was 
right above the peak there within like 10 or 20 feet above it I mean it was low it was just 
incredible was quite an amazing experience it was something that I never thought I would see 
it's funny that he says that because that's the same quote many of the ufo witnesses say 
and bruce immediately pointed it out to his girlfriend rayna who was driving so she didn't get a chance to really look at it as closely or as long as 
bruce did but she certainly did look at it and boy was she shocked as she says and I quote it just 
turned on its side and we saw the bottom part it was facing us the bottom it was tilted I started 
looking because it was so big and we were getting close to it I was like wow I don't know what it is 
and I kept looking over at it and it was just so odd i've never seen anything looking like 
that was very unusual I don't know if it was a spaceship but what else could it have been 
this one wasn't round as everyone says it should be it was like a flying boat 
reina confirms that this object had lights all over it colored lights which she says were mostly 
red and yellow and as she says there was a lot first there was just a few 
then it turned on its side and there was a lot more on the bottom as they watched this object scooted over the top of the ridge and disappeared to the east they 
quickly pulled a u-turn to get a better look at it but it was too late by then this object was gone 
what I find interesting about this case is I was in topanga canyon at the time outside conducting 
a ce5 meditation with a small group of other people just a few miles away we were all in a 
circle meditating and suddenly I got a very strong impulse to look up I kept kind of getting almost a 
telepathic message like we're here look up we're here and so I don't like to break meditation 
but I couldn't help it the impulse was so strong I opened my eyes and looked up and at that moment 
i saw a small pin prick of light straight up overhead that quickly expanded in size until it 
was like the full moon and then it just got bigger and bigger and covered a huge portion of the sky 
this was sort of a milky white light that just kept expanding and expanding in diameter until it was huge and it was a very quick sighting it just quickly winked out and 
further questioning revealed that my sighting occurred really around the same time or within 
that hour that rayna and bruce had their sighting so i'm wondering if I saw this craft 
you know coming in through a portal or leaving I didn't see a metallic craft like they did 
but I think they're that this is not a coincidence because we were so close to each other 
in virtually the same area at virtually the same time so it's certainly confirmation for 
both of us to see something unusual at the same time in the same area 
and now i'd like to move to the last case in this episode and I call this case 
"What Is That?" Linda Jordan's Encounter
what is that linda jordan's sighting this occurred short time later in august of 1994 
and this occurred again in the old topanga canyon road area this is where a lot of sightings have 
occurred it's really in the heart of topanga canyon and linda jordan became very interested 
in ufos following this sighting she was in bed with her boyfriend in this house along 
old tapanga canyon road when a huge bright light appeared outside very low in the sky 
hovering very near their home and as linda says and I quote all of a sudden there was this huge 
bright light and I said to him look look at that and he sat up and said wow what is that 
and I got up out of bed and he said you're going to go outside aren't you and I said 
yes and she went outside and so did he he followed her out and they both saw this object this light 
was huge was very low in the sky was totally silent it was clearly not a plane helicopter 
star satellite meteor balloon or anything like that and it was just hovering in place and in fact 
it just stayed there for a really long time as she says and I quote we watched it for a few minutes 
and it was not moving and it was much much too bright to be a star I mean it was bright enough 
to make us both get up and go outside to look and we've never done that before it was not a plane 
so they watched it for several minutes and it started to get boring and so they 
went back inside and looked outside a few minutes later and it was gone 
so they didn't see it move away they do believe they saw it arrive because they noticed it right away but it's another example of this unusual activity in the topanga canyon area 
so those are just a few of the sightings I wanted to share with you in this episode and 
what I find interesting about these cases is they have many unusual aspects such as 
having deja vu immediately before a sighting or watching these objects disappear and reappear 
or dart at right angles or fly across the sky all night long as if they're putting on a display 
or moving so fast that they leave a streak of light in the sky or seeing a ufo and having 
vague memories of being taken on board or wishing upon a ufo and then suddenly reacts 
i think my sister's sighting is probably one of the most unusual because this ufo showed up 
right when her baby was only five days old and as I mentioned earlier this is evidence I think that 
ets are very interested in human reproduction and perhaps that's why they showed up for my sister 
i don't know hard to say I did cover all these cases in my book ufos over topanga canyon 
and as I said I think these cases have something really interesting to say about the 
nature of the ufo phenomena and have something to contribute to our understanding of this phenomena 
and that's why I wanted to do this video for you today I hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you 
very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for the truth keep 
asking questions if you want to see a ufo go to chipanga and keep having fun.
