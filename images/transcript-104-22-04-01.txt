ALIENS TOOK YOUR BABY
Apr 1, 2022

Summary:
Apr 1, 2022
In January 2006, a young couple, Charles and Maria (pseudonyms) moved into their new home on the east coast of Canada. They were quite busy with moving in, repairing the house, starting a new business and dealing with red-tape from the Canadian government about insurance and other issues, when they became pregnant. While they had been hoping to start a family, they wanted to settle in first. Still, it was good news and quite exciting for them both.

They went to the doctor, verified the pregnancy and hired a midwife. They informed both their families of the happy news, and transformed one of the rooms in their home into a nursery for the baby.

The pregnancy proceeded smoothly. They visited the doctor and midwife regularly. At around three or four months, both Maria and Charles felt the baby kicking and squirming. Her belly grew larger and larger. Thankfully, she only suffered a minor case of morning sickness.

Then in July 2006, about seven months into the pregnancy, something strange happened. They were driving to their friends' house to attend a dinner party, and somehow became lost and disoriented. To their shock, they arrived at their destination far sooner than they should have. But unable to explain it, they just ignored it and moved on with their lives.

Other than the baby moving into a breech position, the pregnancy was still going fine. Their midwife prescribed exercises to help encourage the baby to move into the proper position for birth.

Then, two weeks later, on August 2, 2006 (at seven and a half months pregnancy), they went to sleep and awoke to a violent electrical storm over their house. The bolts of lightning were massive and quite unusual, traveling horizontally across their backyard. Frightened for their safety, Charles jumped up and closed the window. The next thing they knew, it was morning. That was weird; neither could understand how they fell asleep so quickly.

Both Charles and especially Maria felt a bit dazed and groggy. Maria felt almost as though she had been anesthetized. And looking down at her belly, she was shocked to see that it had shrunk in size. Not only that, she no longer felt pregnant. She told her husband, who said that perhaps the baby had moved away from a breech position. Maria hoped that was the case, but she didn't think so. She also noticed three strange puncture wounds in a triangular position on the arch of her foot.

Concerned, they went to see their midwife. To their dismay, the midwife was unable to detect the baby's heartbeat and urged them to visit their doctor immediately, which they did. 

The doctor ran some tests and then told them the devastating news: Maria was no longer pregnant. Charles and Maria were shocked and began crying. There was no explanation. She had not had any problems. There was no miscarriage. Blood tests had confirmed the pregnancy. They both had heard the heartbeat numerous times. Not only that, they felt the baby kicking. Still, the doctor told them that she was not pregnant, and that perhaps there had been a mis-diagnosis. Neither Charles nor Maria believed this to be the case.

Thus began a search for answers, but there were none. The only explanation that they could find was the "missing fetus syndrome." They learned that women who had experienced UFO encounters sometimes lost their babies under mysterious circumstances. Could this be what happened to them?

Examining their past, they found several clues. Charles had seen UFOs, and so had his father. Maria reported dreaming about "light beings" and on a few occasions had actually seen them in her bedroom. Then there was that weird incident on the way to their friends' house. The problem was, most of the cases they found occurred at three or four months. They were seven and a half months pregnant!

This video presents the story and Charles and Maria and their experience with the missing fetus syndrome. While they can't prove that aliens took their baby, neither of them can find any other explanation. It's an important case that illustrates one of the ET agendas involving human reproduction.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode aliens took our baby this is a very controversial aspect of ufo contact 
known as the missing fetus syndrome in which a pregnancy disappears often in association 
with a ufo encounter I've investigated many cases like this but this is one of the most 
unusual and that's why I wanted to present it to you today this case begins in january 2006 
and involves a young couple that I call charles and maria this is not their real name they prefer 
to remain anonymous they had just moved into a new home on the eastern coast of canada and they 
were dealing with all the complications of moving the house needed a lot of repairs maria herself 
was dealing with some red tape issues with the canadian government in terms of her citizenship 
as well as health insurance and charles was starting his own business so they had a lot 
going on and that's when they became pregnant they were planning on becoming pregnant but not so soon 
still it was good news they were quite excited about it and they immediately started to prepare 
they outfitted one of the rooms in their home to become a nursery 
they of course went to the doctor who confirmed the pregnancy with blood tests and other tests 
and they hired a midwife they told all their family and everything was going great in fact 
the pregnancy proceeded perfectly normally maria's belly grew in size about three or four 
months they started to feel the baby kick both she and charles maria had all 
the symptoms associated with pregnancy they visited the doctor several times and the midwife 
tracking the pregnancy which again was completely normal the first really strange thing to happen 
occurred on in july of 2006 about six and a half to seven months into the pregnancy 
they had decided to attend a dinner party at the home of one of their friends 
and on the drive there they became disoriented lost their way and the next thing they knew 
they were arriving at their friend's house too early they thought it was quite puzzling to them 
they didn't see any ufos they had no reason to think that this might involve the ufo phenomena 
that was the farthest thing from their mind so they didn't really think much of it but it was 
just two weeks later on august 2nd 2006 when they had a very unusual experience they are now 
seven and a half months pregnant at that time the baby had moved into a breach position and 
their midwife had prescribed various exercises to encourage the fetus to move into a proper position 
so maria had been doing that this could be significant considering what happened next they 
went to bed that evening and in the middle of the night they were awoken by a huge lightning storm 
directly over their home this was not a lightning storm like any other that they had experienced 
before it was quite violent very low over their home and in fact they saw bolts of lightning 
crashing down into their backyard and became quite frightened especially when they saw a really 
strange bolt of lightning moving horizontally right in front of their bedroom window so they 
were frightened about this and charles jumped up to close the window and he hopped back into bed 
and the next thing they know it's morning and they are waking up they thought that was quite unusual 
because they had a lot of adrenaline flowing but not only that they both felt somewhat groggy and 
disoriented as maria says when I woke up I noticed that my movements were very flowing and supple 
the pressure on my ribs caused by the breach position of the baby was completely gone 
at first I thought that the exercises must have worked that our midwife taught me I felt weird 
and a little dizzy and completely out of balance I did not seem to be able to wake up like having 
an anesthetic I remember telling charles that for some reason I did not feel pregnant anymore
charles could not believe this what do you mean you're not pregnant of course you're pregnant 
she had not experienced any bleeding there was no miscarriage there was no reason to think that 
she wasn't pregnant other than that they both did notice that maria's belly had seemed to decrease 
in size so they were both quite concerned about this they also noticed one other thing there was a 
weird triangular mark on maria's foot on the arch of her foot as she says I never had anything like 
that before this part of my foot is quite hollow so it does not even touch the ground while walking 
they had an appointment with the midwife in just two days so they immediately went to see her 
and the midwife became very concerned uh they were planning on having a 
home birth but after the midwife did the tests uh she started measuring 
maria's belly and maria had gone down in measurement as maria says when she measured my 
belly I had gone down in measurement from 34 weeks to 27 weeks she was very surprised and astonished 
and at first she thought like us that morning that the baby had changed positions 
then the midwife tried to find a heartbeat and she could not find the heartbeat of the 
baby she speculated that perhaps the baby's heartbeat was beating in time with maria's 
but that made no sense because a baby's heartbeat is much quicker than a full-grown adult 
so she was quite concerned and told them that the baby might be having a heart problem she couldn't 
say what exactly what was going on but recommended that they go visit the doctor as soon as possible 
at that time they were planning on having an ultrasound about two weeks later but they didn't 
want to wait so they moved up the appointment and went to see the doctor and the doctor the nurse 
rather began to examine maria and as maria says the nurse took my blood pressure and investigated 
my belly she also tried to locate the heartbeat of the baby several times without results 
she called up the obstetrician right away and looked up the information at the other hospital 
where the heartbeat was confirmed before and I had had a routine check by two different nurses 
they had both confirmed that the baby was okay the belly the right size a strong placenta and 
the heartbeat of 139 nice and regular and my home doctor had confirmed the pregnancy as well 
at 25 weeks so they brought in the obstetrician and the obstetrician conducted tests and told them 
that there was no evidence that she was pregnant any longer he did not know how to explain it 
he said perhaps there was a misdiagnosis but there was no baby 
and he said probably there would be disciplinary action taken but he really had no way to explain 
this other than a misdiagnosis maria and charles did not believe there had been a misdiagnosis the 
pregnancy had been confirmed multiple times not only had they heard the heartbeat that 
felt the baby kick both of them she had all the symptoms of prank 
of pregnancy so there was just no way they thought that this could have been a misdiagnosis 
certainly not all the way to seven and a half months but the doctor said I'm very sorry 
you are no longer pregnant and sent them home they of course both started crying at this news 
they were devastated they did not know how to explain this and started looking up information 
about how this could have happened to them and this is when they realize that there is 
a phenomenon known as the missing fetus syndrome that is associated with the ufo phenomenon
and uh they were very puzzled about this because they don't remember seeing ets or 
ufos during the pregnancy however both admit that they did have a history of ufo encounters 
they reached out to several ufo researchers before finding me and I asked them about this 
and charles said yes at one point earlier in his life he was quite depressed and had been praying 
about it and saw what he believes our two ufos uh which definitely helped lift his depression 
and maria said that she had often dreamt about light beings this was quite common for her and 
in fact these weren't all just dreams she says on at least a couple of occasions throughout her life 
she has seen what she describes as light beings in her room turns out charles's father also has 
a history of ufo sightings maria's father is a well-known psychical researcher in europe 
so these are little clues that perhaps there is a real connection here to the ufo phenomena but 
it's the missing pregnancy that really clinched it because there was just no way to explain this 
and the first thing they did was tell their both parents to their surprise their parents 
both sets of them were very supportive and as maria says and I quote to our surprise 
the people in our environment did react with understanding we just told them what happened 
and spoke our truth and I guess that is the best you can do the people who attend conservative 
churches called it an act of god or the signs and wonders that were predicted for the end times 
other people who feel more comfortable with ufo sightings in other dimensions 
could immediately sense a connection there and talked freely about it it is 
kind of beautiful that everyone has their approach to give it a place in their lives 
uh immediately following this maria did take a picture of her belly which she sent to me 
as well as the records from her midwife and as maria says this picture was taken august third 
i was very confused and had been crying as you can see in this picture I put my hands behind 
my back because we were both amazed where my big belly went so the slimmer belly would show good 
we had the feeling that there was something weird going on so even if we were not really in the mood 
we made the picture that morning anyway just to have it on file and she also took a picture of 
the mark on her foot and while they did send these to me unfortunately I do not have them now as my 
computer crashed at some point after interviewing them and I had failed to make a backup of this 
so I apologize for that but I can tell you that I did in fact see her medical records and pictures 
confirming her pregnancy so this was quite traumatic for them I think charles was probably 
more upset than maria maria felt a weird sense of peace and calmness about the whole thing 
and as the more she thought about it she became absolutely convinced that her baby was still 
alive and well and being well taken care of as maria says and I quote I still experience a 
feeling of a very light high frequency and a bright energy that feels very peaceful 
my sleeping pattern is still somewhat weird I wake up suddenly but no fear at all 
and feel dizzy when waking up I can fall asleep at any moment during the day somehow I feel very much 
at peace with what happened and when I think about it I have the tendency to smile because I have 
the sure feeling that our baby is in good hands or energy or whatever you want to call it I just have 
to take time to meditate and connect after all the where is the baby and did you already give birth 
questions in our environment have been answered so they dealt with this as best as they could 
and uh it was quite dramatic but yeah maria seems to be okay with it I was quite surprised 
uh certainly not the only person I've interviewed who has felt this way some do feel a very strong 
sense of violation each case is different but maria feels no fear and she feels like 
her contacts are very benevolent she did try to reach out to the doctors to get her tests 
and medical records to verify all this but the doctors were extremely uncooperative as maria says 
we have never heard back from the medical establishment we sent faxes and additional 
information but total silence we know that they had contact among each other they only told us 
that they don't understand it and when we ever consider another baby the head obstetrician of 
the hospital gave us his phone number so I can be his quote special patient right away normally he 
has a waiting list for new patients for over six months so that must say something I think it does 
i investigated another case involving a missing fetus and afterwards the nurse approached the 
patient and said I'm not supposed to tell you this but your pregnancy records are being sent 
to a government lab and she was very surprised about that and wanted the mother to know this 
so I think the medical establishment is to some degree aware of these missing fetus syndrome 
so that is pretty much the extent of the case I did lose contact with them for many years 
uh years later I did reach out to charles and have corresponded with him he is no longer 
with maria he believes that she may have actually gone with the ets though he can't confirm 
this he will say or he did say that he you know prior to her leaving 
he had some very weird dreams lucid dreams which she thinks are probably more than dreams 
in which he was taken on board a craft with her and saw human-like ets 
she's a very spiritual person would often read to him while he was sleeping and trying 
to educate him on various spiritual subjects I did cover this case in my book wondrous I 
think it's a very important case because I have never investigated a case involving a 
missing fetus at seven and a half months usually it's about three months maybe four but I've never 
investigated a case beyond that except for this one so that's very unusual 
what I also find unusual is how maria feels that this was a very positive experience for her so I 
cannot confirm where maria is now uh but charles last I heard is a single man and doing well 
and this case again is one of many involving the missing fetus syndrome and speaks to the et agenda 
of producing hybrid babies or being certainly interested in human reproduction so that's why I 
wanted to present this case to you today it's got some very unusual elements and really illustrates 
this et agenda quite well so I want to thank you once again for listening that's it for today I 
really appreciate you watching and until next time keep searching for answers and keep having fun.
