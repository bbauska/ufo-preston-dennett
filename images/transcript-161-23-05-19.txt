MORE CELEBRITY UFO ENCOUNTERS: THE LIST IS GROWING!
May 19, 2023

Summary:
May 19, 2023
People from all levels of society encounter UFOs, and that includes the rich and famous. In fact, there is a very long list of celebrities who have come forward revealing their own dramatic UFO encounters. Actors, musicians, sports stars -- there are now about 100 cases of celebrity UFO encounters, and the list is growing fast. Here are some new ones that you may not have heard of.

JOHNNY CASH: In Feb 1981, world-famous musician Johnny Cash was in Jamaica when he had a dramatic UFO encounter. It was a clear night, and he was outside with a group of people. Suddenly a bright streaking light caught his eye. He first thought it was a shooting star. But then he saw it was oval in shape, purple in color, and was making a strange noise. As Johnny says, “It was unearthly.”

RONNIE JAMES DIO: One of the most influential heavy metal vocalists of all times, (heading such bands as Black Sabbath and Deep Purple) Ronnie is also a UFO witness. In 1978, Ronnie and his wife Donna were in their home in New Canaan, CT when they saw an enormous globe of white light. They first thought it was the moon, but then it started to move closer. “That was the presence of a UFO,” Dio says, “and we were blown away.”

ROMA DOWNEY: Best known for her starring role in “Touched by an Angel,” Roma Downey has also been touched by an alien. While in Joshua Tree, CA on Oct 21, 2020, Roma and others saw several glowing objects. When they stayed in the sky, they actually filmed one of the objects. “Something has appeared in the skies over Joshua Tree,” Roma writes, “but what is it?”

DARRELL EVANS: Baseball superstar Darrell Evans was playing for the Detroit Tigers when, in June of 1982, he and his wife LaDonna viewed a close-up UFO hover by their home in Pleasanton, CA. The object was silent, metallic, glowing and less than 200 feet away. “It was as if they wanted us to see them,” Darrell says, “as if they had singled us out.”

GIGI HADID: Super-model Gigi Hadid stunned the world when, in 2017, she described her sighting of a UFO while driving through the deserts of California. She (and others) saw a strange “bright light" in the sky. She called the experience “crazy” and “life-changing,” and now has a strong interest in the subject of UFOs.

REINHOLD MESSNER: The most famous mountain climber in the world, it should come as no surprise that Reinhold has joined the ranks of celebrity UFO witnesses. While climbing Mount Chamblang in the Himalayas, he and climbing partner Doug Scott saw a glowing UFO for a period of three hours! Reinhold says that the object was “the size of a full moon.” Doug says “The movements of this object were irregular.”

DOUG PINNICK. Lead singer for the heavy metal band, Kings X, Doug Pinnick shocked the world when he said, “I was abducted by an alien.” One night, at age three, a beautiful man “like Jesus” appeared in the bedroom of his home in Braidwood, IL. He was led outside where he saw other similar figures. A bright light shone down and lifted him up into the sky. Years later, watching Ancient Aliens, he saw drawings of the same exact beings.

WILL SMITH: One of the most successful actors of modern times, Oscar-winner Will Smith has starred in a long list of blockbuster movies such as Independence Day, Men in Black and others. One night while driving with a friend through the Nevada desert, he saw a hovering white light, which swooped down in front of his vehicle and disappeared. “I was scared,” Will admitted. “I think there has to be something out there.”

DENNIS WEAVER: Award-winning actor Dennis Weaver is best known for his role in the TV series, McCloud. In March 1986, he and his wife Gerry had a close-up sighting of a metallic cigar-shaped object over their home in Ridgway, CO. “We just stood there and stared at it,” said Dennis. “It was certainly something that was totally unidentified, something I’d never seen before.”

KIM WILDE: Creator of the mega-hit, “We’re the Kids in America,” UK-popstar Kim Wilde saw a bright darting light over her home. “It was a UFO,” she says. “I can’t believe it.” She was so impressed, she titled her new album, “Here Come the Aliens.”

CINDY WILLIAMS: Comedic actress Cindy Williams was the co-star of the sit-com, Laverne & Shirley, which was at one point, the single most popular show on television. While in San Bernardino, CA, Cindy and others saw a fleet of orange and purple discs zooming across the sky. Says Cindy, “It was like they were trying to announce their presence to us.”

As can be seen, the UFO occupants visit all kinds of people on our planet, regardless of age, ancestry, religion, sex, occupation, location, education…etc. Or could it be that they are visiting famous people intentionally, putting on a display in the hopes that celebrities will come forward and use their platform to tell the world that UFOs are real?

Introduction
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and 
the Paranormal today's episode is called more celebrity UFO encounters the list is growing 
so this is actually kind of a part two to a previous episode I did about celebrity Encounters 
in fact I collected about 70 7-0 encounters from celebrities of all kinds sports stars musicians 
actors and so forth and yeah I was surprised to find so many people who are quite well known 
who've had UFO encounters and not just little ones some sightings yes but some face-to-face 
encounters some who say they've been taken on board so the whole gamut and when I did that 
episode there was a few of you out there who said you forgot this one and you're right I did and 
just recently going through some very interesting news clipping databases I found a couple of more 
ones that you probably do not know about who have seen UFOs and some really extensive encounters 
so that's why I'd like to talk about today I find these celebrity encounters interesting 
not only because there is a fascination with celebrities but I wonder if the 
ETS sometimes pick celebrities on purpose because they know that celebrities have a platform and 
have the ability to reach a large number of people I'm not so sure that's true because they 
do contact people from every level of society but certainly it does provide an opportunity 
to get some real air time on this subject and the cases I got are about a dozen of them slightly 
less I do have a little bit I want to add to one of the cases that I previously covered regarding 
Elvis actually who's had some very extensive encounters I found some new information about him 
but yeah I have about a dozen other celebrities who I think you've probably heard of but don't 
know that they have had some really remarkable UFO encounters and again these do cover the gamut 
we're talking about some sightings some close-up but not just sightings of entity encounters at 
least one who says he's been taken on board meant et's face to face so yeah this is pretty exciting 
a couple of these cases are really remarkable and show how profoundly a UFO experience can 
affect a person and I think you'll find it quite interesting I certainly hope so I'm 
gonna do this in alphabetical order like I did last time and yeah as I said in the beginning 
the list of celebrity sightings is growing fast and I know there are a lot of others out there 
Johnny Cash
the first case I'd like to cover is someone I'm sure you know of he walks the line he fell into 
a burning Ring of Fire and yeah it's Johnny Cash I had no idea that he had seen a UFO but I found 
a little news clipping where he did in fact talk about a sighting he had in Jamaica in February of 
1981. in fact he was in a with a group of people but he's the only one who saw it and I'll just 
read you the quote that he gave describing his sighting as Johnny Cash says in his own words 
I was on the island of Jamaica and there were a bunch of us outside it was such a nice night 
somebody said they saw a shooting star so I was looking up and I saw this object whiz by it made a 
strange noise I really can't describe I think the shape was oval and the color was new to me purple 
or Rose I'm just not sure it was gone before I could even point it out to my friends I don't know 
what it was all I know is that I saw it and it was unearthly I really feel for Johnny being unable to 
have a supporting witness talk to a lot of people who've had that problem been in a crowd of people 
and they were the only one who saw it so maybe it was just meant for him I don't know but it's 
certainly an interesting setting by a celebrity that I did not know about and here's another one 
which was actually suggested to me by one of my uh fans who listened to my YouTube channel so 
thanks for alerting me to this sighting by Ronnie James Dio who is really famous as a rock star 
of heavy metal for the most part he's probably most famous as the lead singer for Deep Purple 
Black Sabbath and of course his own band Dio which was quite successful it had two platinum albums 
and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential heavy metal vocalists of all times 
and he was asked if he saw a UFO and he says yes I have he had his sighting in New Canaan Connecticut 
it was in 1978. he and his wife Wendy had just moved and it was around midnight when they saw 
a glowing object outside he was looking through his window he at first thought it was the moon 
but could see that it wasn't so he called his wife to see it and this is when they started to 
realize this was something strange so I just I'll just quote Ronnie directly as he says 
my close encounter happened in New Canaan I happened to look out the window when I looked a 
few minutes later it was bigger then it was bigger and bigger and coming closer and closer and closer 
I thought oh my God this is it the big one I was so excited zika closer we meaning he and Wendy 
saw a car coming where we lived was kind of in a forested area and there was this one lone car 
coming down the hill as this car was coming down it was just about to intersect with this light 
I thought he's going to take this car away this car is going to shoot up into whatever this thing may be I had baited breath the car got to the intersection point 
and suddenly it went out meaning the UFO and continuing with Ronnie's testimony as he says 
but it didn't go out as though you would take a flame and blow the flame out where there is an Afterglow it was as if someone had taken a black curtain and gone whoosh and off it went 
I thought now I know that was the presence of a UFO and we were blown away the next day in the 
newspaper 20 to 45 people saw the same thing and then heard a large explosion with light after it 
so it wasn't just me and I know it was that I mean I am absolutely positive that it was that 
so yeah like many witnesses he's utterly convinced he saw something otherworldly and as he says we 
always think we're the center of the universe and it's so untrue I am fascinated by UFOs 
yeah well I am too I think all it takes is to see one and then you're in 
and here's the next case again going in alphabetical order and this is a very well-known 
actress who actually just recently came out with her sighting she is one of the co-stars of the 
Roma Downey
very popular television series Touched by an Angel and of course you know her her name is Roma Downey 
well apparently now she's not only Touched by an Angel but Touched by an alien because it was on October 21st 2020. that Roma was in Joshua Tree when she saw and actually filmed 
a strange glowing object hovering in the sky she hasn't talked a lot about this there's not a whole 
lot of information but she did post her video on Twitter and you can see images of this UFO here 
and if she writes saw these lights tonight around 7 30 PM over Joshua Tree this was the fourth Set 
of Lights the previous three disappeared and reappeared many miles apart unnerving military 
so yeah she's like many witnesses not sure what she saw again October 21st 2020 pretty 
recently and you can see from this image it's quite a bright object in the sky 
and as she says while she's filming this video live something has appeared in the Skies over 
Joshua Tree but what is it I find this fascinating because not only do we have film footage showing 
that this did in fact happen whatever it is but Joshua tree is a pretty well-known UFO hotspot 
so who knows could be moving along I think this is my favorite case in this little collection 
of celebrity encounters just because of how deeply and profoundly it affected the witness 
and the witness is if you're a sports fan you'll know him Daryl Evans he's a baseball player who signed up with the Detroit Tigers 
and in June of 1982 Daryl who was a batter for the Detroit Tigers was with his wife Ladonna sitting 
outside their home in Pleasanton California when they saw a strange light it was actually La Donna 
who sought first his wife and she called him out you've got to see this so both as it turns out 
are pretty familiar with aircraft and objects in the sky Ladonna was a former stewardess and 
Daryl Evans had been an amateur astronomer an astronomy buff since he was a little kid 
so they could see right away this was unusual I'd just like to quote Daryl as he describes what he 
saw and what happened as Daryl Evans says the light seemed to be a little brighter than any 
others and the closer it got the brighter it got what made it so unusual was that it was moving 
so slowly this is at night and as Daryl says and there was no sound whatsoever it ended up 
stopping about 60 yards from our house and just hovered there almost over a neighbor's house 
the thing was triangular in shape with the back kind of flattened out the front had a rounded nose 
and some sort of Dome all the light was coming from the back more of a glow than an actual light 
it was about 20 to 30 yards wide from the nose to the flat back end and was a dull gray color 
Ladonna and I looked at each other and didn't say a thing then after about a minute I decided 
I'd get my camera actually Ladonna was urging him to he didn't want to leave and as Daryl says but 
as but just as I was getting up to go inside the things started to leave as if to say no we're not 
going to let you take a picture of us I felt it sensed what I was about to do it was so strange 
it was a as if they wanted us to see them it was as if they had singled us out at least I want to 
think that a minute or so later it appeared again on the other side of our house about a 
half mile away then all of a sudden without any sound at all it took off like a jet and was gone 
yeah I'm not surprised to hear Daryl say that the he felt that the ET says no we're not going 
to let you take a picture of us many accounts like that where people reach for their camera and off the object goes and also I thought it was interesting that he said it was as if they 
wanted us to see them because I've heard other Witnesses describe that same thing and what I 
like about this case also is that he wasn't alone his wife Ladonna confirms everything as she says 
it was shaped like a triangle the lights were bright and white not at all like the lights on 
an aircraft the fuselage was charcoal gray kind of opalescent it looked like Steel the fuselage 
was slowed down to a windowless Dome there was no sound at all usually our dogs Kelly the shepherd 
and Bridget the Cocker would react to something like that but neither of them moved a hair 
so her testimony is important she's a stewardess she sees aircraft all day long former stewardess 
so pretty interesting to say the least and as Daryl says I guess I'd always hoped there would be 
something like this something that would come in peace I think we knew from the start what it was 
and Ladonna says it would be vain of us to think that there was no one else in the universe 
so this entire sighting they said lasted about 20 minutes they were very deeply impressed that 
they had seen something very unusual and like many witnesses they began an immediate search 
for confirmation as Daryl says the next day we checked the papers to see if anyone else 
had seen it and even called the airport to see if they'd spotted anything there was nothing 
I suspect that there were other people who saw this in fact there is a few reports which seem 
to indicate confirmation it's hard to say but people in the area did see UFOs 
and at first they did keep this sighting a secret telling only a few friends because 
as Daryl Evans says it's not the sort of thing you bring up to people you've just met 
now this is where I think the setting is very interesting because there was sort of an after 
effect to all of this so a really interesting endnote to the whole case I've come to discover 
that when a UFO gets within a few hundred feet of a witness that's a huge red flag pointing 
towards direct contact or communication of some kind something Beyond just a simple sighting 
and judging from what happened next it appear appears that Daryl Evans did have some sort of 
closer contact as he says at the time of the sightings I was with the San Francisco Giants 
sitting on the bench for the first time in my career the UFO was a special part of my life 
Daryl believes that this did have an effect on him profoundly 
he says that this UFO made him think about the universe and his place in it made his personal 
problems seem much less significant and actually enabled him to put his own personal personal 
issues aside and just focus on playing ball as he says in his own words the UFO gave me a more 
positive outlook it made me realize that there are a lot of things out there that are more important 
so this came at a time when he really needed some encouragement because this did have a huge 
effect on him and led to incredible success in his career at the time he was 35 years old and 
his position on the team had recently been filled by a 21 year old up-and-comer player Tom O'Malley 
and after seeing this UFO it completely changed his Outlook as he says when I 
got a chance to play again I approached things a lot more intensely than before 
and get this one month after his encounter Daryl Evans hit five home runs in one month 
equaling his total for the previous two months and the next season he actually hit 30 homers 
he was so successful he became a free agent and signed a three-year 2.25 million dollar contract 
with the Detroit Tigers and then went on to win the World Series so it was his best season in 
over a decade at age 38 he was the oldest player to lead the American League in home runs 40 of 
them and the first tiger to do so in about 39 years so yeah I don't know if we can put all 
of that on his UFO sighting but he certainly thinks so and I just find that so fascinating 
and here's another case which I almost didn't include because technically this did not turn out to be a genuine UFO but it's an interesting story nevertheless 
and this one involves Manu Ginobili who is an Argentinian sports star he ended up moving to the 
United States and became an NBA star playing for the San Antonio Spurs and he had an interesting 
experience on December 1st 2010 in Los Angeles and this was during a gamer um in the area 
as he says in his own words I think I've just seen an airplane in Flames plummeting unless I'm 
still asleep and it's just a dream he put this on Twitter and a lot of his followers thought he was 
joking or drunk but no he wasn't a day later he confirmed his remarks he says what did I see last 
night was there any news about it anywhere it was a strange flight pattern I saw something strange 
I'm not sure there's an Air Force Base Northwest of where we were supposed to be some space shuttle landing the good thing is I'm not 
the only one who saw it that's what really got me saying okay I am not totally crazy 
so yeah this did hit the Airways TMZ talked about it you can see a picture you actually was filmed 
and uh as Manu says it was a pretty strange flight pattern I thought it was falling not Landing 
that's it it's not a big deal it's not like I said it's an extraterrestrial life in Santa 
Monica I didn't care I saw something weird and someone who saw it with me recorded it in poor 
quality but it is a recording it is an HD high definition but that's what we've got the quote 
fire can be seen in the background so he's later speculated on Facebook that this was an aircraft 
but the mystery was solved as it turns out the company Red Bull was sending down 
skydivers to do advertising and this was in the time at the place of manu's encounters so 
it appears that's what he saw skydivers from the company that produces Red Bull 
so it's a pretty funny story and I guess you could say Red Bull really does give you wings 
not advertising for them but they can pay me later I guess anyway I thought it was funny uh 
moving forward here we have another case and this comes from World Demis model JiJi Hadid 
and I don't have a whole lot of information on this case but she believes she did see a UFO 
and she did an interview with Harper's bizarre Arabia in 2017 where she recounted her story of 
seeing a bright light in the sky with her friends while driving through the California deserts 
and yeah I don't have much information on it but she described her experience as quote crazy 
quote life-changing and she said it convince her that there might be more to the universe than what 
we know and since then she has occasionally posted about UFO sightings on her social media accounts 
and it has expressed her fascination with the topic of UFOs so there you go again all it takes 
is one sighting to really make you think moving along so the next case I'd like to cover involves 
Reinhold Messner
a gentleman who you may not have heard of but you should know him his name is Reinhold Messner 
and he is easily one of the most famous and accomplished mountain climbers in the world 
and in October of 1981 he went public with his sighting of a UFO while climbing in the Himalayas 
he and his climbing partner Doug Scott also very well known were attempting to climb the mountain 
it's called Mount shambalang it's located near Mount Everest in the Himalayas and this is a big 
mountain it's 24 000 feet more 24 248. and they weren't successful in summoning the mountain but 
while they were on the climb they did see a glowing object that they described as quote the size of a full moon but it wasn't a full moon because it was moving around as a Reinhold 
Messner says in his own words it was moving very slowly it moved Eastward and then went West again 
Southwest and drifted finally North into Tibet so both he and Doug Scott watched this for a long 
time a full three hours until it finally moved off they later learned it was also cited by a nearby 
joint polish British Expedition that wasn't at the same time it appears to have been the same object 
Doug Scott sought also he confirms it as Doug Scott says it could not be a satellite 
because it moved in an elliptical manner the movements of this object were irregular 
pretty darn interesting and moving along here's a really interesting case which occurred quite some 
time ago and the main witness in this case is Doug pinnick a rocker musician from Braidwood Illinois 
I'm one of the people who wanted you guys who watched my YouTube channel alerted me to this so thank you for that uh Doug pinnick is super famous this encounter occurred to me 
is just a tiny little boy this was in 1953 he's a toddler uh he this occurred in Braidwood Illinois 
now Doug pinnick is famous as being a member of the Hard Rock metal band King's s x 
he's a bassist and singer and in an interview he says that he not only believes he has seen 
UFOs but he was taken on board as he says I'm definitely convinced of that I was abducted by 
an alien once I was a little kid and this being came into my bedroom I thought it was a person 
I thought it was Jesus because he had long blondeish white hair and he was really tall 
and he had a white robe on with sandals that tied up his leg I was about three years old at the time 
I remember he took my hand and I got out of bed and we went out into the backyard this 
was at night time and all of a sudden it was very bright and we started going up and all I 
remember is there was this blinking light and there were other people that looked like him 
and they were going with me I got scared and I remember all I knew is I had a panic attack 
and I tried to get away from him because I was scared at that point I didn't know anything and 
the next thing I remember I was in my mom's lap crying so at the time he wondered could this be 
a dream was this a real experience he felt it was real it felt real you went outside so he always 
wondered about this and it was many many years later that he got some interesting confirmation 
as he says and I quote I was watching Ancient Aliens about five years ago 
and while he's watching this show Ancient Aliens he saw images of ETS that they were 
flashing on the screen they're often called nordics These are the human looking type of 
ETS and as Doug says the Nords that's the thing that came and got me it happened so I believe 
it plus I've seen UFOs they did crazy things that normally can't happen yeah he said that the images 
that he saw on Ancient Aliens matched exactly what he saw the hair the clothes the robes all of it 
so now he's absolutely convinced that at age three he was taken on board a UFO he's a huge 
UFO fan and he says given the opportunity he would definitely go live on another planet 
moving along this one I want to thank Renee Cruz for alerting me too and this is a sighting by 
Will Smith
Oscar winner Will Smith the star of many movies Men In Black Independence Day kind of coincidental 
them being about UFOs and ETS but when Will Smith went on the tonight's show with Jay Leno he talked 
about his experience with a UFO and apparently this was somewhere in Las Vegas maybe near Area 51 
he didn't really say I don't know the date of it either but just like to quote What Will Smith says 
what he told Jay Leno as he says I'm just going to tell you it was this one night it was on a 
dark dark road going to Vegas or something like that it's me and a friend of mine and I'm driving 
and it was really quick comes down whoosh and just shot off and I kind of kept driving so you can 
actually see a clip of this online if you want to see we'll talk about it firsthand but he said this 
object just appeared and disappeared very fast as he says it was like quick enough that it was just 
fast enough that you don't really remember what it was and it was a light and it could have been 
something but it was like some stuff had flew man and so Jay asked well could it be military 
and Will Smith says but it was the way that it flew whoosh it just hovered for one second it 
did like that he makes a hovering motion with his hand and then shot off and Will Smith kind 
of jokingly half jokingly said I was scared I was scared actually I'm really scared now 
because if I keep doing all these Alien movies it's like they're gonna think I know something 
so Jay asked him if he'd go on board given the opportunity and Will Smith being the joking kind 
of guy he is said I need to talk to them I'd say look I'm really important to my people here 
but that seems like something you'd have to explore if they were to come down and it was 
just me and they brought the ship and they said hey well you've been talking about us 
let me talk to you a second it seems like you've just got to just to see what the ship is like 
and again like most UFO Witnesses he's convinced that UFOs are real and as he 
says I think it would be arrogant of us human beings for us to assume that we are the only 
living creatures in this vast universe I think there has to be something out there 
yeah I agree and moving along to our next celebrity this one really surprised me 
I did not know about this I'm sure you've heard of the actor Dennis Weaver 
Dennis Weaver
he's best known as the lead actor in Mcleod a very popular television series but he was 
also on Gunsmoke and in many western movies he started the hit Thriller duel and yeah a 
very well-known actor in fact he was at one time the president of the Screen Actors Guild he's an 
Emmy Award winner very interesting guy he's very spiritual he's been a vegetarian since 1958. he's 
a follower of paramahansa Yogananda founder of the self-realization fellowship it was an avid 
environmentalist and an animal rights activist a humanitarian a really influential one he founded 
an organization which daily fed thousands of the poor and the homeless in Los Angeles I find this 
fascinating because this is something we see with a lot of contactees they're very much along these 
lines environmentalists and humanitarians at any rate it was in March of 1986 when Dennis Weaver 
and his wife Jerry were in their home in Ridgeway Colorado when they had a very close up sighting 
and they would not have seen anything if a friend of theirs and a neighbor did not come 
running down the street screaming at the top of his lungs I want you to verify this look 
at that so he pulled him outside and pointed at the sky and Dennis and his wife couldn't believe 
it there was a UFO and I'll just quote Dennis Weaver directly as he says my wife Jerry and I 
were standing in the front garden we looked up and there was this strange looking object 
it was sort of cigar-shaped tubular shaped and it just hung there for the longest period of time 
it had no lights or any type of cloud around it we just stood there and stared at it it 
was certainly something that was totally unidentified something I'd never seen before I couldn't find any reasonable explanation for it it hovered and then it simply disappeared 
so this sighting left Dennis and his wife Jerry firmly convinced in the reality of UFOs and as 
Dennis Weaver says I know UFOs exist and I believe they are manned I personally feel 
that the chances of their being intelligent life someplace else in the universe which has billions 
of SARS and planets is absolutely astronomical we are being observed in much the same way we 
might observe bees or ants I'm not sure I agree with that but it is an interesting quote and 
also interesting is Dennis Weaver himself became something of a UFO Advocate along 
with his son Rustin Rusty and as Rusty Weaver an actor in his own right says my father and I have 
talked with scientists and UFO researchers who have documented case histories so yeah Dennis 
is a Believer he's seen himself as he says I believe in UFOs I've seen one with my own eyes 
I think there's a lot of evidence we've made contact many of the Unexplained flying objects 
and unexplainable happenings are the result of other forms of life making visits to our planet
all right next case which is again one that was alerted to me by someone who 
saw my video so thank you for that and this involves British pop star Kim Wilde 
is probably most famous for her song were the kids in America 
Kim Wilde
at any rate she says she saw a UFO in 2009. and I will just quote her directly as she says I 
was in our garden with my husband and a friend helicopters and a bright light came towards us 
maybe they were after someone but then they left and the light remained behind the cloud in the sky 
and everyone thought I'd been on the Pinot Grigio no drinking but as Kim Wilde says I was looking 
up and it moved from 11 o'clock to two o'clock again and again and then a smaller one joined it 
my husband went running in to find something to film it but I felt compelled to watch it it 
inspired me it was a UFO I can't believe I saw it so yeah this did affect her profoundly as it often 
does she has very strong feelings about ETS in fact she titled her new album here come the aliens 
and she thinks they are looking down on us I'm wondering if she had some level of contact because what she says is something I do here from contactees as Kim Wilde says in her own words they 
have been keeping an eye on us for a long time and are in despair because of the way we treat each 
other and the planet and they are sitting around holding conferences about what they are gonna do 
with this lot meaning us and we're a sorry lot the way we treat each other in our planet I just found 
that interesting because she's echoing what the same message a lot of contactees get and now we 
move to another case that really quite shocked me I had no idea that Cindy Williams had seen a UFO 
and Cindy Williams is probably best known as the co-star of the mega hit sitcom Laverne and Shirley 
which at one point was actually the single highest rated most popular show on television 
she's quite an accomplished actress she also started in the comedy movie Euphoria which is 
all about UFOs which is what prompted her to come forward with her sighting and one of her 
big breaks was in the mega hit movie graffiti so interestingly enough Cindy Williams was born in 
August 1947 one month after the Roswell UFO crash and sadly she just passed away a few months ago 
this year in 2023. but what many people don't know is about her close-up sighting of a UFO in 1980. 
she was at a church retreat in the San Bernardino Mountains in Southern California 
and I'll just quote Cindy directly as Cindy Williams says I've seen UFOs I've seen them 
Cindy Williams
I was with a group of people and we were walking up a hill when these four lights seemed to rush 
over the mountains towards us they were orange and purple discs gleaming and shimmering they 
vibrated in perfect formation it was like they were trying to announce their presence to us 
there were eight kids in our party and we stared at those saucers for several minutes then with 
an incredible speed they were sucked into the distance and disappeared so pretty interesting 
she's not the only witness to it I thought it's interesting that she said it was like they were 
trying to announce their presence that wouldn't surprise me at all UFOs do seem to put on displays 
so yeah that's Cindy Williams sightings and she's also had some interesting psychic experiences as 
well she's very much into pyramids and period pyramid powers and she also said that she once 
had a prophetic dream about her future many prophetic dreams but one dream really impressed 
her because it provided encouragement for her when she was at the lowest point of her acting career 
and she says it convinced me to keep on trying so that I'd become a very successful actress 
what she did I just wanted to include that because we do see that a lot of contactees 
have pronounced psychic abilities and that just seems to turn up again and again so those are the 
cases I wanted to cover from celebrities who have seen UFOs but there's one more as I said in the 
beginning that I'd like to talk about I already did talk about Elvis Presley's many encounters 
but I found out something interesting it's an interesting endnote to his life and his contact 
with ETS because apparently people are seeing UFOs over Graceland over Elvis Presley's grave 
site in Memphis Tennessee in fact in 1980 there were some 13 reported sightings at Graceland and 
these are not distant sightings by any means these are objects that are hovering as low as 20 feet 
over his tomb his grave site and actually shining down beams of light there are first-hand witnesses 
as one witness says he's a security guard and I'll just quote him directly use my name and 
I will lose my job but this place is getting to be like Close Encounters of the Third Kind 
I have seen the spacecraft around here several times they always come between two and four in 
the morning when hardly anyone's around the first time I saw one was on a drizzly night last April 
I heard a strange noise near the grave like an electrical popping like a high tension 
wire that's been blown down I ran out there size strange Glow In The Clouds above the tomb then a 
saucer-shaped object dipped out of the clouds and came down within a few yards of the grave 
then the whole area was lit up by a ray of light from the underside of the ship now my job is to 
protect that tomb with my life if necessary but I was so scared I couldn't reach for my gun after a 
few seconds the light suddenly went away and the shoop the ship zoomed away now he did actually try 
to call on his walkie-talkie but he says it was filled with static and he's not the only one who's 
seen this he's talked with his co-workers it's well known among them as he says all of us who 
work here have seen the UFOs but were under strict orders not to talk I've told you too much already 
but this did get into newspapers because reporters were able to find Outside Witnesses 
there were some Elvis super fans who visit the gravesite regularly and they're talking including 
16 year old Sandy Lee Smith who told reporters and I quote I was one of Elvis's biggest fans 
I feel close to him when I can park outside the fence at night and look toward his grave 
the night I saw the UFO I was with my friends Debbie Barnes and Rhonda flowers we saw the Flying 
Saucer Dart down from the sky there was a strange humming in the air it was raining and the tomb is 
a good distance from the street but there was no doubt about it a beam of light lit up the tomb 
I jumped out of the car the UFO started to go away but it came back and hung around for 10 seconds or 
so before disappearing it's a pretty interesting endnote I think you'll agree to the Encounters of 
Elvis Presley so that's it that's all I could find so far I think that's close to at least a hundred 
celebrities now who report encounters I will say that I know for certain Marina certis who played 
Troy on Star Trek the Next Generation did have an encounter I know there's an article somewhere in 
People magazine I saw an interview with her where she talked about her sighting but I couldn't find 
any information on it so I didn't include it in this episode but I definitely wanted to give it 
a shout out maybe one of you out there can find some more information for me I'd certainly be 
interested but yeah as you can see these celebrity encounters match up exactly with what other people 
are telling no surprise there but it's interesting to see that people of all levels of society are 
having encounters sightings being taken on board face-to-face encounters with entities 
and with celebrities there's an added complication because a lot of these people I think are keeping quiet it is still a subject that's not fully accepted in mainstream Society 
and I think can cause people to sort of roll their eyes a little bit chuckled behind your back 
and I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that there are many many other well-known 
celebrities out there who have seen UFOs and are not stepping forward I know at least three 
four or five myself and I'm not going to say because until they step forward it's not up to 
me to out to them but yeah I know it's far more numerous than we hear about and that this list 
of about a hundred celebrities will continue to grow I certainly hope so so hope you've enjoyed 
this episode today I want to thank you once again for watching as always I truly appreciate it keep 
looking for answers keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye.
