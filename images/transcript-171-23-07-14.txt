I SAW AN ALIEN THROUGH THE WINDOW OF A UFO: 14 TRUE CASES
Jul 14, 2023

Summary:
Jul 14, 2023
This is a strange category, but there are many cases where people encounter a craft that is so close, they can see the humanoids inside of it! It’s a unique category that is more than just a UFO sighting, but not quite an onboard experience. Yet, they are equally fascinating and often involve very high strangeness. With multiple witnesses and lots of physical evidence, these cases represent an important contribution to our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.

1952, SEAT PLEASANT, MD: It was a hot summer night, when Suzanne Knight heard a strange buzzing noise. Looking outside, she saw a glowing object descend. She thought it might be a crashing plane, but then the object stopped and through one of the windows, she saw a strange figure.

1954, RANTON, ENGLAND: Hearing a strange sound, Jessie Roestenburg rushed outside her home and saw her two children lying on the ground in shock. A large UFO hovered overhead. And looking down at them through a large picture window were two beautiful human-looking ETs.

1957, OLD SAYBROOK, CT: When a bright light flooded her room, Mary Starr looked outside and saw a massive cigar-shaped craft hovering only a few feet above the ground. It was lined with portholes, and inside the craft she saw three very strange figures wearing weird uniforms and strange square helmets.

1959, MARIANNELUND, SWEDEN. Suffering a sudden power-failure, Gideon Johansson exited his house only to watch a saucer-shaped craft descend into his yard and almost land. Through the windows, she saw two strange bald figures with big beautiful eyes filled with intelligence. 

1962, LAKE MOVIL, MN: After the entire family had a UFO sighting, Mildred Anderson and her daughter Marilyn notice an odd glowing red object outside their cabin. Looking outside, they are amazed to see a large window on a craft, and inside are two ETs staring right at them.

1968, REUNION ISLAND, FRANCE: Hiking in the forest to pick some grass for his plants, Luce Fontaine comes upon a massive craft hovering about 15 feet above the ground. Through a massive picture window, he saw two ETs wearing spacesuits that looked just like the Michelin Man.

1973, MANCHESTER, NH: Driving home, Lyndia Morel was puzzled by a colorful star-like object that blinked on and off and seemed to follow her car. Without warning, the object appeared in front of her car, a massive craft. And looking down at her was a gray-skinned alien with big dark eyes.

1974, MEDELLIN, SPAIN: Driving to his father’s farm, Santiago Pulido Romero saw a UFO pacing his car. He blinked his headlights at the object, which reacted by zooming towards him. As he arrived at the farm, the craft followed. And inside, through the window of the craft, were weird-looking aliens.

1975, SAN ANTONIO, TX: He first thought it was a helicopter, but when it hovered over his truck, Alois Olenick realized he was seeing a genuine UFO. It had a huge window in front, through which Alois could see two strange-looking short figures with bald heads, pointed ears, big noses and gray wrinkled skin.

1977, TUCSON, AZ: Running outside their home, Lois Stovall and her grandmother, Alice were amazed to see a tiny capsule-shaped UFO with a child-sized figure standing up inside it. It was so close, they could almost touch it. They watched it swoop up into the sky while nearby helicopters searched for it.

1977, DORSET, ENGLAND: Ethel May Field went outside to take the laundry off the clothesline when suddenly a large craft swooped down and tilted towards her. Inside, through a large window, she saw two human-looking ETs. And one of them was looking down and pointing right at her.

1979, SAN FERNANDO, CA: When an intense UFO wave strikes the area, dozens of people report low-flying craft. Two witnesses have a craft approach so close to them that they can clearly see two humanoid figures looking down at them through the window of the craft.

1983, MOBILE, AL: Driving off Highway 90 to her home, Pat Norris sees a strange light in the forest. Pulling over to get a better look, she sees a massive craft hovering overhead. A long panel window lines the craft allowing her to see dozens of white-suited figures walking gracefully around the craft.

OCT 2003, WESTERVILLE, OH: David Noll and his wife can hardly believe their eyes. Hovering in the sky above their home is a large craft with a humanoid figure inside. When it remains in place, they view the UFO through binoculars and can see that the figure is wearing a light-colored one-piece suit.

These 14 cases span six decades and come from across the planet. They provide some profound insights into the UFO phenomenon. They show that it is global, ongoing and incredibly varied with UFO shapes and humanoid types. Most important, they show that UFOs are showing themselves intentionally in what appears to be a publicity campaign announcing their presence. The question is, will we listen?

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
I have quite an unusual episode for you today. I call this one, "I Saw an Alien Through the Window
of a UFO". I know that might sound a little bit arbitrary but it's really not. This is actually a 
pretty sharply defined category of UFO encounters. A lot of cases where people are driving along or 
perhaps walking outside or are in their home. And they're alerted to an object outside and 
they are all seeing these objects. These UFOs are very low generally at treetop level or even lower. 
There's a large picture window usually or a bunch of portholes and people are seeing these 
humanoids right through the window. Not only that, seeing right inside the UFO itself. 
So yeah, it's an interesting category of UFO encounters that goes beyond the mere sighting. 
Perhaps not quite as extensive as a landing though in a few cases the UFO did apparently land 
these are not onboard experiences though that may have happened in a couple of these cases 
but yeah these are cases where people saw an alien through the window of a UFO 
and they have a lot to say and to teach us actually about UFOs the shapes they 
come in the types of humanoids they are and more particularly why they are behaving in this way 
so today I have 14 cases I'd like to present to you these are coming from all over the world 
they reach way back to the 1950s all the way up to the pretty much present day the 2000s 
so over many many decades and these involve all kinds of witnesses and in many of these cases 
multiple Witnesses a good number of these cases do involve physical evidence of various kinds 
and also many many different types of humanoids so some very interesting aspects to this 
this is going to be quite a lengthy episode I have 14 cases that's a lot so let's just Dive Right In 
the first case I'd like to talk about occurred in Seat Pleasant Maryland 
and what I like about this case is it's such an early case 1952 actually 
which predates pretty much the vast majority of humanoid reports this is before the contactee 
era of George adansky Truman bathroom Howard Menger Daniel fry people just weren't talking 
about humanoids and yet here's a case of a witness who saw a UFO very close up in 
her backyard and through the window of it saw a humanoid it was a hot summer evening in August 
of 1952 around 9 30 PM when Suzanne Knight was in her kitchen and heard a strange buzzing noise 
she first thought it was an insect but looking out she saw a glowing object shooting down very 
quickly at about a 45 degree angle she first thought it might be a crashing plane but then 
the object stopped and it hovered about a half block away only 300 feet in the air so pretty low 
she said it was silver in color lined with square portholes illuminated by a yellow light 
and looking through these portholes she saw what looked like strange rows of cabinets 
with slanted tops now the craft itself she said looked like a wingless fuselage of an airplane 
and on the top left side front of the object she saw a bright red light 
there was also a bottom section like a gondola off of a dirigible she said that had a smaller 
row of Square Windows and it was through these windows that she saw what looked like seats 
and I'll just let Suzanne describe in her own words seeing someone inside this UFO as she says 
there was a man in front looking straight ahead towards the front I couldn't understand what he 
was looking at so intently and not moving either I expected to see a lot of instruments or dials 
Etc similar to instrument panels on airplanes but there were none that I could see 
she said that everything inside this craft looked yellow from the yellow light inside and the man was wearing a helmet of some kind and she watched this for about a minute and then 
left to call the newspaper nobody answered the phone so she hung up and returned to the window 
the crop was still there but she could no longer see the figure and as Suzanne says 
I thought maybe it had moved up into the fuselage because not even an outline of the guy was visible 
but it should have been because the street light would have shown it so suddenly the object the 
lights on the object went out the craft which had been silver now glowed red and it began to 
rock forward and back and Suzanne saw what looked like heat waves emanating from the craft itself 
at this point she called for her sister who was in the house to also come see this object 
but her sister didn't respond so Suzanne quickly rushed to find her and when they 
returned to the window the object was gone Suzanne's sister seemed a little bit skeptical 
but Suzanne was absolutely sure she saw something very unusual but this is 
interesting because following the incident she completely forgot about it until years later 
and it wasn't until 1967. almost 15 years later that she reported the sighting to nightcap 
the national investigative committee for aerial phenomena who investigated the case interviewed 
her and were unable to account for the object as a conventional aircraft yes that is a single witness 
case but it does fit the pattern we see in so many of these other cases as we shall see and this next 
case is by no means a single witness the whole family saw it this occurred in Renton England 
and this case became very well known you may have heard of it before but it's such a marvelous case 
with multiple Witnesses and physiological effects and more it's not just one event that I think it's 
an important case with a lot to say so that's why I wanted to include it in this compilation and 
yeah it's a wild case the primary witness in this case is Jesse rostenberg again she's not the only 
Witness but it had been all that day on October 21st 1954. Jesse had been feeling strange quote 
tingles all day now she had had prior events with psychic precognition so she was pretty sure that 
something unusual was going to happen and it did was at 4 45 pm on that day when two of Jesse's 
children Anthony age eight and Ronald age six were in the backyard Jesse heard a loud crashing sound 
and rushed outside to find her two boys lying on the ground terrified and directly above them very 
low was a huge saucer-shaped object with a dome on top and that was amazing enough but staring 
down at her children Jesse saw two quote unsmiling human-like creatures with long faces and long hair 
so Jesse describes this craft as being about 15 to 20 feet in diameter a dull 
metallic silver and the outer rim she said appeared to be rotating it was totally silent 
the beings she said had white skin long hair very high foreheads so that their features were 
almost entirely on the bottom of their face she said they were both wearing transparent helmets 
kind of like a fish ball and a blue one piece uniform that kind of reminded her of ski suits 
so I'll just let Jesse describe in her own words this experience she says to my amazement there 
suspended on the top of the roof of this Old Farm was this object that I can only describe as a huge 
Mexican hat it was that shape without the bobbles it must have been 15 to 20 yards from where I 
stood it covered the roof so in circumference it must have been about 60 feet it was enormous 
the people in the spacecraft were just looking out I could see them from the waist to the top of their heads they were very beautiful people they had long golden hair 
and they just looked at us their eyes the expression in their eyes were full of compassion 
they just looked and I was absolutely paralytic with fear I couldn't move although my mind was 
taking over and they seemed so sympathetic that I was mesmerized it seemed to be ages but it 
could have only been seconds it felt like hours passed but it must have been seconds 
time was suspended I was also paralyzed it was like I was in a vice but my mind was 
working overtime and all of a sudden I felt the tension leaving me and I felt movement 
and I turned around to touch my children and when I looked again it was gone 
so they all rushed back inside and Jesse went to fetch some paper and pencils so they could all 
sketch what they had just seen and that's when her two boys called out that the UFO 
had returned again so they all ran outside and watched this craft Circle the house two or three 
times and then streak skywards and it was gone now Jesse's husband Tony hadn't seen The Craft 
but he had a feeling that it might come back and he kept a sharp eye on the sky and sure enough he 
was right three days later on October 24 the UFO or probably a different one because it was larger 
came down and maneuvered in a long semi-circle curve around the house about one mile away 
he called up to Jesse and there was another guest in the house they all came out and 
watched this craft move off and then two months later December 15 another UFO returned a glowing 
fiery object which descended slowly until a plane appeared and apparently scared this object off 
so this affected them all really profoundly particularly the children Jesse's younger 
daughter Karen began crying much more than she had before and she said her boys also began acting up 
as Jesse says I can see a tremendous change in them whether it's a reaction after their fright 
or what I don't know but they are much not here now than they have ever been before it happened 
so Jesse was also so stressed out that she broke out in a rash as she says it's on my 
face and arms and I don't know what it is just nerves the same as my edginess and bad temper 
so afterwards Jesse says she felt both revitalized and also a little bit ill 
and in fact she lost quite a bit of weight concerned her so much she visited the doctor 
and learned that her blood count had dropped dramatically and the doctor told her you know 
it's crazy to say this but I'm wondering if you have ever been exposed to radiation 
so these are some interesting physiological effects but emotional as well 
uh Jesse's husband Tony confirms that all of them felt changed as he says that old Cottage 
ever since that UFO hovered over it something snapped there and almost made us snap too 
so the family was so dramatically affected by this encounter that they ended up moving and 
this move did bring immediate relief things began to get back to normal 
but never fully back to normal because Jesse says that following this encounter her psychic 
abilities increased massively as she says it was quote great almost extreme development of ESP 
I know things about people I understand situations all this Probably sounds crazy but it is true 
ultimately despite all the weird After Effects she did feel like it was a positive experience she 
kept sensing the ETS around even sometimes perhaps seeing them in her house and she felt that the ETS 
were watching over her and her family and she says I think they'll be there when I need them yeah 
I like that case for the reasons cited multiple Witnesses physiological evidence and it's amazing 
how profoundly it affected all the witnesses the entire family was really profoundly emotionally 
affected by this encounter which is a pattern we see a sighting can absolutely change your life 
and that's what we see in a lot of these cases and this next case I would say is no exception 
this one occurred in Saybrook Connecticut and what I like about this case is it probably 
would have gone unreported except for the fact that the witness Miss Mary M Starr 
was very well educated she went to Yale University and had two Master degrees and this is what 
prompted UFO researchers to take her seriously because this is a single witness case and what she 
described is incredibly unusual this UFO it's so close to her it's a very strangely described UFO 
and even more stranger the humanoids she described but a very lucid witness and I think an important 
case this next case occurred on December 16 1957 and the main witness is Mary M Starr 
and as I said she had two degrees a master's degree from Yale she was a teacher she lived alone 
and it was around 2 to 3 A.M on December 16 1957 when she had this incredible sighting which I'll 
just let her describe in her own words as Mary says I was awakened by a bright light in my room 
I looked out the window and there was what I first thought was a crippled airplane in my back Garden 
but when I got my eyes really open I saw that it was a cigar shaped object brightly 
lit and with square portholes hovering just above my clothesline I could see men inside 
so this object is very very low and it's huge she says the object was about 25 feet long gray 
or black with square portholes and she thought that it was about to crash but then it became 
motionless at this point it's hovering about five feet above the ground and looking through 
these portholes she saw two figures walking by passing each other walking in opposite directions 
and at some point she realized they could not be very tall she says I could see that it the 
object was so shallow that the men could not have been more than three and a half or four feet tall 
and they were very unusual looking she said that the right arms were raised they wore uniforms 
like stewards on a ship and seemed to be carrying trays of some kind but she said their heads were 
very unusual looking almost squarish red orange with a bright red bulb in the center perhaps 
some kind of helmet she thought and then she saw a third figure walk right in front of the portholes 
at this point the entire craft began to Glow the portholes sort of faded away as the entire shell 
of The Craft glowed more and more she watched as an antenna began to extend from the near end 
it began to Sparkle and oscillate and after about five minutes antenna device retracted 
and the object began to move in sharp right angle turns almost hitting her blue spruce tree 
the surface of this craft now looked blue gray and instead of portholes she saw a small circular 
lights outlining the perimeter she said the craft from this perspective now looked oval 
and she washes it dipped and Rose following the Contour of the train below it 
then it tilted steeply and took off like a jet but in complete silence and was gone it's incredible 
the variety of the shapes of UFOs we see and the types of humanoids I think that case typifies this 
and while it is a single witness case there were in fact a bunch of sightings that followed in that 
area which does lend a level of corroboration to it doesn't prove her case which is anecdotal 
but yeah I just found it a super fascinating case and this next one I think is one of my 
favorite in this Bunch because this one does have multiple Witnesses and an enormous amount 
of physical evidence of different kinds and by that I mean electromagnetic disturbances 
Landing traces physiological effects and more because this wasn't an isolated event 
this one occurred in marianland Sweden and it's a truly remarkable case the main witness 
in this case is an electrical worker and former Army officer by the name of Gideon Johansson he 
was 67 years old it was September 29 1959 just before 7 PM Gideon was in his home when there 
was a weird power failure so he went outside to check on it and saw that his son Ralph 
was looking up he told Ralph that all the lights were out and his son pointed upwards and said 
yeah but not up there it's light enough up there and as Gideon says in his own words 
I looked up hovering above a three-story building was a blinding white light 
I called through the window to my wife telling her to run out of the house because I thought an 
aircraft might be going to crash onto it but the machine stopped still in the sky 
at first we thought it was a helicopter but we realized that it was not making any sound 
the craft moved again slowly descended and it seemed to be heading for our garden 
so Gideon's son is watching all this happen and he screamed run father get out of the way quick 
but at this point the craft rocked three times turned to the right actually smashed into a 
nearby maple tree and then descended until it was hovering only one and a half feet above the ground 
and it stayed there kind of rocking like a boat on waves this point Gideon was less than 10 feet away 
he says the craft was about 15 feet wide and 12 feet high was sort of an oval saucer 
with a metallic surface there were four oval portholes which allowed him to see right inside 
so it was pretty crudely instructed constructed he thought that was kind of interesting 
but as Gideon says and I quote inside it I saw an unusual white light very compact I have never seen 
anything like it I can only describe it as being like sunshine on new fallen snow I could see it 
shining through what appeared to be a large glass window and inside it were two strange individuals 
their heads were very high crowned and they had big very beautiful eyes full of intelligence with 
a piercing look I felt that they were looking right through me reading my mind I don't know 
how to explain it but somehow I felt that I knew what had happened to them they seem to be friendly 
their noses were long and thin with small nostrils they had small mouths and pointed chins with small 
lower Jaws they wore neat white uniforms with broad black belts crossed over their shoulders 
and chests they were small men about the size of a 14 year old I had plenty of time to take 
a good look at the craft and the people inside of it it was a weird feeling that came over me seeing 
these creatures they radiated something that made you feel transparent and kind of negative 
their faces were chalk White it seemed like some apparatus was sticking out of their heads 
so Gideon's son Roth also saw the craft and the portholes but he became frightened he 
was too afraid to approach and said that he was actually scared stiff in fact later that day he had a track meet and was unable to run because he was so shaky 
so this encounter is going on Gideon is watching as one of them these figures loosened his belt 
and bent down and began working on what Gideon believes to be a panel of some kind 
one of the other beings kept looking around at the interior of the craft and back at him 
and here's where it gets so interesting because Gideon says that he was not only seeing visually into the craft he was getting strong mental or telepathic impressions of what 
the inside looked like you could mentally see that this entity was repairing the windings on 
a strange barrel-shaped mechanism with a white illuminated Dome on top pictured here he didn't 
have the impression that this the light from the inside of the craft was coming from this thing 
and he also had the impression that the cause of the landing itself was to repair this mechanism 
so all very interesting and as Gideon says I waved at them smiled and tried to give 
the impression that I was glad to see them and that they were welcome visitors but they didn't return my friendly gestures one of them stared at me for a few seconds but apart from 
that they took no notice of me so after just a few moments the craft floated upward and away 
Gideon tried to follow it as it floated towards his gate for a distance of about 75 feet 
at this point it stopped the lights inside the craft went out and the craft just disappeared 
quote in a flash it happened so quickly Gideon wasn't sure which direction it went it says it 
was just gone with a puff of air now it turned out he and his son were not the only Witnesses 
later according to Gideon a few of his neighbors approached him and said that they had also seen the object come right down in the direction of his house 
now the power was later restored they can't link the appearance of this craft directly to the power 
value but it certainly looks like it because Gideon learned that there was a strange gray 
white glassy deposit found on three of the power lines and this deposit extended about nine feet 
and there were other strange medical effects on the witness himself as Gideon says after the incident I had terrible prickling pains from the waist downwards 
the pain disappeared after a few hours and there was no redness or obvious irritation of the skin 
but I couldn't go to bed after the incident I just sat at the table making notes I didn't feel 
well all my glands became swollen and sore and so did my testicles had some difficulty 
passing water my body started to swell and when I bent down my face felt as if it was bursting 
my body began to smell like something putrid I lost my appetite and food was tasteless so this 
was severe enough that Gideon did go to the doctor told him what happened the doctor seemed skeptical 
and simply treated him by giving him a sedative these problems did clear up but months after the 
incident Gideon saw that the maple tree which had been damaged by The Craft was not budding like the 
other nearby trees and in fact the tree never recovered it eventually died and was cut down 
now after talking two investigators Gideon did reveal that he had had a few prior sightings 
including seeing a strange craft in 1957 and way back in 1945 he had a very strange experience he 
and his wife witnessed a mysterious reign of weird worms falling out of the sky 
this does happen all across the world weird objects falling out of a clear blue sky in 
this case it was worms and they covered an area of about 300 by 900 feet the neighbors also saw 
it and let out their hens to Feast on the worms but the hens would not touch them and in fact 
other crows and birds dive down to try to eat the worms but they also wouldn't touch them 
now Gideon did have the foresight to collect a few samples and he sent them to a biologist 
who was not able to identify the species so I just thought that was a weird side note 
a follow-up to this case is that Gideon was in fact psychoanalyzed and found to be totally normal 
and according to Swedish researcher Anders littlegren he says this is one of the best reports 
to have come out of Sweden yeah that case does have a lot to say about ETS and how they behave it 
being so close to the witness and he walks right up to this UFO can see right inside it sees the 
humanoids but what I find Most Fascinating is that he had a telepathic link up to them could actually 
not only see physically inside the craft but had very strong mental Impressions or communication of 
what was going on inside as well so that case I think does provide some really interesting 
insights and here's another case which again is not a one-off a number of these do seem to be 
part of a larger complex of events but this next case occurred in Lake movil this is in Minnesota 
it's a really interesting case with multiple witnesses as we shall see it was in early 
August of 1962 when Mildred Anderson her two brothers Dwayne and Roger their parents and 
the family dog zipper were driving about 12 miles past Bagley to their home in Grand Forks 
and without warning their dog's zipper began to growl and looking up the entire family saw 
a green luminous object which seemed to be approaching their car on a parallel course 
other father who was driving Kenneth Anderson slowed down the car and the object was pretty 
close approximately 70 feet or yards away it was very large almost as tall as a two-story 
building they said yellow green and it had this weird foggy Haze surrounding it 
it passed right by their car and then hovered over a bare patch of land moved over to a wooded area 
and made this long curving half circle maneuver off into the distance so it was quite an amazing 
sighting but little did they know this was just a precursor to a much more close-up sighting 
was three weeks later Mildred Anderson and her two children Roger Anderson and Marilyn chenarides 
were visiting their vacation cabin which was located on the shores of Lake movil in Minnesota 
now Roger had gone to bed and Mildred was doing her daughter Marilyn's hair Maryland was the first 
to notice an odd glowing red object hovering over the boat dock which was just 50 feet from 
their cabin and they both stared in amazement as this object was clearly a flying saucer 
and yeah it was very close hovering actually at the near landward side of the boat dock 
the object itself was about eight feet high they estimate and 35 feet wide pretty big 
and the red light coming from it was so bright that it made the green paint on the boat dock 
appear almost brown and the water greenish black now on the side of the saucer they could see three 
large Windows which were all lit up by a yellow light and it was in two of the windows that they 
saw the Silhouettes Of Three humanoid figures two were in the center window and one was on the left 
and as Marilyn says in her own words it appeared from nowhere it appeared to be about eight 
feet tall and two car lengths long and was oval shaped with a smaller oval on top which had three 
triangular windows yellow light was shining from the windows and we could see the silhouette of 
three human-like people they were about the size of ordinary men and appeared to be staring at us 
so both woman Marilyn and Mildred had the impression that the men were directly 
watching them and there was this apparent staring contest which lasted a few minutes 
Mildred became frightened and turned out the cabin lights and immediately the lights in the UFO also 
went out and this is when Mildred acted in a very strange way she had this irresistible impulse to 
approach the object she quickly threw open the cabin door and ran from the cabin to the boat dock 
meanwhile her daughter Marilyn started screaming hysterically for her to come back but when Mildred 
got about halfway to the boat dock the object lifted up very slowly moved off at an angle and 
then shot off into the distance and was gone so that's the lake moviel case very interesting I'm 
not sure how I would react if a UFO came down that low that close to my house but I'd like to think 
I would react as this witness did running out and running up to it perhaps not too close this 
craft can be quite hot and dangerous at times if you get too close but yeah I mean she was close 
enough to see this thing right into the window there's no doubt that this was something unusual 
and this next case I love this case for a number of reasons this one occurred on Reunion Island 
this is part of France and initially this was thought to be a single witness case it turns 
out that following his encounter many other people started seeing the same craft and humanoid as well 
and what I like about this case is this is another example of a type of humanoid people 
are describing all over the world which is most often described as the Michelin Man 
it's called that because it shows a remarkable similarity to the Michelin Man Tire commercials 
so this is a very interesting case with physical evidence as well this case occurred on July 31st 
1968 and the main witness is loose Fontaine at the time he was 31 years old and worked as a farmer 
and he had gone out into the forest to pick some grass for his rabbits to eat 
and I'll just let loose describe in his own words this amazing sighting as loose says 
suddenly I saw a sort of oval shaped cabin in the clearing 
it was 25 meters from me and as though suspended at a height of 4 or 5 meters from the ground 
the extremities of it were dark blue the center part lighter more transparent rather like the 
windscreen of a Peugeot above and below it had what looked like two glass feet of shining metal 
in the center of the cabin were two individuals with their backs towards me 
the one on the left turned right around and so faced me he was standing small about 90 centimeters in height and valve from head to toe 
in a sort of One Piece overall a bit like the suit worn by the Michelin Man 
the one on the right simply turned his head round towards me but all the same I had time to catch a glimpse of his face which was partly masked by a sort of helmet they both 
turned their backs to me and there was a flash as strong as the electric Arc of a welding machine 
everything went white around me a powerful heat was given off and then as it were a 
sort of blast of wind and a few seconds later there was nothing there anymore 
so this really freaked him out I mean he was sweating breathing hard he went and examined 
the spot saw no Landing traces nothing visible but he went home told his family uh police were 
called they examined the site and they actually did find that this area had a higher level of 
radioactivity than surrounding areas Lewis himself was feeling somewhat unwell so they also 
tested him and they found out that his clothes showed abnormally High radioactive readings 
so it's quite a case involving very unusual looking humanoids a very unusual looking craft 
but most amazing is following this numerous people on Reunion Island also started reporting 
the same apparent craft and the same apparent humanoids it's quite an interesting case that 
case did receive quite a bit of publicity it was very well investigated and through even more 
interest because people kept seeing this craft and humanoids it's really remarkable I love how 
these cases are usually not just a one-off though in some cases they do appear to be just a singular 
event such as this next case which really drew the attention of investigators this occurred in 
Manchester New Hampshire and of all the cases in this Bunch this is easily one of the most dramatic 
because this lady was driving very late at night and Came Upon a UFO which essentially chased her 
down the highway this one may in fact involve an onboard experience though she has no memory of 
it but she certainly remembers coming around the corner and seeing this UFO blocking her pathway on 
the road looking through the window of this very strangely described object and seeing a humanoid 
and what's also very interesting about this case is how she reacted when she had this experience 
it was around 3 A.M on November 2nd 1973 when lindia moral age 20 was driving Northwest on 
Mast Road this is Route 114 a and as she drove through the small town of Pinardville she saw a 
bright star-like light and it was weird because it was flashing red green and blue clearly not a star 
so she began watching it as she drove along and as she drove for about a mile she began 
to approach the intersection of route 114a and Route 114 at which point the light winked out 
and this is when she wondered if this could possibly be a UFO it suddenly reappeared 
again but even at this point she wasn't sure and as she says I didn't think anything of it 
so as she drove along this light continued to disappear and reappear now she drove through downtown Goffstown it disappeared this is just a tiny little town 
but then as she drove on down North Mast Road outside of town this object appeared directly 
in front of her on the road as lindia says it was right in front of me and I started to get dizzy 
my whole body kind of numbed and as it came closer I could see that it was honeycombed orange and gold colored and it felt like a magnet was pulling me towards it 
so this craft was very low right over the road she saw an oval window on the upper left portion 
the object itself was flashing red green and blue lights what looked like Rays or 
beams emanating from the center was also making a thin high-pitched wine which seemed to pierce her 
entire being and made her whole body tingle so she began to feel a lot of fear and panic when 
she realized that she was unable to remove her hands from the steering wheel she felt almost 
glued there she says it felt like it was drawing her eyes upward and taking control of her body 
and she found herself beginning to lose awareness in fact she had no memory of driving a short 
Portion by Westlawn Cemetery even though she says she never took her eyes off the object 
she felt like the UFO occupants Were Somehow retrieving and recording her memories 
but coming back to full awareness she realized at this point that she was speeding out of control and it was then that she noticed the figure in the upper left window 
she could only see the head the upper body and arms she guessed that it was standing 
at some kind of control panel behind it she could see a white background but she said 
the being looked gray in color that the face had wrinkles or loose skin kind of like an elephant 
she said she saw two quote large egg-shaped eyes they had dark large dark pupils just she 
saw a thin slit for a mouth doesn't recall seeing any nose or ears so pretty much your typical Gray 
and in her head she received a strong mental impression that it was telling her quote don't 
be afraid and as lindia says in her own words my eyes were forced to it and for a flash it 
seemed like I saw a figure or body in it I really thought it intended me to take away 
now she was later interviewed by researchers and reporters and she admitted that she didn't 
really want to tell reporters about the figure because it sounded so crazy and unbelievable 
but she felt absolutely certain that this UFO was trying to capture her in fact as she's driving along and this thing is in front of her she said the light was so 
bright she had to cover her eyes to see and the noise was so loud she could barely stand it 
this point she was less than one mile from her home but she pulled onto the lawn of a stranger's house it turned out to be Mr and Mrs Beau Doan so she leaps from the car 
and the Bedouins owned a German Shepherd this German Shepherd lunged forward and growled at her 
now normally lindia is afraid of dogs but at this point she was so panicked she belted the dog with 
her hand ran to the door and began pounding on it as lindia says I pounded on the door of the 
house and screamed as the object hovered over the back of the house as soon as the man opened the 
door of the house the feeling of awful buzzing and being drawn left me so she screamed out help 
me help me a UFO is right above me it's trying to get me I'm not drunk I'm not on drugs a UFO 
just tried to pick me up now the Bedouins had been sleeping and when they were woken up they saw that 
it was now 4 30 a.m they didn't believe lindia at first but stepping outside they both saw this UFO 
in fact as Miss beaudolin says in her own words we went out and we really saw that thing 
at first it looked like a ball of fire with a blue haze around it and it kept moving back and forth 
so she quickly went inside grabbed her Polaroid camera and pointed it at the object she was 
about to take a picture when immediately all the lights on the object went out 
so she put the camera down and all the lights came back on she kept trying to take a picture 
and finally did manage to take one but nothing came out they did call the police and an officer 
jubenville responded and according to lindia he didn't believe her at first either until she 
pointed at the object and he shouted out oh my god there it is over the tree line I don't believe it 
now later in interviews with newspaper reporters Officer jubenville Down played deciding a little 
bit and he said I saw what she said she saw it looked like an ordinary star but 
it was an awfully strange star it didn't look like a flying saucer or anything like 
that but it did go out and it moved probably a foot and turned colors red yellow and back 
to Red so that is the Manchester New Hampshire experience and yeah really really interesting 
and what I like about that case is when she saw this UFO in this humanoid and she felt it 
was after her she did what I think most Witnesses should do get another witness drove right up onto 
someone's yard and pounded on their door pulled them outside in time for them to see it too 
and they actually called the police and the police officer side so this is a very well verified case one which I think deservedly got the attention of UFO researchers 
and here's another case that was equally interesting to researchers for a number of reasons 
it's quite well known certainly in the country where it occurred and that was in Medellin Spain 
and this case is super interesting for a number of reasons particularly because there were other 
Witnesses no one else saw the humanoids because only one witness was close enough to see it but 
what I like about this case is he was able to interact with the UFO occupants using the 
headlights of his car it's quite a lengthy case in terms of how long he saw this object 
and like in all these cases he was very very close up to it and yeah just a really interesting case all around this case occurred on June 14 1974 and the main 
witness is a farmer his name is Santiago pulido Romero what's interesting about this sighting is 
it occurred not far from the very famous Medellin Castle in Spain so Santiago is driving in the very 
early morning hours it was still dark and as Santiago says a strong light struck me in the 
eyes I saw a very strange pot-shaped object which was flying at a low altitude 300 feet 
it was traveling at an incredible velocity as fast as I could follow with my eyes I was at one side 
of the castle and as the apparatus was coming towards me an overwhelming fear filled my body 
it occurred to me to turn off the lights of the car and to continue in second gear very slowly 
my body was trembling all over I tell you that you have to see how imposing a thing like that is 
so this object was very brightly lit in fact it was casting light down on the ground like daylight 
this object would Dart zigzag hover Santiago said that the top part of the object was a 
pointed cone about 30 feet high while the bottom was a rounded cylinder transparent and quite large 
about 60 feet wide in many ways it's your classic Flying Saucer and the whole thing was brightly 
illuminated with this intense yellow light so as Santiago said he turned off his headlights 
but the objects began to follow him and it was just about 200 feet off to the right 
so he turned on his headlights again at which point this object zoomed towards him 
he flicked them off and the object darted away scooting way up into the sky until it was a little star-like light and then would start all over the place hover and do all these maneuvers 
so he quickly arrives at his father's Farm his destination at which point the object swooped 
down again stopped and hovered near the gate about 300 feet high bobbing up and down it was 
completely silent now Santiago says in his own words my first intention was to shut myself up 
in the house so I did this then a little braver I went out clutching a pitchfork just in case 
imagine the fear which filled me so much that I even thought about running towards the mountain 
where I knew some very good places to hide so at this point he got a very good close look 
Santiago could clearly see the bottom transparent section of this craft and 
was amazed to see men moving around inside it and again I'll just quote Santiago directly 
I saw clearly three men they were very tall more than two meters who were moving very stiffly as 
though under orders and who had something on their heads like helmets or something similar 
they moved about on foot I tell you it was something to see if I lived to be a thousand I'll 
never forget that experience never never never I swear that it was a terrible thing you and all the 
rest can believe me or not it's all the same to me I know it is true and that's all that matters 
I was always very skeptical about such things I used to think that they were the invention of idlers and dreamers just a lot of nonsense but now I know that there's something to it 
they were beings from other worlds what I saw that apparatus thing is not from 
this world because there can't be anything even similar I never saw the likes of such 
so this did get a lot of publicity researchers interviewed Santiago did some investigating 
and found a number of other Witnesses including a young boy who described the same craft as well as 
two neighbors of Santiago and two traffic police officers in Medellin who also saw this apparently 
the same object darting around in the sky so that is the Medellin Spain case which again came pretty 
famous in that country and I think deserves to be widely known because wow what a case 
now here's another one which occurred in San Antonio Texas and of all the cases in this compilation I think this might be one of the weirdest and it's just 
such an amazing case involving yes only one witness but he did have physiological reactions 
the kind which cannot be faked and he saw this UFO so close I mean this was right in front of his 
car you could see right inside of it you could see the inside of the craft and he saw these humanoids 
which were not your average humanoids that's putting it lightly it was one evening around 9 
pm in 1975 when the main witness Alois J olanik who was 48 years old was driving along magford 
Road near the Bexar Atascosa line when he saw what he first thought was a helicopter hovering 
over a nearby cow pasture he said it was glowing cherry red and was causing a quote terrific wind 
and it was quite low it was hovering only 30 feet above the field and then without warning 
it came right for him his Alouette says when the craft got directly over the top of my pickup 
the lights went completely out and the engine was dead as I was trying to get out of the pickup I 
thought it was a chopper passing on top of me at first then when they hovered over the top 
of me and I got a good look at it I knew it was no Chopper I thought to myself that's got to be a UFO 
so he's looking at it and he could see that this craft had a spherical Center and a saucer 
shape encircling the sphere pretty much your typical Flying Saucer the bottom of the craft 
was highly polished metal and had a cherry red light on the bottom front and it hovered over 
his truck for a good 20 seconds long enough for him to see very two very strange beings inside 
he estimated that they were five feet tall they had strangely tight firm skin he says 
and as Alois says they were bald with long prominent ears and a long nose 
their eyes did not appear very plainly they just looked like slits their skin 
was not like our skin it appeared to me to look sort of like shark skin sort of a gray color 
there is no motor noise during this time that it was over my truck just a whirring shriek of wind 
it was very loud it sounded to me like a cyclone so he stared in wonder he could see right into 
this craft and he saw that there were dash-like panels with t-shaped levers on the front which 
the beings presumably used to maneuver the craft he thought now this UFO was tipped towards him 
at an angle of about 40 degrees which gave him even a better View he said the transparent Dome 
seemed to Glow with reddish light which made the interior of the craft and the beings themselves 
plainly visible you could see nothing on their heads but so that they did seem to be wearing 
some kind of shirt with a texture somewhat akin to leather and as Alois says in his own words 
they appeared to be just as interested in me as I was in them one of the occupants the one farthest 
from me appeared to be the pilot and had his hands on the controls he was looking up and 
away from me the other occupant looked directly at me a side view at my windshield and appeared 
to be observing me I got a good look at both of them they weren't human beings like we see here 
so yeah it was a quick sighting a matter of seconds and without warning this craft abruptly 
Departed and as Alois says it took off straight up there was a terrible thrust that buffeted my 
pickup and then it vanished almost instantly it was just like turning off a light bulb now while 
this craft was in his presence he did notice a strong odor like burning copper or electrical 
wiring this is while the craft was very near his truck but in fact it lingered for days afterwards 
and he discovered something else his eyes were very painful in fact he was partially blinded 
as though he had looked at an arc welder he said without protection in fact it was bad 
enough that he sought medical attention and he had to wear dark sunglasses to protect his eyes in the days that followed but yeah he is absolutely convinced this was a UFO as he says 
it was not from this world it was something but I don't know what I feel like they got a good look 
at me and maybe got my picture or something and then turned off their lights and vanished he said 
that the whole incident left him quote very shaken so that's the San Antonio Texas case and yeah 
as you can see from the description of the main witness not your average gray by any means I'm not 
sure I've heard et's described quite like that but there are a few cases certainly similar to that 
however this next case no I don't think I've heard anyone describe a UFO shaped quite this 
way or for that matter a humanoid quite like this or how it behaved so this next case which occurred 
in Tucson Arizona is a real doozy it involves multiple Witnesses it's quite a long enduring 
sighting as well and yeah the details are just amazing this next case comes from apro the aerial 
phenomena research organization and it occurred on February 10 1977. the main witness is Lois Stovall 
with 7 30 p.m and she was sitting in her living room at her home at 2150 boquita Vista in Tucson 
she saw a fiery glowing object rising up from behind the Lillian Cavett Elementary School which 
was right near her home and it immediately caught her attention because it was just a 
beautiful light and she washed as it curved around the school building and moving at Treetop level 
approached directly to her house hovering at one point only inches above the ground on the 
school lawn across the street this is when Lois called out to her grandmother Alice Buckner and 
they both watched this object rose up came even closer and hovered over their yard and it stayed 
there for a good full two minutes long enough for them both to go outside and walk right up to it 
they approached within 50 feet of this object they now got a clear view of it and saw that 
it was shaped like a vertical capsule cylindrical with blunt round ends both on bottom and the top 
the bottom was emitting a bright flame-like light which was red white and blue the front 
section was transparent and had what looked like vertical bars running from top to bottom 
but it was what was behind those bars that really startled the most was a humanoid figure 
and in fact Alice shouted out there's a man in there she said this figure was gray in color was 
wearing something it looked like a puffed up suit with rings or ridges around the arms and 
legs reminded them very much of a spacesuit this figure looked as though it was slightly crouched 
and appeared to be holding onto controls perhaps of some kind though they really couldn't see any 
but they did feel that this figure was very short about the size they estimate of a six-year-old child and it almost completely filled the cabin space this was quite small 
so Alice approached and walked right under this craft and it was only two feet over her head 
she actually wanted to reach out and touch it but it was just Out Of Reach but she could see at this point that there was a sort of glass covering over this opening and the 
Bars were in front of it and as she tried to touch it it rose up and now it's could 
now see a face plate on this figure and the glimmerings of what she believed was a face 
so they both watched this object departed passing over the carport over the roof of the house and 
passed just over the telephone lines behind their house and began to climb up into the sky they 
watched it move slowly away and up until it became a glittering star-like object high in the sky 
and also it's very interesting is that both Lois and Alice said that three helicopters were 
in the area and were actually crisscrossing the school property as if searching for the object but they did not appear to see it hovering over their yard in fact as this object scooted up 
into the sky and moved away they saw three other helicopters a total of six helicopters 
so after this all occurred they did call the police who's denied having any helicopters in 
the area and so that they actually only have three helicopters none were out that night and they said 
that they had never even flown three helicopters at once so meanwhile well uh Alice and Lois were 
watching them this object their neighbor at 2202 East boquita Vista was brushing her teeth 
and she saw the object move over the driveway she described the same object and said it was 
about six feet six inches tall and maybe about two feet six inches wide and she also saw a 
figure behind the glass she saw Alice and Lois watch the object she also confirmed the presence 
of helicopters and she called a TV station but they showed no interest in the sighting 
now investigators did interview all the witnesses and the investigators contacted Davis-Monthan Air 
Force Base which was only three miles away Davis-Monthan denied any knowledge of this 
incident so they had no helicopters out the investigators also contacted nearby Tucson 
Airport who also denied any knowledge and so that they saw nothing so pretty amazing sighting 
and it's somewhat corroborated because 11 days later numerous residents described another UFO 
seen here which flew around Tucson at Treetop level solo Witnesses thought it might actually 
strike the electric lines so that's the Tucson case which again I like for a number of reasons 
multiple Witnesses very much intrigued by the fact that they all the witnesses talked 
about the helicopter activity going on during the sighting with these six helicopters crisscrossing 
the area clearly searching for this UFO and occupant though weren't able to see it even 
though they were quite close that makes me wonder are the et's able to Shield themselves from view 
from whoever they don't want to see them and show themselves to who they do want to see them 
so it looks like that's what's happening in this case but what I also like about this case is that the witness was able to get within two feet of the object that is so unusual a really strange case 
now this next case got an enormous amount of publicity you may have heard of it before it 
occurred in Dorset England it was again your typical case of a UFO dropping down right over 
a person's home over her backyard in this case and yes this is a single witness case but she saw 
it so close up she's such a clearly sincere honest Witness and she didn't have a parent physiological 
effects as well it's a truly interesting case it was around 11 p.m in September of 1977 when 
Ethel Mayfield aged 62 stepped out of her home on Seaview Road this was at parkstone pool in Dorset 
and inside her home her husband Maurice and daughter Teresa were watching TV Ethel 
had stepped out to bring the clothes in off the clothesline and this is when she heard a humming 
noise and looking up saw a round object with a dome on top approaching her was gray in color 
she said but brilliantly lit with blue blue yellow beams of light coming downward from the perimeter 
she estimates that it was about 22 feet wide as it covered her entire backyard and it was so low 
because she could easily see windows and Through the Windows to occupants in fact the object was 
so bright she held her hands out Palm outwards to Shield herself from the light she could actually 
feel heat on her hands and the ground itself actually seemed to tremble as this object arrived 
again I'll just let Ethel describe it in her own words it's always great to hear what the witness says and as she says there was a vibration in the ground I thought it was an earthquake I also heard 
a humming noise I looked to my left from where it was coming and I saw this large disc shaped 
object flying towards me the object was as big as a bus it seemed to be swooping upwards across the 
gardens as if it had come out of the sea which is in that direction it was very bright and 
shiny and looked to be made of metal it came close and hovered just a short distance away 
tilted slightly downwards I could see there was a dome on top around which looked to be Windows 
of some kind inside were two figures one at a control panel and the other pointing at me she 
said the two occupants looked normal in size but were wearing silver suits which covered everything 
except their faces she wasn't sure but they both seemed to be male had very slender facial features 
the figure on the right was operating she said what looked like a control panel but the other was staring directly at her and making sort of a Down pointing gesture at her which she 
interpretated interpreted as an intention to come in for a landing and as Ethel says the light from 
the Dome was terribly bright I held up my hands to Shield my eyes and watched from between my fingers 
I saw one of the occupants pointing down and I thought for a horrible moment was going to land 
so now alarmed she retreated to the doorway and turned around just in time to watch this object 
speed away and she estimates that the entire sighting lasted only about 20 to 30 seconds 
she immediately told her husband and daughter who did not believe her and actually laughed at her 
Ethel was not happy about that and she said she was going to call the newspapers and at 
this point her family convinced her not to as they said people would ridicule her 
but Ethel was determined to tell someone and later she did contact UFO researchers 
and here was an interesting sort of detail because in the week following her experience she said that 
the palms of her hands became raw and painful to the point where the skin actually peeled 
she wasn't sure if this was directly linked or connected to her UFO encounter 
but researchers felt that it was entirely possible given that she did feel Heat 
had put her hands up Palms facing this object and that there are many other cases where this sort 
of physiological effect has occurred that's the Dorset England England case with Ethel May field 
and I like that case because it typifies this category she saw this rifle so close was right over her backyard it was a fairly brief case yes but long 
enough for her to good get a good look at these humanoids who looked human these were what we 
would probably call the human like E.T sometimes called nordics I don't really like that term it's 
not entirely accurate but in her case it was yeah these were blonde-haired beings apparently 
um absolutely human looking and I think clearly showing themselves off on purpose 
it's a really unusual case now this next case is actually a cluster of sightings and I love this 
case for reasons I will tell you right now this occurred in San Fernando Valley in California 
over a pretty sharply defined area this includes Woodland Hills Canoga Park Chatsworth and Reseda 
what I like about this is I actually lived in this area for many years decades my brother and 
sister-in-law lived in Woodland Hills I lived in a condo in Canoga Park and in a tiny little home 
in Reseda so all the locations that are mentioned in this particular cluster of sightings I know all 
of them every intersection all of the streets so I'm quite familiar with this area in fact I was 
living just a few miles away I was a little kid at the time so I didn't see any of this activity 
boy if I had my life might have been quite different but again this involves a series 
of sightings of flap of UFO activity over a period of a week or two which was quite intense 
involving 10 or so events with some 30 Witnesses and one involving an apparent onboard experience 
and missing time but one involving an absolute sighting of humanoids seen through the window of 
a UFO was in July through August of 1979 that an amazing series of sightings and encounters 
occurred over the space of about a week and was really only a few miles wide with at least as I 
said 28 Witnesses I'm just going to Breeze through these pretty quickly because there's quite a few 
on July 21st Sandra p and her four young children saw a white glowing sphere move over their home 
in Simi Valley this was a little bit farther to the north as most of these sightings but 
later in the evening Sandra saw it again and it now blinked white red green and blue lights 
and this was the beginning of an amazing series of sightings July 25th was really the big night 
it was at 2 A.M that morning when four teenagers said that they saw a low-flying glowing object 
pass low over the intersection of Shoop and Vanowen they lit up the whole area and was so 
low they could hear a soft whirring noise it was about an hour and 15 minutes later when Mickey 
Childers was woken up in her home which was at the intersection of Valley Circle Boulevard and 
Highlander Road this is very near Chatsworth Reservoir and she was woken up by the sound 
of barking dogs and living on the second story she looked out to sea if there were any Prowlers 
and she saw this object hovering near the intersection of Platt and Saticoy so she woke 
up her son Dean who was a college student very interested in astronomy and together they observed 
the object through a telescope and they could see that it was surrounded by sparkling white lights 
that actually watched for about 25 minutes as it moved silently upwards turning green red and then 
blue the next morning they did call the police but forgot about it until there was a lot of publicity 
of this sighting in the newspaper and that's when they recalled it and contacted investigators 
so Walt greenewald investigated these cases and he started uncovering a number of other Witnesses 
one of them was Sherry n a cocktail waitress it was on the same night around the same time 3 15 
a.m Sherry was driving through Chatsworth and this is only a few miles from where Mickey Childers and 
her son Dean saw the UFO and she saw this bright light coming down from above she was actually 
stopped at a red light on Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Plummer Street when the object swooped down 
towards her so she freaked out she actually ran the red light and raced home and when she 
got home she realized that she couldn't account for a half hour of time so she had missing time 
and the next morning she said she had pretty severe nausea and strange blisters on her legs 
and the sightings were continuing on this day morning arrived it was around 7 15 A.M 
when Ira Pearson and three friends saw what's apparently the same object from the intersection 
of Oso and Saticoy it was metallic a cylinder shape six feet wide 12 feet long and hovered 
in a diagonal position for five minutes before darting away but while they were watching it 
they actually saw police car stop two officers exited and watched the object through binoculars 
so that night again still July 25th 11 pm the hetman family saw weird lights which they 
estimated were hovering over the intersection of Fallbrook and Dolorosa in Woodland Hills 
I know all these intersections this is so interesting to me and it was about one week later 
there was another wave of sightings pretty much all on August 3rd and 4th on August 3rd at around 
12 10 a.m a couple by the name of Angelo and Nelly mortiaro were in their home in Reseda this is near 
the intersection of victory in Tampa and they saw a saucer-shaped object move over Hamlin Street and 
Victory Boulevard they said it was covered with white blinking lights and was totally silent 
later that evening actually at 9 15 A.M Miss Evelyn Palmer was driving near Corbin and 
Nordhoff passing the intersections of Roscoe and Lanark as well and as she drove home she 
saw this object she got her binoculars when she reached home and saw it was a silver saucer which 
she estimates was about 200 feet in diameter she watched it for 10 minutes before it darted off 
now Walt greenewald was triangulating all these sightings in the descriptions 
and based on her testimony the testimony of others he thinks she overestimated its size and was 
probably closer to 80 feet but she also called the local news who said that they had received 
several calls about it so these are not all the witnesses by any means and it was around the same 
time that I'll Mrs peacock observed apparently the same object from Runnymede and Ria in Canoga Park 
and she also confirmed the description and said it had 20 blinking lights on the bottom she watched 
it for about five minutes now she's just one mile west of Miss Evelyn Palmer so August 4th 8 30 A.M 
this is the next day a gentleman by the name of George observed apparently the same UFO hovering 
over Canoga Park and here's the really interesting sighting involving humanoids 
because it was that evening again August 4th around 10 35 PM when Maria artura was 60 years 
old and her grandson were in Canoga Park and they saw this UFO come swooping down towards them from 
the Topanga Canyon area and it hovered just above the apartment building across the street they 
said it was a classic saucer with blinking yellow lights and a transparent Dome on top and looking 
through the Dome she could see the silhouette of two humanoid figures looking down at her 
she said they look totally human except they had very large oversized heads the craft tilted 
to one side then the other became horizontal and then flew off to the West now she started talking 
about this and learned that four of her neighbors also reported apparently seeing the same object 
and it was some 20 days later when there was still another sighting a Mr anapol was 
at Sherman away and Royer Street and he says he observed a pink purple disc at low altitude 
so again researcher Walt Greenwald investigated all these cases and he said it was a very unusual 
and intense wave of sightings and he later contacted the cocktail waitress Sherry who 
had had a missing under missing time and arranged for her to go under hypnosis which she did and 
she recalled being taken inside a craft laid out on a metal table an examined by a creature which 
couldn't see very well other than she said it had a small head no nose or mouth and she's pretty 
sure she felt three fingers on each of its hands as it examined her so certainly a very interesting 
cluster of sightings and a good reminder that one person citing is another person's 
Direct encounter with humanoids perhaps even an onboard experience so that is the San Fernando 
case whole wave of sightings really interesting series of events now with so many witnesses and 
so many separate sightings there's no doubt something very unusual was happening there 
but of all the cases in this compilation I have to say this next one really caught my attention 
it's a bit of an outlier the witness in this case has insisted upon absolute anonymity does 
not want her exact location to be revealed but this did occur on the outskirts of Mobile Alabama 
and what I like about this case is its unusual aspects this was a very unusual UFO it's 
absolutely humongous and where in most of these cases people see one two or maybe three humanoids 
in this case the witness saw quite a bit more than that we're talking about a crowd of humanoids 20 
or 30 or more that alone makes this case really unusual and there's other unusual aspects to it 
as we shall see this case occurred on February 3rd in 1983 and again the witness is anonymous but is 
referred to as Pat and this was in Mobile Alabama she doesn't want to say exactly where but she had 
left Highway 90 and was heading towards her home in Mobile when she heard a strange explosion 
at which point her car began to vibrate in a very strange way in fact it was enough that 
she pulled over stopped leaned out the window to check the car but noticed nothing wrong 
and as she continued to drive she noticed that the woods ahead of her were all lit up 
and she became concerned she thought that there was some sort of helicopter search so she stopped the car and looked up and saw this enormous object about a half mile to the West 
and it was huge this object was seven to eight stories high maybe 80 feet more than 200 feet wide 
she could now hear a high-pitched sound and saw that the wind was whipping the trees around 
and the object moved closer as it came up to her all sound stopped and Pat who had been 
quite frightened now felt no fear at all in fact she got out of the car and viewed this object 
and she said she felt like a child with quote unbelievable happiness so she was entranced and 
she looked up the top deck where she saw long Windows One Long window more than 50 feet long 
she was amazed at what she saw there were about 30 people more or less walking around as if changing 
shifts now they showed no signs of noticing her did not look down at her but she said that they 
were very pale all of them were dressed in white one-piece suits they were of normal height about 
5 10 thin but had very large chests looked strong that prominent foreheads and no hair 
she also noticed something else they seemed to move with this incredible Grace 
so she's looking at this craft she could see inside of it she said it looked very sterile white with curved walls said there was a big opening of a window in front of it 
it was or a door of some kind but below the top deck she saw another window that looked opaque 
or tinted she saw below the craft on the street what looked like strange tubular or rectangular 
equipment strange i-beams and she said the craft in some ways reminded her of a submarine 
and she thought it might have been constructed on Earth so she's not entirely convinced this 
was ETS at this point but the very bottom deck did appear to be an observation deck and she saw 
more beings there and these were peering down at her this craft had white spotlights and on 
the side blue and red lights that sent beams of light both up into the sky and down into 
the ground and in fact the light from the craft was bright enough to illuminate the ground below 
so in interviews with researchers they learned something really interesting she admitted to 
dreaming about UFOs not only after but before this incident and these dreams included her going on 
board a craft being not only physically examined but emotionally examined she's still unsure you 
know whether this was genuinely ETS or not uh but yeah it was an experience that affected her so 
profoundly she insisted on absolute anonymity so that's the Mobile Alabama case yeah super strange 
I find it very intriguing that she thought perhaps that this was reverse engineered 
human craft which is certainly a possibility we know that this does happen we can't rule it out 
I'm leaning towards this being extraterrestrial because she said that before this encounter and 
after she was having dreams of being on board UFOs being physically examined emotionally examined I 
don't know it's hard to say because there are some aspects to the way she described this UFO they make it sound like it might be a reverse engineered craft I'll let you make up your own 
mind about it but it's certainly something to be aware of when investigating these UFO cases 
we do have some of this technology and it has been reverse engineered to a certain extent 
now moving on to the last and final case which I love because it's quite recent it 
involves multiple Witnesses they were able to observe this object through binoculars for quite a long period of time and that I think makes this case super interesting 
this one occurred in Westerville Ohio this final case occurred in October 2003 again in 
Westerville Ohio this was reported to new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center and I'll just 
quote the witness directly because he explained his sighting very lucidly as the witness says 
my wife and I were sitting on our screened porch at our home in Westerville Ohio which faces East 
at around 6 pm on an October evening we saw a large bright stationary object in the Southeast 
sky I tended to ignore it for a while I thought that perhaps it was a communication satellite 
but I went into the house and I got my 7 by 50 field glasses to help identify the object 
and it was no helicopter commercial or military aircraft and certainly not one of those blints 
that occasionally make its way down to the Ohio State University to cover a football game 
as far as I could tell it didn't move there is no noise coming from it this object was perhaps 50 to 
60 feet in diameter the Setting Sun was reflecting off the object and made it somewhat difficult 
to see but as far as I could tell there were no external lights there were five large rectangular 
windows that took up much of the space of this object and there was a yellow glow in the interior 
I saw a person dressed in a light-colored single piece suit from the neck down 
the person had a head two arms and a body he appeared to move only once and only slightly 
stood next to what appeared to be a file cabinet or stood as tall as his shoulder there was some 
Mass around these windows but nothing that would constitute the body of some aircraft 
the next evening my wife and I saw the same object I called a local television station to 
report what I had seen and if anybody had any idea what it was the lady gave me some answer 
and that was the last that I heard of this object as far as I know nothing was reported 
on any television news broadcast or printed in The Columbus Dispatch surely others in the area 
must have seen this object I know what I saw but I have no idea what I saw there you go another Super 
fascinating case I think there probably are more witnesses to it as the original witness describes 
but again most people don't step forward and talk about this most people don't know about 
organizations like mufon the mutual UFO Network or new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center 
and even if you call the police the police don't usually take these accounts seriously either 
so these 14 cases are definitely just the tip of the iceberg I know of many other cases and 
I would have included them here but we'd be here all day but yeah what I like about 
these cases is I think they have something important to say about the UFO phenomena 
the ET agenda and how UFO occupants behave on this planet I think one thing it shows is that this is 
an ongoing phenomena I mean here these cases reach back to the 1950s all the way up to the 2000s 
I also think it's important to note that these cases are coming from all over the world 
I'm very much intrigued by the vast differences we see in a lot of the shapes of these craft 
and also even more interestingly the different types of humanoids we see and yet they're all 
humanoid that I think is very significant and perhaps the most important takeaway from all this 
because what we are seeing are people people very much like us 
we have quite a bit of variation in our own people here on Earth I think we're seeing that with these 
et's and this speaks to the message that so many contacties get directly from the 
ETS which is we are you you are us we are all one perhaps we really shouldn't even be 
calling them aliens because let's face it to anyone else on any other planet we're aliens 
when really we are all just people so I think that's the real takeaway from cases like these 
but yeah the other really interesting aspect I find is that these are such low level sightings 
are so in your face so clearly wanting to be seen I think this speaks towards the 
ET agenda of them wanting to announce their presence and let people know that they are here 
to quote Ancient Aliens we are not alone we have never been alone and the ETS are doing their part 
towards disclosure it's already happened they've showed themselves if you don't think disclosure 
has happened all you have to do is take a look at the vast database of cases like these we know 
UFOs are real the evidence is there for those who have the courage to objectively examine it 
so that's why I wanted to do this episode today I hope you've enjoyed it and found it interesting and perhaps learned something I really want to thank you once again for 
watching I truly appreciate it and until next time signing off with keep asking 
questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun until next time
