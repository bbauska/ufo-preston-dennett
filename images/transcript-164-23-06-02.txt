EXTRAORDINARY EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS: TEN TRUE CASES OF LANDINGS AND HUMANOIDS
Jun 2, 2023

Summary:
Jun 2, 2023
All types of UFO encounters are important and add to our knowledge of this very complex subject. Among the most extraordinary are cases of UFO landings and face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials. Sightings don’t contain very much data, and the onboard UFO experience often has the issues of missing time, hypnotically-recalled memories, not to mention the fear and trauma that often comes with it. Cases involving landings and humanoids, however, belong to a unique category of encounters that allows witnesses to experience the phenomenon directly and without the issues of missing time.

Here are ten extraordinary cases of alien meetings from across the planet. They reach back into the 1950s and continue up to the 1980s. Most involve multiple witnesses. Many involve compelling physical evidence such as animal reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and even landing traces. Most remarkable is the huge variety of humanoids seen, short and tall, skinny and wide, with variations in appearance, clothing and the craft they fly. Each case also contains unique elements in the way the ETs behave. Together they have much to tell us about the nature and origin of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial agenda on our planet.

MICHELIN MAN ETS. May 14, 1955, Monsieur Droguet, a professor at the College for Girls in Dinan, France was entering his home when he was struck by a beam of light. Looking up, he saw a saucer-shaped object and right below it, two strange humanoids, both dressed in uniforms like the Michelin Man seen on TV. One walked up to the college and peered in one of the windows.

SWIMMING ETS. Aug 1, 1962, three sailors in two boats were in the Mediterranean Sea and saw what they thought was a foreign submarine. Then, nearly a dozen figures in weird wetsuits emerged and climbed onto the “sub.” Moments later it rose from the sea to reveal itself to be a flying saucer.

CAR-JACKING EXTRATERRESTRIAL. Nov 2, 1967, Guy Tossie and Will Begay drove on Highway 26 at Ririe, ID when a saucer dropped down in front of them blocking their way. Inside they saw two strange humanoids. One floated to the car, opened the door and got in the driver’s seat, steering the car into a field. One of the men ran away in fear while the other stayed in the car with the ET.

THEY LOOKED LIKE SAINTS. Jan 1968, a family in Lagoa Negra, Brazil was confronted by a landed saucer on their property. Two tall human-looking figures exited the craft, followed by shorter figures. The short ETs stayed by the craft while the tall ones approached the household, close enough for the witnesses to see them clearly. To their shock, the ETs looked like saints.

THE MILAKOVIC FAMILY ENCOUNTER. Nov 20, 1968, Milin Milokovac, his wife Doris, and their young son went house-hunting in Hanbury, England. Instead, they were amazed to see a huge craft rise up from a field and move over their car. Even more extraordinary, looking through the transparent canopy of the craft, they saw several human-looking figures.

TEN-FOOT-TALL HUMANOIDS. On Apr 14, 1971, Dennis Donaldson and Marion Lang were driving through Callery, PA and saw a bright light pacing their car. As it darted around, it came very low and close, revealing itself to be a metallic craft. The couple pulled over to get a closer-look and were awed to see windows in the craft and two 10-foot-tall humanoids.

ETS IN THE FRONT YARD. Jun 9, 1971, Esther Clappison stepped out of her home in Rosedale, Alberta, Canada and saw a weird craft landed only 200 from her home. It had a huge picture window through which she could see two strangely dressed figures. Outside the craft, another figure was picked up stones.

MINIATURE UFO AND HUMANOIDS. Jun 19, 1979, Allan and Maila of Rauma, Finland saw a tiny saucer-shaped object landed next to their home. Maila went outside and walked up to the craft. Inside, she saw two tiny humanoids busy with a control console. As she reached out to tap on the craft, the humanoids both turned to look at her.

THE RUNNING ALIENS. Jul 25, 1979, Federico Ibanez went to pick grapes from his vineyard in Turis, Spain and drove up to a landed UFO. Staring in shock, he saw two oddly-dressed humanoids running at high speed from behind a tree and into the craft.
 
IT FOLLOWED US HOME. Dec 29, 1981, two boys from Onsted, MI were playing in their backyard when a UFO hovered overhead. Then a humanoid came floating toward them. They ran away in fear, only to find that the humanoid followed them. It was to be an encounter that would affect them profoundly for a long time afterwards.

As extraordinary and bizarre as these cases may appear, they are all true, fully investigated and often supported by multiple witnesses and physical evidence. Although each case is different, they also share remarkable commonalities which lend an additional level of corroboration. Mostly they show how truly extraordinary the UFO phenomenon is.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I call this one extraordinary extraterrestrial encounters 10 true cases of Landings and humanoids 
so this is a really interesting subject for me and I hope for you what I like about these cases is 
these are not simple sightings which are often quite distance and prone to misinterpretations 
and nor are these onboard UFO encounters which often have a lot of fear and missing time and 
controversy surrounding them now these aren't Landings and humanoids in most cases Landings 
or so low to the ground I think we can consider it the landing and I wanted to present these 
cases because they come from all over the world they show how truly Global this phenomena is and 
these cases occurred in Canada all across the United States South America all through Europe 
as well so quite a widely spread geographic area and also important I think is these cases 
have occurred over quite a period of time so I've got cases from the 50s the 60s 70s and 80s 
and what's most amazing to me and this is why I titled it extraordinary that there is a huge 
variety of ET types seen here these are not just Grays these are all different types of 
ETS some that I think might be categorized is absolutely unique so we're talking really 
tiny humanoids from maybe two feet tall to ones much taller upwards of 10 feet 
so yeah many many different types of humanoids another thing that's really cool about all 
these cases is the amount of supporting evidence most of these cases involve multiple Witnesses 
most of these cases involve face-to-face meetings with ETS so we're talking a few feet away in some 
cases a couple of hundred feet at the most so very very close up which pretty much removes 
all chances of misperception another thing that's really amazing about these cases is that a good 
number of them have a lot of physical evidence and it runs the entire gamut so we're looking at 
Landing traces animal reactions uh physiological effects electromagnetic disturbances and more 
most of these have been fully investigated as well by Leading researchers these are people who were 
so much affected by their encounters they called the police I mean it affected them for probably 
the rest of their lives but certainly for days and weeks and months afterwards so what I'd like to 
do today is just take you on a little Journey Through Time and across the planet presenting 
these amazing encounters which I'm guessing you've not heard before a lot of these are not very well 
known there's a few you may have heard of I kind of doubt it honestly I was certainly surprised to 
hear some of these cases because I really had no idea and I think you will find them interesting 
I certainly hope so so let's get started because there's a lot in the first case I'd like to talk 
about I call the Michelin Man ETS I love this case because this is a type of ET that has been 
seen in widespread locations across our planet this one took place in France but other people 
across the world have reported seeing et's of this same description it's really an interesting case
this case took place on May 14 1955 in Dino France this is nakote Du Nord area 
and the main witness is Monsieur droge he is a professor at the college for girls in Dino 
France I couldn't find the exact location but we've got it pinned down pretty close 
and what I'd like to do is just quote the witness directly this is translated from French so it's a 
little awkward in some of the wording but yeah it's so interesting to hear from him directly 
so as the main witness says I was returning from the movies at the time when I opened the metal 
Wicket of the yard this one did a little noise I then received directly on the face a kind of 
blue green ray dazzling I was afraid my knees started to shake and I do believe that my hair 
raised after a few seconds I was accustomed to this light and I distinguished an enormous 
object absolutely motionless it did not make any noise but I felt like kind of continuous vibration 
two beings who did not seem to pay attention to me at all evolved at its side they were dressed 
in a diving suit which evoked the Michelin Man with a very bulky helmet the hull of a 
metallic gray color on the belly They Carried a black box from which many wires came out 
one of them was leaning on the ground and seemed to pick up stones the other inspected places he 
approached a window and looked at the old heating Boiler Room I wanted to run away but I was nailed 
on the ground like paralyzed from Fear perhaps I was however only within two meters of the Wicket 
and since I was there I had the impression to be observed from the craft by another character who 
had directed the projector on me he's talking about the light beam and he continues I cannot 
say how long I remain there forcibly observing the maneuvers of the two beings in diving suits 
a quarter of an hour perhaps but it seemed very long to me finally the two beings returned to 
the apparatus under the ladder which stationed within approximately 1.5 meters of the ground 
I distinguished like a black hole from where hung a kind of metal scale with a few bars when they 
went up I clearly heard a metallic noise which seemed to come from the contact of their souls 
and the scale and they returned inside the land ladder went up I felt a kind of suction then a 
drought of air like a suction the apparatus still lit rose up I managed to note that it was circular 
and that it seemed to rotate in the center was the black hole I had noticed which seemed Motionless 
when the machine was higher than the trees all lights died out and I saw nothing anymore 
so this really did quite frighten him became pretty well known at the time where it occurred 
and the witness said that it was actually the greatest fright he had ever had in his life 
he had not believed in UFOs prior to this he did share his account with the headmistress of 
the college for girls who told him to keep quiet lest there should be a scandal which he did for a 
while though eventually did tell investigators which is how we found out about it yeah I love 
that case I mean this is a college professor he's well educated he'd not really thought about UFOs 
you can tell it affected him profoundly they tried to cover this up of course it did come 
out it's just a really interesting case and I think equally interesting is this next case 
which I call the swimming ETS this took place on the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of France and 
I wanted to present this one just because it's so darn unique it also involves multiple Witnesses 
and I don't think I've ever heard a case quite like this and it's got some very interesting 
details this is another case which I'd like to quote the witnesses extensively this occurred 
on August 1st 1962. and this was at the Port du Brusque in southeast France well actually 
off the coast in the Mediterranean Sea which if you know that area it's really quite large 
and there's a number of cases that come from there this is just one of them and again I 
will quote the main witness directly this was in the evening and as he says there were three of 
us out in two boats I was alone in my boat and my two companions weren't theirs it was a very fine 
night with a Starry Sky a slight wind and the Sea quite calm Suddenly at about 300 meters from me 
I saw a large metallic body elongated in shape with this sort of Chimney or turret in the middle 
it seemed to be moving along slowly on the surface of the sea then it finally stopped 
so at this point he shouted out to his friends look a submarine has surfaced over there quite close to us it doesn't seem to worry them 
and one of his friends said it must be a foreign sub it's a model that I don't know 
so allow the witness to describe what happened next he's anonymous none of them want their 
name used but as the main witness says then there was a disturbance and waves around the submarine 
and I was able to make out some frogmen coming out of the sea and climbing up onto the craft 
we shouted to them but at first they didn't even turn around to look at us my two companions who 
had also seen them and had heard me hailing them also called out to them with their loudspeaker 
so when the witness says frog man he doesn't mean a man that looks like a frog he means a diver this is another term for divers so at any rate his companions shouted out over the loudspeaker 
hi there mates snotty today eh are you from here foreigners maybe but anyway give us an answer 
now these strange figures did not answer and as the main witness says I had a good view of them 
I counted about a dozen getting up onto the submarine then three or four of them did look 
around and hesitated for a few instance before Vanishing into the ship finally before rejoining 
the rest the last man turned towards us and raised his right arm above his head and waved it for a 
few instance in greeting to say he had seen us and then he disappeared into the craft like the rest 
now at this point the craft rose upward hovering just above the waves only a few feet 
this point they saw colored lights red and green come on and a beam of white light Shone 
down on the ocean and moved towards the witnesses and struck them in their boat 
this was very momentary the beam then went out and this craft began to glow orange 
the red and green lights are on the perimeter of the craft went out and they could see that this craft began to rotate and they could now make it out they could see clearly that this was sort of 
your classic saucer shape and I'll quote the main witness again as he says it hung there stationary 
for a few minutes then it began to rotate faster its light grew brighter and suddenly it shot off 
horizontally at high speed over the sea its light now took on the color of a red flame 
flattened out and came back right round over us in a beautiful curve while climbing all 
the while and increasing speed and then it vanished as a tiny red dot Among the Stars 
within just a few moments while we watched it it had become totally invisible to sight 
we remained there quite a while flabbergasted straining our eyes at the spot in the sky where 
that fantastic machine had disappeared we have never talked to anybody about that fantastic 
and mysterious encounter out at Sea and we have kept silent about it right up until now 
yeah these Witnesses only agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity I think there are 
some very special things about that case which does again have multiple Witnesses again this 
is a Uso so I don't know how many cases there are of people seeing ETS actually swimming uh but it 
does turn up I know in a few cases this is one I haven't heard before and I think what struck 
me most about that case is that as this UFO left one of the ETS actually waved at the witnesses 
waving goodbye I think this show is a very sort of human aspect to these et's and illustrates 
something that I think is really important that these guys are not that different from us it's 
a really cool case and the next one I'd like to talk about I call the car jacking extraterrestrial 
I'm just gonna say it this is the weirdest one I've heard in a very long time it's probably the 
most unusual in this presentation and for that reason probably my favorite does have multiple 
Witnesses a surprising amount of confirmation it was investigated it was reported to the police 
and boy is it bizarre so I will just move forward with this one because it is beyond weird 
this very bizarre case took place on November 2nd 1967 in Riri Idaho 
there are two main Witnesses they're both young men of Native American ancestry around age 21 23 
one of the witnesses is Guy tossi and the other guy is will be gay and they were driving South 
on Highway 26 just outside of Riri pictured here on November 2nd it was around 9 30 P.M 
they were driving a 1956 Buick Sedan when they saw a sudden flash of light 
now they first thought it was lightning but as their car rolled to a stop by itself they now 
saw that there was in fact a small domed craft hovering in front of them right on the road just 
five feet over the road it had flashing green and orange lights around the rim the perimeter 
and these lights were quite bright they illuminated the whole Road area but on top 
of this craft was a transparent Dome and inside this Dome they could see two quite small figures 
as they watched this Dome swung open kind of like it was on a hinge and one of the figures floated 
up and down out of this craft and approached their car and it was short now that it's next to their 
car they could see that this figure was really only about three feet tall and according to the 
witnesses she looked quite unusual his face had deep scars on his skin he had large pointed ears 
round eyes no apparent nose and a slit for a mouth so in many ways reminiscent of the ETS we hear 
and here's where it just gets so strange this being opened the driver's door the left door to 
the car this freaked the witnesses out guy and well and they quickly slid to the right as this 
being actually climbed into their vehicle now the lights the headlights were still on the car engine 
was still running and this car seemed to move of its own accord about 75 feet off the road and into 
the stubble of a wheat field and this UFO that was in front of them followed right along as if 
it was attached to the car in some way but yeah 75 feet out into the middle of this field the car 
stops and at this point one of the witnesses guy jumps out of the car and flees back to the highway 
and he believed the second entity came out of the UFO and chased him 
the first witness didn't see this he was still in the car and so is this other humanoid who began to 
make this sort of high quick chirping and warbling sound which she says was kind of like a woman or 
maybe it sounded like a bird but it frightened him so bad he says he nearly passed out and as he's 
you know hearing this and watching this figure do this this second occupant returns to the car 
and both figures then well one exits the car and both figures then float back into the UFO 
which glows brightly and starts to zigzag upwards while making a whirring sound and it left 
now meanwhile the other witness guy ran about one-fifth of a mile to the home of Willard 
Hammond who you can see here and they along I mean he explained to uh Willard Hammond what happened 
Willard had a hard time understanding him because poor guy was just so emotionally distraught but 
after he got the idea guy Willard and Willard's son returned to the scene and they found the car 
still in the field with Will sitting in the front seat trembling shaking and his eyes tightly closed 
so they gathered their wits about him drove back into reary and reported the incident to 
Corporal Tom Harper of the Idaho State Police and this is when they contacted UFO researchers 
and an investigation revealed some very interesting corroborating information 
it turned out there was a lady in the area Mrs man who had cattle and she said her cattle broke 
through their gate and ran for two miles as if extremely frightened by something 
that's definitely you know peripheral circumstantial evidence we can't link it directly to this encounter but it's certainly curious and also interesting and 
probably even better confirmation was another witness Elaine Quinn who lived six miles east 
of Rari in the Snake River Valley and she said she saw an orange glowing object zigzagging in 
the sky at pretty much the same time of the incident so that is good confirmation 
and here's where it just gets crazy because later that evening only two hours later at 11 30 pm 
another witness was driving along State Highway 48 between Riri and Rigby this is very close to 
where the first incident happened when a UFO dropped down in the road in front of him and 
stopped his truck he said a short figure exited the craft and approached his car and actually 
tapped on the side window and scratched the windshield as if trying to get inside 
now this whole incident was investigated by Mr CR Rex he was a researcher for the national 
investigative committee on aerial phenomena nightcap he interviewed all the witnesses and 
he came away convinced as he says they are simple honest men and incapable of a perfectly executed 
hoax so yeah what a weird case and it just gets weirder because it was later about one month later 
and this was on the night of December 8 1967. when Marilyn Wilding age 15 of Idaho Falls 
which was not too far away she went out on the porch of her house and noticed a reflection of 
light on the snow on the ground in front of her house and looking up she could see this bright blazing light over her house so she walked out into the yard to get a better look 
and saw that there was this round object not too big about the size of a car 
and it was hovering at the far end of her house and it was close she said it was close enough she 
could have thrown a stone and hit it she estimates it was only about 50 feet above her house 
and she stared in absolute Fascination and as she was looking at it this object tilted towards her 
almost as if on purpose but it allowed her to see that this object had a clear Dome on 
top just like the other Witnesses had described and inside she saw the Silhouettes of two people 
now unfortunately the light from the craft itself was much too bright for her to make out what they looked like she could really only see silhouettes 
but she did what all people should do she darted back inside to get her little sister but her little sister had no shoes on and wouldn't walk out in the snow 
so Marilyn ran back out and she watched as this object started to rotate counterclockwise 
and moved off to the north turning orange as it Departed 
and at this point uh she saw this object rotating clockwise From Below and during its rotation the 
subject maintained its downward position and sort of created this impression of fluctuating in place 
and it left to the north and as it moved off the light dimmed and turned Orange but meanwhile 
inside the house Maryland's younger brothers and siblings actually watched this object as it moved 
off they estimate this total sighting lasted about three minutes but what's so interesting is and I 
really wonder about this is if it was connected to the earlier sighting by guy tossi and will be gay 
could very well be because it certainly was described in very much the same way 
so yeah I think you'll agree there I'm not sure if there are any other cases out there quite like 
that one where an ET actually kind of gets into the car and takes over the vehicle I did do a 
presentation on hitchhiking ETS I guess that might fit into that category but no this is different 
and what's so amazing is not only are there the two witnesses the Native American young men 
but another witness just hours later and another possible related case could be the same darn 
ETS just one month later in the same area it's certainly judging from the the witnesses drawing 
looks the same I don't know hard to say for sure but man what a case that is just beyond bizarre 
I call this next case they look like Saints it's a very interesting case for a couple of reasons 
one is because of the appearance of the ETS as being not only human looking but very good 
looking I mean they looked like Saints as one of the witnesses described also interesting is the 
fact that there were multiple Witnesses it's a whole family who saw this and another adult 
and finally there were some interesting I wouldn't call them Landing traces so much as I would call 
them Footprints so yeah some very interesting aspects to this case this next case took place 
in January of 1968 at an area called lagoa Negra in Brazil lagoa Negra means Black Lagoon this is 
an amazing multi-witness case which took place at a plantation the lagoa Negra fazenda which means 
Plantation in Portuguese at any rate it was around 9 pm when the entire family at this Plantation saw 
a saucer-shaped object it wasn't super large it was about nine feet tall 30 feet wide not small 
either but had a dome on top and it was very low it was hovering about six feet above the ground 
so they watched this for just a few moments when they realized this is not normal so the 
father and the manager of the plantation exited the house while the rest of the family stayed inside and they walked to a small hill and hid underneath a palm tree to observe more closely 
and yeah the wife and two children stayed in the house and watched from the front door 
they all described this craft as shiny metallic and it glowed a bright red so bright actually 
that it hurt the eyes to stare at it and it was bright enough that it actually lit up the entire 
interior of the house even though the house was about 1400 feet away this was later confirmed by 
investigators however it's all the witnesses watched two six foot tall beings emerge from 
the disc these were very much human looking figures they wore white jumpsuits and uh they 
were quite tall they were Fair complected with long hair interestingly these two figures were 
both Barefoot and seemed to walk stiffly without bending their knees and as they watched three 
smaller beings came out they were about four and a half feet tall wearing brown jumpsuits and Boots 
these smaller figures stayed under the desk while the taller beings walked around the area 
we actually started to approach the house they crossed the small wooden bridge and walked towards 
the house starting to open the actual gate and they got about as close as 180 feet to the house 
at which point the daughter exclaimed mother they look like Saints so this is when they all started 
to get quite emotional a little scared family did have five dogs none of who reacted in any way 
but it was the mother who became mostly frightened by the near approach of these beings at which point she called out to her husband was hiding under that tree just a short 
distance away and it was this that caused the beings to Halt their progress towards the house 
and after some moments of hesitation these beings turned around and returned to the craft 
all of the beings the short ones and the tall ones then entered into the craft which immediately began to spin it then Rose vertically and left the area 
but examining the area later they found the bare Footprints of the taller beings and the smaller 
boot prints of the shorter beings interestingly the boot prints had a little star-like sort of 
impression on the bottom of them so I thought that was kind of interesting now as you can 
see an extraordinary case from South America from Brazil which involves a lot of unusual 
elements to it and I think definitely deserves a place in this presentation 
and now we move to the next case which I call the milakovic Family encounter this is one that took 
place in England again this was investigated by UFO researchers as well and involves three 
Witnesses and physiological effects it really affected them quite profoundly emotionally as well 
it's just on all accounts a really interesting case they saw it so close up this case took place 
on November 20 1968 in Hanbury this is in England and again the main Witnesses are the malakovic 
family Mr Malin malakovic his wife Doris from their 11 year old son Slavic now they have a 
bunch of other kids but they had stayed at home well Mr and Mrs malakovic and Slavic left their 
home on 432 Cannon Road in hednessford and went out house hunting in the rural areas of Hanbury 
they were near the border of Staffordshire and Derbyshire very close to Burton on Trent it was 
around dusk when they suddenly noticed something very strange first one rabbit ran across the road 
from left to right but this was followed by a whole bunch of rabbits scurrying across the road 
and looking to the left to see what the rabbits were trying to escape they saw 
this very large Flying Saucer rising up from the fields so this wasn't coming 
down out of the sky this was rising up from the ground and Mr malakovic stopped the car 
and all three of them got out and watched as this object approach them it flew low over their car 
and at this point they could feel the temperature rise several degrees this craft moved on the 
temperature fell again and the object hovered over a house about 300 feet away they estimate 
and slightly to the right and where it seemed to sort of quiver as Doris described like jelly 
they all said it was pretty large as big as a house it was a pretty much a classic saucer 
shaved with a dark Bowl shape on the bottom and a clear Dome on top and here's I mean this is 
strange the top Dome was divided into thirds the left section glowed with a white light 
the middle section glowed with an amber light and the third on the right glowed with a green light 
and inside this transparent Dome they could see several humanoid figures busily moving around 
these did seem to be human looking although they were largely only silhouettes and they watched for 
about five minutes a pretty long time as these figures seem to be quite busy inside the craft 
moving back and forth sometimes bending down as if working with the instruments or something 
finally after five minutes this object began to move upwards with the moment a movement that the 
witnesses described as pulsating or jerky and the brightness increased at this point to where 
Mr malakovic felt his eyes actually burning and he's normally a brave guy he says he says 
he became quite frightened right enough to push his family forcibly into the car and drove off 
so this case was investigated they did try to locate the exact spot but weren't able to but really an extraordinary case involving animal reactions and physiological reactions 
so yeah it's a shame there wasn't more follow-up on that case but with three Witnesses I think it's 
pretty well confirmed uh the exact location they weren't able to find it precisely 
but yeah when you see something that close I don't blame the witnesses for being you know 
emotionally affected in the way that they were and here's another case that's equally profound 
and affected the witnesses also majorly and I call this one 10 foot tall humanoids I really 
love this case because they actually pursued this object this UFO to get a closer look at it 
and this is a case also which affected them emotionally of course it's got some interesting 
aspects to it in that the ETS the way they're described as being so tall that's quite unusual 
they also had so well I mean we'll get into it it's just got some really interesting details I love this case this one is just so interesting April 14 1971. 
we know the exact location this occurred at calorie Pennsylvania now this case was 
investigated by Robert a Schmidt Secretary of UFO Research Institute in Pennsylvania 
around 8 P.M on April 14th that a newly engaged couple Dennis Donaldson and Marion Lang were 
driving from Evans City his house to Pittsburgh where she lived they had just passed the calorie 
chemical plant pictured here and it was Marion who noticed a glowing object to the right of their car 
was about 300 feet away and traveling along at the same pace of their car at a very low altitude 
they didn't feel like it was purposefully pacing their car but I wonder she thought at first it 
might be a conventional aircraft but she couldn't hear any noise now this is just 
a small country road and Dennis who was driving was only going about 35 miles per hour per hour 
but when his fiance became excited and started pointing at this object he slowed down to 10 
miles per hour and started to look at this thing too and as Dennis says in his own words 
it followed the Contours of the hills off to our right staying above them in always 
equidistant from them as if using some kind of radar technology I pulled off onto 
the berm and stopped the engine so we could listen for any sound coming from the object 
it then shot way from its place above the hills across the road at about the same height one 
thousand feet and out into the sky to a point where it became like a small point of light 
so they thought it was gone at this point but it wasn't because less than a minute later this 
object came zooming back down they watched this like go larger and larger and it got even closer 
they could now see that this object looked like as they said two deep moles placed rim to rim 
and they said it was about the size of a one or two story house totally silent and it was still 
moving at this point and it went behind a hill now Dennis who was driving decided to pursue it much 
to Marion's dislike she was becoming frightened but he was fascinated so they pulled off the 
highway and decided to drive down this little road this little dirt road where they had seen it 
and coming around the corner They Came Upon This object and it was hovering just a few 
feet over a farmer's field about 160 feet away now they could see The Farmhouse a barn all the 
lights were off even though it was only 8 PM the only light burning on this house was on the barn 
and Dennis thought that was strange as he says I was hoping someone would be at home so that we 
could get others to see this peculiar object but not a soul was around so another interesting thing 
is this object was hovering in a little clearing surrounded on three sides by tall maple trees it's 
only open on one side and that was where the two witnesses Dennis Sumerian were watching this thing 
and it was unusual for sure as Dennis says the object had several windows on the upper portion 
they were in the shape of vertical rectangles the bottom half had three round windows spaced equally 
across the front how many vertical ones there were I don't know but I'm sure there were at least four 
there appeared red lights from within the top windows and the bottom ones reddish flickering 
lights from within like those which one sees dancing across computer screens 
it was Marion who first saw the figures in the windows human-like forms two of them they were 
large figures from the distance they must have been about 10 feet high they stood silhouetted 
in two of the upper windows and it was this that termed inquisitiveness into unadulterated fright 
along with her I took about three seconds to get into the car and beat it out of there 
the UFO was still there in that same position as we went out of sight of it down the dirt road 
so that's such a shame they didn't stay to see what happened next but I can understand that it's quitty pretty frightening when you see something that you've never seen before 
but both of them did notice something very strange there was this really strong kind of 
sweet Aroma like freshness it wasn't unpleasant but both of them remarked upon it and it was a 
very unusual odor and as Dennis says we had parked on the road nearby a couple of trees and it was 
while we watched the object with widening eyes that we smelled the unnatural aroma so 
they estimate that this object was about 30 feet wide and 20 feet tall and as we were watching it 
actually a beam of light did come out from the top of the object and shown straight up but when they 
realized that there were beings in there and they weren't human they were far too tall that's when 
they decided to leave this case was investigated the witnesses initially insisted upon anonymity 
but then decided no it was important that they go public and did allow their real names to be used 
it's quite an interesting case yeah what's weird about that case is the odor they described as the 
sort of fresh almost Pleasant odor which they absolutely attributed to the presence of this 
object I suspect that that was ozone because that does turn up in a number of cases you can smell 
ozone after a fresh rain it wasn't raining at that time so I think probably that's the odor that they 
were describing but yeah I love this case because again there are two witnesses they sought very 
close we know the exact location where they saw it and this darn craft was so low to the ground 
I mean it's a weird case with a lot of interesting details which is why I wanted to include it here 
and now we move to the next case which I call ETS in the front yard now this does involve a single 
witness but as we shall see it was very close up and also a very interesting there were Landing 
traces and the behavior of the ETS as we shall see and their appearance are both quite unusual this 
was on June 9 1971 in Rosedale this is in Alberta Canada it was evening and Esther a clappison 
noticed a strange light shining into her house so she walked out the front door and onto the porch 
with her dog George and to her amazement she saw that a large rectangular object had landed right 
at an intersection about 200 feet from her house really right in her front yard and this object 
this craft glowed brightly and had this huge kind of picture window through which she could see two 
men one who is gesticulating to the other guy and also kind of motioning to the outside of The Craft 
and one of them was trying to sort of obstruct from View well look to Esther like an instrument 
panel so she's watching this and seeing one of these guys sort of motioning outside 
she looked to where he was pointing and saw a third figure Outside The Craft 
who was picking up rocks or something soil from the ground now she had the impression these were 
male she couldn't really tell but she did see that these figures were short No taller than five feet 
the each War which he described as a loose fitting full body olive green jumpsuit that 
covered them from head to toe with really only sort of holes for eyes and they were also wearing 
what looked like mittens so she didn't see any fingers just sort of these Mitten like objects 
and I'll just quote Esther directly and she described what happened next as Esther says 
I tried to get closer and have a real eye fall but the old dog wouldn't let me 
in fact she said her dog was shaking and cowering and was clearly scared to death and actually prevented her from going any further out pushed her right back she says 
Now esther herself had no fear she wanted to see more so she quickly went inside to alert her 
brother who was in the house and they came back out only seconds later and this object was gone 
so yeah never take your eyes off the object any right they went to inspect the area and they 
saw you know where this object had landed there was this blackened burned spot in the vegetation 
these are very tough weeds she said but they were absolutely blackened in an area about 20 
feet long and five feet wide this was investigated by researchers this Landing site remained visible 
according to the witnesses for about six months after the incident the weeds would not grow there
so I think this case does have some lessons to teach us never take your eyes off a craft because 
the second you look away it's probably gonna Dart off uh and yeah that would have been so amazing 
if she had just walked a little bit closer to this craft and tried to interact with these 
et's uh she didn't I mean I don't blame her for that and I think she did take good action in 
trying to get another witness which is something I do recommend because seeing a UFO or humanoids 
especially alone can be very traumatic I mean it can make you question everything 
and having another witness with you makes the whole experience a lot easier to digest 
and explain and so forth a very interesting case and I think well worth knowing about 
and now we move to another one and boy is this one weird I've never heard a case like this one I call 
this the miniature UFO and humanoids and when I say miniature I mean it these are tiny little 
things this is the case from Finland I don't know of a whole lot of cases in that area but again 
this is worldwide it's one of the reasons I wanted to choose this case is because we don't have a lot 
of cases coming from Finland most of the cases certainly I've heard about are here in the U.S 
but this case also it's just so bizarre and boy did the witness get close to this one as 
we shall see this case occurred during the day on June 19 1979 in Rama Finland now Rama is a small 
picturesque town and actually they were on the outskirts of it in a fairly rural sort of area 
it was here that the married couple Alan in Mela shared this very bizarre encounter with 
a tiny UFO and even smaller humanoids it was a hot and sunny afternoon and it was Mela who 
first caught movement outside the open window of their living room and she told her husband to go 
look and he was amazed to see what appeared to be a very small disc a metallic disc it was hovering 
just a few feet over a rocky area about 180 feet away was measured afterwards by investigators 
they described this object as silver gray on the top and much darker on the bottom half 
blue black they think and beneath it a dark blue beam of light was scanning the trees in the area 
and so they stared at it for about a minute when the beam Switched Off and this is when they really realized this was not normal and they wanted to go look at it now 
as it turns out Alan is handicapped he had lost his leg some years earlier 
so he asked his wife Mela to go outside and investigate firsthand and she could see that this 
object was weird so she agreed to go see what it was and she walked right up to it close enough she 
said to actually touch it she got an incredible shock because this was a saucer-shaped object and 
it was Tiny it was about three feet wide two feet high and was resting on tiny little Landing legs 
said it was so short it reached just up to her knees and while the bottom half was uh opaque the 
top had a transparent Coppola a dome and looking inside of it she got an even bigger shock because 
inside she saw two tiny humanoid figures who she described as quote the most terrible looking men 
and she described them vividly she said that crooked beaks like a hawk for a mouth they had 
large bulging toad-like eyes you know a big mouth a long chin pointed ears and she said their skin 
was almost toad like and was flecked with green brown spots there are two of them each sitting 
on these little seats each were wearing gray helmets with a yellow stripe down the center 
and on top what looked like little antenna they wore black clothing and gloves now she 
couldn't see below their waist as it was blocked by the sides of this little object but she could 
see what looked like little levers and gauges now she says as you could see in cars or in airplanes 
so she was utterly intrigued and she reached out to actually touch this craft when both creatures 
turned to look at her and instantly Mela says she felt this strong electrical pain in her eyes 
she was struck with vertigo and was momentarily blinded so she staggered back at which point 
this craft made a loud whistling sound and took off so she didn't see that part clearly but her 
husband Alan was watching the entire incident from the house he was not close enough to see 
the beings but when Mila came stumbling back in he could see that she was quote in a State of Shock 
neither of them had seen UFOs before or described any other paranormal experiences 
however afterwards Mela did suffer from persistent eye irritation which lasted some weeks afterwards 
a final endnote to this case was at the rocky area where the craft had hovered showed discoloration 
on the Lichen there investigators who inspected this spot weren't able to completely confirm this 
but that's what the witness says and yeah what a bizarre case
yeah a totally bizarre and interesting case I can only imagine what it must have been like to 
be within two three feet of a UFO to reach out to actually touch the darn thing when it takes off 
I think that's why she had those physiological effects the eye irritation and blurriness which 
persisted for some weeks or months and yeah it's a really bizarre and unique case I don't know 
of any quite like it and now we move to another extremely well verified case now this one did have 
only a single witness but as you can see or we'll see there's really good hard physical evidence 
that this case did take place and I call this the running ETS and you will see why in just a second 
now this next case occurred just one month after the above case on July 25 1979 in tourists Spain 
the main witness is Senor Federico Ibanez it's age 54. you can see him here 
and he was actually driving through his Vineyards he was going to harvest some of the grapes 
when he noticed his strange vehicle parked among the Caribbean trees on the property 
immediately adjacent to his he knows the guy who owns this carob Orchard Caribbean Orchard 
and that's who he assumed this was he thought it was the owner of the property next to his and he 
didn't really take a close look at the vehicle because he just assumed it was the guy's car 
and it continued down this little dirt road to go and visit and speak with him and he actually 
drove right up to this vehicle before he realized it wasn't a vehicle at all or certainly not a car 
instead it was a brilliant white egg-shaped object resting on short Landing struts 
it was big enough to block the entire Road and he drove right up to it I mean he was 
only 12 feet away from it and it wasn't huge he estimates it was about seven to eight feet 
tall and wide and as soon as he came upon it two figures two very strange looking figures appeared 
from behind a carob tree about 30 feet away and they ran towards this craft at high speed it was 
very peculiar because they ran so close together says the witness that they were almost touching 
and they moved fast I mean they covered that distance from the tree to the craft in seconds 
but it was long enough for Senor Federico to see that these figures both wore puffy white 
robe-like clothes that went up over their heads kind of like a helmet and down past their knees 
almost like a skirt and as they ran to the craft you could see that they had short arms which were 
folded tight against their bodies little black legs and small feet with shoes that reminded him 
of quote boxing gloves and it was their faces that were really unusual and he couldn't really 
see faces but what he did see were protruding black goggles what looked to him like welding 
goggles but they stuck out inches so that was bizarre so he just sat there in his front seat 
and watched as these beings ran from the carob Tree in up to the craft and he says they went to 
the left of it perhaps behind it and apparently inside because this object immediately began 
to rise up and it kicked up a huge cloud of dust and it really puzzled Federico because as he says 
they got into the craft without opening or closing a door I've never seen anything like 
it it was a very bright metallic thing a very strong white that I had never seen 
so he didn't know what this was he called it a contraption and he called the little beings little dwarves because they were short he estimates that they were no taller than three feet 
and I'll just let him describe a little bit about what they look like as he says the only detail 
I remember exactly was that I could see some black tubes protruding from them no more than 
about seven or eight centimeters long similar to the glasses it used for welding but longer 
and he said that their clothing was very strange because it seemed to be almost quote swollen with 
air reached very close to the ground exposing their small dark feet and he saw their short 
arms that were you know very close to their body and the hands were very dark as well 
and he said this object just rose up into the air and departed and as it went off into the distance 
it took on the appearance of a shining Pearl and vashed into the distance 
so he was quite Shook Up he went and looked at the area where he had seen these beings 
and saw some sort of weird sort of digging in the ground he picked a few grapes but decided 
to return home and tell his wife and daughter what he had seen and they could see he was 
upset in fact they thought he had been in some kind of accident but he told him no even worse 
and told them what happened so all three of them returned to the inspect of the area 
as it turns out the owner of the curb tree Plantation had showed up and actually parked 
his car directly where this craft had landed and they were too embarrassed to tell him about the 
UFO they were afraid he wouldn't believe them so they couldn't really see any Landing traces but 
they did notice that the area where the object had landed was swept completely free of any loose dust 
and inspecting the carob tree where these two figures had been standing they did find these 
two sort of unexplained quote fissures in the ground that looked artificially created 
so he did inform UFO researchers who returned to the spot where this UFO landed and they 
did find as you can see here four circular marks on the ground in a perfect rectangle 
now Federico hadn't seen these marks due to the fact that his neighbor's car was in the way 
but yeah you can see that something landed here and he didn't notice it which I think speaks 
more towards the authenticity of this case at any rate soil samples were taken first study but did 
not show any unusual properties uh Federico did Grant interviews to the French media it's quite 
an interesting case and he has never retracted uh and yeah just a really weird case so yeah a very 
interesting case uh perhaps they were Landing in that Orchard because they wanted to pick some food 
or right next to The Vineyards that's definitely possible there are a lot of Landings among you 
know Farms places where crops are being grown so perhaps that was the agenda in that case it's very 
hard to say what is interesting about this case is how these et's were described the uniform they 
were wearing the masks or goggles I guess I don't think I've heard a case quite like that or the way 
they were running so fast as soon as the witness uh sort of surprised them I'm guessing they were 
clearly quite alarmed by that and made a quick return to their craft which took off immediately 
but what's so amazing about this case is the landing traces and I think that clinches it 
this is something that I really can't easily fake I mean the witness wasn't even really aware 
of how extensive these Landing traces were and it's not just where the craft was but where the 
ETS were as well I'm not sure if you call those Landing traces or something else but yeah good 
physical evidence the wind says never recounted the story his family absolutely believes him 
just judging from his emotional reaction to the whole incident it's really an extraordinary case 
and now we move to the 10th and final case for this presentation and I call this one 
it followed us home and this is a really poignant case involving two pre-teen boys from Michigan 
who had an encounter in their backyard actually or close to it and uh really affected them 
not only physically but emotionally for quite a long time so glad they had each 
other as Witnesses because I can only imagine how frightening this must have been if you were alone 
but yeah another well-verified well-investigated case with some interesting insights into the 
UFO phenomenon this next case occurred on December 29 1981 in Onsted Michigan 
the witnesses did not want their exact location mentioned but Onsted is not a huge town it was 
a cold evening with snow on the ground as two pre-teen boys both of who have requested anonymity 
playing behind the home of one of the boys in a little snow fort they had built 
and they heard something above them and looking up saw this weird glowing object 
now both thought at first it was a plane perhaps except they became puzzled when 
they saw that it wasn't a normal plane it was saucer shaped it had red it had red lights on 
the bottom green lights on top and a row of blinking colored lights along the perimeter 
my colored lights I mean blue green and red I have this weird kind of squarish Coppola on top 
one of the boys talking to investigators said that it was pretty high up there but the other no felt 
it was very low perhaps as low as 500 feet and yeah at first they didn't pay much attention to it 
because you know they weren't familiar with flying saucers or UFOs that didn't really enter 
their minds at this point even though this was strangely shaped with weird lights and so forth 
so they left their little snow fort and decided to go slide down a hill this is in behind the area 
behind their house and that's when their play was interrupted by the approach of a small humanoid 
and yeah very small three to four feet tall and he wasn't walking he was floating towards them 
and said one of the boys it floated over the fence and came towards us 
so one of the boys called out to the figure and got no answer so he took off running 
meanwhile the first boy was kind of rooted to the spot he felt stunned to the point of being unable 
to move he's not sure if this was a product coming from the human eye itself or just fear 
but at any rate as the stimulator moved closer and closer he finally ran away 
so this humanoid figure started to Pace them it followed them in a parallel path 
but there were trees in the way so this figure then returned to the place where it first appeared 
and these two boys stopped at this point to see if it would come any closer and of course it did 
the sarja approached them right up to their house the boys ran to their house and watched this being 
approached and stopped at the fence at the edge of their yard and this is when they got a pretty 
good look at it this figure seemed to open a sort of diamond shaped red colored section on its face 
and here's when they heard a weird sort of moaning sound at the same time it seemed to 
spin around emitting lights both above and below it both agreed that this figure was floating 
and both felt that it probably had the ability to move much more quickly than it was and could have 
apprehended and approached them if it wanted to but it didn't do that now one of the boys was a 
little closer than the others one couldn't see much detail the farther boy but estimated that 
the head was about the size of a grapefruit not big and the other boy agreed but he said that 
this being it seemed to him to have greenish wrinkled skin and legs he did not see any arms 
but it did notice sort of a greenish smog next to this figure which appeared to contain perhaps 
another figure which he thought was wearing some kind of mask as he says and I quote like 
a gas mask with an elephant's trunk a hose with lines across it and a round thing at the end 
so it stayed there for just a few moments and left at which point the boys ran inside and told the 
parents now the father was very skeptical at first but the boy's sister was there 
and she told investigator Ron Westrom who and ended up interviewing both of the witnesses 
that both the boys were pale and shaking with fear clearly upset so the boys were put in separate 
rooms and instructed to draw The Craft and each as you can see Drew nearly identical details 
and following this incident they discussed the whole thing for the entire evening and 
then went to bed and both boys said that they had bad dreams nightmares in fact one 
was so frightened he was unable to sleep alone climbed into the bed of the other and the other kid said he had continuing nightmares for a month afterwards 
and he would only go to sleep with the light on and a BB gun by his side and he also set 
up little booby traps around the room in case the ETS would come in uh one final thing was that he 
complained of blurred peripheral vision following this uh describing his dreams the witness says 
in my dreams I feel like I'm in the Army and aliens come down and our bullets can't penetrate 
them and they eat up our world so yeah you can see this was something that not only physically 
affected at least one of the boys the closer one but also emotionally affected them both 
it's a very interesting case there you go that's the final case and what's interesting about 
this to me is how profoundly the Witnesses were affected afterwards physically with eye irritation 
as we see again that's probably the most common quote injury people have and boy how it affected 
them emotionally is really quite extraordinary with the kid actually refusing to go to sleep 
unless the lights were on he had his shotgun in his hand and his whole bedroom was booby trapped 
so the E.T couldn't return even though both of them did not feel like this E.T was out to hurt 
them in any way they felt like it could have gotten to them if it wanted to and it didn't 
I think this is an important detail because in all of these cases none of these people were in 
any way physically harmed as a result of their encounters or attacked or anything like that 
so this again goes to show how very much like us these humanoids are they are People Like Us 
so there's a lot I think to learn from all of these cases again as we've seen that from all 
over the world well most of these again have multiple Witnesses lots of physical evidence 
to support this there's lots of people who say oh if there aren't photographs it didn't happen well 
that's just plain not true when you have two three four five people experiencing an event at once 
may not be proof to you but it's certainly proof to the people who had the experience 
and the fact is these 10 cases are just the tiniest tiniest fraction of the huge number 
of cases that have taken place on our planet to ignore them would be completely unscientific there 
are so many of these cases and again these are not simple sightings these aren't onboard experiences 
recovered under hypnosis involving missing time these are face-to-face confrontations face-to-face 
meetings where people were right up close to these craft and these humanoids and really 
extraordinary is how different all these humanoids are I think that's one of the big takeaways here 
so many different variations of ETS and yet in so many ways very much like us having arms and 
legs and two eyes a mouth and nose and so forth so again I think this speaks to the fact that the 
humanoid form is universal throughout you know this universe uh so yeah that's my presentation 
for today I hope you've learned something I certainly have I hope you found it interesting 
I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching 
for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun bye till next time
