TOP TWENTY UFO ENCOUNTERS IN ARIZONA, PART I
Jan 14, 2022

Summary:
Jan 14, 2022
While UFO encounters occur all across the planet, some places are more active than others. One 
such location is the state of Arizona. In fact, the Grand Canyon state has produced some of the 
world's most famous and influential encounters.

After reviewing thousands of UFO cases from Arizona, I have compiled a list of what I think are 
the top twenty best cases in the state. These cases include well-known influential cases, cases 
of high credibility, cases that contain unique or unusual elements, cases that provide important 
insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon, and more! Sightings, landings, UFO waves, 
photographic cases, face-to-face encounters with humanoids, abductions, UFO crash/retrievals -- 
the state of Arizona has them all.

Part One of this two-part video presents a countdown of cases, from number twenty to number 
eleven. Part Two presents a countdown of the top ten. With so many cases to choose from, a 
list like this can only provide a brief glimpse into the vast number of cases. But there are 
enough accounts to offer a broad understanding of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial 
presence on planet Earth.

<p>All of these cases and more appear in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071H9YM5D/...">
"UFOs over Arizona: A True History of Extraterrestrial Encounters in the Grand Canyon State"</a>. Now available!</p>

TOP TWENTY UFO CASES OVER ARIZONA PART ONE
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal 
i call this episode the top 20 UFO cases in arizona i've gone through literally thousands 
of cases in the state of arizona and picked what I think are the top 20 best UFO cases and by that 
i mean the cases that are most well known in some cases very influential cases that have something 
unique to offer in terms of our understanding of UFOs cases that have really shaped our 
understanding of this phenomena I think another researcher may have come up with a different list 
but this is mine and i'm super excited about presenting it to you today so this is going to 
be a countdown of the top 20 cases from 20 all the way to number one because there's so much 
information to present to you i'm actually going to break this down into a two part episode part 
one will be case number 20 all the way to case number 11 and part 2 will be the top 10 cases 
so let's just get started and for case number 20 I chose astronomer seymour l hesse sees a UFO
TWENTY ASTRONOMER SEYMOUR L. HESS SEES A UFO
despite allegations of skeptics there are actually many accounts on record in which professional 
astronomers have observed UFOs and that's true in this case with astronomer seymour l hess of lowell 
observatory in flagstaff arizona at 12 20 pm on may 20 1950 seymour hess was at lowell observatory 
when he observed a disc shaped craft moving slowly against the prevailing 
wind at an estimated altitude of about 12 000 feet so it was quite high up there 
but he observed this object through binoculars and became absolutely convinced that it was a powered 
vehicle of some kind as he says and I quote it was extremely prominent and showed some 
size to the naked eye that is it was not merely a pinpoint he heard no noise from this object 
as it moved across the sky and disappeared into a large cloud bank but he estimates that it was no 
larger than five feet across and moving at about 200 miles per hour 
researcher james mcdonald an atmospheric physicist from the university of arizona was really 
impressed by this report because seymour has was an astronomer a trained observer and knew about 
objects in the sky and was still convinced that it was highly unusual and in fact james mcdonald 
recommended that the robertson panel who was studying UFOs for the university of colorado 
recommended that they pay more attention to this report unfortunately that didn't 
happen and the content committee came up with a negative conclusion as to the veracity of UFOs 
but this is a really interesting case one of many in which professional astronomers have seen UFOs 
so I think it definitely deserved a place on this list that's case 20 a really remarkable and influential case that deserves to be more well-known than it 
is and that's why I gave it slot number 20 on this list and now we move along to case number 19 
and for case number 19 I chose mass sighting over tucson this is not a very well known 
case but it certainly deserves to be what more well-known because it's really quite remarkable 
NINETEEN MASS SIGHTING OVER TUSCON
early on the morning of april 1st 1958 literally hundreds of people in the tucson area observed a 
group of five or six silvery objects floating leisurely eastward over the city calls flooded 
into the local news stations and eventually these reports found their way to researcher 
james mcdonald who began a formal investigation james mcdonald was able to locate and interview 
JAMES E. MCDONALD
no less than 80 separate witnesses who observed these objects from locations more than 70 miles 
apart and after collecting and analyzing all the data he was able to triangulate the reports 
he contacted the local air force bases and local weather stations and ruled out 
any type of natural atmospheric phenomena weather balloons and conventional aircraft 
he tried to get radar information from the air force but was told that quote 
radar information is classified but after all his research a full picture of this incident 
emerged and his investigation showed that around 6 00 a.m on that morning of april 1st 1958 
a group of five or six shaped silver colored objects an estimated 25 miles high moved overhead 
and all the witnesses described essentially the same thing and here's another very interesting 
thing about this report after the objects left a group of six air force jets appeared moving in the 
direction of the UFOs so apparently chasing after them james mcdonald interviewed multiple groups 
of people who observed these objects together including a group of weathermen trained observers 
several residents a navy seaman a military pilot a group of greyhound bus passengers and more 
he made numerous inquiries trying to find the identity of these jets 
but received the runaround from the air force and it was this treatment which first convinced 
james mcdonald that our military the u.s military was withholding information about UFOs 
he eventually prepared a 40-page report on this sighting which unfortunately was never 
published his investigation however opened doors and he soon became inundated by new 
witnesses who had heard about his interest in this subject it's a really amazing encounter 
so that's case 19 and now we move to case 18 and for case 18 I chose ranch UFO encounter this case 
is virtually unknown but it's got some really interesting and unusual elements and I think it 
deserves to be more well known and that's why I gave it slot number 18 on this list on july 21st 
EIGHTEEN RANCH UFO ENCOUNTER
1985 ranch hand scott wilkins that's a pseudonym was working at the k-4 cattle ranch in yavapai 
county this is located some miles northwest of prescott arizona and it was 9 p.m in the evening 
and scott was working in the maintenance barn when he was called outside by three other ranch hands 
who stood with their families looking upward at the sky scott looked upward and saw this strange 
object moving at quote a snail's pace towards the main house on the east edge of the ranch 
and this object says scott was quote over 100 yards long triangle shaped with three huge 
bright blue lights on the bottom and smaller porthole like lights all the way around the object
now according to scott wilkins this craft moved until it was directly over the main house 
at which point it came to a complete standstill and at this point all the animals on the ranch 
became totally silent and scott saw that the horses were bunching up together against the fence 
as far from the object as they could get and the dogs who were normally very loud were retreating 
to the barn and hiding behind the hay bales so he runs to his house and he got his wife and daughter 
and they went outside and observed this object and at the same time he and the other ranch 
hands grabbed their rifles and pistols uh just to hope you know try and protect themselves from what 
this thing might be and a few of them actually brought cameras and began to take photographs 
and here's where it gets very strange the next thing everyone on the ranch knew they 
were all back inside their homes waking up the next morning the owner of the ranch paid out 
yesterday's wages as he normally did and they began this day the next day as usual 
and scott wilkins and the other employees at the ranch began the long drive out to town 
to cash their checks at the local market this is quite an isolated ranch and when he and the others arrived at the store they got an incredible shock 
as scott wilkins says and I quote it was three days later the store employees had expected us 
two days prior they showed us that day's newspaper we just stared at each other in disbelief 
but we weren't alone walnut creek station has four ranch headquarters and one forest service 
firefighters facility there the store employee and night manager told us we were part of a stream of 
people who worked in walnut creek that showed up on the wrong day to buy our monthly stock of food 
the local feed store reported the same strange event as dusty old cowboys and their families came to buy tack clothes boots shirts barbed wire etc 
so apparently there was three days of missing time with multiple people 
and according to scott this strange event caused major shock waves throughout the entire community 
several of the wives moved off the ranch and back into town others nailed their windows 
shut and placed deadlocks on their doors some bought new guns and new guard dogs 
and some left the ranch and refused to ever go there again several of the ranch hands reportedly 
found strange marks on the backs of their children next to their belly buttons as well other ranch 
hands and their wives found marks on or near their knees and around the same time of this incident 
the ranch experienced several strange cattle mutilations and according to scott these involved 
mainly pregnant cows the calf laying there still in the birthing sack but the mom cut to pieces 
the rear end just gone eyes tongue guts just gone and hardly any blood 
and there were other strange effects as scott says what was really strange we all seem to 
just forget about it never discussing it and in fact according to scott it wasn't until 
the phoenix lights incident more than 10 years later that he even thought about the event at all 
and according to scott he says that the object returned a number of times usually around late 
july july 21st he later had the opportunity to examine some of the photos taken of the UFO 
over the main ranch house and the photos from the digital cameras did not come out the only camera 
that worked was an old instematic and this photo showed only a big blur shaped like a triangle 
so this is a very strange case involving what appears to be three days of missing time uh animal 
effects uh photographs multiple witnesses it's really a remarkable case and deserves to be much 
more well-known but it is and that's why I gave it this slot and now we move to case number 17. 
for case number 17 I chose the cave creek UFO crash arizona has actually quite a few reports of 
ufo crashes and this is one of the more prominent ones certainly not the only one as we shall see 
but this is one that is not super well known and I think definitely deserves a place on 
this list and that's why I wanted to present it to you today early one morning on october 1947 
SEVENTEEN CAVE CREEK UFO CRASH
a gentleman by the name of selman graves who was then 22 years old and his brother-in-law 
bob malody who was 16 years old decided to go rabbit hunting and explore some of the 
many abandoned mines in the area of cave creek they drove over to their friend walt sollyer's 
ranch house because he was supposed to join them strangely however walt was nowhere to be found 
so selman graves and bob melody retreated to the basement of the ranch house to wait for 
walt sawyer and he arrived 20 minutes later and seemed strangely agitated and upset and whenever 
walt or bob got anywhere near the large freezer in his basement walt sawyer seemed to become 
quote especially nervous and finally he told his friends that they couldn't go hunting on 
the west part of his ranch because the air force was there and had restricted the area 
he said that the air force might be spooked by any gunfire and when he didn't elaborate 
selman graves and bob melody set off alone on horseback believing that walt would join them 
later so while they did that they climbed to the top of a large hill which gave a perfect view 
of the surrounding area and to the west of walt sawyer's ranch house they saw something incredible 
and i'll just let selman graves describe what they saw as he says and I quote what we saw 
can best be described as a large aluminum dome-shaped thing sitting upright in the desert 
according to selman graves this object was about 36 feet in diameter and about one mile 
away so he and his friend wondered if this object might be some kind of observatory dome 
but what was strange was that there were two military vehicles parked next to the object 
and five men were milling around next to it none of these guys appeared to be dressed 
in military uniform so selma graves wasn't sure what to think of this incident and after going 
hunting they returned to walt sawyer's home and at this point selman's memory becomes confused 
as he says there were men running around in the basement asking us questions about what we saw i'm 
not sure what I told them but I do remember telling myself not to forget not to forget 
he now thinks that he was brainwashed and actually made to forget so here's a little audio clip from selman graves describing what
big it was happened and so forth which I learned later and it says it was approximately 36 feet
we had no idea what we were looking at we kicked things
when they do it somewhere else maybe it's something even we thought maybe this is something to do with the solar energy collection some sort of 
a firing but in any case there was nothing that made sense of this being there instead of being
we arrived there at about 10 30 in the morning and when we left it was about 10 30 at night 
after we finished uh looking at the shafts and seeing everything that could be seen and 
it was getting late in the afternoon we uh returned to slaughter's house
we didn't leave there at about 10 30 at night because there were some other men
two years following this incident something else strange happened summon graves saw a man with a 
bulldozer right at the same exact area where he saw this object and as salman says I couldn't 
figure out what he was doing first off he was rather well groomed for that kind of work and 
he seemed to be digging ditches held her skelter so intrigued by this selman graves approached 
the man on his break and asked him why he was digging random ditches in the area and as salman 
says and I quote he laughed and admitted that he had been ordered to just mess up the ground 
so many years later in 1962 salmon graves drove out to sawyers ranch on a whim he says 
to ask what walt sollyer remembered about the 1947 incident and what was not happy about this 
as someone graves says he immediately got angry he said nothing like that happened and furthermore 
you have never been here at my ranch before so this was really confusing to selman graves 
because he knew what he saw and this is when he started to connect us all to UFOs 
so sometime later the television program unsolved mysteries heard about the case and decided to do 
an investigation unfortunately by this point walt sawyer had died some years earlier 
however they were able to obtain some confirmation of the event reporter don devereaux of the 
scottsdale progress newspaper found a resident who had spoken with sawyer about the UFO event and as 
don devereaux says and I quote he was supposedly talking about the incident including the bodies 
in the freezer the people in the bar thought it was funny and were razzing him about it 
strangely bob melody summoned graves friend has no memory of this incident at all but he does 
believe that his friend is telling the truth and as bob melody says I don't doubt it now some in 
graves remains convinced that both he and his brother-in-law were victims of of some sort of quote mind-bending hypnosis end quote by military officials to make them forget what they had seen 
researcher sean castille who published an article about this case in UFO universe magazine 
rights so there you have it arizona arizona produces one mystery after another some rooted 
in the ever-changing present while others seep up from the dark well of the almost forgotten 
if there are answers they continue to elude us at least for now 
so there you go uh amazing case of an apparent UFO crash retrieval including bodies and a government 
cover-up it's really quite interesting so that's case number 17. now we move to 16 
and for slot number 16 I chose the william rhodes UFO photographs this is quite a controversial case 
but it's a very interesting story and one of the first really interesting UFO photographs out there 
i think it should be much more well known than it is and that's why I gave it slot number 16 on this list on july 7 1947 around the exact same time as the roswell UFO 
SIXTEEN WILLIAM RHODES UFO PHOTOGRAPHS
crash in new mexico amateur photographer william rhodes of phoenix was drawn outside by a strange 
sound hoping to photograph a jet he was surprised to see instead what appeared to be a flying disc 
he said it was semi-circular flat and circling the area about two thousand feet away 
so william rhodes quickly snapped two photographs of this object which then veered 
and flew quickly off to the west and realizing he had just captured two photographs of a flying 
saucer that the newspapers were talking about he rushed to his laboratory and developed the film 
and the two pictures came out perfectly he offered them to the newspaper the arizona republic who 
published them on july 9 1947 under the headline saucer flits in the sky at unbelievable speeds 
so the story develops from there kenneth arnold who is most famous for the sighting over 
mount rainier viewed the photographs and seeing that they portrayed pretty much exactly what he 
had seen earlier that year over mount rainier he publicly declared his belief that rhodes's 
pictures were genuine and it was kenneth arnold's endorsement that caught the attention of the 
air force and actually the fbi and according to william rhodes the fbi showed up within 48 hours 
of the photograph being published and these two men presented themselves as lieutenant 
colonel beam from hamilton field california and fbi agent mr ledding and they interrogated william 
rhodes about the sighting and the photographs and as william rhodes says and I quote 
they confiscated the negative and said I could get it back soon but that never happened 
and according to william rhodes in 1948 he was asked to travel to wright patterson air force base 
in ohio for an interview but he declined and it was shortly later that military and government 
officials arrived at his home to interview him again as william rhodes says years later when 
i called the fbi they denied all knowledge of the incident but then the bombshell occurred on march 
5th 1985 when the air force declassified air intelligence report number 100
this formerly top secret report originally dated december 10 1948 
presents an analysis of the then current UFO situation at that time reporting on different 
types of UFOs and speculating on their possible origins and intentions and this report concludes 
that quote some sort of flying object end quote has been observed so what are these flying objects 
the report takes a very hesitant conservative stance and says it is not known at this time 
whether these observations are misidentifications of domestically launched devices natural phenomena 
or foreign unconventional aircraft but important here is the appendix appendix c 
which is called the selected reports of flying object incidents and several cases are mentioned 
including the sighting by william rhodes which the air force conveniently said that they forgot 
and this report clearly says that william rhodes and I quote allegedly saw a disc circling his locality during sunset and took two photographs 
the resulting pictures show a dislike object with a round front and a square tail 
these photographs have been examined by experts who state they are true photographic images 
and do not appear to be imperfections in the emulsion or imperfections in the lens 
today some UFO researchers speculate that william rhodes may have photographed one of the 
actual UFOs that crashed at roswell or one that's identical to them 
this case is not without controversy some believe that rhodes hoaxed these photographs 
though no explanation is given to how he did this but the fact that the fbi and government officials 
showed so much interest in these photographs I think lends credibility to this case and the 
fact that they denied it and we now know that that was a lie also I think shows that they were taking 
this very seriously indeed whatever the case I think it's an important and influential case and 
could very well be a early genuine photograph of the UFOs that were flying around during this 
massive wave during the time of the roswell UFO crash all right moving along and now we 
get to case number 15. for case number 15 I chose luke air force base UFO cover-up this is another 
incident that's virtually unknown but it involves an insider at luke air force base who admits to 
covering up UFO information it's a very important case and that's why I wanted to include it on this 
list now it is well known that air force bases are primary targets for UFOs and that certainly 
FIFTEEN LUKE AFB UFO COVER-UP
seems to be true in this case where luke air force base had an incredible sighting and here's 
a direct quote from an individual who worked at luke air force base at the time of this incident 
this actually occurred on august 10th 1974 and as this witness says and I quote 
as a former sat staff sergeant in the usaf and a tower crew chief at luke air force base control 
tower a former phoenix firefighter and engineer a business owner a jet aircraft mechanic for 
lockheed martin and nasa a husband father and an american patriot 
i promise you these comments are true and honest so this is how this witness is introducing himself 
and this gentleman worked as the tower chief when a colonel from luke air force base command post 
telephoned him on the hotline saying that he had a civilian resident from nearby sun city who was 
looking at a UFO at that very moment and this colonel told the tower chief who's anonymous 
to take the call so the chief answered the phone and spoke with the resident a woman who said that 
there was a bright object hovering over the white tank mountains and she asked him repeatedly do you 
see it do you see this object and as the chief says at luke air force base and I quote the UFO 
was real and clearly visible it glowed orange to red and seemed to move all about an approximate 
2 to 10 degrees degrees each time it moved the lady repeated several times do you see it 
and this chief from luke air force base lied and said no he lied to her and as he says and I quote 
i wish to point out at this time that we lied to the lady we saw the object all too well but due to 
the extremely heavy amount of paperwork we would have had to undergo not to mention a psychological 
assessment we answered her no and that was a lie to this day I regret lying to this lady 
so according to this witness this chief he and four other officers in the control tower observed 
this glowing object for 45 more minutes when as he says suddenly and in the blink of an eye it shot 
up and off to the right that point it disappeared off into the distance what's important here as is 
that this chief at luke air force base and other witnesses saw this object knew it was a UFO 
and still lied about it and covered it up and this just goes to show how badly 
our military has bungled this whole UFO situation and he didn't tell the truth because 
he knew that it would cause not only paperwork but it would actually put his own 
job in jeopardy it's such a shame and one can only wonder how many other incidents 
there are that occurred that we don't know about and I have to give credit to this chief 
from luke air force base for coming forward even though it was years later it's an amazing case 
so that's case number 15 and I think you'll agree that that's an amazing encounter and now we move to number 14 and for number 14 I chose a radar visual UFO encounter 
this is an amazing encounter involving multiple witnesses and a UFO that appeared on radar this 
case comes from j allen heineck and I think you'll find it quite interesting so this case occurred 
on january 13 1967 and as I mentioned it's a particularly well verified sighting involving 
multiple eyewitnesses and radar confirmation it was at 10 p.m on the evening of january 13 
and at that time two pilots in separate planes one was the national airlines jet 
and the other was a lear jet each crew observed a mysterious red flashing object 
which appeared to be elongating and increasing in size in addition to these two witnesses 
an aircraft controller in nearby albuquerque was watching the object on his radar screens 
and was also in communication with both pilots and the radar operator noticed a very 
interesting and curious fact whenever the pilots reported the light flashing 
off the object would disappear from his radar scope and when the pilot saw the light flash 
on the object would reappear on his screens so this object was in view for more than 25 minutes 
this did reach uh project blue book and was investigated by j allen heineck who investigated 
this incident in depth and as jay allen heineck writes and I quote as the tower warned the jet 
that the object was getting closer it seemed to play a cat and mouse game with the jet 
involving some rapid accelerations and according to highneck during this incident the following 
conversation ensued between the controller in albuquerque and the national jet airlines 
the control tower said do you want to report a UFO and the pilot of the national airlines jet replied 
no then albuquerque control asks the pilot of the leader jet do you want to report a UFO and the 
pilot of the leader jet replied no we don't want to report this point the object took off at a 30 
degree angle upward and accelerated at super high speeds and was out of view in less than 10 seconds 
so j alan heineck pointed out this case in particular as an example of how 
attitudes toward UFOs can affect the reactions of the witness so once again 
it is the air force's policy of ignoring and ridiculing witnesses 
that led them to not want to report it it's quite a shame it's an important case that deserves to be 
really well known so that's case 14 definitely a substantial case now we move to case number 13. 
for 13 I chose a disabled UFO there are not many cases of apparently disabled UFOs 
this is one of them and it comes from jim and coral lorenzen it's quite a fascinating case 
and that's why I gave it number 13 on this list on june 26 1962 UFO researchers jim and coral 
THIRTEEN A DISABLED UFO
lorenzen received a UFO report coming from their hometown of tucson the witnesses were two brothers 
john and james westmoreland who were camping out in the backyard of their home with their friend 
ronnie black john was 14 years old and james and ronnie were both 11 years old around 9 00 pm 
on that evening they noticed what appeared to be an unusually bright star 
it seemed to move slowly becoming lower and lower in the sky and when it became stationary they 
lost interest and this object remained in place for at least two hours and it was around 11 45 pm 
began to descend again moving so close so low that the witnesses were able to discern a triangular 
shape and at this point it suddenly emitted three smaller green objects which started away 
and at the same time another object swooped down and hovered in place above the first 
so naturally the boys were amazed and watched the first object emit another three green objects 
which went into the second object and next to this next the second object moved close enough that the 
witnesses could see what appeared to be some type of landing gear and the second object retrieved 
one more of the smaller green objects from the first and then it slowly faded away 
and now a third object appeared this time close enough to see a white cone-shaped superstructure above a round aerofoil the boys watched as a small 
door open from underneath and three objects were emitted it moved lower 
and a cable was lowered for about five minutes and then drawn back up into the craft carrying a large 
dark object the door closed and the object moved upward and to the east until it was out of sight 
so jim and coral lorenzen were very much impressed by this report they questioned the boys extensively and concluded that the third and closest object was about an estimated 80 feet 
in diameter and a quarter mile from the witnesses they also concluded that the object seen being 
pulled back up into the object was the same size as the smaller ships that they had seen 
so the lorenzens can seriously consider the possibility that this was a disabled 
ufo being retrieved by a mother ship and as they write and I quote in view of presence 
of the smaller objects we can theorize at some time or another one had become disabled and lost 
a search was initiated and a recovery eventually affected the latter phase of the observations 
in which a device was lowered to the ground and retracted to the third saucer at the end of it 
could have been that recovery this idea may be further supported by the saucer's prompt 
departure after the object was taken aboard recovery of the object from the wash may have been 
the sole purpose of the presence of the saucers that night so whether or not this was an actual 
recovery operation of a disabled UFO is still a matter of speculation but this is what jim 
and coral lorenzen of apro the aerial phenomena research organization uh thought considered it's 
a very interesting case to say the least and I think it definitely deserves a place on this list 
so yeah as you can see that it's quite an amazing case case number 13. and moving along we now 
move to case number 12 and for case number 12 I chose blue book case number 2 3 8 8 unidentified 
this involves a weatherman a very credible witness who had quite an incredible encounter involving 
two UFOs which he viewed through a theodolite I think you'll find this quite interesting 
so this next case took place at yuma arizona at 1 50 p.m on february 4 1953 
now as we've seen most blue book cases that were labeled unidentified involve witnesses of high 
credibility and that's certainly true in this case the main witness is weather observer stanley 
brown and he was using a theodolite which is a camera attached to a telescope and he was tracking 
a balloon a theodolite allows the observer to sort of triangulate an object and measure its size and 
distance and movement and as stanley brown is observing this balloon through a deodolite to 
his amazement he saw two UFOs approach right close to this balloon perhaps to investigate it and as 
stanley brown wrote in a written statement to the air force and I quote I saw one object going 
upward and curving to the left although it moved rapidly I was able to see it clearly and follow 
the flight about 30 seconds after citing the first object a second object came into the field and 
swooped upward and across the path of the first object the first object flew toward the west while 
the second object swooped across or near the path of the first object three or four times going out 
of the field about two times for a moment the two objects passed near the lower portion of the sun 
and were traveling westward the second object below and behind the first object when a serious 
serous cloud came into the theodolite field and I lost sight of the two objects 
the objects were both the same size almost round a solid dull pure white color 
with a thin mist completely edging around each object I am absolutely certain of what I have seen 
so stanley brown says he observed these objects for about five minutes until they were lost in the clouds and after being investigated by project blue book 
they were unable to come with come up with any explanation for what this object might be and it's 
one of very few cases that made their unidentified list in arizona and again this is case number two 
three eight eight it's quite an amazing case and now we move to case number eleven the last one 
for this part one episode and for case number 11 I chose congresswoman isabelle greenway king sees 
aufo there are not a lot of cases of government officials seeing UFOs but this is one of them it's 
virtually unknown I think it should be much more well known that it is and that's why I gave it the 
number 11 slot on this list I think you'll find it quite interesting on september 6 1952 in tucson 
ELEVEN CONGRESSWOMAN ISABELLA GREENWAY KING SEES UFO
congresswoman isabella greenway king who was by the way arizona's first female congresswoman 
ISABELLA GREENWAY KING, ARIZONA'S FIRST FEMALE CONGRESSWOMAN AND A UFO WITNESS.
she observed a UFO it was at precisely 4 55 p.m and she was no longer a congresswoman at this 
point but she and her friend bill mclean observed an orange tear-shaped object overhead according 
to the witnesses it first whirled on its vertical axis then descended very quickly stopped and began 
whirling in the opposite direction and retraced its path upward it was a pretty brief sighting but 
definitely unexplained and blue book officers were called in to investigate and after interviewing 
the witnesses and investigating the incident in detail blue book officers were totally stumped 
they could not identify it and it became another one of the cases in arizona that they labeled 
unidentified and that's blue book case number two zero four eight so there you go that's case number 
twenty all the way to case number 11. I did cover all of these cases in my book UFOs over arizona 
and next week I will be covering case number 10 all the way to number one and I think you'll find 
that even more interesting I certainly hope so uh but that's it for now I hope you found that 
interesting and I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it until next time 
keep searching for the truth keep asking questions and keep having fun
you
