EIGHT TRUE CASES OF ANIMALS HEALED BY ALIENS

Summary:
Mar 21, 2021
UFO healings are now a recognized feature of extraterrestrial encounters. What many people don't know, however, is that there are also several cases on record of animals being healed. The most common category by far is dogs, but other are reports of other animal UFO cures too.

This video presents eight cases of animals who have been healed as the result of a UFO encounter. These cases are important because they not only show a benevolent side to UFOs and aliens; they also show just how truly advanced the ETs are when it comes to healing.

Compared to reports of humans being healed, cases of animal healings are exceedingly rare. That alone makes accounts like these significant. Why are the ETs healing animals? How are they affecting these cures? What does this say about these mysterious visitors to our planet?

Using firsthand eyewitness testimony and actual true-life cases, this video attempts to answer all these questions and more. If you'd like to learn more about animals who have been healed by aliens, please check out my book, "The Healing Power of UFOs: 300 True Accounts."

hello everyone and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal today's episode is called eight true cases of animals healed by aliens there are literally 
hundreds of cases of people who have been healed as a result of a ufo encounter but what many 
people don't know is that animals are being healed as well it's not super common but it does happen 
it's not a new idea in fact it's appeared in film at least a couple of times that I know of 
one good example comes from the science fiction film star man starring karen allen 
and jeff bridges there's a very memorable scene in that film in which jeff bridges 
who plays a human looking extraterrestrial heals a deer who had been killed by a hunter 
more recently in the science fiction comedic film paul which is about an alien on the run 
from the government paul a grey alien heals a dead bird and brings it back to life 
it doesn't end too well in that case but in most of the true life cases it ends very well so 
in this video i'd like to cover eight true cases of animals that have been healed these cases have 
occurred across the united states and the world i'm going to start with the most common category 
by far which is dogs and then move on to the cases involving other animals the first case i'd like to 
talk about occurred in 2012 and involved a dog by the name of ben the main witness in this case is a 
woman named joy davies she was born in 1949 and currently lives in a small town in pennsylvania 
called warren this is outside of the allegheny national forest
and on august 2nd 2012 joy davies was taking a walk in the forest in her backyard with her dog 
named ben at the time joy suffered from pretty severe arthritis and uh had to take pills uh 
daily uh even with this medication she wasn't able to be as active as she liked but on august 2nd 
2012 she was taking a walk with her dog ben when she came upon a group of figures in the forest 
they were child sized but had very pale skin and were bald no hair on their heads 
they were smiling at her and joy heard a voice in her head saying 
telling her not to be afraid as she says I wasn't scared at all they were very polite and I felt 
safe the whole time there was a large white peanut shaped craft sitting on the ground 
next to them it lit up the forest around them with a bright soft blue glow 
and suddenly joy found herself inside this craft as she says I don't remember entering the ship 
but I knew I was inside because the walls were curved and the blue light was underneath me 
ben was next to me and one of the aliens was scratching him behind his ears which he likes 
as joy stood there she saw a tiny blue light kind of like a little glowing star but it was about the 
size of a snowflake she said the light appeared above her and started to float slowly down 
joy was delighted and began laughing and she held out her hand to catch it and as she says the next thing I remember is standing on the path 
facing my house one of the aliens was holding my hand when he let go and turned back down the path 
i don't know why I didn't turn to watch but instead I just walked back to the house with ben 
and made a cup of tea I then went to bed because somehow four hours had passed and it was late 
when joy woke the next morning she had an incredible surprise all the symptoms of her 
arthritis were gone and she was pain-free she is absolutely convinced that the aliens healed her of 
her arthritis as she says now I haven't got it at all and I haven't taken a single pill since 
i've played tennis for the first time in several years and I can knit again now that the arthritis 
is gone what's interesting and significant here is that her dog also was apparently 
healed as she says and I quote ben seems more frisky too so the dog had a lot more energy and 
was able to keep up with her as well so this is a very interesting case which was investigated by 
a columnist by the name of holly thorne who writes for the morton report 
holly thorne interviewed joy davies and as holly thorne says prior to joy's alleged encounter four 
different people had reported strange lights in the area three sightings had been reported 
since april and only a week before davies had her experience several witnesses reported 
military activity in the forest part of the force was sealed off for three days 
so yeah it's a very interesting case indeed and it's not unique the next case i'd like to talk 
about involves a dog by the name of sam the main witness in this case is a gentleman by the name of 
danny anderson he's a resident of mount kiara which is located in new south wales australia 
throughout his life danny has had many unusual experiences but one evening in 1971 while lying in 
bed a whirling red light appeared in his bedroom and he suddenly found himself being pulled inside 
of a large room with flashing lights and strange instrument panels there was a seven foot tall 
humanoid in a green suit who instructed anderson to sit in a weird type of chair the alien placed a 
hand over dany's eyes which caused him some pain at first but as danny says before long though 
the pain gave way to a beautiful peaceful feeling and I knew I never wanted to leave 
that place a moment later I was back in bed so that was one very memorable encounter 
once he woke up he found out that he had had some physiological changes his sense of hearing and 
touch were now both ultra sensitive his face was red and swollen and there were two hieroglyphic 
like marks which had appeared on his chest so following this experience danny had repeated 
visitations by what he describes as insectoid beings and other types of entities as well but 
one afternoon danny was watering his plants in his garden when he saw a mantis-like creature exiting 
the shed of his dog and disappearing behind it his dog his name was sam and he was old and 
crippled with arthritis and would yelp with pain whenever anybody even tried to pet him 
so the condition was so severe that danny was planning on having old sam put to sleep pretty 
soon so after this incident he rushed into the dog shed to check on sam and the dog was not only fine 
he appeared to be completely healed as danny anderson says his coat was suddenly glossy and 
his eyes were brighter than they'd been for years from that day the arthritis never troubled sam 
uh he went outside and looked for the mantid being but there was no sign of him but anderson feels 
really humbled and he feels like he's got a strong connection to these beings who he says are quote 
full of love and peace so it was a very benevolent encounter which healed a dog of arthritis 
another interesting case involves a dog named katrina I was able to interview 
the witness first hand she is an animal control officer from arizona her name is juji lee kuita 
and she's had encounters her entire life beginning around age five when tall grays visited her in her 
bedroom in indiana her encounters continued uh including in not only physically but in the dream 
state and in the astral state she said a number of very strange ufo sightings uh her encounters 
uh have been very benevolent for her with lots of communication lots of knowledge given to her and juju as she likes to be called considers these ets her family 
in the mid 2000s uh juju received a dog by the name of katrina juju adored this 
dog and felt almost as though they were soul mates she became closer to katrina than any 
other pet she's ever had but in 2016 katrina became sick and developed a condition known as 
valley fever this is a systemic fungal infection that can cause fever nausea lung problems joint 
pain inflammation and worse I mean in some cases it can be fatal and katrina was not doing well 
at the time juju didn't know what was wrong with her dog but she knew that the dog was definitely 
sick but then one evening around march 2016 juju found herself apparently on board a ufo as she 
says it looked like the inside of a football the floor came up and met the ceiling that came down 
it was not real sharp but there was a curve in the wall the room was dimly lit 
juju felt no sensation of movement there was a weird kind of floor floor lamp um on the floor 
a weird device which you couldn't quite recognize but looked like a lamp she saw two men in the 
room as well one was white skinned and stocky with blonde hair and appeared to be caucasian 
the other was darker skinned with dark curly hair and he looked almost italian 
is was her impression both of them wore full length white robes but what really caught juju's 
attention was that the caucasian looking man was hunched over her dog who had her legs straight 
up in the air and appeared to be unconscious her first thought was that the man was hurting katrina 
and anger swept over her and she took instant action as she says I saw that he had my dog she 
was on her back and she was kind of whimpering she seemed scared and I thought this guy was hurting 
her so I grabbed what looked like a floor lamp I grabbed this thing and I was going towards him 
she was ready to knock these guys over with the lamp when the italian man 
jumped in front of her and said hold on please wait just three seconds he spoke 
very peacefully and very calmly and his tone calmed juju down enough for her to realize that 
these were not people these were et's and she was having a visitation and she instantly felt like 
she could trust them she looked down at her dog and was just absolutely amazed at what she saw 
as she says this guy was bringing his hand out of her chest and she wasn't whimpering anymore 
but it was like his fingers extended and were elongated and went actually through her body 
and he was bringing them back out and he did this really gently the man bowed his head deferentially 
at juju and allowed her to approach katrina as uh she says I looked down and katrina gets up 
she just looks at me I kneel down to pet her and be next to her and that was it it ended 
juju woke up the next day back inside her home and she instantly checked on katrina 
who seemed to be fine as the days pass however katrina did still seem to be a little unwell and 
started to get worse over a period of months so she took the dog to the vet and 
the veterinarian diagnosed katrina with valley fever
juju believes she knows how katrina got valley fever because katrina loved to dig around in the 
dirt and it she it appeared that she had become infected by a fungus from doing so much digging 
but juju believes that katrina's health was improved as a result of this encounter and 
her life was extended she believes the dog probably would have died much earlier but the dog managed to live one year longer before finally dying of valley fever 
juju believes that the et's healed katrina trying to keep her alive because at that time juju was 
going through a lot of personal difficulties in her life and really needed to have katrina around 
as juju says I think what they were trying to do is help her because they were so loving and so 
benevolent to me toward me and her I truly believe they were helping her following katrina's passing 
juju was actually contacted by her et friends who told her that katrina was in fact 
of et heritage as juju was herself and finally it made sense to juju why she always felt such a 
strong and special bond uh to her so this juju has had a lot of benevolent counters as I said once 
uh as a young girl she was saved from a fall later on as a an adult she believed her vision 
was healed as a result of a ufo encounter but it was this incident with katrina that left a very 
lasting impression on her she continues to have experiences to this day with ets as she says 
i've had the most beautiful healing and loving lessons from them that help me in my reiki how to 
channel energy juju's story was told in the book being with the beings written by miguel mendonka 
and it's a really astonishing case another strange and bizarre case involving a dog 
uh occurred on july 23rd 2015. this case comes from mufon and was reported by an anonymous 
witness the dog is also anonymous I call the gentleman rory but on july 
23 2015 rory was sitting in front of his computer in yonkers new york when he suddenly became 
unaccountably paralyzed unable to move and his dog who sat next to him also appeared to be paralyzed 
rory didn't see anyone at first but he did sense a presence in the room suddenly his electronics went 
haywire his computer began switching on and off and began playing music and the lights on his cell 
phone began blinking on and off and at this point events went from very strange to totally bizarre 
rory didn't hear anything but he felt that the entities were telepathically questioning him trying to study and categorize him and he just kept thinking strongly 
i i'm a good person i'm a good person he felt a strong mental link to these unseen beings but not 
only to these beings but to his dog so there was a sort of three-way telepathic link with rory his 
dog and the beings and it seemed to rory as if his dog had been intellectually enhanced in his 
awareness as rory says she was looking at me and I felt she was telling me to be calm and unafraid 
rory actually wondered if one of the beings had taken over his dog and was communicating through her at some point rory found himself apparently inside a craft he was on a table 
undressed and was being probed next thing he knows he was back in his computer chair feeling like 
one of the beings had kind of taken over his body this weird trance-like state uh ended and outside 
rory heard this pretty strong roaring sound he ran outside and could hear this thing overhead as he 
says it was right above me hovering loudly it was no plane uh he couldn't see anything there was a 
pretty low uh level of clouds but he could definitely hear this thing roaring and staying 
in place was very strange and following this experience rory did notice some strange changes 
he began to focus a lot mentally on really profound and esoteric subjects as he says 
i suddenly started thinking about the universe creation god and seemed to have 
knowledge or a better understanding of ideas I had never thought about before and a sense of how things came to be in what we are in the universe and not only that his dog 
also seemed to be more aware and smarter rory also noticed some physiological changes as he says 
the next day my health was extraordinarily great no aches or pains with my arthritis my 
diabetes was like it was not there my sugar wouldn't raise no matter what I ate 
and this was for about a week like I just got diabetes my energy and strength were incredible 
and yeah his dog was also altered in some way and seemed incredibly aware and intelligent 
three days following this event rory was in bed with his dog when something very weird 
happened as he says I felt a sudden dread like something altered in this time space dimension 
and they left my dog went back to being a dog with less awareness that's the best way I can 
explain it I realized for the past three days she was more attentive and like a close friend 
i know this is weird but that that's all I can say and remember 
he now believes that these entities were interacting with him for and his dog for about three days as he says these beings are dimensional travelers and are in our 
time they made me aware that death is not the end just different in that we are made up of energy 
and have control of our environment they were having fun with me and were just curious about 
my daily events overall he feels like this was a very benevolent experience 
as he says i'm not afraid or confused about these events I feel comforted with the new awareness 
about my life it was a few months later he was so impressed by this event 
that he finally reported his experience to mufon the mutual ufo network probably the ultimate case 
of a dog healing is one i've covered before but i'll cover it here again and it occurred to a 
gentleman by the name of raynero hernandez who is an estate tax attorney from miami florida 
this was in 2012 and at the time ray considered himself a quote material rationalist he did 
not believe in ufos or anything paranormal he scoffed at those who talked about such things 
but on march 3rd 2012 he had a very strange experience involving his wife and his dog 
whose name was nina nina was a 15 year old jack russell terrier and had she had become paralyzed 
she had previously been very ill because of severe arthritis in a heart condition 
but on march 3rd 2012 suffered what her their vet their veterinarian believed must have been 
a cerebral aneurysm because the dog was paralyzed and they called the vet and the veterinarian gave 
them the bad news and said yeah it's probably a cerebral aneurysm and to please bring her in 
and uh told them that likely she would have have to be euthanized 
uh rey and his wife were devastated and rey's wife who is a devout catholic uh prayed 
earnestly for angels to help nina and the next morning at 6 00 am this is now march 4th 2012. 
rey's wife woke up and carried nina downstairs to the living room when without warning 
a quote small silver colored translucent metallic object appeared in the in the corner of the room 
and rey's wife believed her prayers had been answered and she fell to her knees 
and began praying she screamed for rey to come downstairs and when he didn't she quickly ran 
back upstairs pulled him out of bed and dragged him downstairs and into the living room 
ray was absolutely shocked to see what looked like a quote plasma energy being 
he apparently had a period of missing time on they all did because the next thing ray knew 45 minutes 
had passed as ray says I woke up 45 minutes later where I found my wife celebrating in our 
living room and nina running around like she was a young puppy before this miraculous medical healing 
nina was not able to either run or jump because of her severe arthritis and heart condition now she was running around the house enjoy celebrating her new lease on life 
of course rey's wife was also overjoyed and told him that angels had cured their dog 
for ray this was a mind-blowing experience which completely transformed his life as he says 
this experience felt like an atom bomb blew up in my brain and I was in total shock and confusion my wife did not know that she had disappeared for 45 minutes 
she also did not see the energy being because she was taken before this plasma energy being appeared 
it was a state of total chaos and celebration for the miraculous healing of our beloved nina by what my wife perceived to be angelic intervention
so this changed ray's life he was absolutely shocked and began to do research into what might have happened to him and after doing a lot of research 
he came to the conclusion conclusion that this may have very well been a ufo encounter 
and it wasn't long after this that both rey and his wife experienced several close-up ufo 
sightings and other paranormal encounters and in the space of a few months ray became completely 
transformed his life took a left turn and he became inspired to do lots of research into ufos 
one year later he became the co-founder of the dr edgar mitchell foundation for research into 
extraterrestrial and extraordinary experiences which at the time was titled free uh and uh 
it led to him doing very substantial and pioneering work in the ufo field he wrote 
or actually wrote and edited a groundbreaking landmark book by titled beyond 
ufos which brought some real scientific and academic attention to the ufo field 
and he's now become a very major figure in the ufo field and is lecturing across the united states
so this is an incredible healing of his dog and unfortunately 
it was uh temporary nina was a very old dog and a few months later nina died but rey 
and his wife would never be the same it's an incredible encounter so those are the dog 
healings but as i've mentioned there have been healings of a number of other animals 
here is a very strange case involving two roosters the case comes from a witness by the name of susan 
navares morton and it took place in a small town in called pleasanton in texas and one summer 
afternoon in 1959 susan who was 13 years years old she and her family went to attend a rooster fight 
and then she and her family drove to a secret location because uh rooster fights are not legal 
in texas and she joined a huge crowd of people uh who all sat on wooden beachers bleachers 
surrounding a little area where two roosters were would fight this would be a fight a battle 
susan knew to the death and the two roosters were fiercely fighting when suddenly the attention of 
the crowd was caught by a large glowing object which hovered at low elevation over the area 
and without any warning this object emitted two beams of light which struck the roosters 
susan described the object as quote an enormous red globe with two shafts of white light 
inching down towards us everyone watched in total amazement as the beams of light 
targeted the two roosters who were now lying on the ground nearly dead from their injuries 
and this is when something truly incredible happened as susan says and I quote their small broken bodies glowed eerily for a few seconds then slowly 
they both got up on their little chicken feet and began strutting around with robust enthusiasm 
at this point the crowd was extremely agitated the object's object flew away the beams of light 
retracted the object changed from a red color to an orange and streaked away at high speed 
and the two roosters now showed no trace at all of their uh former injuries 
uh needless to say the fight was canceled and the whole event was dispersed and ended but it's a 
very bizarre case involving what appears to be a ufo healing involving two roosters and of course 
there are other cases the next case i'd like to talk about involves a horse named daffodil 
the main witness in this case is a gentleman by the name of ivor circombe who owned a farm 
near davis england on november 12 1960 ivor heard a voice in his head telling him to check on his 
horse daffodil at the time daffodil was suffering from an illness in her hooves so ivor went outside 
to check uh daffodil who was in her stable and as he walks towards the stables he saw that 
there was a golden glow coming from the stable and he entered the stable and standing besides 
beside daffodil was a six-foot figure wearing a weird kind of sports jacket 
and the figure spoke telepathically to ivor saying that he was a veterinarian and would 
cure the court the horse this was no ordinary veterinarian because in his hand he held a very 
strange looking machine type device which looked semi-solid semi-transparent it reminded ivor 
of a dental x-ray device that a central column with two arms projecting out on either side 
at the end of which were metallic spheres this strange six foot being moved the instrument along 
the horse's forelegs focusing on the hooves and at this point ivor saw blue purple sparks being 
emitted and felt a powerful electric force this went on for about 15 minutes at which 
point the visitor just gradually faded away and disappeared ivor was about to check on his 
horse when he heard a telepathic voice say clearly leave the horse alone there is nothing you can do 
so ivor returned to his home but following this incident the horse showed no signs of his hoof 
disease and experienced a full recovery it's a very bizarre and incredible case
my fav probably my favorite case of an animal healing uh involves a gibbon which is a small ape 
this gibbon was named sarah and this case comes from a lady I interviewed personally her name 
is dolly part of her story appears in my book on board ufo encounters 
and uh like many contactees are most perhaps dolly has a very strong affinity 
and love of animals she worked for many years at a zoo and one one day while working at this uh zoo 
in florida she had a very unusual experience with this baby gibbon whose name was sarah and i'll 
just quote dolly uh as she tells this story in her own words so this is dolly talking as dolly says 
sarah was born early 2014 and as she grew up she came to be in our zoo 
when we had her about five days I noticed that she was not eating right she could barely take even an 
ounce of milk and she was lethargic and sleeping and I knew we were in trouble with her so my 
cousin and I took her to the vet whereupon he did blood testing and kept her overnight and he let us 
know that she had leukemia and she was in a lot of trouble I was so despondent and I freaked out and 
i was praying as loudly as I could to anything and anyone who would hear me to help me with this baby 
i couldn't handle losing this sweet little girl she was so precious the first thing that happened 
is we had to find her a full blood sibling who might become a donor match for bone marrow for her 
she had to be taken to auburn in alabama to the university animal hospital up there they notified 
us of a time to come and we prepared to get her up there after we found a full blood sibling who 
also had to go with us but an interesting happen an interesting thing happened while all this was 
going on as I was praying and praying and praying and sending out message after message in my mind 
please help me uh we had a day where I had to go to tampa to check something out 
and when I was coming back I was followed by a ufo it followed me all the way back to the zoo 
and all I kept thinking was oh please let this be help let this be help we went to bed that 
night knowing full well that sarah could die before we could even get her to auburn 
the next morning I got up and sarah was awake and she seemed a little chipper and she actually took 
four ounces at one time of milk and was more alert I was so thankful and I thought oh my god 
this is good she's going to make this trip sarah was taken to auburn university and the first thing 
they noticed after doing all their blood tests was that her leukemia was calming down she was doing 
much better tests were done between her and her sibling to see if he could be a full bone 
marrow donor for her during this process a very miraculous thing occurred sarah just kept kept 
getting better and better to the point that they didn't think she needed the bone marrow transplant 
with her improvement her miraculous improvement as a matter of fact because they had never seen 
an animal do this before we took her home knowing full well that it could turn sour again and that 
we'd still need her blood sibling but we were willing to take the chance so we took her home 
sarah did nothing but continue miraculously recovering every day getting better and better 
she grew up to be a giant beautiful adult gibbon she is so sweet and loving her nature 
is the sweetest of any gibbon i've ever known when we had other monkeys come to 
the zoo she would baby them and take care of them and hold them as if she was their mother 
i know in my heart of heart that my et friends helped her there's no way that they couldn't 
have the vets all kept saying to us that they don't understand why she recuperated like that 
and why she has never ever ever had another recurrence or relapse today sarah now lives in 
another state and she's very happy living with her family she's very well taken care of and she is 
still in excellent health and is doing wonderfully she's probably going to live a good long life 
so wow I mean that's an incredible case in which a gibbon was cured of leukemia 
and the doctors just could not figure it out and dolly is absolutely convinced that her e.t friends 
who are mostly greys healed sarah of her leukemia so I wrote about most of these cases in my 
book and many other cases for that matter in my book the healing power of ufos 
i wanted to do this video because I think this shows a very positive side to extraterrestrials 
and that not only people are being healed but animals too as we have seen a variety of animals 
dogs horses birds apes couldn't find any other cases involving other animals you know such as 
cats or what have you so overall it appears that this might be pretty rare 
but i'm guessing that most cases involving animal healings go unreported 
perhaps because they are so incredible and of course animals are not able to communicate their 
healing either but there are enough cases I think that this is clearly something that does happen 
and uh it's something I think we need to watch out for and again shows that et's are not only 
healing people but are healing animals too 
and again these eight cases i'm sure are only the tip of the iceberg so it's a wonderful 
uh sort of aspect to ufo encounters that does not get enough attention in my opinion so that's 
the eight cases I wanted to present to you uh I want to thank you again very much for watching 
i really appreciate it and I hope you enjoyed this video and until next time keep having fun
