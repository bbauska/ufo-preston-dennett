May 16, 2021
Do you believe that there are unknown creatures lurking in the depths of our lakes and oceans? The answer of course is, yes! Mainstream science discovers new species each year. And yet, some creatures still remain very elusive. Among these are lake monsters and sea serpents. Lakes and oceans across the United States and the world contain mysterious creatures that have yet to be identified by scientists. And the state of California is filled with them.

California alone has several lakes which have produced many reports of strange lake monsters. And you may be surprised to hear that the California coast is one of the leading producers of sea serpent reports in the world. These reports have been occurring for more than 100 years and yet, nobody knows what they are!

This video presents the baffling but true stories of several lakes in California which are believed to contain strange creatures. Lizzie of Lake Elizabeth, Elsie of Lake Elsinore, Hodgee of Lake Hodges, Tessie of Lake Tahoe...and more! Most startling are the dozens of reports of giant sea serpents up and down the California coast. Many of these reports are extremely well-verified, coming from highly credible witnesses who have put their sterling reputations on the line by coming forward with their own eyewitness accounts.

What do these creatures look like? How big are they? How often are they seen? The answers might surprise you. One thing seems certain, very large creatures exist on our planet that have yet to be discovered and identified.

High strangeness is at your fingertips. Are you ready to have your own encounter with the unknown? If you would like to explore more about lake monsters, sea serpents and other strange mysteries in California, check out "Supernatural California: A Golden State Guide." Your adventure is waiting!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal today I have something different for you i'm going to talk about cryptozoology the 
name of today's episode is called lake monsters and sea serpents california has a number of lakes 
in which unexplained creatures have been sighted and also all along the california coast there have 
been reports of gigantic sea serpents so that's what I want to talk about today and the first 
case i'd like to talk about is actually lizzy of lake elizabeth lake elizabeth is located about 17 
miles west of palmdale on elizabeth lake road this is a rather small lake it's not very deep 
but has many reports of an unexplained creature first reports stretch back to about 1780 
when spanish explorer junipero serra named the lake la laguna diablo 
because native americans in this area said that a dragon like creature lived in the lake 
among the first actual eyewitnesses to report unusual activity was a rancher by the name of don 
pedro carrillo who reportedly abandoned his ranch in 1830 after a mysterious fire burned down his 
property and he felt like the lake was actually cursed by the devil in 1855 american settlers 
moved into the area but they also reportedly abandoned it saying that it was haunted 
so the first recorded sightings occurred around that time rancher don chico lopez 
and two others observed quote a huge monster with bat like wings emerge from the lake 
don lopez had been actually losing his livestock regularly and now it seemed he knew why 
so he actually sold his ranch at a loss and the property was purchased by another rancher 
by the name of miguel leonis who also claimed to see the creature and in 1886 
yet another rancher don felipe rivera also reported seeing this gigantic reptilian creature 
so again this lake is not very deep and in fact it has dried up completely during 
a number of droughts some researchers believe that these reports may actually pertain to lake 
hughes which is the larger lake very close by about five miles away but that's when the 
reports uh seem to end there are a few scattered but unsubstantiated modern day reports uh but 
it's really hard to say perhaps the creature has you know remained hidden or maybe it passed away 
uh possibly it moved locations as there are rumors of similar sightings in nearby other lakes such as 
a nearby small lake called sag pond which also goes by other names including una lake or lake 
la rouge lamar or the bottomless lake so this particular body of water again 
is located in palmdale along the sierra highway so that's the story of lizzie of lake elizabeth 
another lake which reportedly had a lake monster is lake lagunas and I call this 
segment old bob of lake lagunas so california has a number of lakes involving unknown creatures 
scattered reports of unknown creatures have been come from the blue lakes east of ukaya and from 
clear lake in northern california but it's lake laguna which has had a number of reports this is 
located in fullerton in southern california it's a seven acre lake and there's been a number of 
reports largely unsubstantiated of a large unknown prehistoric looking creature lurking in its depths 
these reports stretch back at least 40 years and people the locals call it old bob 
and eyewitnesses say that it has a huge head which would peak above the surface of the lake for 
just seconds before diving down beneath the surface and these were pretty much 
rumors for a very long time until september 9 2004 when the rumors were proven to be true 
turned out that workers were hired to pull fish from the lake and they captured something very 
unusual in their fishing nets the lake at the time was undergoing a two million dollar renovation 
which involved dredging the entire lake and when the workers pulled up their nets the last thing 
they expected to find was old bob but there he was tangled in the net the lake monster of 
lake laguna and it turned out to be nothing other than a giant alligator snapping turtle 
so alligator snapping turtles are the largest of all freshwater turtles in north america 
and they can get huge they can grow up to about 250 pounds and live longer than 100 years 
but they are only native to south and the south and the east coast and they're actually illegal 
in california old bob weighed about 100 pounds and scientists estimated his age at about 50 years old 
he had the characteristic huge head and worm-like tongue a hooked beak and a three-foot diameter 
ridge-like shell so how he got into the lake remains a mystery officials speculated that 
perhaps he was a pet that grew too big for his pond and the owner just dumped him into the lake 
so sharon paquette she was the vice president of the orange county chapter of the california turtle 
and tortoise club and according to her alligator snapping turtles have changed very little since 
the age of dinosaurs and as she says I quote no wonder folks get excited it's an awesome sight to 
see what looks like a prehistoric creature old bob is dangerous these are powerful animals a human 
could lose a foot or fingers so because old bob uh was living in lake laguna illegally he was carted 
away and taken to a refuge on the east coast uh where he as far as I know still remains today 
but there is a lesson to be learned from old bob I think that the fact that a creature of his size 
remained undetected in the lake for so long lends credence to the other reports 
of lake monsters that have remained undetected in the larger california lakes for example 
lake elsinore and that brings us to our next segment elsie of lake elsinore 
so of course loch ness has the world's most famous lake monster nessie and there are there are hundreds of lakes that actually have lake monsters 
but lake elsinore is just one of many and it's got a very famous lake monster by the name of elsie
the town of lake elsinore was actually built around the lake and is the area's main industry 
mostly tourism and recreation thousands of people flock each year to lake elsinore to enjoy its 
fresh waters so it's entirely possible that a large unknown creature has remained undetected 
and the fact is reports stretch back well over a hundred years the first reports of a monster in lake elizabeth come from the pi aceh native americans 
who told visiting spaniards that their lake lake elsinore uh contained a gigantic monster 
they called it a tenvo moma and that was the name of the lake and they believed that this 
very large creature lived inside of it and that it could belch steam and even fire 
much like a dragon so some people speculated that perhaps this was hot springs which would 
belch out you know hot gases but I don't think that that really explains what people are seeing 
because the first reports of this lake monster stretch all the way back to 
1884 in terms of eyewitnesses there was a rancher by the name of mr c.b 
greenstreet he and his family were on the lake when they saw a creature which they described 
as about 100 feet long with a 30 foot long tail and it scared the daylights out of them as soon 
as it saw them it quickly swam off with at such high speed that it created a 10 foot wave awake 
this family the green streets were so upset by the setting they refused to ever go back to lake elsinore again so for many years there weren't any well verified sightings 
but throughout the 60s and 70s there was a whole rash of pretty well verified sightings 
in 1967 a family was boating on the lake and they saw a strange creature it had several humps which 
rose above the surface of the lake three years later in 1970 a witness by the name of bonnie play 
said that she saw the creature twice and that it was at least 12 feet long and had a dinosaur-like 
appearance in 1971 a man by the name of bill ware from henderson nevada was visiting the lake 
uh with his wife they were water skiing she was water skiing and he saw a strange creature 
following her it scared them both pretty badly actually and throughout the 1970s there were 
a number of sightings at least three of these sightings come directly from park officials who 
said that they saw a weird creature they could not identify they also said it was about 12 feet long 
what they saw and they could see three or four humps sticking out of the water and these humps 
had weird spikes along the top of it so again you get this sort of weird dinosaur like description 
uh another one this is sam daniels and he had a pretty clear sighting and i'd just like to quote 
his sighting directly as he says as I stood at the water's edge I could see a very large swirl on top 
of the water suddenly it came my way thinking that it was one of the big fish I was startled to see 
what looked like a very large lizard coming at me I was scared but also amazed at what I saw 
it swam back and forth in front of me no more than 20 feet from me and there were no humps on the on the back humps to the back feet from me it had huge 
round black eyes its skin was very dark green with black spots on it I couldn't see any teeth 
it made no sound at all but suddenly it dove when it came up it had a very large carp in its mouth 
and that's how I noticed the teeth more like what a lizard would have when it swallowed the carpet dove again and it never came back I never told anyone 
about it because they wouldn't have believed me anyway but I did tell a few people years later 
researcher brent swanser looked into this and he actually interviewed a couple of first-hand 
eyewitnesses in 1993 according to brent he talked to a kayaker who says his kayak 
was actually nudged by a strange creature which he said reminded him of a whale so very large 
and in 1994 a fisherman according again to brent swanser hooked a fish and was pulling it out of 
the lake when suddenly he saw it and it was not a fish it had a head like a very large alligator 
and as soon as it came out of the water the line snapped and this creature dived back beneath the 
surface so yeah there are a number of witnesses as one local writer david allen russell reports and I 
quote there are still many reliable witnesses who claim they have seen the monster following their 
boats under the water late at night terrifying them so much that they headed pell now for 
the banks and beaches as fast as their water vessels could carry them and never came back 
so most people described this as a sort of a serpent-like creature and only a few have 
seen its actual head or face which is described as very much like a snake according to most 
reports with a dog-like snout so what's weird about this particular account lake elsinore has 
actually dried up completely twice in its history dried up completely in 1954 during a bad drought 
so skeptics have concluded that uh any sightings would therefore be impossible 
of course that's hard to say because maybe it did die but it laid eggs and reproduced or 
moved to another area at any rate in the late 1980s a local company poppy graphics 
created a life-size statue of elsie and made the creature the city's official mascot 
more than 200 people donated their time money or supplies to build this fiberglass statue which 
stands about 25 feet high and 100 feet long and is being held captive on lakeland beach where you 
anyone can go and view it so in fact uh there is I mean lake elsinore is open to the public 
it's very popular tourist attraction and there is the elsi museum located on graham 
avenue in lake elsinore if you'd like to learn more about elsie the lake monster 
perhaps the most controversial of california's lake monsters is the lake monster of lake hodges 
this is called [ __ ] the lake monster of lake hodges and yeah it's certainly 
controversial because most of the information about this case comes from a single website 
but of course the locals know all about uh the [ __ ] the lake monster and it's quite the topic 
of conversation lake hodges is a rather large lake uh it's about 1 200 acres it's got 27 miles of 
shoreline it's a long thin winding lake it's about 115 feet deep and its waters are filled by the 
del dios river which has run through this valley for 40 000 years so that's certainly long enough 
for a lake monster to have arrived there lake hodges used to be a much smaller lake 
but was actually enlarged through a project involving a dam it was regarded for many many 
years by the local kumem yay native americans as sacred in fact on the south side of the lake 
they created a sacred site to honor the area it's called piedras pintadas or painted rocks 
and it's still considered sacred to the native americans but in 1916 colonel ed 
fletcher convinced the santa fe railroad to create a dam at the western edge of the lake 
the native americans protested and for the first time they said that there was a lake monster an 
unknown creature which actually guarded the lake the union railroad went ahead and built this dam 
anyway and after two years the dam was completed and the lake was tripled in size so the first 
modern reports of [ __ ] date back to about 1921 when fishermen from san diego and local fishermen 
reported seeing a large disturbance in the water and these reports continued for about two years 
in 1923 events began to escalate two mines near the lake had been in operation for years 
but four days apart both of the mines were vandalized heavy rock extraction equipment 
had been toppled over and partially crushed and the two mine owners blamed each other 
police were brought in to investigate but no conclusions could really be drawn because there 
were no footprints and people then began to speculate that perhaps [ __ ] was responsible 
in 1925 the city of san diego purchased the lake for 490 thousand dollars and the area was turned 
into a recreational and fishing area and this is when reports of [ __ ] really began to increase 
and by 1921 the reports have become so numerous that reportedly the mayor of escondido 
was receiving pressure from local citizens to take action and he requested the san diego mayor mayor 
harry c clarke to fund an official investigation and he agreed and reportedly the scripps 
institute of oceanography did an official investigation in 1930 and according to this 
website the lake [ __ ] website found conclusive evidence of lake uh of [ __ ] in lake hodges 
one researcher assistant reported his own sighting he said he was out on the lake when he saw a large lizard-like head protruding from the water in 1931 a small boat was docked along the pier 
it was mysteriously destroyed police were called in to investigate and again there was no evidence 
of any culprit found but there was evidence of a quote great turmoil under the water along 
the base of the pier from a boat perhaps or an underwater vessel or perhaps a large creature 
so at this point thomas w vaughan who was the director of the scripps institute headed 
a project which involved the construction of a large metal cage it was the size of a small house 
to try and capture this creature and in 1932 this cage was submerged into the lake and a small 
sea lion was secured inside as bait along with several glass cameras inside of glass containers 
so the trap was complete and a short time later the cage was raised up and investigators were 
amazed to see that the bait had been taken but the trap remained unsprung they checked the cameras 
and at least one of these cameras captured a intriguing photograph which appears to show the 
shape of a large underwater creature this photo was digitally enhanced and appears to show sort 
of a dinosaur looking shape with a long snake-like neck and a head a large thick body and wide flat 
fins so further attempts were made to capture this creature but this ended up in smashed cameras and 
[ __ ] apparently uh destroyed them uh so the project itself uh ran into problems when people 
began to protest that sea lions were being used as bait and in 1933 the project was canceled 
but reportedly they continued to study the possibility of a creature in this lake in 
1941 scientists from the scripps institute reportedly received funds from the united states 
navy's office of naval research they placed a portion of the lake off limits to to people 
and placed a huge length of tripwire at a depth of 12 feet attached to a large rack of cameras and on 
the there was no activity but on the third month the tripwire was activated and the most famous 
photo of [ __ ] was taken which shows a very large hump protruding from the water 
so around this time world war ii started to come along and all research was stopped but sightings 
continued in 1956 the lake became overcome by carp and officials decided that the only solution was 
to kill all the fish entirely in the lake and they poisoned the entire lake with rhodon a very highly 
toxic chemical and this caused them almost all the fish to affixiate and they then restocked the lake
some people thought hey they were just actually trying to kill uh [ __ ] but uh 
it's unknown for sure of course the lake was then reopened to the public and everyone assumed 
that [ __ ] had been killed but reports began to surface again in 1966 two family families 
were picnicking along the shore and when about 50 yards offshore a large creature surfaced 
seven people saw it one person snapped a photo which appears to show a dark hump 
protruding from the water on 1985 the dam keeper morgan a tidwell held a press conference in which 
he announced that [ __ ] was in fact a real creature of an unknown species which inhabited 
the lake and sightings of [ __ ] have continued to the present day and are reportedly being 
studied by the lake hodges scientific research center at least according to this 
website and in 1999 cameras were set up along the shore trying to catch a photo of [ __ ] and 
as far as I know it hasn't been successful there's very few good explanations to account 
for this weird creature because the fish I mean the lake does can tune contain a lot of fish 
but they're all pretty small there's largemouth bass crappie bluegill catfish bullhead and carp 
but none big enough to really account for [ __ ] uh itself but uh haji's lake hodges is a big lake 
and some fish that have been caught from this lake are very large of size in fact 
in uh 1985 the second largest bass ever recorded up to that time 
caught in the united states was pulled out of lake hodges by a fisherman by the name of gene 
du pros and this bass weighed about 20 uh 25 pounds so although it's large it's nowhere big 
enough to account for [ __ ] so yeah lake hodges is a very popular tourist attraction to this day 
it's got picnicking boating windsurfing horseback riding mountain biking all kinds of uh activities 
and uh also has a little museum this lake is located about 31 miles north of san diego 
and uh again is probably one of the most controversial uh accounts of a lake monster 
because while the locals do talk all about it and there's a statue of it the conclusive evidence 
that it's still there remains elusive uh that brings us along to our next account which is 
the lake monster of lake tahoe who's also known as tessie so tessie of lake tahoe is actually a very 
well verified lake monster lake tahoe is a beautiful alpine lake it's a freshwater 
lake located in central california right along the nevada california border it's an enormous 
tourist attraction bringing in thousands of water sport enthusiasts each year skiers snowboarders 
in the summer of course I mean in the winter but uh yeah it has its own lake monster and unknown 
to many people lake tahoe is actually very deep it's the second deepest lake in the united states 
and has a depth of at least sixteen hundred feet and uh reports of a lake monster 
stretched back a very long time well over a hundred years ago uh reports began around the 
time that american settlers first started arriving at the lake and have continued to the present day 
and like other california lake monsters the first witnesses were actually native americans including 
the washoe and the paiute tribes in the mid 1800s the two tribes often fought over the right to hunt 
and fish in the lake and both of these tribes had legends of a lake monster that lived in the waters 
they held sacred meat sacred meetings at a large cavern called cave rock which is located above 
another large underwater cavern and is supposedly the lair of tessie of lake tahoe so the first 
actual sighting from modern times occurred in 1897 when a man by the name of icy coggin said he saw a 
giant creature with a huge head and giant eyes but it wasn't until 1930 when a series of sightings 
revived these legends i'll call them and people began to take reports of tessie 
much more seriously and over the years reporting became so numerous that a museum was actually 
created to document the history of tessie and this museum is full of tessie souvenirs and newspaper 
clippings of various sightings unfortunately the museum was recently shut down but tessie 
is braver than most lake monsters and has made regular appearances throughout the years in the 
summer of 1979 a visiting couple was absolutely convinced that they had observed a sea serpent 
off of tahoe vista and they reported their account to newspapers in 1984 there was a 
series of highly publicized sightings by various witnesses from different locations on the lake 
and in 1985 a tourist to the lake saw the creature and shot several frames of footage showing a 
large something a creature swimming through the lake officials tried to downplay the sightings 
and even reportedly attempted to suppress the film perhaps one of the best verified sightings 
comes from a gentleman by the name of jean saint dennis and his friend who are walking along the 
beach near cave rock and as saint denis says we saw a blotchy grey creature about 10 to 15 feet 
long it turned a corner and produced a v-shaped wake in front of it at this point the creature 
surfaced briefly and then plunged back into the lake and this was not jean's only sighting
it was uh some years later he actually makes a living at the lake uh he's the owner of 
the blue ribbon fishing and tahoe trophy trout and so he spends a lot of time on the lake and 
this puts him in the perfect position to have another sighting and his next encounter would be much more dramatic he was swimming along the shoreline with another friend when suddenly the 
water exploded underneath them and when it finally calmed down they saw what they described as a 16 
foot long snake-like creature slithering away and looking down below them in the water they waited 
as as he says and I quote we waited for the silt to settle and found large fin prints where the 
creature had been so he's found other bits of evidence throughout the years twice when he was 
reeling fish into his boat something attacked the fish leaving what looked like enormous teeth marks 
as he says and I quote about halfway to the boat these fish and they were big fish got raked 
the holes left by the teeth were big enough to put a pencil into so there are skeptics and debunkers 
skeptics claim that tessie could be just an unusual or rare fish and one popular explanation 
is that the tessie is actually a sturgeon which can get huge and weigh up to 1500 pounds 
and can get up to 20 feet long and live for get this more than a hundred years 
another possible candidate is a muskie this is a large aggressive fish which can reach a length of 
eight feet however both of these explanations are not without their problems for one thing 
sturgeons do not have teeth and neither musky or sturgeons have ever been caught in lake tahoe 
uh and the reports you know the descriptions of this being describe a much longer serpent-like 
creature some of these reports say about 60 feet long and very snake-like with dark skin 
and reptilian features so it does not appear to be a sturgeon or a muskie 
there have been scientific studies in 1984 charles goldman a professor at davis university came to 
study the accounts and he gave a lecture on the topic and he was not convinced he gave a very 
sort of ridiculous explanation saying that what people are actually seeing is just colliding boat wakes which produce a series of waves and it's just an optical illusion 
i don't believe that explanation for a second there's far too many witnesses for example in 1988 
a story in the san francisco examiner described a number of sightings one by an eye doctor one 
involving two police officers another involving two nuns another involving several postal workers 
so most of the people who have seen tessie believe it's exactly what she appeared appears to be 
an unknown unidentified species according to researcher sherry louise 
testy sightings that occur at a rate of about a dozen per year or once once a month 
and at one point a tessie phone hotline was established at king's beach this is the former 
site of the tessie museum and unfortunately again funding ran out and the hotline has been
discontinued there was some rumors that jacques cousteau actually conducted a search for tessie 
and successfully located her but decided that not to reveal the discovery because 
the world wasn't ready or perhaps he feared that tessie would be hunted to her death 
so although this is a rumor it's an intriguing one to say the least and tessie has become one 
of the world's best verified or certainly one of the us's best verified lake monsters and in fact 
cryptozoologist lauren coleman cites lake tahoe as one of the top 10 best locations in the world to 
look for a lake monster so those are the reports of lake monsters in california but I have to tell 
you even more impressive are the accounts of a sea serpent off the california coast particularly off 
the coast of monterrey so california has a thousand mile long beautiful coastline 
with some of the most crowded and popular beaches in the world and if sea serpents 
were real you'd expect there to be a number of reports up and down the coast and this is exactly 
what is being being reported these reports of a sea serpent stretch back about 125 years 
and are actually still occur occurring today the first person to really examine sea serpent reports 
in any detail is a cryptozoologist by the name of bernard hewlemans and he studied cases from 
all over the world but focused on the california coast because of the large number of reports 
and as he writes this territory of one type of sea serpent the mained it would 
seem probably stretches all along the west coast of north america at least in the temperate zone
so sea serpents reports have been recorded all throughout the 1910s and 1920s when 
there was a flurry of sightings as far north as san francisco and all the way south to san
but clemente earliest report or even earlier reports have been located by researchers
one of the earliest according to bernard huevelmains occurred on december 21st 1879 
when captain vers versier of the ship granada was sailing along the southern california coast 
off cape san lucas when he and his crew observed a thin-necked serpent-like creature 
rise three feet out of the water and full view of everyone on board uh 
hughelman speculates that perhaps this was either a giant eel or a baby sea serpent 
the ship's second officer said that was not the only sea serpent in this sighting he saw 
another large larger sea serpent eight years earlier off the coast of australia so yeah these 
are seen all over the world and people who are on the water report sometimes multiple sightings 
another sighting occurred on april 5th 1885 when steam passengers off the san francisco coast 
described what they saw as a huge black monster it rose about 10 feet above the water 
had a huge mouth at least four feet wide filled with sharp teeth and a very long tail 
about 60 feet long and this was just the beginning the first reports to really gain widespread 
attention occurred off the coast of southern california along the santa catalina channel 
and starting in 1914 actually numerous local fishermen reported their sighting 
of an enormous sea serpent like creature for the next five years numerous reports uh poured in 
and uh there were so many that it was impossible to pass these off as rumors because some of these 
witnesses were a very high standing for example in 1919 the world famous fisherman ralph bandini 
confirmed all these rumors when he came forward with his own account of having seen this giant 
sea serpent he was an expert big game fisherman and authored three classic books on fishing 
he was the secretary of the tuna club a member of the california fish and game commission a lawyer a 
coastal conservationist and a really good witness and his first sighting of what came to be known 
as the san clemente monster occurred in 1919 off the coast of catalina island when he and his crew 
saw a creature off in the distance rising higher and higher out of the ocean before they could get a closer observation it plunged beneath the surface but that was just 
the first sighting it wasn't long before they had another one year later in september 1920 
bandini and his fishing partner smith warren had an unforgettable close-up sighting it was 
eight o'clock in the morning and they were fishing off the coast of san clemente island 
when this sea serpent made a really dramatic appearance as bandini writes in his own words as 
ralph bandini writes and I quote all of a sudden I saw something dark and big heave up I seized my 
glasses what I saw brought me straight up a great columnar neck and head I guess that is what it was 
lifting a good ten feet it must have been five or six feet thick something that appeared to be 
a kind of main or coarse hair almost like a fine seaweed hung dankly but the eyes those were what 
held me huge seemingly bulging round at least a foot in diameter we swung around it and then 
even as I watched through the glasses the thing sank there was no swirl no fuss just a leisurely 
majestic sinking and it disappeared about a quarter mile away so ralph bandini estimates this 
was larger than a blue whale which is the largest known living animal on earth and why he concluded 
this was because when he was viewing this sea serpent it didn't rise and fall with the waves as 
a whale would have done and instead remained as motionless as a rock and he knew that this meant 
that like an iceberg most of the creature was underwater and must be incredibly huge he later 
cited this creature on two other separate occasions both in the santa catalina channel 
and it was during the same time period that a number of other very prominent witnesses also saw 
this same apparently the same sea serpent george farnsworth was the president of the tuna club 
claimed to have observed this creature and gave an identical appearance as george farnsworth 
says and i'm quoting its eyes were 12 inches in diameter and set on the side like an ordinary fish 
but more central it had a big mane of hair about two feet long we were within a hundred 
feet of it before it went down this was no sea elephant it was some kind of mammal for it could 
not have been standing so long unless it was other witnesses include the former tuna club president 
jimmy jump a millionaire by the name of george c thomas iii uh the inventor of the cox reel 
joe cox and a well-known author of fishing books j charles davis ii and in each case 
these witnesses said that they saw the serpent in the same area the santa catalina channel 
in 1922 a fisherman by the name of sal collette was fishing off moss landing this is in the 
monterey bear bay area in northern california when he saw something floating on the surface 
he thought it was trash or something so he approached it in his boat and saw that it wasn't trash it was in fact a very large sea creature with a huge barrel-like head 
and it this uh shocked him and this thing quickly dived beneath the surface as he approached he had 
another sighting some 16 years later in 1938 and he said it was larger longer than his 45-foot boat 
it had a wrinkled brown skin and an almost human looking face as he approached it it 
appeared to be sleeping on the surface but woke up stared at him with these large round eyes and 
then dived beneath the water he became obsessed with sea serpents after that and spent a lot of 
time trying to prove his sighting unsuccessfully unfortunately but many more witnesses would soon 
see sea serpents off the california coast in 1925 mr e j lear was driving near monterey bay 
when he saw a commotion in the water and he kept watching he was driving along and he saw 
a group of sea lions were actually attacking what appeared to be a 30 foot long snake-like creature 
unfortunately he just kept driving and only viewed this for a few minutes but it was there the entire time so there are definitely some sort of strange creatures 
off the coast hard evidence of this was found in 1925 when the carcass of an enormous creature 
washed up on the beach of santa cruz it was badly decomposed it measured about 36 feet in length 
appeared to have a long slender neck small eyes a large head and a snout a sort of a beaked snout 
and sea serpent enthusiasts were sure that this appeared to be proof at last but the skull was 
examined by scientists from the museum of the academy of sciences the california academy of 
sciences and they determined it to be a rare species of beaked whale which is one which has 
only been seen a few times actually in recorded history and they said the long neck was just 
an illusion caused by the decomposition of the skin separating from the rib cage 
so not everyone degree agrees with this interpretation there was another scientist whose 
identity has not been verified by researchers but his name allegedly was e.l wallace and according 
to him he examined this carcass and said it wasn't a beak but a bill and it couldn't be a 
whale because as he says the backbone of a whale is far larger than any bone in this animal and 
its tail is too weak for an animal of the deep and that does away with the version of a whale 
with a bill like it possesses it must have lived on herbage I would call it a type of pleiosaur
so I don't know that's a controversial report and although the santa cruz creature turned out to be 
a known species it proved that this area does contain a large variety of rare marine animals 
and in fact in 1901 a fish known as an oarfish washed up on newport beach 
uh and on september 25th another oarfish was captured off the coast of malibu happened again on the island of coronado just north of the mexican border an oar fish 
certainly looks like a sea serpent can reach a length of up to 23 feet so maybe that's 
what these people are seeing I don't think so not if you look at the accounts of the 
ralph bandini and george farnsworth and the other witnesses who said that this creature was much 
much larger so what's very interesting about the monterey bay sightings is monterrey bay is a very 
very deep submarine canyon it's one of the deepest areas along the coastal uh the west coast and it's 
been declared a federal marine sanctuary it covers about 5 300 square miles 200 miles along the coast 
and it's the largest marine refuge in the united states some sections of this trench are almost two 
miles deep about nine thousand feet the exact depth is not actually known but is reportedly 
deeper than the grand canyon and it's the deepest underwater trench in north america 
and this area is protected because there's such a huge variety of marine life this bay 
contains at least 340 species of fish 30 species of marine mammals and 116 species 
of birds so it shouldn't be too hard to believe that there might be giant sea serpents here as 
well and the reports were so frequent that this sea serpent at monterey bay was coined 
bobo or the old man of monterey bay so sightings were reported throughout the 1930s 
and 40s and researcher randall reinstat who is an expert on monterey bay sea monsters writes quote 
stories of encounters with frightening monsters and snake-like serpents have circulated throughout 
the monterey bay for countless years and yeah we know the sightings reach back 
about a hundred years they began around 1920 when many fishermen started reporting these sightings 
and at first they were not believed but as more and more fishermen began reporting it 
people started to take these sightings seriously there was one very well verified sighting which 
occurred in september of 1930 when a fishing boat was off point joe this is just south of monterey 
bay and the crew came upon a very large creature eyeing them from a distance of about 80 feet away 
and they were trying to determine what it was when it rose up out of the water to about six feet 
high and they described like many of the other witnesses a human looking head perched on a four 
foot thick neck and just after looking at them for just a few moments this enormous creature 
dived beneath the surface and swam directly underneath the boat and uh the people 
the crew looked down and could see that this was a weird creature that they could not identify it 
had very large fins and a huge tail and it quickly disappeared underwater so another 
witness a monterey resident had a sighting in 1930 the early 1930s he was walking along the shore 
when he saw a creature come out of the water about 200 yards offshore and he says it stuck its 
head out of water to a height of about 12 feet and he described the head as looking very much 
like a giraffe and he saw it for a few moments before this creature dived back in and disappeared 
so at first these reports were largely ignored but in 1938 there was a very well verified sighting when the crew of the ship dante 
aliyeri or algieri were crossing over the deep part of the monterey trench when they 
saw a strange object floating in the water and as they approached they realized this was a creature 
about 30 feet long at least with a fish-like tail and again a surprisingly human-like face 
like other accounts this boat apparently had surprised this creature which was 
dozing sleeping on the surface and as the boat drew alongside the creature it woke up 
looked at the ship and quickly dived back into the water but many of the people on the ship got a 
very good look at this thing and one witness said it had a face like a very old man's or a monkey 
face with eyes twice the diameter of breakfast buns and a mouth like a crescent moon barnacles 
were all over the head and also along the black body folds of white skin hung beneath the neck 
the body was as big around as a pickup truck it must have weighed maybe eight or nine tons 
so this was reported to local newspapers and this is when the sea serpent of monterey 
became established as a real creature another very credible sighting occurred in 1940 to the captain 
and crew of a sardine boat they were sailing across the bay when they saw again a large object floating directly above the monterey trench they approached it and saw that this 
was a creature about 90 feet long and it was sticking up about four feet out of the water 
they circled around the creature which uh turned in the water to sort of keep an eye on this boat 
and like the other witnesses who have seen the sea serpent this creature had a human like head 
a gray brown body about three feet wide and it was in view for a good 10 minutes 
and the captain was considering trying to actually capture this creature when it suddenly plunged beneath the water and disappeared so this sighting marked the beginning of a huge wave of sightings 
and according to researcher mr reinstead in a quote in the late 1940s there was a rash of such 
sightings in the pacific grove monterey and fort ord areas almost to a person witnesses who made 
sightings from shore described the creature as extremely long approximately four feet in diameter 
and multi-humped reports of the coloring indicated the body was either tan or gray the serpent-like 
head was said to have been flat in appearance with eyes like those of an african crocodile 
and according to reinstead the description of the monster or monsters vary but the reports of the 
human-like face were quote remarkably consistent and while some of these reports were from quite 
some time ago they continue throughout the years on november 7th 1946 the descript a report came of 
a sea monster off cape san martin and one of the witnesses described this creature as having a face 
like a gorilla another encounter occurred one morning around dawn in july of 1948 when a 
crew of nine men were sailing at the midpoint of monterey bay directly over the trench when they 
saw bobo and he was bobbing in the water about 175 feet away he rose up out of the water about 
six feet high and again the face looked human-like with a quote flat nose and large blinking eyes the 
sailors in this monster stared at each other for a few moments until one of the crew grabbed a rifle 
and actually opened fire on the creature at which point it quickly disappeared beneath the surface 
so these reports were coming in regularly to local newspapers and the local population 
became absolutely convinced that this these sightings were real according to one resident who 
wrote in the saturday evening post sea monsters have been cited frequently in monterey bay 
california for the past 20 years so common has the occurrence become that fishermen no longer mention 
it with tongue-in-cheek and many are the tales of encounters with the old man of monterey bay 
as it is called locally and length of the creature is estimated to be from 45 to 70 feet
so this is where most of these sea serpent sightings are occurring but again they go all the 
way south to san clemente in his book mysterious sea monsters of california's central coast 
reinstead presents more than a dozen additional sightings ranging up and down the coast most of 
which occurred in the 1930s and 40s but the 1950s brought more reports of this 
mained sea serpent off of san clemente in december of 1950 a postal worker by the name of miss 
opal lambert was working in her office in the summerland resort this overlooks the 
coastal area of the santa catalina channel and she says and I quote I was stamping 
christmas cards when I looked up and saw it swimming in circles about 200 yards offshore 
she called the police but by the time the police arrived the creature had left she had kept it in 
view for about 10 minutes and she estimates that its head and neck rose about four feet 
above the surface of the water it was three years later june 8th 1953 this creature made another 
appearance professional fisherman sam randazzo and his crew of eight men observed the serpent when 
it surfaced right next to their boat as randazzo says we saw the thing estimated that it had a neck 
10 feet long and between 5 and 6 feet thick its eyes were cone-shaped protruding and about a foot 
in diameter they immediately caught called the coast guard and reported their sighting 
and sightings continued october 1954 barney armstrong of his boat the sea fern 
was off the coast of newport beach when he saw a creature that he estimated weighed at least 20 
tons as he says and I quote I spotted the thing sticking up out of the water about four feet high 
he said it had a large round head and a mouth that was about two feet across 
and it was around the same time that an aircraft worker by the name of phil parker and his friend 
an architect grant king they were fishing off the coast of la jolla which is not far away 
when they saw an enormous sea creature surface about 50 feet away from their boat 
they watched it for 25 minutes and said that it had a face and shoulders like a gorilla as phil 
parker says it wasn't a whale and it wasn't a sea lion and it sure didn't look like a snake 
so sightings continued throughout the 1970s and 80s there was more reports of a serpent-like creature in the san francisco bay area in october november of 1983 
witnesses saw what they described as a dark eel like creature swimming up and down the coast 
and some of the witnesses were actually able to observe this through binoculars a very well verified sighting occurred on october 31st 1983 when a construction crew working on the 
golden gate bridge above stinson beach looked down in the water and saw a hundred foot long 
creature swimming along the shoreline another trucker who's in the area also observed this 
one of the construction workers marc rato reports that this creature was about five feet thick and 
could move through the water very quickly and he said it was actually being followed by a large 
flock of birds and a school of about two dozen sea lions who were perhaps trying to uh capture 
some of the fish being brought up by the wake of this sea serpent according to mark rato this 
creature lifted its head and neck up out of the water and he could also see several humps 
also coming out of the water behind it they reported their sighting to the local newspapers 
and after they reported numerous other witnesses in the area also reported seeing this creature 
another recent sighting occurred on february 5th 1985 off stone tower point in the san francisco 
bay two brothers robert and william clark saw two seals swimming frantically across the bay 
and looking behind the seals they saw what they described as a gigantic quote snake-like creature 
and it was propelling itself by forming its body into humps and moving them up and down 
and they also noticed small fins along its side the creature quickly moved away 
their brothers were absolutely astonished and posted themselves as lookouts hoping to see it 
again and their patience was rewarded a few weeks later when the sea serpent returned and they got 
another sighting and since then they said that they've observed this creature several times 
and uh have also found many other witnesses who have also seen it so yeah it appears that sea 
serpents are real have been regularly seen up and down the california coast for nearly a century 
we're still waiting for the conclusive footage for someone to capture this on film uh and that hasn't come yet but i'm hoping it does because the reports of a 
giant sea serpent sticking its head five or ten feet out of the water with a human-like face 
and a mane and eyes as big as dinner plates and a mouth two feet long filled with sharp 
teeth well that would be something to see for sure and I for one am looking forward to it 
so yeah that's my show for today there are unknown lake monsters in several lakes in california and 
definitely dozens upon dozens of reports of a sea serpent up and down the california coast 
that have yet to be explained as any known creature so once again I want to thank you 
all for watching I hope you've enjoyed this episode and until next time keep having fun.
