we have Ashley Taylor as well so thanks guys yeah I'm super excited we have a really great 
guest I've known him for a while uh and he is quite accomplished let me just get to 
his bio here so I don't want to miss anything because he does have a very interesting bio 
tonight we are welcoming Earl Gray his full name is actually Earl Gray Anderson 
and he is a UFO experiencer uh a mufon field investigator and actually the mufan state 
director of Southern California and a mufan star team member so he's part of the Emergency Response 
Team if there is a case that's taking place he gets notified and rushes to it with a team 
of expert investigators and trust me when I say that to become a mufon field investigator you do 
have to go through some training and a big test I took the test we can certainly talk about that 
with Earl but Earl has wear as many hats mufan by the way is the world's largest citizen UFO study 
group it's got chapters and pretty much every state of the United States and offices all over 
the world a lot of really great people in mufan and uh Earl as I said wears many hats he's also a 
singer songwriter and a guitarist and a retired but still licensed vocational nurse Dolly wow
so Earl has been researching the UFO phenomenon for many years and get this has investigated 
nearly 1 000 cases for mufa that's a lot he is not quite up to a thousand but I think it's 
970 something if if I read correctly but he's definitely a sought after speaker and presenter 
for many podcasts and conventions and even television it's been on all kinds of podcasts 
and radio shows but wasn't television shows too including unidentified with Demi Lovato 
I think that was pretty short-lived unfortunately but I'm really glad she came out as an experiencer 
but also on I want to believe uh mufon and UFOs the proof is out there and of course 
the big one Ancient Aliens he's also spoken at alien Khan and many mufon symposiums and 
in fact hosted the experiencer workshop at the 2022 mufon Symposium in Denver Colorado 
he is one of very few full-time ufologists out there so that alone is hugely significant and 
I love what Earl said here and I just want to give a short quote because Earl says that the 
experience of phenomena is the Beating Heart of ufology 100 degree this is the core of the whole 
phenomena this is where the truth lies and as Earl says and I quote if we wish to understand 
this phenomenon we need to listen to those who have had face-to-face encounters end quote I love 
that I often say that everything we know about UFOs comes from One Source not governments not 
commentators not scientists who've never had an enconer and frankly don't even do their research 
it comes from the people who've had experiences and of course from investigators who talk to them 
so I'm super excited about that Earl lives with his wife and two cats in Los Angeles 
California we've got some of his links in the description there but let's just bring him on 
because he has quite a story to tell let me see boom there we go hi guys it's only one 
cat now but it leaves my cat four I know our other cat passed away well around this time 
year sadly but anyway Thor Thor was making himself known he he he whenever I do a podcast 
or radio or something he he starts crying and and meowing he has to come in here so
a good boy thought you know computer over there but um anyway thank you so much for having me you guys and 
uh yeah it's a honor and a pleasure so yeah and Thor's welcome to come on too if Dora wants to 
thank you you missed missed one little bit of my my my uh you know I've got a few but 
um I'm at I'm also a uh executive committee member of mufon's experiencer resource team the 
ERT uh and and what you said about the the experience or phenomenon being the Beating 
Heart of ufology that's absolutely they're not here to do air shows folks there there there's 
something much more important going on uh than just showing off Cosmic hot rods so 
um there's you know contact is is what it's all about and there's interaction going on 
very cool yeah well I love that you said that because you know that's is where we get the 
truth about UFOs there's so much speculation and frankly as you know disinformation uh so that's 
I think we're where we need to start looking to see the people are having encounters so yeah I'm 
so glad and I'm excited to talk to you because you know I've been a move on field investigator 
I've worked not nearly as many as cases as you I started going pretty much independent 
but I love mufan I've spoken at let's see Arizona muffon about four or five of the California 
muffons and that's where I first met you I met you 2015 at the uh the mufon Symposium I had read 
your Topanga UFO book I believe at that point I had read a couple and uh it was all thrilled to 
meet Mr Preston Dennett I caught your presentation there and everything so so they're Fanboy you know
stop stop embarrassing me you're the one who's actually super accomplished as a professional 
how many books have you written now I'm impressed I'm still you know found out my first one you know
it's a brand new one yeah fantastic yeah thanks and get a Shameless shout out hi strangeness 
so you can do that it's our show so it was just absolutely absolutely you have to write a book at 
one of these points too I am working on one right now I've got one probably about two-thirds of the 
way through and and the main thing is editing together all the pieces in a readable form where 
it's you know cohesive coherent and hopefully eloquent and and hopefully you know uh adds adds 
to the uh the the literature of of ufology as such you know I mean I have high standards I mean my 
guys are Jacques valet and and doctor you know uh Dr J Allen heineck and uh yeah but but you know I 
mean it's uh it's an ever-evolving uh phenomenon and and field and and uh the best way to find out 
what's going on is to go Hands-On so move on I took to it like a fish to water you know you 
can't go to college to learn this stuff I mean you can take my college class over at Otis College of 
Art and Design I do teach an accredited course in ufology over uh next to LAX at Otis I know I the 
last time I we talked to you and you mentioned that I forgot to ask you but you won't get a 
degree that says ufologist though unfortunately you get a credit for my class yeah that's coming 
at some point I think it will honestly I hope so yeah and that is so cool that you actually 
have an accredited course because this should be taught in schools because I can it's a new new day 
I mean I was absolutely shocked I mean it knocked me over finding out this was real because it never 
was mentioned in schools and in the media it was pretty much ridiculed and uh the only show I ever 
saw that ever covered this at all was in search of and Saturday Night Live they did make some fun
I can't read the comments otherwise I have I have two fields of vision sorry about that 
excuse me okay yeah my wife will sometimes kid me she'll you know the Saturday Night 
Live skit where you know well yeah they took me and they did this and they did you know 
we hope we don't sound like that we probably do to people that aren't in the know you know um yeah 
somebody sent in a somebody to send in a question yes I'm state director for Southern California our 
state's so big that we divided in half so since I I my cases go from San Diego the border with 
Mexico up to Central California and around frel area uh my dear friend uh Ruben uriarte 
is is state director for Northern California Reuben is a great guy and we're dear friends so 
we work together and you have to stay in touch sometimes because sometimes you'll have a flap 
or something's going on where you know it's not like our visitors recognize borders of any sort
I love Reuben oh great guy Susan says great book each experience her experiences chapter 
19. thank you Susan your story is so awesome it deserves to be well known 
so sorry I had to jump that in there so yeah I know Earl you've had a lot of experiences 
investigating but I'm always curious about how someone gets involved in this field and have 
they had their own experiences and having talked to you I know you've had some but I'm wondering how early did it begin and what brought you into this field wow you you are opening up Pandora's 
Box it's a good thing this is a two-hour show um well okay the way it kind of started for me I 
always seemed to have this propensity and love for outer space the first thing I remember you know 
is being like a little you know under five years old drawing uh control panels for a spaceship and 
Scotch taping them to my bedroom wall you know and it's like we're gonna go to Jupiter now you know 
and uh I remember climbing up the swing set that my dad built you know you'd build things 
back there and built this beautiful wooden swing set that monkey bars so I climbed up to the top of 
this thing and I was up there singing and waving at the sky and my mom was looking through the 
kitchen window this was in Venice California yes I am a native of Southern California 
um but she uh I remember this really well actually uh I was up there singing and waving 
and I remember who I was singing and waving to uh but it's like who are you singing and 
waving to Earl and I just said the space people Mom I'm singing and waving to the space people 
um and here it's you know 60 years after I'm kind of doing the same thing you know at that 
point that's about four and a half or so so you know around four maybe it's it's 
an early memory but I have a good memory why are you waving to the space people at age four 
I I honestly don't know I think I wanted to know them you know I think I wanted to know them 
um now my my mom had an interesting history and it wasn't who my mom worked for was no mystery 
all right the family knew about this and be talked about and stuff that she was actually one of Howard hughes's secretaries uh he had a couple of secretaries here you know over by 
Otis College it's kind of ironic that I teach a class there because it's Howard Hughes Parkway right there and the old Hughes aircraft facility was was on that that that road 
um so but everybody we all knew that and when I was born my mom uh tried to become a housewife 
which later on she she got bored and she wound up be it Hunter for aerospace companies and she was 
getting rocket scientists uh down to broom pushers for some places like the Rockwell Science Center 
here in uh Newbury Park Thousand Oaks area she literally got the people pushing brooms to the 
astrophysicists to the rocket scientists over there but um when I was five years old my mom uh 
it was it was just it was breakfast and our cheery little yellow painted kitchen in Venice 
California I remember it was just like a normal day I think I was having cereal or something 
and my mom sat down and she started talking to me in a weird way she was talking to me 
as though I were another adult and if this really it got my attention I 
mean she wasn't speaking in like a parental Voice or anything it was it was very strange 
and she told me a story she said well son you know that I worked for Howard Hughes but 
um what people don't know is is that I used to work for him in a very strange place 
and she talked about how they sent her out to the middle of nowhere with a little security detail 
and she said it was the Great American desert and she never she never expounded upon that she didn't 
tell me whether you know I've I've thought maybe Area 51 I've spoken to Richard souter about it and 
Hughes did have a facility back in the 1950s at Area 51 which I find interesting Richard solder 
is the guy who wrote that book underground bases yes underground bases and we're gonna get we're 
gonna go there it might have been New Mexico White Sands I think just in my own research and stories 
I've heard from other people the children of uh people that had worked there told a very similar 
story to what my mom told me but she said that they didn't tell her where she was going they 
took her out to the middle of nowhere and she said there was this concrete Shack it was very low slung to the ground and she was wondering why they took her all that way to go and look at 
tools or a tractor you know she didn't know what could possibly be interested in there um but they 
unlocked everything and they took her in there and there was an elevator she actually said it was an Otis Elevator like you'd see in a skyscraper but this thing only went one direction it went it 
went down I guess it went up too but there weren't floors above the ground floor so she got in this 
thing and she said that she thought that maybe it would go down maybe a floor or two or three 
it kept on going it kept on going and I guess it had some speed to it and she she used the word 
um I felt butterflies in my stomach and I felt scared because this it just kept on dropping down 
um she said that the doors opened up and there was a little city under the desert as her very words she said it was a little city under the desert now mind you this is 
1955. that's before I was born I'm 65 years old all right I'm aging myself I'm proud of it okay
there you go yeah good good music that we grew up that's right yeah 1958. 
so um but anyway she said that they got around in little golf carts that there were lots of German 
rocket scientists that worked down there um she mentioned uh that they had little cafes and they 
tried to make people feel at home apparently they stayed there long periods of time um she 
said that she had a guy they had a barber shop but she said that the barber could actually perm 
her hair and do her hair for her now she never mentioned how long she was working down there 
figure well if she had to have her hair done it must have been you know longer than a day or two 
um she's the they had one little calf they had yellow umbrellas over the table it's like a French 
cafe and then she laughed and she said you don't need an umbrella in the cave but it had umbrellas
a five-year-old and and I I don't think that I was going I think it might have been during 
the summer because I I don't remember being in a hurry to go to school or anything I'd start 
in kindergarten that year um but she talked about how she worked you know she knew Werner Von Braun 
she said I don't think I'm in the conversation but he would come on you know the Wonderful World of 
Color the Disney show you know his color TVs were the new big thing and so it was in color and that 
was the name of the first you know Disney show and uh she you know Werner Von Braun would come 
on and my mom would say that's my friend Werner and she once talked about him a little bit and she 
said well he he used to call me Betty Grace that was my mom's first and middle name put together 
uh almost like a pet name I guess and so she uh but she said he's a Charming Man I got older you 
know and later on I I said you know Mom I don't know how Charming he was he was a Nazi wasn't 
he and and Mom got she almost got kind of mad she said he was not really a Nazi they forced 
him to work for Hitler but he just wanted to go to the Moon um in fact she's she said she 
quoted him once she said uh that that Werner said that we built the Rockets right in Germany but we 
sent them to the wrong planet in other words the V2s crashing down on on Liverpool and such 
so that was you know the after my mom talked under underground base then she kind of at the 
very end of it she said oh by the way UFOs and uh extraterrestrial life are a real thing we already 
know we've already we've already met them um so that's where my interest began as a kid 
I figure maybe it's because my mom would see the way I was because I would sort of 
get like the time life books and I would go straight to the satellite launches and the early asked you know Gemini missions and stuff put them around myself and that's where 
I would play it was my safe little and uh and I think that she recognized from an early age 
that uh there was something different about me that I had this great love for outer space 
um and you know so moving on to you know that was the only time she talked about that she would she 
would mention Werner if you saw him on TV but it was sort of like that was all she wrote for a long long time well did you ever figure out like why she was do you think she was unloading 
like just I need someone to talk to about yes okay you remember did she expect you to remember I mean 
you were five years old oh no no no no okay well okay in fourth grade I was 10 years old 
and we used to do Show and Tell and stuff and uh I remember I went up and I talked about my father's 
landscaping business and people the the other kids were kind of yawning and not very interested so 
then I decided to talk about my mom and what she used to do and I I told my mom's story in front of 
my fourth grade class wow and by the way UFOs are real and we already know there's alien life in the 
universe uh so suddenly the UFO books disappeared from the school library right they've been books
all the time growing up when I was in the fourth grade I opened my mouth in school one day it's 
the first time I ever did it in front of my teacher her name was Mrs Stone and uh I told 
her about NASA and I even said we should go to NASA and see astronauts and talk about the moon 
and what's on the Moon besides astronauts and sure and I went home and told my father about 
it my dad was oh my God and they had to find a way to shut me up so the next thing I know we're all 
on a bus my whole class going to NASA to see NASA to meet astronauts and my dad told me after that 
never again and I was like okay I didn't get anything like that yeah what happened was the other kids started making 
fun of me and they would put the little you know my Martian antennae behind my head you know you 
know alien and UFOs and and it became a problem uh uh you know I was already kind of a weird kid to 
begin with but that just like ramped the whole teasing business up yeah and so my teacher she 
scheduled a parent teacher conference with my mom and it wasn't parent-teacher conference time so I 
you know I was wondering what's going on but uh I went and played in the little playground and it 
was Acacia School in Thousand Oaks California uh where where this whole thing took place 
and uh so I remember my mom was really quiet and she went to the plane retrieved me from 
the swing sets and all that and we're driving home and it wasn't that far we're like you know 
a mile drive or something but she's very very quiet and then she looks at me and she goes son 
I'm not angry at you because you didn't know that it was wrong 
but you can't ever ever ever talk about what I use the little city under the desert or UFOs or or uh 
space people ever again because I wasn't supposed to tell you what I told you it's it's top secret 
and she goes back to driving you know and I'm kind of you know I remember feeling 
like kind of sweaty or you know it was I I didn't know that I I did something wrong 
and my God how did you remember that you were just a baby you were just a baby 
and she said Son you can't talk about it if you talk about that again your mom could go 
to prison your mom is you know I signed things where you know and I I never would have told 
you but I didn't think that you would remember because you were just you were in kindergarten
so the rest of my life was me contact tease I've heard this many times remember stuff all the way 
way back right yeah well I remember this I wasn't a contactee until I become until I joined mufon 
I mean that was way later on I think that they were always around okay I think that 
probably they you know I mean I was constantly trying to get my mom to talk more as I got older 
um when I was uh late in my teens I had like kind of a yeah a Christian rebirth and and I 
was actually planning on becoming a minister and then I didn't want to hear about it okay 
because I didn't really have room for aliens in my Pantheon but um now I found something out from 
Richard souter he said that a lot of the people that worked in the early dumps which is a deep underground military base a lot of those people wound up with recurring cancers uh now I'm not 
sure if this is because they built them near the Trinity site and where they were doing all the nuclear testing or perhaps they were using uh you know a nuclear pile to to to make the place run 
I mean I'm sure it was off the grid you know you don't run a City off of the usual electric company 
that you got you know but um it was around 1977 and my mom had a cancer skier again um she had 
already had a total hysterectomy shortly after I was born 1958. she stopped working for Hughes 
when I was born and she was actually working in the the military dumb while she was pregnant 
with me I mean she went at one point said well you were down there too you were in my tummy you know
so but um 1977 she she had a clear cancer screening and uh I I was sort of there as 
her support I was 19 years old and I told my mom uh let's let's go see this new movie this new 
movie just came out it come out two days before this thing called Star Wars Time Magazine did an 
article on it um so we went and saw the film uh I think that we might have been the only people in 
the theater it was before the lines were wrapped around I mean nobody knew about it yet and the 
curtains closed Santa Monica California you know where my mom you know my mom and dad or work you 
know or strange job that she had and apparently learned all this stuff and she started talking 
and for me at that point it was an inconvenient because I didn't want I didn't really have room 
for ETS and my Pantheon it was Jesus and angels and the devil and demons and she's talking about 
she she went into detail she she said well you know son that film Star Wars is not far-fetched 
she said it's really like that out there she said that the different spacecraft and and 
the different beings she said that that's it's really truly like that but they're never going 
to tell the public and I remember I I was almost like la la la I don't I don't want to hear this 
you know it was I I really didn't want to hear it I I actually I if I ever get hypnotically 
regressed I'm not going to go back to my face to face because I remember that but I may go back to 
1977 to retrieve that whole conversation because I know she told me more than what I remember 
um but she she said I I asked her why won't they tell people and she said they're afraid 
of how biblical react uh she mentioned the War of the Worlds radio broadcast and the people 
were barricading themselves and jumping out of Windows and draining their bank accounts and and 
she said that uh they're they're just afraid that it will just cause chaos out there and and there 
it's never going to happen she said they will never ever ever tell the public um but she said 
it's me I told all everybody back then who was working on the ground like that that was their number one set Pat answer it was to cover what was really going on just so you know that that is not 
true they knew we wouldn't react that way but they put that out there because they were causing fear 
yeah yeah I've always wondered when people bring up the war of the world because that was designed to scare people I mean that was oh yeah yeah and it did well now we're hearing from David grush and 
all this that apparently you know we've known that they've been here at least since 1930 so 
um there you go but this was kind of news to me other than you know what I had initially 
heard from my mom when I was five and I really I'll tell you the truth I mean I was I it confused me all right because I had become a amateur astronomer I loved Carl Sagan 
and I you know was reading all the you know the astronomy books and and and was into the Voyager 
spacecraft and all that did you believe in UFOs at this point no no I I decided Arthur arth Clark and 
Isaac Asimov said that it was a bunch of bunk and so I I'd kind of I I didn't understand why 
my mom had said that when I was little now one of my dearest friends ironically now is Paul heineck 
you know he's a very very close friend of mine and he has the correspondence between his father and 
Arthur C Clarke and I found out that Arthur Clark in his correspondence with Jay Alan heineck he he 
said Joseph I really really respect your work and I think there's absolutely something to it 
but I can't ever say that in public because I was invited to another moonshot yeah and others could
terrible his first this is first uh the the first paper he ever wrote in 1962 was 
essentially ancient aliens uh Theory you know he said that instead of looking for radio signals 
like our friend Seth parfum Seth shostak says that you should dig deep and you're eventually 
going to find something that doesn't belong there uh and and apparently Arthur C Clarke one of his 
award-winning stories was the Sentinel which was I think about an alien artifact on the moon but 
there's one just like that on Phobos I've seen that yes that's weird it makes me wonder why do 
you think 2010 happened 22 2010 Space yeah he knew something yeah I think he knew something too I I 
now Robert Heinlein he was a little more uh open about it and and he actually said that he thought 
that UFOs were a real thing he's one of the few guys I mean yes he did azimovic yeah I have 
poo pooed the whole thing Clifford cymac who was really my favorite writer as a young man he wrote 
several UFO articles I had no idea online I'm like oh my God Clifford simack I love Clifford Simon 
he was the head uh the editor of the Milwaukee star when he you know he's a wonderful writer 
and I I think I've read everything that man ever published yeah well I've always loved outer space 
and the and and you know when my mom I got past my my boxed and ideology and and all that and I 
think that I that a part of it maybe was was when I read in my father's house there's there's many 
rooms and and uh C.S Lewis talked about how the light years is uh God's quarantine to keep the 
rest of the universe safe from us and he might not be that wrong you know I mean you look at 
the way we War amongst ourselves and what how barbaric we still are we aren't the only place 
that does that there are a few planets out there that at the same don't doubt it no I'm sure this 
isn't their first rodeo I'm positive I like that statement the corn because it does seem like once 
you reach that level of technology to actually Traverse Interstellar distances you will have 
hopefully reached a level of spiritual and ethical and moral maturity responsibility yeah well we're 
on the cusp of that we're on the cusp of that you know with Elon Musk talking about going you 
know take over Mars I've been into a friend who I can't say that much about who said uh Earl Mars is 
is not for colonizing it's for you guys to learn from you don't want to repeat what happened there 
right it's a dead Planet anyway there's no way it's going to happen he wants to send nukes to 
the polls there to blow them up so that the water you know evacuates into an atmosphere but it'll never happen because it's outgassing it's it's core it's dead it has no magnetos fear 
anything they do will go back out in the space and cause more problems for us because it'll disrupt 
the magnetism from that planet that we do are are affecting one another and mess with us really bad 
so everything that he says in my opinion with knowledge is aceline okay I'm sorry yeah no I 
agree I I started out as a kind of a fan of Elon Musk and I I you know if you'd asked me five years 
ago if I would go to the you know to Mars with Elon musk's group I would have I would have said 
yeah sign me up and now no not so much yeah not so much I mean I want to stay here and try to save 
our world and I hope that we can and that's what I what I I I guess that if I have any core purpose 
in this life maybe that's that's it because if we create uh ripples those can become waves 
and there's such negativity and such desperation right now and everybody's at each other's throats 
everybody's demonizing each other political parties so they're they're it's it's like you hear this talk about Civil War and it's just gone to hell you know thesis and antithesis we are now
it's very disturbing but I I believe that nothing is ever set in stone and I think that we can change things if if we put our heart in that and and if we uh go out there and create 
the ripples that can become waves and hopefully by doing that you know I I mean that's what keeps 
me going every single day you know I mean it's not just yeah it's not just you know I'm not 
in this thing for you know the the cosmic hot rods and and I I love Hot Rods ironically I've 
had a couple of UFO sightings and they felt like teachable moments it was after it had my my own 
face-to-face experience which was very scary in the moment ontological shock plus you know it was 
you could talk about this thing but when you you you experience it uh it it pulls the rug out from 
under you and and there's PTSD involved and you have to throw away your your former views of stuff 
yeah how old were you when that happened it happened recently it happened like eight years ago I had just become a field investigator right um my mom you know I kept trying to get more 
information from her and and and sometimes I'd get a little bit more but she she was working 
in Aerospace she wanted to keep her her uh you know her her uh security clearances and she did 
um I mean I've been told by you know a couple people from the dod since you know I've read your mom's file she did not lie to you and you could be very very proud of your mom she was a patriotic 
woman and she she loved you very much you know one person said she didn't talk much about your 
dad she talked about you and we knew about you yes because her mom I had one guy say your mom 
uh reported on herself after you talked in front of your school you gave like a report or something 
didn't you and it's like oh my God but I guess she was afraid it would get back to him you know yeah 
are you comfortable talking about that encounter Yeah well yeah sure okay I do it all the time
well when it happened I wasn't expecting it to happen and I I had a lot of stuff you know 
presuppositions about what it would be and I I started doing like the meditation thing and 
sending out like the message I wanted to me I want to meet you I'm thinking Valiant for you know or 
I'm thinking the tall whites the the benevolent ones you know and uh I'm I'm thinking uh you know 
take me show me the universe but bring me home yeah in time for breakfast when was this I mean 
when you started to turn around this was I'd been a mufon field investigator for maybe four or five 
months I I was kind of feeling my oats about it I had not gotten unknown yet though it was a bunch 
of ifos and and a few I thought probable UFOs my state director was kind of kind of strict and and 
in in a good way too I mean he wanted to have your you you had to have your ducks in line I'm 
gonna call something uh an actual UFO and and that it was good I mean I have high standards 
too you know I want my field investigators to if they have a case that is an unknown I want 
them to prove it as close to impeccably as possible um I and I've said this many times 
uh I challenge anybody to take any single one of my uh cases that I've closed as an unknown 
uh and uh prove that it's not you know I'm very very punctilious and and careful uh and 
detail-oriented about my cases I think I've got maybe maybe 80 90 cases now maybe closer to 100 
um if if we include my ERT cases you know I definitely have you know many more you 
call yourself an objective Observer researcher correct yeah yeah I mean I certainly have my 
views and My Views and my passions but I also have a kind of strict uh standards that I try 
to hold myself up to okay well you know I do want to hear about your encounter but I'm curious what what inspired you to become a UFO researcher what pulled you in to move on my mom died 
um when my mom died in 1999 um again on her deathbed I mean I was angry because she was 
dying of cancer it was like the sixth time she had it and she she got breast cancer again and 
she didn't have breasts anymore you know she'd had bilateral um you know Mass activities yes 
but but it came back and it went into her lungs and metastasized so she it was maybe she was gone 
maybe a week later but I I told her I said you know we should go get lawyers we should go after 
the government because they obviously didn't protect you you know and my mom's big deal 
um her money used to go to every single year she would go to England and she would flat for 
three months and her Summers would all be spent in England and I think that she considered other than 
you know after paying for you know house mortgage and things like that that was for Mad Money 
and I told her you know trips to England aren't worth your life you you know she was only 73 
years old she was a relatively young woman uh she she was a young woman I mean I'm 65. do the math 
um and my mom said Earl I'm proud of what I did I would do it again I knew the risks involved 
and I would I would do it all over you know it was it was worth it and I did it because 
I love my country um and a week later she was gone she was gone and as long as she was alive 
there was always that chance that I might get the golden ticket that she might just blah you 
know this is what they are like this is who they are this is where they're from this is why they're 
I didn't get any of that yeah I mean she never gave me any she she didn't say they're little gray aliens I'd try to trick her I even brought up Bob Lazar I mean I wasn't real 
UFO Savvy but you know I I like everybody else I'd heard the Bob Lazar you know the 
George Knapp stuff that came out and I asked her I said you know this this Bob Lazar guy sounds 
like somebody that you would have sent out to one of your clients mom uh you know because I 
mean she was you know she was sending people out to the atomic commission and to Rockwell 
and Lockheed and you know I mean she would yuck it up with Ben rich on the phone for 
God's sake everything ridden in shorthand so you couldn't read a darn thing you know 
and uh so I said the the his name's Bob lizard you did you ever hear that guy and she looked 
uncomfortable for a second and then she like looks up and she says Bob laser that's not a real name 
and she puts her glasses back up on her top of her nose and she's back into doing what she was doing 
so uh anyway uh but it was all over in 1999 I I started reading some literature I mean I had read 
some heinek and and I'd read uh I think I had read like some of the contacties stuff you know the 
stuff from from uh giant rock here in in uh Joshua tree and I was just you know I I read whatever 
books were there in the school library that then disappeared you know and I gave my lecture but uh 
um don't ban books you guys anyway um so but when she when she passed away uh I I realized 
I mean I I had to figure it out for myself and it bothered me I kept remembering what she said that 
it's realer than you'll ever know and you know I mean I you know I I I read Corso's book where you 
know I guess Barry Goldwater went and and wanted to see the Blue Room at Wright-Patterson and they 
told him curiosity is not need to know you know never ask me that again uh and I but I felt like 
I had the need to know and and nobody's gonna tell me what it was you know what the answer was 
so after going through the literature I finally decided I need to do this Hands-On somehow 
about that time hayner won TV show started playing on TV I had read a 
mufon kept coming up and book after book after book um and and it seemed like it 
was a scientific organization I mean their their Creed was the scientific study of UFOs 
for the benefit of humanity which sounded like my personal Creed really that's what I wanted 
to do it's like wow you know talk about you know Square Peg and a square role that's me you know 
so I looked up uh my my uh then California state director who is Jeff Krauss my dear mentor and 
friend and uh he kind of got me up to speed on the on the uh the nuts and bolts stuff you know 
um and uh I that's that's what I was doing and that's how I became a UFO investigator 
and contact completely threw me and changed me I I mean I'm still a very good you know UFO 
Straight Ahead investigator but I know that it has this whole other aspect to it it's a 
little bit more like The Jock valet type you know John Keel High strange and stuff you know 
it's it's a personal phenomenon very personal um okay I'm down to hear about your account
will you guys take a break halfway right are we there yet because I don't want to yeah I don't want to stop no you don't okay we even come back it's just station identification so 
go ahead oh okay I got you um all right so well I was putting this telepathic message out there 
and and I it was just a romp I didn't think it was going to work to tell you the truth I I did I had I really truly didn't think it was going to work but you know it's worth a try 
and uh so I I just sent that out there I want to meet you and you can abduct me if you want 
I actually sent that message out there you can you can have you can take my DNA that's fine I 
don't mind you know but I just want to see you I want to meet you liaison and personal 
and uh I did that for maybe two weeks my wife and I were living in Burbank at the time Chandler bike 
path Old House in Burbank crickets in the rafters that's a there's a bookstore right near there that 
I attended many times oh the Odyssey was yeah yeah I know that place [Laughter] so anyhow I I I I 
went upstairs it was a little after midnight and I think I'd closed a case that was like a mileoon or 
something you know and it wasn't much as I have and uh I'd had a hip surgery recently so I put 
a bunch of pillows behind my back because it was more comfortable if I was semi-recumbent you know 
almost sort of like lounge chair up you know so I was lying there my wife was already asleep and 
a weird thing started happening our room started flooding with light with no Source um it wasn't 
coming from the window it wasn't coming from any Source it was as though the air had become lit and 
it had loot to it or it made me feel like it was blue I don't know you know I mean you hear about 
the blue color of light that experiencers see but I for me it was more of like this peaceful it was 
almost like the the feeling of blue of the ocean and in a perfect Sky it was sort of you know yeah 
uh you couldn't hear the cricket uh concerto crickets were silent which didn't happen we we had 
a problem with crickets it was an old house it's a noisy area of town it's certainly not uh not uh 
you know it's it's not the side it's an urban area a Suburbia anyhow 
uh but you couldn't hear external noise and this didn't bother me nothing none of it was 
bothering me and looking back at it like I'm so scientifically minded you know I've been 
as a nurse and uh you know amateur astronomer and everything else and uh but but for some reason I 
wasn't really questioning it I felt calm and peaceful and and the light became brighter 
and I started realizing that I couldn't move my body and there was this area in front of the bed 
where our TV was and this is impossible but but it happened there was this swirling Motion in the air 
uh it was sort of a sepia color sort of a sort of a yellowish 
kind of rust and yellow mixed together and it was spinning around like a little Galaxy yep 
you're familiar with us okay yes many times yes yeah I know one other guy in New York that had 
this happen um so I I'm still I'm calm for some reason and the thing opens from the center out 
it was as though somebody had poured cream into a cup of black coffee right where it just you become 
opaque yeah yeah and I just saw a distance you could it wasn't like you could see the inside of 
a spaceship or anything like that it was just blank it was just bright light coming forward 
wow and uh these four little figures that were being drawn towards me they didn't walk up it 
was though they were just floating a millimeter off the ground and they pulled up to where the 
bed was uh and they were the little the guys that you saw in Whitley streamers communion book but 
the gray skin and larger forehead than that just like four foot tall maybe a little smaller than 
that well yeah at this point I was scared uh but I was still they put you into like a 
hypnagogic state I think is is the word uh it's almost like a dream state but you're not you're 
not asleep uh and I could feel their hands on me I could feel their skin texture it was not 
it was kind of a cold it was certainly not warm there they're cold-blooded um and I'm trying to 
communicate with them with my mind I mean I've read enough literature at that point at Red Bud Hopkins as trying you know usually and there is a tall this is what I there was a tall being 
that was standing in the periphery of this portal for lack of better terminology I mean I think it 
they really did open some kind of a wormhole or a little dimensional you were in a dimensional Rift
it's the encapsulate you you mentioned into the fourth dimension you're outside yourself okay 
and I think this is why you know like the thick test going Mach 18 and cause a single sonic boom 
and they said that it had this Shimmer around it and I think it's the same thing that's kind of what it looked like it was a shimmery light thing that was going on when you come out of the 
third dimension and you're halfway between the third and the fourth everything becomes opaque because you're not seeing in the third solidly in the third you're halfway into the fourth and 
everything goes opaque you can see objects you know where you're at you can see while you can see 
people and things but you're still opaque because you now have shifted out of your own time frame 
this would explain why like cars can disappear from roads right yeah oh I know you know well 
I mean it I mean they're in control you're highly suggestible when you're under their influence and 
it's speaking of being under the influence I know I was not under the influence of anything you guys 
I you know I know I maybe had a beer with dinner and that was you know like five six hours were 
you alone or what was your wife no my wife my wife was there but when this was going on it was all I 
could see the entities and and and I I believe that she was still there I don't think that they took me somewhere like like their ship or something like that because I could still see the 
opening and I could see this tall Bean standing there almost like a God and then I was I was 
coated enough where I remembered how some people the the little guys are usually not talkative but 
usually there's a tall guy there communicate with you but he was not communicating with me and and 
uh they were taking blood from me they had put these four tubes it almost looked like this like 
a fire hose like except you know what they remind me of is almost like the the oxygen tubes that the 
Apollo Astronauts used to have they were like you know like a couple inches around right and I felt 
very weak like they were taking blood and energy from me and I started scared because I wasn't a 
calming message I I knew enough about this thing that usually people are told don't worry we're 
not going to harm you we're going to leave you you know fine and I wasn't getting that so I I think 
that I I got so horrified because I I started thinking well maybe I'm going to wind up like one 
of those mutilated cows I mean these guys really don't care they're not you ask some questions 
while they were there they were not talk they were not answering anything yeah I I did I was asking 
who they were where they were from and why they were you know but there was nothing coming back 
um I believe that my experience in in the time thing is so hard to say how long it was because 
it was it it seemed almost timeless it is but I best of my ability I mean went on all key when 
it was all over it was only maybe one thirty two in the morning so it must like 20 minutes 
30 minutes max it was a one thing and as far as I know they didn't take me to a ship or anything 
it was a house call and there's no room to park a spaceship between our old house and our neighbor's 
house there's like 10 10 feet there so it had to have been an interdimensional portal or Wormhole 
of some kind they don't use portals and they don't use wormholes there is no such thing as 
and I'll explain to you if you understand physics at all or astronomy I've I've heard differently 
but I I don't know I'm I'm open I I honest to God I I don't have any Dogma about this stuff but I I 
have my favorite ideas and I've had things that I've been told technology and uh they they are 
billions of years in advance of us and they know how to open what they call like gateways and they 
can travel interdimensionally that way and they did a dimensional Rift and came into the room with you and then they evacuated well I know it was an interdimensional thing I mean it wasn't uh 
it wasn't the way that our physics works exactly left it was the same way that they came in I mean 
they apparently got what they wanted and they went uh they went backwards but they kept staring at 
me and there are heading you you you you look in their eyes and it's like staring into the abyss 
and you can't look away you can't you can't you can't pull your gaze away from them 
so they they pulled away and the the tubes pulled away almost like you know I think of 
a fire engine where you see that yeah I mean but I didn't see what they were going to or what you 
know I couldn't see a machine they were attached to or anything it was just all brightness you know so any way they were gone again you could see them like the distance it was very abstract it 
was almost like looking at a Salvador Dolly painting or something the way it looked and 
the wall started spinning again the opposite direction though it was going that way this 
time yeah and it closed up and it was still lit in our room I could start moving 
and when I could finally move I started screaming and yelling at my wife uh my wife was not happy 
she said oh my God you know you've joined this crazy UFO group and is this the kind of crazy this is this a thing that I have to look forward to in the future hold on for just a second because we 
do need a decoration break that's a good place to find yes so yeah I just want to let everyone know 
that you are watching the light gate I'm Preston Dennett and my lovely co-host is Dolly saffron our 
guest tonight is Earl Gray State section director for the mutual UFO Network and we are streaming 
on several platforms including United public radio network 107.7 from the beautiful city of 
New Orleans also the UFO paranormal radio network at 105.3 Roku Facebook YouTube and that's what we 
wanted to let you know so thank you for joining us and didn't mean to interrupt you I have two very 
important questions too but go ahead march on you I did not have a single Mark anywhere okay there 
is no mark and I've asked somebody about that who's a interesting person again that I can't 
say much about and I was told well there are other ways to take blood in the universe the 
needles this is very uh kind of a barbaric practice that you guys are still actually I 
didn't tell you what was happening to you um I've witnessed this you were being given an implant
can I swear to you if you go have an x-ray soft tissue x-ray you probably find one in one of your arms
well here's here's the thing so I my wife thought that I had I don't know what she she 
was not happy and I I felt embarrassed and I I didn't know who to talk to I I told him 
that she didn't remember anything she didn't see anything I mean it was still light in our room but she was so angry I don't even think she noticed and uh but two nights later 
uh the shoe was on the other foot I was being shaken and the room was flooded with light the 
second time yeah and it's the only time I've ever seen my wife do this but she was pays next to the 
bed she's going my God Earl you need to tell your little friends that they need to leave us 
the I'm not going to use the word a family show you need to tell them that they need to leave us 
that alone I didn't sign up for this yeah and she was mad I mean she and maybe she's the reason did 
for being mad you know she was acting like I had drawn them to us and maybe that you know 
veracity for that you know a few nights after that okay thank God though now now you know at 
least my wife knows that I didn't have a mental break you know thank God for that okay because 
I I don't know what I would I don't know what I would do I mean I certainly I I don't think I'd be talking with you guys if she thought that I I I love my wife I don't want her to leave me you know 
it's a weird story um and she sure didn't want to hear it after the first night 
um now if there is five nights after my initial experience and again our house was filled with 
light with no Source but then it was also coming through the window and Lisa and I went we we kind 
of ran to the window we had the Venetian you know these guys all right yeah and and so we pulled 
them up and you couldn't see where the light was coming from but it was perfectly silent and 
neighbors lights were porch lights were coming on right and it was like God's Own Spotlight 
over our house you could see the Shadows behind every single leaf it was it was just intense it 
was like a laser bright and we're looking at this we're looking at each other I'm not going to go 
and see where you know I I knew about Travis Walton I wasn't going to repeat that you know 
um but my wife and I had a had a telepathic moment at the same time we were given not a 
screen memory but it's like a screen excuse for what was going on we both 
heard in our head at the same time don't worry it's just the neighbor's porch light italya said I look at each other and we're standing there one side of the 
window I'm on the other side and we both laugh we're both you know LOL right at the same time and and uh and Lisa said that's no porch light yeah
we had a telepathic moment now I'll tell you the heck of this thing is is it my wife at 
this to this date all she remembers from all three nights except for when she you know I 
was screaming and yelling all she remembers is is our room flooding with light she does not remember 
beans she doesn't remember a hole in the wall she doesn't remember the light Even in our backyard 
I've I've sometimes thought well maybe I should go and and and ask some of our old neighbors if 
they remember something weird happening but I kind of my guess is that they're they're probably not 
going to I mean if they if they erase my wife's memory of this but thank God I mean she knows 
that you need a source for light she so she knows that I'm not making stuff up um but I kept this to 
myself for a long time about that I'm curious do you feel like this was a good thing are you glad 
that this happened I am now yeah in fact shortly it took a while all right after it first happened 
it threw me it threw me I mean I I this isn't what I ordered you know I want to be Val foreign
I think I was marked from birth anyway I think I don't know if you know I don't think anything necessarily you have a lot of contact 
markers on you okay yeah the interesting I know at this point these people
well I told you know I told my state director and he was that was the first 
person other than Lisa that I talked to and he was like rolling to the eyes if you did not want to hear this I was this new field investigator and he was hoping 
to promote me and and uh I thought he was going to fire me quite honestly because
and people that's amazing to me because it's been my observation since I came out and I've 
been watching y'all and I do um that a lot of field investigators have decide to be fiddled 
investigators ask for a moment with DT or ask to be contacted and they are and it's more of you 
than not you know lots almost every investigator that I've you know seen talked to or heard of have 
all had contact I did it yeah I asked for it and I got it Kathleen Martin is who was the most helpful 
person in the universe to me um I'd send other experiencer cases to Kathy and I I met her at the 
I think I think I met her at the same Symposium I met you at the first time Preston but at this 
point she she knew about me and she you know she she knew me via emails I would send her you know 
ERT cases if I had a contact case or I had a deduction case I wasn't a member of the 
ERT I would send them to Kathy and we got talking and I I told her I 
said you know I had an experience and I'm still confused about it and could we talk 
and we scheduled lunch uh she was she was out here for I think it was alien con the first one 
and uh we we got together we sat down for lunch and I told her about everything and she had uh she 
had some answers for me and and and strangely you know I didn't hate my my uh entities I I felt like 
it sort of initiated something in me and later on I'd read things like Kenneth Rings book you know 
and uh this is Omega and and things like that and I found out about the the um valet Davis effect 
which I you know I consider myself a valet Davis effect uh uh that I experienced this in my life a 
lot of people that have this anomalous contact uh we find ourselves with uh kind of expressing the 
gifts that we usually uh think of as as belonging to the beings themselves and I think that there's 
something like a cosmic contagion that's passed along through this experience sure okay 
um you're you know you are a physical mind in your consciousness you have Consciousness on board 
that's who you really are as your Consciousness and if you're not developed enough to hear your 
Consciousness outright hear it your physical mind can be spoken to by them and this is exactly 
what they did they download you with information while you're they're there in other words they're speaking to your Consciousness not your physical mind because your physical mind can't hear it okay 
and then as you go along from that you start experiencing it because your Consciousness is 
not going to let you forget it in other words it's going to come at you in your dreams it's going to come at you in your experiences it's going to give you a serendipitous moments well 
synchronicities that was how they that's how they contacted me tell you what it is and what 
it is basically is that you know you you know I hope you know that your abilities are innate 
Daniel Glenn and in your brain and it operates and whether you're using it properly or not is 
up to you okay sure yeah you treat yourself and all that well if you have all the abilities that 
ET has all of them oh I know we're born with those we are born with those it's like they were engaged is what happened so what happened is you ask for contact and you buddy got it
they were trying to talk to you they were telling you all kinds of stuff but you couldn't hear it 
yet and now you're living through it and it's going to keep coming at you until you get it until you work it out and that's what you're thirsting your hunger for all this is that's the 
seed they plant they want you to know the truth and now you're going for it see what I'm saying so early Davis effect can you be more specific do you mean like experiences yeah sure well uh the 
the idea that well Kenneth Green I believe was the first guy who he was he was a psychologist that 
was doing uh he was he was doing a research project looking into near-death experiences 
and uh somebody gave him a book about uh Alien Abduction uh I I forget whose it was whether 
it was uh Turner or or Bud Hopkins or whose book it was but anyway they said I think you 
would be you would find uh like a that these their commonalities between these experiencers of alien 
abduction and visitation and those that have had out of body experiences and near-death experiences 
and he he kind of connected the dots and saw this and a lot of these people 
um after they have uh this extraordinary experience it will engage it'll do the same 
thing as dolly was saying the pineal gland uh is engaged and people begin to have synchronicities 
telepathic moments uh intuition is kicked up through the rafters I mean I was able to connect 
the dots I was suddenly like the best field investigator around you know because I would 
see every little marker and and I would connect my cases you know it was not like this case and 
this random case and no you you would be able to collate and see you know and under it just opened 
up my understanding you know and experiencers become spiritual we become spiritual too
I used to tell a friend that she was trying to link up to her psychic abilities and she she just 
was having a hard time understanding how this works and I said look when you learn to ride a bike you tell your parents I want to ride a bike right and they give you a trust and it's easy to 
ride and then you graduate you go to a two-wheeler well sometimes they put training wheels on the thing so you can get your balance and then they take them off and you write on it this is how 
this is the same channel of events in another way you wanted to know about BTS you grew up 
knowing that something was going on that space was more than what you everybody realized you 
were hungering for it already because you're already in contact with me you were and then we have watchers that's that's what I found yeah yeah people you know consider guardian 
angels and and and and this and that but I mean there are extraordinary experiences I 
mean when I was three years old I was thrown out of the car window in a car accident we went off a cliff and in Utah and and and I I guess that's my first memory is is my dad 
um drove off a cliff and my dad is next to me and he's going Jesus is going to protect us 
Jesus will protect us and the next you know I remember the door opening up and I go out 
and the next memory is is I see the station wagon with the wheels spinning around upside 
down you know yeah Mom was okay except she broke her back but she you know I mean it 
was healable uh dad had just like a you know a contusion on his head and it was for me there 
was a rock like a foot away from my but I didn't have a scratch I didn't have a scratch yeah um
of similar things and I feel like um like I've been watched over all of my life I mean when I 
was singing to the and waving to the space people you know that young age there was a reason for that I I mean that I believe that's right well at some point some of the cases you 
investigated but I also know you got another exciting but I do want to pop up this question before I lose it because it was asked at 9 30 by tools is mufan interested in personal UFO 
experiences from 60 years ago absolutely I mean I love historical cases that's that's like meat 
and potatoes yeah oh I have I have one case where a guy and his friend were playing toboggan with a 
like a cardboard box down ice plant and Echo Park in Los Angeles and they they were young enough to 
where they saw this missile silver missile shaped UFO it was hovering like seven feet off the ground 
and they kept playing toboggan but they waved at the UFO they got way you know space people 
and and uh and then this thing it went to like a 90 degree angle and shot off and this happened in 
1952 I believe as well that this guy had his experience he was an older gentleman kind of 
wanting to tell his story well it wasn't a month later I had two guys in San Diego they're closer 
to my age that were motorcycle guys they're kind of doing Motocross up this hill they got up to the 
top of the hill and what they see was this silver shaped missile thing that was Defying Gravity it 
was it was like seven feet off the ground I mean this just happened recently uh and it it again the 
same thing went up to 90 degree angle and shot off into the you know into the cosmos apparently now 
the you know if if I didn't have that that other case that was from over you know 60 years ago uh 
I wouldn't have had anything to to compare it to but you know was essentially the same thing you 
told me I know for a fact there are both those were real sightings just by the fact that it went up on a 90 degree angle oh yeah that's what they always do and that's how they power up to go 
if change in polarity and they shoot out from it so one question you might like this or you might 
like it too Dolly I mean I don't know if either of you guys are are like big music fans but uh 
I I I love the band Yes they're Progressive right I love them okay you'll like this I I 
because of synchronicity Our God or my aliens I'm not sure why but for some reason I got to 
become very close friends with Chris Squire their baseball Chris was a dear dear friend in fact he's 
one of the reasons one of the reasons why I I decided to become a field investigator because 
in 1977 he had a sighting he was out the the they were on the going for the one tour in in England 
and he had uh he told me the story it was like three o'clock in the morning and Chris would like 
to drink wine and talk so and I was his friend so that's what we do and he was in town for uh he 
was recording an album a side project away from yes and uh but he started telling me this story 
and uh he had his driver pull over it's kind of the middle of nowhere 
and he was literally peeing on a Rock when he felt stared at and looked up he looked up and he saw a 
flying saucer and he said it had these garish I can't do Chris's voice there's garish lights 
going around the bottom of it it was purple and it looked like a carnival ride it was just absurd 
absurd he said that his thing it hung there watching him and he zipped up [Laughter] 
he said that it went it went it went to an angle and shot off and into space yeah that's 
exactly he said who do you suppose that was and maybe it was us from the future 
maybe because somebody was a colleges or maybe maybe there's some ETS that are interested in 
music I mean John Lennon had a similar you know sighting yeah smoothie Blues
Jimi Hendrix [Music] uh he he was a close friend but Jimmy and he said uh Jimmy was absolutely a contactee uh 
aliens saved him saved us if at one point in fact um I met him when I was about I don't know seven 
six years wow he was on board and I was going to quarters okay on board and I walked by him 
he was sitting in the middle of some people okay he had a guitar and he was playing acapella okay 
and I was shocked I'd never seen anybody do that in real life and um I I spoiled just followed 
toward him and I'm standing with my mouth hanging up and going wow I never met Jimmy but I did know 
Chris tell me my first chords is C energy and he said keep playing and I did I played the guitar 
because I am I also listen to music when I'm flying on board I'm not joking and yes is one 
of my favorite groups to listen yeah when I was interviewing Dalia I started asking him I 
don't suppose you've ever seen any famous people because she wasn't gonna offer that information 
um her story is very extensive I'll have to give you dollars but I know a few famous experiencers but I can't say who but I mean you know I mean you know about the 
Santa Monica Mountains I'm not allowed to talk about it yeah I can't either I can't either yeah
don't tell me this Chris I mean the lat you know and sadly we lost him about God what eight years 
ago now yeah it was eight years ago and uh but Scott the way I knew Chris was his friend uh 
Scotland Taylor was a dear close friend of mine and and uh and just you know from yes fandom 
right you know I used to write a blog I was a administrator from yesfans.com but apparently 
Chris used to secretly read my blogs you know and and so uh when he started seeing Scotty you know 
Scotty met him in Hawaii uh and I was there too I mean it was it was a night I was 2003 and there 
was this big show in Honolulu uh it was a guess with a full Orchestra and Rick Rick Wakeman was 
playing with him too and it was the only time that Rick played with yes and they had an orchestra 
other other times it was either it would be the orchestra would take place the keyboards or you 
get Rick Wakeman right so had to go to Hawaii to see this show and uh if Scotty hooked up with him 
you know she got backstage and he fell madly in love with Scott and they got married they 
had little girls Island guys still kind of keep in touch with Scotty and zai but um but Chris it 
changed his life when he had his uh his his experiences siding and the last thing that I 
I spoke with him a week before he passed away and Scott I mean he had leukemias what he died from um 
and Scotty held the phone up yeah she had to hold the phone up to his ear he was just really really sad but I gotta tell Chris I said Chris I I become a mufon field investigator I'm going to figure 
out who is flying that uh Flying Saucer and he he was he was happy she said you know early smiling 
you know he's smiling uh that's amazing I missed the man I wish he was here I wish my mom was here 
I mean you know there's like this whole panoply of people that I wish so badly that they're gone
um I've had an out-of-body I've had a near-death experience actually when I was in a hospital 21 
years old and uh I was floating it was a hospital where I was born St John's in Santa Monica wow 
as floating like down the hallway and I could hear like I could see light and I could hear a clax an 
alarm in my head that was you're not supposed to do this you're not supposed to do this and 
I remember crawling back into my body and coming to um and that but that's uh you know other than 
that you know I've I've had dream states where I think that I've probably astral traveled and stuff 
but I I they do that I was very good at meditating um you know I could feel the cord going up and all 
that stuff you know but uh yeah but I have that one accomplished Shelby you can talk to your mom 
I have people that have you know that say shout out of me but I'm going to pop up a question 
because sure I've always say that you know we want to interact with chat and people have some really interesting questions and I I'm sure Dolly can answer this uh the questions from tools and I'm 
interested in if any of your cases reflect this because none of mine really do but tools is asking 
as your research shown any indication that ETS have a sense of smell and I can't say I have ever 
have any maybe if they use a human Avatar no then they would have the human senses Preston 
knows this I've talked about this extensively with him uh one of the way the tall Grays greet each 
other as they create foreheads and they Huff each other they smell each other they smell pheromones really well and they're almost like dogs I'm not joking I'm a hybrid and I have an 
unbelievable sense of smell and mom um told me I've inherited that I can smell anything with 
my nuts yeah and they do I I I haven't I I don't have any personal cases where where they where 
they where that was evident but that doesn't mean that they're I believe you I mean I do believe uh 
I mean I think that they you know they run the gamut and I think that uh that our visitors can 
kind of appear how they want and where they want and uh uh I mean I have we had a recent 
case where a couple of women uh stopped their car to look at the forefoot tall jack rabbits 
in the road and two hours later they came too you know and they were not jackrabbits so 
um you know uh this happened no it was an ERT case it wasn't my case it was one of my ERT guys 
um I've got I've got three ERT people or myself here on a desert highway in Utah was it you know 
it might have been the same case yeah that might be the same one Preston I think that might be the same case I have to look at the details again it wasn't mine but I just I love the jackrabbit so 
I mean Dr George medich is is our he runs the experience or resource team and uh I remember 
when the case came in he has shaking his head and kind of going to jackrabbits yeah it was the never 
surprises me yeah Susan is here tonight I think that's her case I am not sure really oh cool
what I love you know for me every wonderful case in the best cases I think that they 
have intentional absurdity in them and it's almost like a signature line it's 
almost like an eye wink you know you can have this perfectly scientific thing that's going 
on and and then it all goes to jock valet land I think that was the humor I really
I was laying in the front yard and I saw this giant umbrella coming down it was five and I was 
like what the hell I thought it was Mary Poppins Umbrella because I just seen Mary Poppins so that was in my head and I'm looking for the handle and the parent and there was none and the very first 
thing I thought before I was on board was well it doesn't have a handle that doesn't mean it's an 
umbrella and then I was on board and uh it freaked me out for five minutes I was like huh you know 
yeah early case from the 50s who was it that I saw UFO that looked like an umbrella I know I know and 
it's making me nuts well I'll I'll tell you in a second because there's a very famous ufologist is 
one of the classic people um pictures are also maybe we could go through some of the oh sure 
yeah some of those because yeah well here let me see oh that's a Sagittarius arm of our own 
Galaxy right there beautiful picture um I think I pulled that one off your website actually sorry 
oh wow I didn't even send you that one that was the case yeah okay this one is a cool one and it 
is an abduction case um this was a case uh it was actually a Buffon case of the year a couple years 
ago and I spoke about the symposium but the main Witnesses were clinical psychologists and her son 
and uh she was driving him home from some event when they saw this v-shaped craft hanging over 
a school they loved to hang over schools you guys that's where I had my sighting is uh hanging over 
a grammar school and this was the same thing he was handing over a grammar school and it's like 
what's that Mom you know adult Son by the way he was like 18 19 years old uh so not a child and uh 
the closer they get to it it starts turning on its side and the little blue and white lights 
that you see that's her illustration they started flashing and they started 
experiencing the Oz effect where time became weird uh external sounds were were not there 
uh and and I we're not sure if it was five minutes or 15 minutes or 20 minutes it was very weird um 
but they of course this thing it it turns back the way that they saw it originally uh you know where 
the lights were facing down towards the ground ah yeah you got the other picture too I forgot whether I sent you that and that that's the mom's illustration with them in the little car there 
uh so this thing it spun around and it started it was almost like rooftop level uh and they 
she said it was almost like looking at the nerve cells then the cells of the Starship Enterprise 
when it was leaving because they had those two things in the back and for those who can't see 
this this is a v-shaped craft with lights along each arm very low level what time of day was it 
um it was in the early evening and it had uh in the very front of it it had what looked like a 
cloud and that's that little uh what you see up front that's kind of a fuzzy area yeah it looked 
like it had a little cloud in the front you couldn't see that it came to a point or or not 
and uh but they didn't say a single word to each other it was almost like they came to this agreement we're not going to talk about this which we know is a part of this quite often 
um and and mom drives home not talking about it these spaceship over the school not gonna 
say a word and they drove into the driving into the driveway and then the son says mom 
what was that and she she said well I think you know as well as I know he just saw a UFO 
um now that's a pretty good story right there but that's not where it ends uh the mom started 
having missing time uh experiences uh the father in the situation is a medical doctor the mother 
of clinical psychologist um they uh they they actually do like mental health work with people 
out there so I have to I can't say who people are I can't give you any personal information 
and I do that anyway I kind of adhere to hip a lot um but uh but anyway the she starts finding 
hers you know the husband wouldn't be able to move but he would see the beans and they were the small Grays uh they would take the wife up to a ship and uh there there was the Mantis that 
that was highly telepathic and she thought I'm just going to read the case file for you on that 
I think that this one was actually mentioned during the Congressional hearings although I can't 
tell you that for sure but it's the only case I know of that happened between uh that happened 
between Japan and Hawaii uh but hold on one second let me find the case File here for you here we go
um this I'm I again will redact the Pilot's name but this was a commercial pilot 
said my initial UFO sighting was on February 12 2005 flying at 39 
000 feet elevation out of back to Honolulu Hawaii 1421 Zulu and he's got the coordinates 
here there were three of us myself the co-pilot and our flight engineer I'm retiring next year 
I've noticed the airline I currently work for seems to be backing off from warning us not to 
report UAP sightings since the new FAA rules have loosened so I decided to put in a mufon report 
it was February 12 2005. I was piloting a DC-10 flight 58 for Japan air Charter subsidiary of 
JAL we were flying out of fukoka Japan back to Honolulu I'd flown this route multiple times I had 
never seen anything that I couldn't explain before this happened I didn't believe that UFOs were a real thing at 1421 Zulu in the early morning just passed the International Date Line you 
could just see a little fingernail of blue at the horizon line but everything else was Pitch Black 
we were cruising along when next thing you know something catches my eye right around 10 o'clock off the nose of the aircraft 30 degrees as a month I saw something at first just a flash of light 
light reflected off of something but then I saw it and I pointed it out to my crew members and I 
said what the hell is that my co-pilot said what and I pointed directly at what I saw I said that 
sure enough there were three huge and I mean huge discs that had come up into the upper atmosphere 
glinting the sun off of their surfaces far above the horizon line I mean they were up so far that 
they were technically still in space they hadn't really entered our atmosphere yet now when you're 
up at 39 000 feet you can see stuff for instance when the space shuttle did their tether their 
tether experiment we could see that happening from up there well these objects were very very 
large because they had to have been at least 100 miles away from us so I would estimate that each 
silver disc must have been a good couple hundred feet across and that's downsizing if anything 
no surface features that you could see no bubble on top just three metallic discs glinting the 
sun back at us they were in a tight equilateral triangular formation there weren't any lights on 
them that I could see just their mirrored surfaces unwavering like Chrome reflecting back the light 
from a high altitude basically we watched them and as they came in they stopped and you could kind of 
you could kind of see them reorient themselves so they were the exact same distance from each other 
and then they just sat there for around 10 seconds like that hovering in a tight triangular pattern 
when the UFOs took off they didn't have to accelerate to speed they just took off instantaneously at an incredible speed and they shot off down past the horizon line it 
was bizarre you know we're used to accelerating up to speed but these objects left suddenly all 
at once if I hadn't been looking right at them I would have thought that they had blinked out of existence and disappeared but nope you can see them shoot off together at unagenable speed 
now flight Crews come and go I don't really keep in touch with past Crews I've worked with but the three of us kind of bonded over having seen this we stay in touch as the three of us 
witnessed something that they say does not exist but we saw this with our own eyes and it changed 
the way that I look at the stars at night in fact it changed the way that I see everything 
wow just a good UFO sighting no no abductions but uh you know I love the pilots they're trained 
observers you know and they're up there all the time and there's so many more that I mean we don't hear about the vast majority of it let's face it don't report them yeah well they're not the point 
is with Pilots is they're not passive observers they're interactive observers they have to be they're flying and anything coming at them is dangerous so they're constantly scanning the skies 
it is their job and uh as Pilots so you have to listen to very very good guy and I guess that he's 
joined this group of Pilots now that's uh you know proposing this to Congress that that they need to 
be honest with the public because it's it's a risk uh that it's a risk to commercial Jets and 
commercial flight and and that uh you know they need to acknowledge that this is a thing and deal 
with it uh but anyway I I guess I just threw that at you because it was a recent case and I really 
loved it so I'm gonna pop up a question here from neural channels who's asking have you investigated 
any tall white cases yes yeah those are the guys I wanted to meet um I had a guy who uh 
who uh professional photographer out in Badlands somewhere I won't tell you where uh and he was 
out alone and he's on top of a pinnacle of rock like a 150 feet up in the air and nowhere to go 
and he saw what looked like a meteor coming towards him and he said that this was headed straight for him and he thought he was going to die and he like fell on his you know on his butt 
and but then suddenly he was income you know it was just bright bright light all around him so 
he pulls his hands away from his eyes and he said that these three tall humans one hair blue eyes 
perfect features uh wearing I believe they were like the blue jumpsuits uh appeared like Star Trek 
next to him and there was no place for him to go I mean it was this this little tiny I guess what 
they call a hoodoo but a very tall one you know Southwest kind of Rock Butte um he said that he 
had never felt such love in his life that with the one uh the tall woman told was talking to the like 
there was like a child or or like an adolescent so it seemed like it was the the father and and 
the mom and an adolescent and she was telling him that this has been my charge all of his life I've 
known him since he was a little baby and uh but this guy felt he said it was he he felt greatly 
depressed because he's hoping that he will meet with him again he said that it was the greatest 
love he ever felt in his life I've heard that exact thing which brings up his question actually 
do et's have emotional attachments Jamie D is asking friendships like humans yes it depends on 
the ET yeah yeah I mean the little gray guys are pretty robotic you know I mean some people robots 
yeah I was wondering if you figured that out yet they didn't talk to me there's nothing there you 
know I I figure the tall guy was the one that was cogent that's right for whatever reason but 
here's a personal question Earl uh yeah is that a photo of my mom in the background yeah so oh 
there went E.T I know it's just a little a little model of it yeah but yeah that's that's my mom right there that's Betty Grace Anderson what's her name 
she's beautiful and that's that's why I'm into all this stuff you know wow okay well you gave us another photo we're running out of time we've got like 10 15 minutes 
left and I do want to hear about your schoolyard encounter but here's another photo that you sent 
to us which I am curious about because it's a really well I want the everything bagel tonight 
I love this cake yeah again what I've seen from case to case to case uh and this repeats from case 
to case it'll be a family they're outside say a barbecue or whatever somebody sees a distant light 
in the in the distance and the mom pointed in this case uh the mom pointed to this star that was very 
very bright over the mountain and said what's that just like the pilot you know what's that next you know this thing was right on top of her her best friend uh though it was a whole family 
it was a family Barbecue uh the main witness was 10 years old then now she's in her 30s 
like mid-30s uh she's trying to get her mom to Mom's attention she's scared she's tugging on 
her mom's pants at her mom and her mom's best friend are standing there like statues so this 
little girl she ran into the house which was now flooded with light she found her little 
nephew and she put her arms around her nephew because he was scared and the next thing you 
know they both wake up and it's eight o'clock in the morning they're tucked into their beds uh the uncle and his best friend will not talk about it the mother will spoken with a mom spoken 
with her friend spoken with a daughter and that's the daughter's uh illustration she's an artist and 
I I use a lot of art therapy with my uh experiencer cases because there's catharsis 
in expression is this a porthole then that we're looking at with people we're looking at a window 
all the way around with beans in there and the bottom of the craft almost looked uh biological 
you can see where it almost looks like roots or something and she said yeah that's the way it was I can't understand it it looked like it grew that way there you go wow they can open windows 
up on any any viewporting on any craft at all yeah all crafter it's not glass no I've never 
seen a leaf that when you touch it or put water on it it turns translucent it goes from green 
to see-through almost the same thing it's that's the leaf is primitive that's way Advanced and it's 
the same idea it's like I heard the the Roswell crash site the debris field uh the pieces we're 
trying to reassemble into the original shape like a living thing yes and they were blown like there 
was no Breeze but it looked like it was all in in a breeze I know the Marcel family room yeah Susan 
yeah that is your case you're the one with the jackrabbits we love your taste I wanted that for 
myself but I gave that to my field investigator yeah well we love the tall jackrabbits it was just 
such a wonderful wonderful case and proverbial you know uh they I don't know if you know I believe 
that they'll use screen screen memories and Screen images so that they don't scare us right yeah yeah 
exactly that is very synchronistic out of all the people in the world you're listening to us tonight
and I would not say your name there Susan but you you did so and yeah well she's courageously 
stepped forward which is always a big huge and that's hard to do I can't watch myself after I 
had my experience I would the only people I would you know I mean the people I told at first acted like I was nuts or they wanted to fire me for mufon or something so uh I would tell 
my new field investigators because I felt like I owed them that little heads up caveat that 
uh you know if you poke at the phenomenon it's interactive don't be surprised if it folks back they're not here to do air shows you know right so so you were also driving by a school once and 
yeah this was after my experiences happened about four or five years ago uh it happened 
out here in Winnetka California I was driving to work so it was a daytime sighting uh no preamble 
to it I wasn't asking the cet's again you know I just uh but I felt like a teachable moment 
uh I saw a v-shaped craft not a beautiful craft I always wanted to see like something streamlined 
and you know a Starship you know out of Arthur Clark right you know that's what I grew up reading but it was real boxy looking it looked old and rusted and and when I first saw it it was about 
the size of like a large UPS truck or maybe a fighter plane you know size maybe a little larger 
so I was about 300 feet away from it and I'm trying to figure out how somebody did this hoax 
because it didn't look like any UFO I'd ever heard of um and I'm looking for tethers maybe somebody 
hung some you know the students or trying to treat their teacher out or something uh no there's 
nothing that you could tether this up with it was just massive tonnage the closer you got to it you could see it was metallic and heavy and a massive tonnage that was just Defying Gravity somehow 
so now I'm a trained Observer I'm a Star Team uh member I I know what I'm supposed to do 
who I'm supposed to call uh you know that how I could protect myself from radiation Etc didn't do anything that I have ever been taught to do the closer I got to this thing the 
less in control of myself I was um about a hundred feet away from this thing I am thinking I am going 
to be late to work I gotta go I have to go to work I'm going to be late and I didn't like that job 
it's always looking for excuses you know case so but sorry old client but I didn't like it anyway 
um sorry just kidding but but anyway uh about uh long story short I I couldn't hear the sounds 
outside of my car time got very weird again I felt like I was in a hypnagogic state and I'm 
driving a vehicle you guys I'm driving like 45 miles an hour down Winnetka Boulevard here where 
I live currently so I passed right by it but when I got right next to it it changes in perspective 
it kind of foreshortened a little bit and the next thing I know it's the size of a football 
field and it's a mile away but I didn't care did I take any photos no did I take video no it was like
I know it was just and I just drove right past that miracle I just kept on going and I was about 
a mile from the 118 freeway here when I came to my senses and I I stopped my car I got out and 
of course there's nothing there anymore and I'm like palming and you know what what did I do you 
know I mean I wanted to fire myself from mufon I didn't even bother to put in a report but you 
know what it was it was a teachable moment it just showed me that uh that they're in control that you 
can be trained to do what you've been trained to do but uh you know if they're you're within 
their realm of influence you're not going to do with something that they don't want you to do 
um it kind of explains why you don't see a whole lot of really close-up pictures or always distant and fuzzy I certainly I didn't even get a distant fuzzy picture of it it was as though I I was some 
I I can't even explain it to this day it's very very very strange and I was so embarrassed by it I 
mean I think I sold my state director at the time maybe later but I just felt like an idiot but now 
I understand I mean it was to teach me something it was and it was not a hot rod they they showed 
themselves but they didn't show me what I wanted to see they showed me this boxy looking thing 
wow well we just have like three or four minutes left of the show so I want to give you a chance we 
do have any more a couple more questions but I'm not sure we really have time let's just try we're 
running we're running the game right now let's try one real fast is there a reason this is Brad 
peanut is there any reason why we make constantly see craft but never meet beings that we remember 
could you repeat that I'm sorry is there any reason we may constantly see crafts but never 
meet beings maybe it's not time to meet them yet you know or maybe you have met them and you've you 
know you don't remember you know that we remember anyway there are reasons there are huge reasons 
right right now but yeah we are now pushing to two minutes so if you have any um upcoming things or 
anything you wanna yeah well I'm gonna be speaking at at the mufon uh Symposium in Ohio uh in about 
eight days from now uh on Saturday and Sunday I'm I'm leading both experience or workshops 
if you come in uh I'll give a short presentation each day but it's mostly so that you guys can uh 
no phones or video or anything like that will be allowed because we've we believe that you 
we respect your anonymity yeah is Paramount to us uh if somebody wants to go like like Susan 
just did and talked about her jackrabbits you know I mean that's okay and I I will certainly go and back in back your case and say yes you know it's absolutely true but uh so if if you 
live in the Ohio area uh be sure to go to the mufon Symposium we have some wonderful speakers 
if anything that I've been telling you sounds familiar to you just go to mufun.com it'll say 
report an entity or report a UFO uh and somebody like myself or or somebody like me will get a hold 
of you and will take you seriously and we would love to hear about your sighting or your meeting 
that you had thank you that's awesome thank you Dolly and thank you president welcome both of 
you guys for having me of course we have to have you again there's lots more to unpack with you definitely sure okay well thank you everybody for joining the life gate tonight if you uh didn't get 
a question answered the live feed will still be up and you will be answered one way or the other from 
either one of us me Preston or Earl uh the light gate has come to you tonight uh from the United 
Radio public radio network at 107.3 uh FM in New Orleans and the United paranormal Radio Network 
at 105.3 we thank you very much for coming to see us we're going 
to miss you see you next week bye thanks girl bless you guys thank you.
