Summary:
Oct 11, 2024
While there are still many questions surrounding the origin of UFOs and their occupants, the most popular theory is that they are from the stars, in other words: extraterrestrial. This video presents twelve cases from across the world involving a wide variety of ETs. These reports are supported by a wide variety of evidence: photos, medical effects, landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more. It’s time for this subject to be taken seriously by everyone on this planet.

THE HUMANOID IN THE FIREBALL. One evening in the Summer of 1961, “Mike” (age 7) was camping with his buddy in the backyard of his home in Anaheim, California. Suddenly a fiery object swooped down and hovered overhead. Inside, he saw a humanoid figure looking down at him.

THE ALIEN UNDER THE BRIDGE. A summer day in 1963, a group of children were playing in a park in Lesnica, Poland when a silver-suited short humanoid appeared next to them. Time seemed to move in slow motion as the figure gestured at them to come closer. The children fled, and refused to return to the park again.

THE LITTLE ETS IN THE TINY UFO. On November 15, 1969, Madame X looked out the window of her apartment in downtown Nancy, France and saw a tiny UFO glide towards her window, stop and hover. Inside she saw two tiny little ETs smiling and looking right at her. It zoomed away. Afterward, the witness discovered her face had been slightly burned.

VISITORS TO EARTH. One summer night in 1972, a lady from Oslo, Norway saw a large saucer-shaped craft with big picture windows hovering at treetop level. Even more shocking, she saw humanoid figures bustling about inside. Oddly, although other people were around, she seemed to be the only one to see it!

A UFO PARKED BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. Late at night on September 6, 1973, two people drove along the Eyre Highway near Penong, South Australia. The passenger was asleep when a telepathic voice woke her up. Looking outside, she saw a UFO parked alongside the road. One humanoid stood next to it, and another was visible through a window.

THE ALIENS ON THE BEACH. One day in June 1975, a couple walked along Playa de Marin Beach in Spain when three UFOs appeared, landed on the beach, and out came three short humanoids dressed in jumpsuits. The three beings converged and then returned to their craft. One of the witnesses tried to communicate telepathically, but got a bad headache.

THE LITTLE MAN IN THE SILVER SUIT. One night in October 1977, Jose Benedito Santos (age 78) was hunting near Chapada das Mesas, Brazil when a glowing object landed near him. He approached and saw a short humanoid wearing a silver suit and helmet. It walked right up to him, and Jose promptly fainted. When he awoke, he found a weird mark on his neck.

THE ETS ON THE BALCONY. When four people drove near Danville, California one evening in summer of 1979, they were amazed to see a glowing object pace their car. They stopped and watched as the object came lower, revealing itself to be a saucer-shaped craft. On a balcony surrounding the craft, they saw several very tall humanoid figures. Later, they learned many people saw UFOs in that area on that night.

CONVERSATION WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL. On the night of August 24, 1985, a couple (both doctors) drove along Route 12 near Ituzaingo, Argentina when a UFO blocked the road. A beautiful man dressed in a jumpsuit walked up to their window and held a long conversation with them. He told them he was from another planet, and that the people of Earth needed to know that we are not alone.

THE ALIEN FROM THE BLACK SPHERE. Throughout 1988-1989, a farming couple from San Piero a Sieve, Italy experienced repeated visits by a flying humanoid which would arrive in black sphere. It warned them to keep away, but then damaged their crops. After several visits, the husband rushed forward to stop the ET. It quickly struck him with a beam of light. That was the final visit.

A NIGHT IN THE TREE WITH ALIENS. On May 17, 1997, three teenage boys became lost in the wilderness of La Rumorosa, Mexico. Taking refuge in a tree for the night, a saucer appeared overhead, followed shortly by several glowing short humanoids. The humanoids soon discovered the boys and actually climbed the tree to observe them. The witnesses' lives were profoundly changed forever.

THE ET WHO WALKED ON WATER. One day in 1999, a man was hiking next to a pond in a natural area near Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada when he saw a tall humanoid figure in a white jumpsuit and helmet floating inches above the water. Suddenly it noticed him and glided across the surface of the water, running off into the forest.

These 12 cases alone make it undeniable that we are being visited by extraterrestrials, but the truth is that there are thousands of more cases. It is no longer possible to deny the truth of the ET presence on our planet. The evidence is clear: we are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal
today I'm going to be exploring one of my favorite topics which is of course humanoids I find this subject endlessly
fascinating there are so many cases this episode is called from the Stars 12
astounding extraterrestrial encounters and yeah I think every single one of these cases is astounding the cases I've
picked today come from all over the world including France Italy Norway
Poland and Spain as well as Australia Canada Argentina and Brazil and two
cases from the United States as it turns out both from California these are cases
that stretch over a pretty long period of time 1961 to 1999 and do involve all different types
of humanoids ETS such as Grays and human looking ETS shortly humanoids the whole
gamut as well as the evidence we often see associated with UFO encounters
there's four main types of evidence and those include Landing traces
electromagnetic disturbances physiological effects and animal
reactions each of these cases I think has some profound insight into the
nature of ET contact teaches us something about why ETS are here and how they behave and they're also just darn
fascinating so let's get started first case I'd like to talk about today I call
the humanoid in the fireball this is a quite unusual case unique in some ways
this occurred in the summer of 1961 in Anaheim California it is a
single witness case relying solely on one person's anecdotal testimony but
it's a very close encounter the witness is a good witness I find him quite
credible and I think this case does have some interesting things to say about ET
Behavior it was a summer evening in 1961 and Mike who had just turned s years old
was camping with his buddy in the backyard of his home on Stony Brook Drive in the suburbs of Anaheim
California earlier Mike's mother had decided that it might be fun if Mike and his friend spent the night in a pup tent
and Mike himself was excited by the prospect it was around 1 p.m. Mike's
friend was asleep when Mike looked up and saw this orange glow high up in the
sky slowly this glowing orange ball of light moved down an arc coming closer
and closer until it was hovering right overhead at a very low altitude and as
Mike says in his own words as it neared the electric pole next door it went from
a fiery orange ball to a more undulating less intense orange ball its surface
seemed to Ripple it became more translucent as it neared the power pole
gauging its size above the power pole I would estimate its size at about 8 to 10
ft in diameter like two VW Bug automobiles put together as it neared
the power pole it became more translucent soon I was able to discern a
humanoid like being looking down at me we looked at each other for less than a
minute now the next thing Mike knew the object was gone but he has no specific
memory of how exactly it left which definitely begs the question is there more to this encounter than he can
remember but this is what he does remember and he does recall telling his family and anyone else would listen
about this encounter right after it happened and of course many times in the years
that followed it was a strange childhood event that he never forgot as he grew up
he later became a firefighter and a registered nurse both jobs which he points out required careful observation
and documentation of unusual events he says he's skeptical by nature but as he
says he knows what he saw when he was just 7 years old as Mike says while
inside a tent in my backyard yard I saw a glowing Fireball descend and stop
above a power pole a being inside observed me while I remain a skeptic who
usually requires reproducible evidence I can honestly say I saw that fireball
with an inhabitant inside of it looking at me a truly fascinating case and I
think it shows how profoundly an encounter like this even a brief one can
affect a person for the rest of their lives but to me the most important takeaway of this case is it shows how
ETS like to show themselves to people I think this is clearly a case of a what
we would call a UFO display et's coming down and basically announcing their
presence I mean when someone has that close of an encounter it's
undeniable certainly the ETS knew they were being observed cuz he's they're looking right down at the witness who's
looking back up at them an amazing case and here's another there's always
another I called this next one the alien under the bridge this took place in July
of 1963 in lesnika Poland this is a really interesting case for a number of
reasons it displays that often heard about Oz effect where there's a weird
Eerie silence pervading over the entire environment when people have an encounter it is a multiple witness case
it's also got a really interesting aspect to it it that we see in some cases but yeah this one's got some
unique elements for sure the investigator to this case is AR MIAA
he's researched quite a few cases he's quite prolific and very thorough this is
one of many astounding humanoid cases to take place in Poland in this instance
the event took place off of marzoa Road in lesnika park this is in lesnika
Poland not far from R claw and it is a multiple Witness case but the primary
witness is Anna sabzac at the time of her encounter she was a young child was one afternoon
around July in 1963 when she and a group of children were playing in a field near their homes
this field contained a small stream which led into a small tunnel under
marzoa road to get to the field the children had to cross this very small
bridge and on the day question Anna was standing in front of a group of children
and she was crouching at the entrance to this tunnel suddenly all the sounds in
the environment stopped and a deathly silence fell over the area even the sound of the gurgling stream was gone
and at the same moment they turned into to look into this tunnel and they all
saw this short figure only about 4T tall standing inside this tunnel and behind
it was a backdrop of bright white light now normally you could see right through
this tunnel to the bushes on the other side but this light was so bright that that's all they could see and at this
moment a very strange feeling swept over Anna she says and she felt as almost as
if she was being drawn towards this being and this light but at the same
time she said she was suddenly unable to move this did allow her to get a very good look at the figure she said it
looked like he was dressed in a sort of loosefitting silvery metallic looking divers suit there were no seams no
buttons of any kind the suit itself seemed to emit an almost blinding light
which made it difficult to look at figure was very short but did have a thick bulky body which he said was
unlike a child it also wore a bubble shaped helmet on its head the same color
of the suit she could see a corrugated looking tube coming out of the top of the helmet reaching around to the back
of the creature she was unable to see any facial features but she did notice that
its arms did not end in hands but instead seemed to be rounded at the tip
this was her impression nevertheless in one of its quote hands it was holding a
thin long black stick at this point Anna and the other children were not feeling
any fear they were just curious but that changed when the figure seemed to notice that it was being observed by
them at which point it suddenly raised one of its arms which some of the children perceived as a threatening
gesture it was gesturing to them said almost Anna felt it was gesturing for
her to come closer but then the being started to turn and move at which point
they could hear rustling noise coming from it which sounded to them like crinkling aluminum foil and as the being
turned turned it gestured again at the children Anna noticed something else
very strange because as the being turned she said it seemed to quote move in slow
motion now I'll let Anna just give a brief description here of what she's experiencing as she says it had
something like a stick in its hands and was making gestures with it indicating to follow it when it moved you could
hear a rustling sound like aluminum foil it emanated a strange energy from itself
which Drew us to it it was hard for us to even back away time stopped only when
he turned around could we make a move before that we couldn't get back out of
there we were all very frightened and screaming in panic fled to the apartment building where I lived I told my
grandfather and grandmother about it but they laughed at me probably because I was a child we never talked about the
incident and never played in that place again was a very traumatic experience for me as a child now Anna estimates
this entire observation lasted only about 1 minute but here's one final
detail which might be connected she felt it was important enough to mention and
it's that one day before the encounter a man was driving his motorcycle right
near this bridge and had a terrible accident actually losing his life when
his motorcycle hit a three a very cool case it's always nice when the witness
can provide an illustration of what they saw certainly helps bring the case to life to me one of the more interesting
things about this case is not only the Oz effect but the way that the humanoid was gesturing at the children it's
really quite odd and also the motorcycle accident that occurred the day before I
wonder if there's a connection there Al I mean it's impossible to say for sure
but it's an interesting aspect to that case and certainly the witness felt it was important enough to
mention now let's move to the next case which I call the little ETS in the tiny
UFO I wanted to present this case because it's so unusual it's a bit of an
outlier uh because in this case the witness described a UFO that was really
small and the ETS inside of it were of course quite a bit smaller but there are
quite a few cases like this and this also is a multiple witness case and it
does have physiological effects this one took place on November 15
1969 in Nancy France and I think you'll agree this is a really unusual and
unique case this very unusual case occurred at 19 R St George this is a
central artery in the city of Nancy France a very crowded area as you can see here and around 5:00 p.m. as the
witness she's Anonymous we know her only as Madame X she's in her 50s she
approached the window of her apartment to feed bird seed to the pigeons this
was an activity she enjoyed and did it daily strangely on this day there were
no pigeons and she quickly saw why because instead she saw this small round
saucer-shaped craft it was approaching at roof level toward her window now when she first saw
it was partly hidden by one of the chimneys coming from the roof so she leaned out the window to get a better
look and she watched this object move out from behind the chimney and approach even closer and she was shocked to see
that it was in fact a flying saucer but not a normal one this thing was Tiny she
estimates it was about 60 cm wide 2 feet roughly the same size of a car tire and
at this point the witness says she heard a quote voice in her head encouraging
her to observe the craft so there was some sort of telepathic link going on here she said the craft looked metallic
it had a small Dome on top and in fact it stopped right in front of her
literally only feet away and inside it she could see two small humanoids
sitting side by side she said that while they looked humanoid they did have sort of an ape like appearance they weren't
perfectly human they did seem to be smiling at her and she said inside of this craft work two quote smiling guys
but very small she says their heads were not much bigger than a person's fist now
at one point the craft tilted allowing her to see the underside which had numerous lights similar to car
headlights now per the witness she was not the only one watching this there were two other people in the street
looking up directly at this thing including a police officer and a bank
guard unfortunately investigators were not able to interview these two witnesses as one had passed away and the
other they were not able to identify but after just a brief moment
of hovering right in front of her this craft moved away spiraling upwards in this weird maneuver and quickly joined
two other similar craft all three of which then moved off in formation to the
north now going inside the witness now smelled an odd acidic kind of chemical
odor and following this encounter her hands and face became swollen which she
believes was due to the fact that these were the parts of her body that were most exposed to the headlights on from
the bottom side of this craft now investigators were really puzzled by this case particularly by the tiny size
of the UFO and the occupant and some of them who who were skeptical
speculated that perhaps the witness had actually banged her head against her window and had hallucinated the entire
experience the witness did admit to an interest in UFOs however for the witness her window
was actually open at the time so this doesn't really make sense as an explanation when I heard about how
Skeptics tried to debunk that case that the lady actually just hit her head on the window and hallucinated the whole
thing you know that actually did make me laugh out loud people will go to ridiculous lengths to explain away a
case and kind of ignore the fact that there might be multiple Witnesses or physiological effects and
so forth if the evidence doesn't fit into their worldview they will simply
discard it so let's move to the next case which
I call visitors to Earth this is a pretty brief account it is a single
witness case there's not a whole lot to it I think if the witness was more
thoroughly interviewed we could probably get some more details but it's certainly a compelling case because this witness
saw the UFO very close up uh this one occurred in the summer of
1972 in Solvang Norway this is in the Oslo area oay brain is the main
investigator to this case he's the muon representative for Norway it was about
700 p.m. as the witness who is anonymous was walking home when she noticed a
classic silver metallic disc-shaped object hovering at a very low level
above some nearby Gardens this disc had large Florida
ceiling Windows around the middle section A flat bottom and a dome on top
your basic Flying Saucer but several other people were in the area working in these Gardens but
not one of them looked up seeing this strange object which was very apparent
the witness did look up and watch as a silver ladder was lowered from the bottom center of the object all the way
to the ground no one came out but looking inside this craft Through the
Windows she could see several figures moving around they all looked human as
far as she could tell all were wearing silver coveralls and helmets she says
that they appeared to be quite busy with some sort of activity inside the craft the object hovered only briefly then
rose up above the Treetops and darted away at high speed now Albert Rosales
who presented this case comments and I quote I wonder if the witness was the
only one meant to see this object so Albert rosali raises an interesting
point in that case was the witness the only one who is meant to see it cuz this was in a fairly crowded area there
should have been other Witnesses but nobody seemed to notice it perhaps some did but like most people just didn't
report it impossible to say for sure but we do know that there's quite a few cases where only one person is seeing a
UFO and there are other people who should be seeing it and they're not so
that certainly has some profound implications and one of the many questions surrounding this subject that
still have to be fully understood now let's move to the next case which I call a UFO parked by the
side of the road quite a few cases like this one this is a really interesting
one this one occurred on September 6th 1973 in pong South Australia this is
actually not too far from the very famous Fay noes case in Australia where
Fay and and her three sons were followed by a UFO which came down and actually
lifted their car up into the sky I did cover that in another episode but a truly interesting case I
can't really tell you why without giving it away so let's just get into it this
case first appeared in the book The Year of the humanoids by David Webb and of
course occurred during this incredible massive wave of humanoid encounters
which were centered Lar largely in the US but also across the world the location of this particular encounter
was between penong and IV tanks in South
Australia now this case is super interesting the woman the main witness
was sleeping in the passenger seat of a semi-trailer as a friend drove along
this lonely remote Eerie Highway in the middle of the vast desert area was late
at night and suddenly she was awakened by a quote voice she apparently did not
hear exactly what it said but it woke her up and almost immediately after Awakening she noticed a brightly lit
egg-shaped object to the left side of the road she said it had an open door at
one end and a large squarish window on the side facing the highway and she
could also see two humanoids two men who look like normal humans
one was outside the craft walking towards this open door and the second one was sitting down inside the object
right in front of this very large window he appeared to be looking Upward at something inside the craft according to
the witness both were wearing shiny white silver full body jumpsuits they
did not appear to pay any attention to the witness or even notice them driving by but as the truck passed the bright
light surrounding this craft began to fade very quickly the witness did immediately alert the driver telling him
to stop the vehicle but by the time she got him to stop the object had already faded to only a single dim white light
now the report doesn't say what happened next here but presumably that is the end of the sighting another pretty short
account yes not a whole lot of details to it but there's a couple of interesting takeaways to it one is why
the heck did this UFO Park right next to the road where it could be seen think it wanted to be seen because why did the
witness hear a voice in her head immediately prior to seeing this object
it woke her up so this looks to me almost as if she was meant to see it or they were alerting her to their presence
it's also strange that the guy was driving the car didn't apparently did not see it so I don't know a very
interesting case for sure and now I move to another one this one I call the
aliens on the beach this occurred in June of 1975 in plad dearin Spain and it is an
unusual case for sure this case took place on a small beach in Spain again
called PL de Marin this was one afternoon in June of 1975 as a young
couple were walking along the beach this is this tiny little beach as you can see when suddenly three disc-shaped objects
appeared on the ocean Horizon very quickly the objects zoomed in a straight
line towards them they were making a low rumbling sound somewhat like the sound
of an air leak and were emitting a thick white streak behind them now they each
stopped about 5 m 15 ft right above the shoreline where they slowly descended
onto the beach Landing in a row about 600 50 m away from the witnesses this is
just under 2,000 ft these craft were classic flying saucers about 10 m or 30
ft in diameter 4 M High 12 ft and we're resting on three or perhaps four Landing
legs now the disc in the center appeared to be all black while the ones on either
side of it the top half was white and the bottom was red all of them did have
a central Dome home in the top Center once they had landed an opening
appeared in each of these three discs and little ladders or stairs came down
and immediately one being came out of each of these openings climbed down
these stairs ladders onto the beach according to the witnesses these figures
looked identical appeared to be about 1 M tall a little over about 3 ft all were
wearing skin tight uniforms with what looked like a wide belt around the waist
now these beings walked in a normal fashion right up to each other the Witnesses were too far away to see any
facial features but the main witness who by the way was a telecommunications worker he
says he did try to communicate telepathically with these ETS he got no response but instead
instead he says he developed a migraine headache following this
encounter after these three figures briefly met up all three returned back
to their respective craft all three of which immediately took off again moving in a straight line the witnesses did go
to look at the beach area where these craft had landed but couldn't see any
traces in terms of footprints or Landing marks you know I just don't know quite
what to think about some of these cases cuz here we have two people walking along the beach when UFOs appear three
of them come zooming towards them come down land three ETS come out and
basically go right back in was this a display why were they Landing why did
they meet up like that it's all quite odd don't know quite what to think of it
certainly another interesting detail is that the witness did try to reach out
telepathically and apparently could not communicate with them but as a result
got a headache very odd certainly an important addition to our understanding
of what's going on here now we move to the next case which I call the little
man in the silver suit this occurred in October of 1977 in the shapar Das mesis area of
Brazil it's quite a rural area and this one is a really interesting case for a
number of reasons it's a very closeup sighting with in landed UFO and an ET
with physiological effects as well as we will see the researcher in this case is
Edison bonaventura Jr and the witness is 78-year-old Jose Benedito
Santos it was one evening in October of 1977 that Jose and his friends had
decided to go out hunting in the shapar Das meses area in maranho Brazil this is
a brawling nature area with a huge natural reserve lots of wildlife lots of
rivers and waterfalls and such but at some point during the night again in
October of 1977 Jose became separated from his friends so he's walking around trying to
find them and this is when he noticed an orange light hovering among the trees so
he's looking at it when suddenly a bright brilliant beam of light
illuminates his surroundings so bright he said it seemed like daytime and at the same time this
hovering orange object is descending to the ground behind a group of trees just a short distance away so now he's very
curious Jose approaches the light and sees that it is in fact an oval-shaped craft with a shiny red Center it was
about 6 M wide 20 ft or so when without warning a 3ft tall human appeared from
behind the object was wearing a silver suit a transparent Fishbowl type helmet
on top you could see a little red tipped antenna attached to it you can see the drawing he made here he did say that it
looked like this silver suit had three golden stripes on it but mostly Jose was
impressed by the beings large dark staring eyes in fact one of them looked
right at him with a penetra in gaze when this happened Jose's curiosity turned to
fear especially when this figure began to suddenly approach and as Jose says
when he came closer I felt scared but I calmed down and fainted I woke up later
with my colleagues around asking what happened so Jose told them what happened
they absolutely believed him he was a very sincere witness they knew him well
following this encounter Jose says he felt a general weakness in his body he also did notice a small burn mark with
tiny little puncture wounds in his neck it did heal quickly over the next several days I do feel for the witness
in this case it might have been quite a shock to be that close to an ET so I can't really fault him for fainting dead
away it's a shame though because makes you wonder what would have happened if he was able to maintain Consciousness
it's also interesting because of the physiological effect also the location there are quite a few
cases of ETS and UFOs hovering over nature reserves which I think speaks to
one of their missions their goals on this planet which is their concern over
how we're treating the environment this comes up again and again in firsthand
contact cases could very well be that this was more than just a sighting that
he was taken on board given that we don't really know if how long he was
there with the ETS but certainly a fascinating case and pretty well
verified as well all right next case this one was professionally
investigated it is a fairly brief account again but it is a multiple
witness case with some outside corroboration very closeup encounter with humanoids in a UFO I call this one
the ETS on the balcony this Ur in the summer of 1979 outside of Danville
California this multiple witness case is virtually unknown but it was published in the magazine The Missing Link this
case was reported by a lady by the name of Natalie we do not know her last name
at the time of her encounter she was 15 years old and it was around 900 p.m. one
summer evening again in 1979 Natalie was in the car with her father
her mother Noella and her Uncle Raymond they were driving from Victorville
California to Danville and looking up at some point
they all noticed what first appeared to be a very bright star but it started
moving seemed to be coming closer and as it approached they realized that it was in fact a flying
saucer they were just arriving in Danville it approached them for a while
paced their car but as they stopped off at a gas station this craft moved so low
in the sky that it looked to them like it was coming in for a landing it appeared to be massive they said and was
very close to the witnesses at this point close enough that they could see what looked like a quote balcony this
balcony went around the circumference of the craft and standing on this balcony were several very tall alien looking
beings each of them were wearing silver uniforms that looked like diving suits
it appeared to Natalie that these beings were at least 7t tall the whole family
watched the craft and humanoids for just a few brief moments till suddenly
without warning the tall figures walked back into the craft the craft then emitted a high-pitched noise and zoomed
upwards at very high speed they continued the drive home and talking
about it the next day they found out that there were other Witnesses because some people approached them and asked if
they had seen the object over Danville the previous evening so yeah apparently
there were other Witnesses a lot of interesting aspects to that case I like it because it is a multiple witness case
and again they saw this pretty close up it paced their car they're pulling over
to a gas station and that's when it comes down so again it looks like there's a intention in these cases where
the ETS are showing themselves I find it really fascinating this is why I wanted to include this case that the
ETS came out on this little balcony on the outside of the UFOs which may sound
unusual but there's quite a few cases of this where ETS will actually step outside of their craft while it's still
hovering in the air the very famous father Gill case in Papa New New Guinea
is a good example of this so there's another case where ETS are standing out
on a balcony really interesting and I'm so glad that the witnesses did find other
witnesses to saw UFO activity in that area at that time but apparently they're
the only ones who saw the humanoids Now we move to the next case
which I call conversation with an extraterrestrial this is a really
extensive case quite an important case in Argentina fairly wellknown you may
have heard of it this occurred on August 24 1985 in the IU Zeno area of Argentina of
all the cases in this compilation this one I think is definitely one of the most extensive and important and
interesting because the witness has got a whole lot of information and as the
title implies did have a conversation with extraterrestrials this case took place
on Route 12 in between Posados and corantes the Witnesses are Anonymous
we'll call them Jose who is age 41 and his wife Maria age 36 they're both
doctors and again driving along Route 12 they were driving pretty slowly because
there were animals occasionally crossing the road this was late at night after midnight and they had just passed the
exit at IU Zeno in Argentina now ahead of them suddenly on
the road without warning they saw unusual looking very colorful pink and
yellow lights almost pastel looking now they did think for a moment this might
be a truck but these lights didn't look like a truck Jose slowed down even more
and as they got closer they could see that these lights were right on the highway so bright that Jose had to stop
his wife wanted him to continue but he was unable to see past these Bright Lights couldn't really see the road they
were so bright could only drive very slowly so he's inching forward it was at
this point he noticed three men three humanoid figures on the side of the road
approaching their car and I'll just quote hose directly as he says I cannot
believe what happened to us it is extraordinary we saw three men on the
side of the road and further up there was a strong light as my wife had recently been been assaulted she became
nervous and when one of the men signaled me to stop she became very ill I
approached the shoulder where The Tall Man dressed in a kind of tight fitting onesie signaled Me by raising his hand
he approached the driver's side and speaking calmly and correctly said to me
don't be afraid we are not going to hurt you we just want to get to know you we
are from another planet we come from a place where there are are seasons winds
rain cold heat just like you we are only different in some aspects we travel in
those devices you call UFOs Don't Be Afraid now hearing this Maria had a
almost complete nervous breakdown she was screaming to her husband Jose start
the car let's get out of here Jose tried but at this point the engine had no
power so he's looking at these guys by the side of the road he says their
jumpsuits were dark in color except for a light strip where the shoulders were
their hair was of medium length not long or short their faces were very handsome
he said that they had large Pleasant eyes and they spoke verbally out loud in
fluent Argentinian Spanish the strange man then told them
that they came from a planet called mate they said it was very similar to Earth only slightly larger
he then looked at Maria the ET did and said don't be afraid we are not going to
hurt you we are leaving as we do not want to cause you any problems wait for
the ship to rise and then start the car engine now before the man left he did
say some more words he said that there were many people in the world who already knew of their existence but they
don't speak out that they the ETS do not know why he tried again to calm down
Maria asked her to tell everyone that they are good he was smiling as he spoke
then he made a very unusual request of Jose and I'll just let Jose say what he
experienced as Jose says in his own words he asked us for something to take
home as a souvenir and I gave him what I found in the glove compartment a bottle
of perfume some toothpaste a packet of biscuits and one one note a money note
and he said explaining in each case what we were using them for the man thanked
me and shook my hand in farewell I hardly felt any temperature it was normal they asked me to say that they
are good they don't want to hurt us they just want to get to know us we have come
to meet you tell everyone not to be afraid then he said goodbye turned
around and went back to where two other men similar to him were waiting for him about 30 m away he joined them and they
disappeared from sight few minutes later which seemed like an eternity we saw a
strange and powerful light rise from the side of the road disappearing rapidly into the starry night we were stupified
open-mouthed and only then was I able to start the engine of the car so the
couple immediately drove to the home of Norma Massa she's a well-known journalist who lived not far away they
knew her address they knocked on her door at about 2:30 a.m. telling her that they had suffered an accident and needed
help she reluctantly let them in asked them what happened they refused at first
to divulge any details but were finally persuaded only on the condition of
absolute anonymity and speaking to Norma Jose said and I quote we went here
remembering that you had written many articles that I read I knew that you lived here and that is why we dared to
come to your house because my wife was really very ill but when we realized
that we had been in front of a being from space it was very difficult for us to believe but the facts were as I told
them to you without removing or adding any details let everyone think what they
want I only know that something extraordinary happened to us and I
regret not having asked this being from space more questions was really an
unforgettable incredible experience personally after what happened to me I
am sure that I spoke with an alien being who came to fulfill a mission of reproach me with human
beings so arriving in Norma's house they gave Maria a tranquilizer she fell
asleep and Norma decided let's go investigate as Norma says we left the
lady to rest and went with her husband to the meeting place where we saw nothing and where we and where we
returned yesterday morning without finding any Trace with the new day and after having
maintained a long conversation which allowed us to know the seriousness of both the couple left back to kentus
Capital so Norma again a journalist ended up writing an article about the couple's experience and in this article
she quotes Jose extensively and this is an important quote as Jose says I am
moved to make this statement by one circumstance alone and that is that man
asked me to tell everyone who wants to know us and not to be afraid that they
are good beings I do this because if all this contributes to clarifying the whole
mystery of extraterrestrial beings we will have contributed to sharing with Humanity that we are part of if all of
this turns out to be fantasy invented by Americans or Russians who own highly sophisticated and fast spaceships we
will have wasted our time but I personally am sure that I spoke with a being from another world a kind being
sweet at times concerned about us who only wanted perhaps to fulfill a mission
of getting closer to Earth and to humanity and although I must admit that I was very scared it will be one of the
most beautiful and fascinating memories that I've ever experienced and I hope it happens to me again because then I will
get out of the car exchange opinions and ask what I did not do now ask as a
result of the strong impression I had so again this incident took place
very near to Wakita Dam one of the largest dams in the world actually after
publication of the article there was some interesting corroboration cuz Jose Cabrera The General Secretary of the
large hydroelectric Works said that at 1:00 a.m. on that morning while working
at this Dam he and several others saw a glowing object which moved around in the
sky and hovered in the area later another witness came forward a farmer who said he was drawn outside by his
animals acting up and he saw a quote luminous object so he saw UFOs on more than one
occasion this was just two days before Jose's and Maria's encounter and as it
turns out this area seems to be a UFO magnet as there are many sightings that have taken place in this area and in
fact some people as you can see have even gotten photographs and moving films
of them clearly an important case where the witnesses got a whole lot of information about why the ETS are here
and it's typical of so many cases we see with a UFO stopping a car along a
Highway late at night seems a bit opportunistic Etc someone driving along
and like hey let's say hi to these folks looks like that's what's happening in this case though again they may have
been there because of this very large Hydro El electric Dam we know ETS are in
fact attracted to these kinds of locations but it's certainly a fascinating case with the ETS imparting
so much inform information and basically just wanting to announce their presence and let people know that they have
nothing to fear from them that they're not here to take over and are just contacting people all over the world to
basically announce their presence a cool case such a shame the
wife was so frightened now let's move to the next case which also has some interesting
insights into the nature of UFOs and ETS I call this one the alien from the black
sphere this one took place in October of 1989 9 in San Pio AEV in Italy and this
is an interesting case because it actually involves a series of events Landing traces physiological effects
animal reactions quite a bit of evidence to this one also multiple witness case
and as we'll see a very unusual series of events this case comes from the very
prolific and respected researcher Moreno tambellini of C the central eico Nel UFO
group The Witnesses are two elderly Farmers from SV this is near the rural muello area of
Florence Italy it was throughout 1988 and 1989 that they began to see this
strange figure dressed in a black jumpsuit actually floating levitating
around their property in fact they called him the fish man because he moved easily through the air just like a fish
in water and when he would appear he always arrived in a large dark silver
sphere this craft sometimes landed and damaged their crops and when this object
would appear it would move around in near silence making only a soft whisper
quote like a breath now the figure that came out of this had long black hair and
reddish eyes though the farmers said this may have been a helmet with a the visor but at first thinking the being
was having trouble with its craft which was quite low the couple tried to approach to help and each time the
figure would shout at them apparently verbally Don't Come Close because you'll
burn so after no less than four events like this the couple became increasingly
frustrated and afraid because some of their crops were being destroyed then
one morning around 11:00 a.m. this large black sphere appeared again
once again landing and crushing and destroying their crops the same dark suited figure emerged and began flying
around her dog started going crazy barking at the strange creature and now
tired of the constant intrusions and angry at the destruction of his food crops the husband finally decided he'd
had enough he grabbed a pitchfork and rushed towards this flying being in an
attempt to Chase it away to his shock the being sent out a beam of light from
its eyes or helmet area which instantly paralyzed the farmer now thinking that
her husband's life was in danger his wife screamed for her husband to run away but he couldn't and at that moment
the being returned inside the sphere which remained hovering a few meters above the ground for a short time and
then after a few minutes it made a loud noise Rose upwards and departed It Away
In A Flash now I can't fault the witness for running towards this ET with a
pitchfork as we can see probably not a good idea what's really interesting to
me about this case is that the ET warned him over and over again don't get too close you could get burned and when the
witness did not heed those instructions that's when he was struck by a beam of
light so it doesn't appear that this was a hostile encounter in any way often at
think it's people's fear of what's Happening that causes them to label an experience as negative which is
understandable if you're an abject Terror it's not a pleasant experience but again no real good evidence that ETS
are here to hurt harm take over cause people problems think if you take a real
close hard objective look at ET contact especially the onboard experiences you
get a much clearer picture of what's going on here so let's let's move to the next case this one is so profound this
one did get a lot of publicity you may have heard of it it's a really unusual
case I don't know of any quite like it there's a few but not quite like this
one multiple witness case some interesting evidence as well I call this
one a knight in a tree with aliens this occurred on May 17 1997 in the LA rum
morosa area of Mexico and what an unusual case this is
this case was initially investigated in part by haime Manan but many other
investigators have looked into it and it's become a very well-known event in Mexican euphology it involves three
young men Raul Fabricio Garcia Salvador vien NOA and Lon Gonzalez through all
teenagers and they had joined a hiking Expedition with a group of other young men planning on camping in the
wilderness of the LA rumorosa area this is outside of teate
in Baja California in Mexico now again May 17
1977 they were two you know hiking for quite some time and they were about 6
hours into the hike when it was apparent that their guide had become disoriented and
lost so they continued walking for another 2 hours without any real idea of where they were going when Fabrizio made
an important decision he decided that he his two friends Salvador and lemon were
going to separate from the group in hopes of finding water and figuring out where the heck they were now this area
was quite dry and arid and they could see a much Greener Mountain ahead of them so they headed in that direction
they did have a compass but it wasn't working they walked deep into the night when it became clear to them that they were
going to have to stop and rest for the evening now they had seen rattlesnakes and other Wildlife so they didn't want
to sleep on the ground they found a very large oak tree with big thick branches
and they decided to climb up there secure themselves to the branches with their belts and spend the night up there
safe from any Predators or wild animals this is the tree right here that they
actually climbed the men were trying to fall asleep when Fabrizio looked up and
saw some star-like lights moving around and he shouted out to the others look the stars are moving the other boys
looked up and saw these objects after a while they seemed to move off and they stopped paying attention until they saw
more lights these were lower and they thought for a moment that perhaps the other
group of boys were approaching with flashlights and coming to rescue them so
they started shouting out to them announcing their location but as Salvador says they came
closer to us a little more I've never seen anything like this so he told his friends you better stop yelling because
you don't know what you're seeing and it was at this point that the boys now saw a UFO a classic saucer as
they says a silvery shape a discoidal shape it was iridescent and glowing it
had a large Dome on top h holes a weird strange light mist started
to come down around the area at one point this object sent down a brilliant beam of light on the tree and then it
began to re release more than a dozen glowing orbl likee objects which started
darting around them moving around the tree moving in geometric
formations this went on for a little while and then the orbs returned back into the craft now there was no noise at
any time coming from the craft or the orbs but the next thing these boys knew
there were several quote small luminous beings with big heads black eyes they
were descending down the hill towards them and as they did this some of them were looking down at the ground and
picking things up others were crouching down the boys watched paralyzed with
fear as the beings approached the base of the tree they knew that these were
physical beings as they could hear their footsteps they estimate these beings were about 1 m 3 ft tall with skinny
bodies long spindly limbs the most noticeable thing was their eyes they
didn't see any nose so these were apparently typical Grays although they were glowing and as lemon says to his
friend are you seeing what I'm seeing fabrio was stunned silent at first and
finally told his friend to keep quiet quote so they don't know we here there
were three or four groups of them these little orbs of light reappeared continued to circle the area while these
little glowing beings walked back and forth beneath the tree the boys really had no choice but to keep quiet and wait
to see what happened and at this point these little beings did not appear to be aware of the
boys in the trees but one of the boys dropped his pocket knife and immediately
there was a reaction these beings became camouflaged in a weird way looking
almost transparent they could still see their outlines and at this point some of them seemed to actually climb the tree
they could tell because they were leaving behind this weird fluorescent wherever they moved little fluorescent
Footprints Salvador says at one point one of them actually came right up to him and touched him on the chest peered
under his hat trying to look at his face and this went on for a long time I mean
these beings remained for a period of hours until about 5 a.m. when it began
to get light and at this point these beings disappeared one by one in a flash
of light so finally climbing down from the tree in the Morning Light the boys did
notice two unusual things there was a series of stones set up in the formation
of a triangle they did not see this the evening before it's possible it was
there but they don't think so but they also found several small three-toed
Footprints so this was quite an amazing experience for them and soon they did go public with their story and it went
viral they eventually appeared on radio and television shows it appeared in newspaper articles turned out there were
other Witnesses because many people in the area came forth to see that they had seen UFOs
in this area and in fact many said that they had seen glowing beings in this area as well it had quite a reputation
going way way back really many many years to the original native inhabitants
who had a mythology about beings in this area so this area quickly began to gain
a reputation as a UFO hotspot and people started to travel there specifically to
see UFOs and they were successful some did see some amazing things in fact a
group of journalists went there and saw glowing beings which really put a lot of
people's attention on this area eventually fabrio did write a full
length very well-received Spanish language book on their experience which he titled El no on El Arbol or the KN in
the tree all three Witnesses say that their lives were changed forever by The
Experience Fabrizio did go under hypnosis to recall more details uh couldn't really recall much
but he suspects that they might have been taken on board uh he would later have further
encounters he does feel that this experience not only improved his health
physically but provided a whole new outlook on life and provided him with a spiritual
awakening he does say that when he was a little boy he used to see a quote woman in white who he assumed was a ghost but
following this encounter he now wonders if those Early Childhood experiences might have been ET related I mean all I
can say to that case is wow actually spoke with researcher Albert Rosal about
it and he is equally impressed with it and as you can see it not only had a
profound effect on the witnesses but on all the people in the area who
live around this encounter and it continues to make waves I mean the
gentleman wrote an entire fulllength book about their experience it's so unusual for an
encounter to the last that long too and like the witness says it wouldn't surprise me if there was more to it and
perhaps they were taken on board but we don't have any direct evidence of that
so it appears to be in close en corner of the Third kind uh so I don't know it's really a
odd case but certainly an important one now let's move to the last case of this
compilation this one's super fascinating it is a single witness case without any
real evidence to it though it does have some sort of interesting corroborative
evidence which is peripherally related I guess I call this one the ET who walked
on water that alone I think makes this case really
unusual uh this one occurred in May of 1999 in cornerbrook this is in New
Finland Canada and a very close-up encounter that seemed quite
Fortis with some interesting premonitions involved with it so yeah
some real interesting and unusual aspects to this case especially what the ET was doing Ryan vik is the main
researcher in this case he's from Canada he's investigated a whole lot of encounters and he received a written
report from this witness who requested total anonymity this case took place in
a very rural area immediately outside of the town of cornerbrook in New Finland Canada where incidentally the witness
says he's had a few odd experiences but this main one occurred one afternoon in
May of 1999 when he was taking a walk he was going up this long low Mountain Area
when a feeling of quote uneasiness came over him in fact it was so strong it
prompted him to cut his walk short and instead of walking back the way he came
for some odd reason he took a shortcut which required him to slog his way
through this marshy area towards where he had parked his car he was about 5
minutes away from his car when another strange impulse overcame him the feeling of uneasiness was now gone but for some
reason he decided to make a quick stop at a nearby Pond known as Three Mile Dam
he had often sat here enjoyed the nature watching baby beavers and their parents
frolicking in this Lake and I'll just quote the witness directly as he says I
have to preface this with the fact that I have never had any experiences like this before or since I don't hallucinate
I'm not medicated I don't drink or do drugs what I saw was so shocking it affected everything in my
life I walked up The Path and as I was nearing the pond something caught my
attention I saw a tall white humanoid figure hovering just over the surface of
the water this thing was about 20 m in front of me and seemed to be in a
trans-like state just floating in the air it sounds crazy but it was solid and
big and dressed in a white suit from head to toe and had what looked like a gray Shield over where its eyes would be
a pure white suit with a dark Shield I was terrified I was so scared that I was
paralyzed and the moment I could move I turned slowly and started to walk along
the side of the pond by this time the being had sort of Awakened out of this trance it was suspended not moving until
it noticed me and we acknowledged each other and without so much as a splash of
water was on the other side of the pond opposite to me it glided silently across
the Pond's surface very fast and I clearly heard twigs and branches breaking as it moved quickly through the
woods I have never run so fast in my life I ran back to the car and drove
back to cornerbrook and I wasn't sure who to tell weird stuff so we did
finally find find Brian vik and reported his encounter and regarding his previous
weird experiences that he had in this area he said that in
1994 he and his mom were walking in this same location when suddenly his dog ran
off to bark at something so they followed the dog and They Came Upon A group of small trees Spruce Birch and
willow trees which had been mysteriously bent at a 90° angle and appeared to be
woven around each other and swirled in a counterclockwise Direction at about
waist height these were not big trees they were about 2 to 10 in in diameter
but as the witness says it struck us as extremely odd in that none of the trees
were snapped now there is a water treatment plant and a dam next to this area again
which is known to attract ETS so perhaps that was the draw here in this case how
crazy is that this humanoid figure just floating inches above the water looked
to the witness almost like it was walking on water but no it was apparently levitating while he didn't
see a UFO given that this figure was wearing this skintight jumpsuit covered
its entire body a helmet with a visor doesn't sound like a ghostly
figure and also super interesting is that there's a little hydroelectric plant in this area again as we saw in a
previous case this is something that ETS do seem to be attracted to studying or
checking out for one reason or another just an overall interesting case and
especially the event before it where the witness was walking with his mother and saw what looked like a little UFO
landing nest for lack of a better word Landing traces of course you can't connect it directly
to this encounter but I wonder about it because again this area with the
hydroelectric plant that makes sense all right that's it for today you
guys 12 cases coming from all over the world all different types of humanoids
compelling evidence of various types multiple Witnesses it's funny I still get
comments from some of you folks out there like you're skeptical and I get it
I came to this field as a skeptic but the fact is I've now covered literally
thousands of humanoid cases on this channel alone and there's still a lot more where they these came from so if
you want to discard one case go right ahead I'll bring another to your attention if you want to discard that
one go ahead I will bring another I'm going to keep bringing them until people recognize that this is happening this is
real there is evidence to support it it is going on it's an important subject I
think it has the potential to change the way we all think about ourselves each other and our place in the universe
that's why I'm doing these videos so thank you once again for watching I truly appreciate it I love you all very
much hope you have a great weekend and until next time keep asking those hard
questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun
I will see you next Friday bye
