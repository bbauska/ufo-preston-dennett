Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and  today I'd like to talk to you about a wonderful  
case of UFO contact involving a man by the name of  Stan Hughes after interviewing him we've continued  
to stay in touch he's become a really good friend  he's visited my home on multiple occasions and  
yeah I'd really like to share with you his amazing  story of his contact with the star people now Stan  
has worked as a teacher most of his life he moved  into school administration he's now retired his  
wife was a teacher he's married he's got kids  he's a really great guy he currently lives in  
the upper Idaho Panhandle he's a Native American  Native American ancestry he's part of the blood  
tribe of Canada his name in Seneca and I don't  think I'm gonna be able to pronounce this right  
but I'll give it a try is ha way Dee's sauce  which means man seeking his people I got a  
very interesting case of UFO contact that I think  is really important and so yeah that's when I'd  
be talking about right now his first sighting  close-up was around 1989 he was with a friend  
at the University of Illinois visiting the campus  and was out there late at night when they both saw  
a very low level saucer-shaped object scoot right  overhead it was a very interesting sighting and  
quite compelling but certainly not his only one  was wasn't long later was really around the early  
1990s that he and his family started to visit  Lake Pend Oreille near their home on the upper  
Idaho Panhandle Lake Pend Oreille is a beautiful  lake it's Idaho's largest lake it's freshwater  
lake very deep a thousand over a thousand feet  in parts so and really beautiful often they go  
there and spend the day and at night they would  watch these what they called nocturnal lights UFOs  
sometimes there'd be four or five sometimes ten  or more sometimes none would show up but usually  
there was something and this started to become  a fun family activity where they just go to the  
lake and watch these objects hovering darting at  right-angles scooting around and they had a real  
fun time watching these things one time in 1992  summer of 1992 they were up the lake they were  
sitting on a little bluff overlooking the lake  watching these nocturnal lights darting around  
when suddenly one of them comes zooming down  to almost a level it's very close and Stan's  
little daughter she suddenly says daddy daddy  they're reading my mind what should I do Stan  
turned to her and said tell them I love you at  that moment she says I in her sweet little voice  
I love you and at that moment this UFO flares  up bright bright blue scoots down a little bit  
comes towards them and flies over their heads  it was a thrilling encounter it was so bright  
it left after images on all the retinas but was  really a benevolent encounter so this was that  
was probably one of their closest at Lake Pend  Oreille but Stan wasn't long after that he had  
probably one of the most amazing encounters of his  life a face-to-face contact with one of the star  
people this occurred in 1997 Stan had traveled  from his home in the upper Idaho Panhandle to go  
camping in Washington State at Thunder Mountain  it's a beautiful very remote and natural area he  
brought his dog you know took us pick up spent  a night camping saw a few of these UFOs darting  
around which wasn't terribly unusual and early the  next morning he starts to head home he's driving  
his pickup along a long dirt road which is a more  direct route towards his destination it's very  
remote there were no other cars on the road though  that's not unusual and he started to feel really  
strange almost sleepier entranced and the feeling  got so strong he actually pulled over for a second  
his dog was asleep on this front seat next to him  when suddenly he hears this loud whooshing noise  
and this giant silver object lands on the road in  front of his car it covers the entire width of the  
road it's perfectly spherical shiny metallic  silver like chrome and stunningly beautiful an  
opening appears in the front and this man steps  out Stan Stan described man as being about six  
feet tall with long shoulder-length brown hair  dark eyes dark skin looked almost middle-eastern  
he said very handsome man he was wearing a  jumpsuit a brown jumpsuit and silver boots  
and Stan was destruct by how handsome this man  looked and the man smiled you know he stepped out  
of this object walked up to the front of Stan's  car smiled raised his hand and just a friendly  
gesture Stan was overwhelmed with the emotion at  this point and had this feeling of I don't want  
to be here her take me with you he actually said  this take me with you please will you I don't want  
to be here will you take me with you and at that  moment the man's smile dropped his hand felt to  
a side and he got an incredibly sad look on his  face turned around walked back into the object  
which promptly took off Stan stood there sat  there stunned for a second as this feeling of  
intense sadness just washed over him like water  he said and it was a feeling which would persist  
for several weeks afterwards actually this whole  experience had a very profound effect on him his  
dog slept right through the whole thing the  truck was still running you know he hadn't  
fallen asleep he so it appears to have been a  fully conscious encounter though it wasn't in  
a sort of a weirdly calm like state and he drove  on so he continued to have encounters after that  
one evening you know his son had not been feeling  well some years following this incident my son had  
gone to Norway as a foreign exchange student and  came back feeling depressed and it was just having  
a real hard time with it he sought conventional  therapy but it wasn't working so one evening Stan  
decided to go camping at Thunder Mountain again  was an activity he enjoyed and this nocturnal  
light appeared this UFO it was very low and it was  pulsating and then suddenly would come swooping  
down at which point Stan would feel this feeling  of dread or fear then it would back off the fear  
would become less and then it would pull Satan  come closer and become brighter and this wave  
of fear came over him again this happened over  and over again you know it was there for about  
20 minutes it became clear to stand that it was  trying to warn him of something but he couldn't  
figure out what it was until the next morning  when he returned home and discovered that his  
son had been going through a crisis so at this  point you know they decided to seek another form  
of treatment the conventional treatment wasn't  working so they decided to try a traditional  
Native American ceremony and that's what they did  they met with relatives and friends at Sullivan  
Lake in Washington it's another very beautiful  natural setting to do a healing ceremony they had  
a medicine woman someone that Stan knows and she  meditated on Stan's sons problem and she said I  
know what the problem is he has a spirit attached  to them he has a spirit attachment of a young man  
now this suddenly made sense because as it turned  out the home that Stan's son had been staying in  
in Norway earlier while the son had committed  suicide only a few months before Stan's son came  
to stay in the same bedroom so apparently somehow  the spirit became attached to him and following  
the Native American healing ceremony suddenly  the children at the camp started screaming and  
pointing at an apparition and sure enough there  was the apparition of the young student who had  
committed suicide he quickly disappeared and as  part of Stan's son healing to cap it all off he  
was instructed to jump into Sullivan Lake which  is icy cold by the way so he jumped in and at  
that moment a UFO appeared there was a very loud  humming noise it took over the camp everyone  
became silent the trees started shaking and this  huge huge black disc appeared was covered with  
lights all around the perimeter and it just slowly  moved off the people there all felt like it had  
come to celebrate the healing ceremony so yeah  these are the kinds of experiences stan has had  
they've been very benevolent he still continues to  go to Lake Pend Oreille and occasionally see the  
lights whizzing around up there he calls the star  people the woge a and he believes they are his  
ancestors actually or that they're related as you  know this is actually a very popular belief among  
Native American peoples he's yeah he's become a  real good friend he's also a writer by the way  
he's written a number of books including a book  by the title of Medicine seeker there's another  
wonderful novel he wrote called children of the  Bluefish about life in early America among Native  
Americans most recently he's written a book called  The Adventures of Sophia warrior princess and he  
has more coming his Stan's story yeah I think  it's an important one because it shows that  
UFO contact can be very positive and friendly his  story is presented in chapter 5 of my book inside  
UFOs and it's one of many cases of people who have  had very benevolent friendly contact the kind you  
don't often hear a lot about so yeah thanks  very much for listening and keep having fun
