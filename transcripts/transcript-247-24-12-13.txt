THE LITTLE PEOPLE: THE HIGH STRANGENESS EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONTACT STORY OF KELLI ANDERSON
Dec 13, 2024

Summary:
Dec 13, 2024
This video presents the high strangeness ET contacts of Kelli Anderson (pseudonym) from southern California. Her story involves a wide variety of paranormal entities and events, including ghosts, extraterrestrials, UFOs and missing time, psychic and paranormal events, OBEs, nature spirits, precognition, orb visitations, weird owl stories, an apparent miracle and more.

Kelli Anderson was only eight years old when she experienced her first visitation by strange entities. She was living with her father, mother, and older sister in a rural home in Escondido. She was excited because she had just gotten her own room. One evening in 1968, she had just gone to bed and closed her eyes when a low rumbling sound filled the room followed by the sense of a presence, and a glowing red light illuminating the interior of her bedroom. Kelly was too afraid to open her eyes and lay there in terror until the presence departed. It was to be the first of many strange events. She found out that both her mother and grandmother had also reported a wide variety of paranormal activity. She herself became drawn towards spirituality.

At age eleven, a traumatic event altered the course of her life. Her parents moved to the town of Julian, and Kelli found herself in an isolated rural area surrounded by huge forests and mountains. It was the ideal place to heal from the recent terrible events she had endured. She developed a great love for nature, and especially trees. This led to a series of very unusual lucid dream encounters with a nature spirit. At the same time, she and her family experienced ghostly activity in their new home, and Kelli had more visitations by strange entities. She didn’t know who or what they were, but they did not appear to be human.

Then, at age twelve, Kelli had a dramatic UFO encounter that resulted in missing time. It was an encounter that would become buried in amnesia for many years. Not long after this, a disappointing Christmas morning led to one of the most miraculous events of her entire life, an encounter so strange, wonderful, and mysterious that to this very day she struggles to understand it. She continued to have more powerful premonitions and realized that she was exhibiting a strong psychic ability.

Then she met a Native American boy who lived on the nearby Santa Ysabel Indian Reservation. Spending lots of time there, she experienced more profoundly unusual and inexplicable events. Then, when her boyfriend joined the Army, they decided to get married so they could remain together. Kelli traveled with him to Germany, where she became pregnant. It was then that she was visited by strange troll-like entities who came into her bedroom and seemed to be interested in her unborn baby. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy, but as he grew up, he also began to complain of entities coming into his room too.

Time passed, and Kelli and her husband ending up getting a divorce. It was a difficult time in her life. That’s when Kelli had an experience with magical glowing orbs entering into her bedroom and bringing a sense of joy and love that healed her of her depression. But strange events continued, including a lifelong series of weird owl encounters. But soon, one incredibly profound and unusual owl experience would occur which left her and her children utterly amazed.

Driven to do more research to understand her encounters, Kelli learned that the Native Americans have some profoundly interesting theories regarding the nature of “little people” and aliens, and that many of them have encountered a wide variety of unusual entities. She soon realized that she was very likely an ET contactee, though she leaves her interpretations open as to what exactly this means. She also received a another visitation by the nature spirit from her childhood, who answered some of the many questions she had surrounding that very strange series of encounters.

Strange events continued, including her home filling with eerie blue and green light on multiple occasions, one of which was witnessed by a visiting friend. Kelli now accepts the fact that her life has always been filled with mysterious and supernatural events, and that such things a normal part of her life.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs in the
Paranormal I have a very special episode for you today which I call the little people the high strangeness ET contact
story of Kelly Anderson that is a pseudonym she did not want her real name used but she did a
write up for me of all of her amazing experiences I also interviewed her firsthand and wow her story is so
amazing because involves a very wide variety of not only ET events but the
Paranormal including but not limited to UFOs missing time ETS ghosts psychic
events precognition a tree Spirit owl stories
orbs obes an apparent miracle and more so really a series of really unusual
events and some startling unique I did write up her experience in
my book humanoids and high strangeness in that book I really tried to embrace
all the events that surround ET contact ET contact usually comes along with a
wide variety of paranormal events of all kinds and that's certainly true with Kelly Anderson her story is particularly
profound super interesting really unique in a lot of ways and I think you'll find it really compelling and interesting ing
so let's just get started she didn't want to admit it but recent events had
convinced Kelly that she was a complete freak it was 1968 she was only 8 years
old just starting out but so many strange things were happening to her that had no rational explanation she
didn't know what else to think at the time she and her older sister I'll call her Julie that is a pseudonym who was
one year older had recently gotten their own rooms her father was a music teacher
and he had moved his music room into the garage so that the girls could each have their own space at the time they were
living in a three bedroom house in Escondido California now they weren't a
religious family but Kelly did have a friend who was and Kelly began to develop an interest in the concept of
God so when her friend received a new Bible in Sunday school Kelly asked her
if she could have her old one and her friend agreed and as Kelly says I often
read it by flashlight in bed at night Jesus's words were all in red print and
I read and reread those red words with Fascination and after such a night of reading something happened that after
Decades of wondering about I now believe shaped the rest of my life it was late
at night and Kelly was getting very sleepy so she decided to stop reading and just go to sleep as she says I just
snapped off the flashlight and was adjusting resting my eyes to the darkness when there came a sudden low
Rumble and the sound of the glass at my window trembling my immediate thought
was that a burglar was trying to force the window open I shut my eyes tight in fear thinking that my survival depended
on Faking that I was asleep and knew nothing my heart pounded with Dread at
the sound of heavy slow footsteps coming to the side of my bed I figured I was
done for as the edge of my bed sagged with the heaven of someone sitting beside me heart- rcing panic ensued as I
clung to the idea that he might let me live if he thought I was asleep so I kept my eyes glued shut I knew that they
were leaning down right next to my face then there was a clicking sound and
light flooded through my closed eyelids showing red now I knew he wasn't being
sneaky and had no fear of me at all the light seemed to peer through my closed
eyes for an eternity as I struggled not to move and give myself away so Kelly wanted to scrunch her eyes
more tightly closed but she was smart enough to know that such an action would look phony and it was at this point she
felt a terrible itch on her arm but was even too afraid to scratch that lest her
movement betray the fact that she was faking being asleep then to her great
relief the pressure on the mattress disappeared there was another loud clicking sound and the Eerie red light
went out she didn't hear any footsteps moving away so she still feared that her
mysterious Intruder was lurking in the room and perhaps testing her so she continued feigning sleep she lay there
in unmoving Terror for most of the rest of the night too afraid to open her eyes
and not until she sensed the morning light coming in through the windows heard the birds start to sing did she
take action not even daring to inspect her room she sprung from her bed ran for
her life and landed in a frenzied Heap on her parents' bed waking them both up from a sound sleep and breathless she
ranted and raved about the Intruder who had haunted her all night long now her
mother listened with concern and then said you were just dreaming it was a
nightmare Kelly protested she knew this wasn't a nightmare she was awake but her mother just shook her head unconvinced
as Kelly says I knew it wasn't a dream and if it wasn't a bir ER I decided it
must have been some sort of monster I've periodically thought of possibilities over the years and still have no
definite conclusions if only I had had the nerve to open my eyes I think it
would take me nearly 40 more years of living and inexplicable experiences before I would begin to see a pattern in
the strange events how interesting is that as we know ET contact usually does
start at a very early age and I suspect that this was ET contact certainly Kelly
has considered it but again it's a little bit ambiguous could have been a ghostly visitation hard to say for sure
but certainly super interesting and it was following this that her life really began to change she blossomed into a
whole series of psychic events that really changed the way she thought about
the world so yeah the next chapter is all about psychic events so it wasn't
long after this strange childhood bedroom encounter that Kelly had a very odd dream at the time she didn't think
there was much to it as she says one morning I woke up with the image of my
own hand on a piece of glass that was spidering out in cracked patterns beneath it that was all just a snapshot
image but the dream had a certain nagging insistence about it that in time I would learn to
recognize later that day she and her family went to visit relatives in the town of Julian Kelly and her cousins
were playing around in their uncle's Feed and Supply store and while crawling among the bales of alala and sacks of
feed Kelly heard and felt something crack below her hand and as she says I
looked down and saw the exact image of my dream upon waking that morning the
weirdness of it made me scream unintentionally but it hadn't hurt i' just ruined our fun game and got us all
in trouble when asked why I screamed I just said I don't know so after a few
more incidents like this where Kelly had inexplicable forn knowledge of events
she began to question her sanity and wonder what the heck was going on with her so unable to understand she went to
her mother and told her what was happening as Kelly says my mother assured me that it was nothing to fear
she herself had occasional premonitions and unusual experiences and her grandmother had clar of voyant dreams my
great grandmother had even seen an angel once and reportedly had healing
abilities so I was somewhat relieved to discover I wasn't a complete freak of course when Kelly's interests and
focused in life began to shift more towards spirituality she began to collect Little Buddha statues and
figurines of various deities she pilfered candles from her grandmother's drawer and set up a secret little temple
in her closet and she says I just sit in there and look at them and wonder about
God I called this Sanctuary My Buddha Hut as you might imagine experiencing
all this paranormal and precognition and psychic events changed the way she
thought about life at a very young age made her a very deeply spiritual person
and events were still in progress because she was now about to experien something a huge event that would change
everything change the course of of her life really affected her whole family as well so from a very young age again
Kelly was deeply spiritual uh she began to feel a very strong connection to Nature particularly
to trees and when her parents gave her a toy doctor's kit she didn't use it on
people but instead used it on trees and she says I made up puses for injured
trees on our property out of various leaves herbs and flow and lovingly applied it trees were not background
objects to me but more like close friends I climbed up in them and sat for
long periods of time singing madeup songs or just thinking I drew pictures of trees and wrote poems about them but
my childhood would come to a screeching halt by the time I was 11 so at this time at age 11 Kelly began
to have this very weird repetitive dream it happened every night and it was always the same and in this dream Kelly
found herself running for her life from a huge crowd of children chasing her across the field it was a very Vivid
dream and different from most of her dreams and after three nights of having this same dream over and over Kelly woke
up one school morning and told her mom about it and her mom asked of course how are things going at school handing Kelly
the sack lunch she had prepared for her and Kelly said fine same as it always is
she thought it was an odd question for her mom to ask because she didn't think the dream had anything to do with school
in fact Kelly's school life was very happy she was popular enough she had
good friends the school work was easy for her she got very good grades she was
having a good time at school and her mother said well then don't worry about it so Kelly didn't she dismissed the
dream and walked off towards school on the way there she met up with one of her friends and as they walked along the
trail going to school they saw a group of other school girls heading in the same direction ahead of them and this is
when things became strange because out of the blue Kelly's friend for some
weird reason randomly picked up a rock and tossed it ahead of her accidentally
to the horror of them both the rock struck one of the girls ahead of them right on the back and of all people the
girl hit by this rock was the school bully the meanest girl in the eighth grade so Kelly's friend immediately hid
behind her and pleaded please Kelly don't tell her it was me and as Kelly
says I didn't have time to think because the bully and her minions were already
upon us she glared into my eyes with hatred and jabbed my chest with her finger as I stood my sorry ground and
aimed for no expression you're going to wish you were never born the bully hissed as her cohorts giggled nervously
the sound of the school bell could be heard just then and thankfully the crowd broke for the grounds in a hurry so
Kelly thought to herself that was close her friend thanked her profusely and they rushed to class now throughout the
day Kelly kept a careful lookout for the bully but thankfully she did not run into her and when the school day ended
Kelly decided that to be safe just in case the bully was waiting for her she
would stay late at school and help the teacher what she did putting away books cleaning the Blackboard and doing other
small jobs and as Kelly says as I later banged
two erasers together outside the classroom door I felt the sense of Doom as I watched the white puffs of chalk
fall heavy to the grass a quick scan of the empty halls and grounds assured me
that only my teacher and myself remained at some point the teacher said my mother would probably be getting worried if I
didn't get home soon I'd bought quite a bit of time with all my cleaning and I
figured no kid was going to hang around in an empty school any longer than they had to the buses were long gone the bike
racks were empty and the school was clearly deserted so Kelly turned to the teacher
and said okay then I'll see you tomorrow she glanced out the window to double check that the coast was clear and it
was but it was not to be Kelly would never see her teacher again only
slightly concerned and seeing no sign of the bully Kelly headed home home and as she says I gripped my books tightly as
my brisk footsteps echoed down the empty halls and towards the gate I'd soon be
home and tomorrow the incident would be if not forgotten at least diminished
tomorrow I'd make a new plan I made it past the bike rack and was coming to a stand of trees when in a blurry Rush of
dawning and adrenaline I saw them rushing towards me it was a whole pack of frenzied kids with their main dog the
school bully in the lead it was totally unexpected and bizarre I reacted
instinctively and just kept running towards home looking back when I dared to see if I lost them so she ran as fast
as she could uh but they kept running after her and the next thing she knows she ran out of breath and looking up saw
that she was surrounded by a large circle of kids some of them were supposedly her friends but not anymore
and the bully came in towards her like a prize fighter she said with a hateful look of Glee spreading across her face
and said you're done for so Kelly tried to defend herself but
she was not able to she felt time actually seeming to slow down as she got
beat up by this school bully the next thing she knew she was lying on the
ground and getting pounded by this school bully she lost Consciousness
actually uh when she woke up she was on the couch in her friend's house and later learned that her older sister had
come running to investigate and rescued Kelly uh so Kelly thanks her sister for
basically saving her life but this was exactly like the dream had
predicted Kelly was left deeply traumatized by this event the kids that she thought were her friends had done
nothing to stop the attack and herself had done nothing to deserve it she hadn't even thrown the rock that
precipitated all of this when Kelly shared that event with me my heart went out to her I mean that must have been
really hard for her she said that it was very sad very poignant but it ended up
having a really interesting Silver Lining as many difficult events do it
can lead to a Great Awakening that's certainly what happened to her and this next event that she describes is so
interesting so unique I don't think I've ever heard anything quite like this this
is a level of contact that is really unusual and interesting and profound so
as you might expect this event affected her profoundly not only her her entire
family they ended up pulling Kelly out of school and her sister and shortly later moved to this beautiful little
town called Julian located in Southern California it's very rural surrounded by trees and
mountains it's a beautiful area but Kelly as a result of this really traumatic experience became quite
isolated she had no desire to make any new friends but the good news was she
loved this new town of Julian it was surrounded by trees and trees had always been her best friends anyway and by luck
the school year was now over and she had all summer to enjoy the forest around her house so once again she rejoiced
among the trees nowhere else but in the forest had she found such peace and her house was right in the middle of it
Kelly says our house was a gray wooden split level set on a sloping Hill of clay the pines and oak trees that
surrounded the house on all sides were thick and towering extending into the web of forest that covered the local
Hills the scents and sounds of the trees were ever present whether buckling with heavy drifts of snow or being worked by
squirrels woodpeckers and J at night the wind whistled High over the rub and Creek of Limbs and the house so
closely meshed so this was a welcome change from the trauma Kelly had left behind in
Escondido and it was that summer that she had her first of a series of very
lucid dreams about a mysterious entity she would later name Birch these dreams
were very Vivid very realistic and they came nightly without fail and were very
comforting as Kelly says they always began and ended exactly the same way I
would be walking in the forest admiring the trees and everything would become extremely Vivid colors and textur stood
out along with the natural sounds and smells of the forest I could even feel the breeze on my skin I would stop to
gaze upon a particular tree when suddenly a loud rustling of leaves would cause me to turn and look in the
direction of the rising wind as soon as I turned my head back around a man appeared where only a tree had stood
before I say man because I have no other way of explaining him the truth is I
knew I loved him from the first and felt as if I'd always known him but after
waking I could never remember what he looked like I dreamed of him every night for a year and yet upon waking his form
had already vanished from my memory so these sound very much like outof body
experiences but certainly very lucid dreams at the very
least and while the dreams began and ended the same way there was always some variation in the middle of them as Kelly
says we somehow traveled through the forest having deep and inspiring conversations the overriding feelings I
had were of love love is too small a word for what I felt I would come to him
with grievances about the world in general in my little world in particular and somehow he would bring me to a place
of profound compassion towards it all at the point of my understanding I would
hear or feel the gust again and turn my head in that direction when I looked back for him he was gone but a tree was
where he'd been so one day Kelly summoned the courage to actually ask his name and
this man this Spirit replied Birch this was odd Kelly thought because
the forest around them was mostly Oak and Pines Birch called the other trees
quote his friends Kelly fully understood that because she felt the same way and
these strange dreams or obes affected Kelly profoundly they were so vivid so
beautiful that upon Awakening she felt as if she had truly been out in the forest and she always woke with a deep
sense of peace and happiness and it was strange because she had no other dreams
and each night she would go to bed with Incredible excitement knowing that she'd get to meet Birch again talk with him
and wander through the forest she came to rely upon Him deeply for companionship but at the same time it
was kind of frustrating because she could never remember what he looked like and the conversation she had with him
while long and vared were always somewhat shrouded in forgetfulness and upon Awakening they'd flee from her
awareness like a flock of scared birds she even kept a pad of paper and a pen
next to her bed in the hopes of capturing something anything but alas it
never happened so she still had no idea what he looked like though in her heart she pictured him as a shining and
beautiful man but it was okay cuz Kelly knew that she would see him the next night and the night after that she had
finally found a true F friend and she no longer felt the sadness and confusion
trauma that had overwhelmed her following this terrible beating that she had endured and she found herself
enjoying her sleep life as much as her waking night then one night she went to
sleep and as she knew he would Birch appeared in front of her and as usual they ambled through the forest talking
of everything under the sun after what seemed like hours Birch turned to her and said something that made her stomach
drop he said we will no longer be meeting like this Kelly immediately woke
up the word still echoing in her mind she thought to herself this can't be true Birch would never leave her but he
did despite all her efforts and repeated entreaties for him to come back these
dreams came to a sudden end she longed terribly for him to return but that was
it following this her nights became ordinary again and she never saw him it
was a tragic loss she felt a hollow emptiness that his absence had left in
her life she missed him more than she could express she hadn't realized how much she had come to depend on his
friendship but as the days and weeks passed into months and years she was able to look back on that special summer
with an incredible sense of gratitude and love her meetings with Birch had left her forever changed and although
she couldn't remember specifically their long conversations she knew that he was
the wisest most loving creature that she would ever never have the grace or honor to know she looked upon him as some kind
of tree Spirit one who had come to her because she had a special relationship with trees and worked hard to heal them
and when she needed a healing Birch was there for her she speculates that he only left her because her healing was
complete but for years afterward and still she missed him how amazing is that
I mean I think we've all heard of things like nature spirits but to have someone describe an event so clearly in such
depth to have someone experience something that changed her so profoundly
I mean that's just amazing I've never heard anyone describe an event like that
before I suspect other people have had these kinds of experiences but so so
amazing and again shows how high strangeness paranormal events are often
a part of the whole contact te experience and his life moved along for
Kelly sure enough more events occurred including not only paranormal events but
apparent visitations by ETS or maybe ghosts again there's a little bit of
ambiguity here with the Birch dreams over Kelly's attention was now drawn to
the many weird events occurring in their house for example there was this heavy wood door at the bottom of the stairs
that kept opening by itself nobody ever actually saw it opening but they certainly remembered closing it yet it
would be opened in the morning and of course that wasn't all shortly after moving into this house they found this
deep red stain on the concrete floor of their room and they could not get rid of it so they just ended up painting the
floor red and basically getting curtains and other Furniture to
match but not long after moving in Kelly started to see something she couldn't
understand visitations of some kind of weird figures as she says many a late moonlit night I
awoke to The Surreal vision of several tall thin nearly human looking figures
moving back and forth in front of the windows their shapes were easily discernible through the sheer curtains
but I was always too afraid to get up and pull the curtains back they were too tall and thin to be quite human and
besides the windows were several feet off the ground so I knew they had to be floating instead of walking
so although they didn't seem to be human the idea of extraterrestrials had not entered Kelly's mind at this point and
she wondered if they might be ghosts in fact her curiosity was even more sparked
when she found what looked like child's carvings of ghostlike figures similar
looking figures etched into a wooden plank above the closet door then one
night she had a very close encounter with whoever these people were as Kelly says my sister was away and I was alone
in our room reading the up stores door was closed and my parents were in the living room watching television I just
turned out the light and lay face down with one leg dangling from under the covers off the edge of the mattress as
soon as I closed my eyes I felt someone push my leg back onto the top of the bed before arranging the blanket over my
legs it took a few moments for my brain to catch up to the fact that I was alone in my room I sh out off the bed and took
the stairs by twos racing up to the top like a maniac I shoved the door open
with a rude jolt and stared at my parents who were sitting on the couch laughing at their favorite sitcom The
Honeymooners so she asked them was someone just downstairs and of course no there wasn't
uh so that was very strange it quite frightened her even though ultimately it was a very benevolent event and soon
more events would occur that convinced everyone in the house that but there was something there they would experience
unexplained cold drafts of air on occasion an object would slide across
the table fly across the room fall off a shelf was startling of course but
somehow not scary and it came to convince Kelly that there were such things as Spirits so she came to look
upon them as unseen friends and another strange thing were
owls um they would appear all the time around the house house more than you would think now as once as Kelly's
mother sat in her art room an owl would come sit at the window and stare at her
even during the day and Kelly's mother admitted that they gave her an uneasy
feeling so this became another weird thing that was going on in Kelly's life
so interesting in my personal opinion because Kelly's describing these
Silhouettes these figures she saw as being somewhat not human looking very very slender I suspect they were ETS but
she leaves the interpretation open because until you're sure you don't know
but so interesting also interesting is how owls started to become a part of all
of this which certainly as you may know does seem to be a part of the ET
experience owls come up again and again and they would come up in the future in a really dramatic way but now events
took a turn where it became pretty clear to Kelly that she was in fact a contacte
because UFOs showed up big time so Kelly was 12 years old when the day came that
she saw a UFO she and her sister had landed their first babysitting job they
were caring for two toddlers and a baby it was a long hectic day neither of them had realized how difficult it was to
care for children but finally they got had the children fed and put to bed and
Kelly's sister went into the kitchen and came out with a can of beer Kelly was a little bit alarmed but her sister said
it's just one can they'll never know so as Kelly says she drank half of the beer
and she gave me the other half I snuck out into the back lot and I was going to sit there and drink my beer under this
tree I sat down and leaned against this tree and for some reason maybe it was
because I was tipping the beer something made me look up and right above the tree was this weird thing I remember it
looking like a long gray blimp type thing but it was so close to the top of the tree that it just freaked me out I
was all guilty because I was sitting there drinking beer I was like oh my god I've been busted and that's the end of
the memory I don't remember running and screaming I just remember being really really paranoid that's the end of the
whole thing I cannot remember years later when Kelly asked
her sister about it her sister had no memory of this whatsoever didn't remember the babysitting job didn't
remember the UFO was so strange because kelly didn't remember telling anyone either and in fact for years the whole
experience seemed to slip from her mind and one day she just spontaneously remembered it very amazing when someone
sees a UFO that close up almost always denotes deeper levels of contact I think
that's absolutely true in Kelly's case especially given the fact that there was apparently some Amnesia surrounding this
event neither of them fully remembering what happened until years later it's a
huge red flag UFO researchers are certainly aware of this this often does
mean that there might have been missing time and perhaps an onboard experience Kelly doesn't remember anything like
that she didn't have any dreams of being on board or anything like that but she
certainly wonders about it and so do I now moving along this next event she
described is stupendous really unique and unusual I've never heard anything
quite like it and Kelly is absolutely sure that this was what we would call a
miracle so time marched on and then one day after receiving a blank diary as a
gift Kelly found she had a real talent for writing she began to compos poems
and songs which her sister put to music they actually formed a band and got gigs at school and local Banquets and dance
halls Kelly also developed an interest in horseback riding one of their neighbors had horses and both Kelly and
her sister began to take turns riding this horse and they both enjoyed it so much that their father finally bought an
old horse named Joker so they they could ride whenever they wanted but of course
this brought new challenges as living up in the mountains the winters were pretty cold and snowy and with her mother
working as an artist and her father as a musician there wasn't a whole lot of money for new warm
clothes now Kelly's friends also rode horses but they all had nice white long
underwear beneath their outer clothes to keep them warm and Kelly became increasingly envious about this and as
Christmas approached she repeatedly begged her mother for a new pair of long underwear but despite several requests
when Christmas morning arrived there was no long underwear Kelly did get a book
about horses and other small gifts which she loved but disappointment flooded her
the book was nice but she really wanted this pair of long underwear so very sad
and upset and disappointed about this she decided to take her horse Joker for a ride and as Kelly later wrote in her
journal I went out and slid across the mud and patches of dirty ice and pushed
the bit into Joker's mouth I threw the rins over his shoulders and stood on a log and leaped onto his back the air was
crisp and piny in the saturated Hills of melting snow I ran Joker into a Gallop
until my body became one with his rhythmic motions no matter how fast he ran I knew I wouldn't slide off his back
the light glistened off the trees in the morning light as his chipped hoves clamped across the Rock and Frozen clay
we ran up a nearby Hill for no particular reason and as I rounded a turn through some trees I leaned down
near to Joker's neck for better bance on his wet and bony back and when I sat up
straight and lifted my eyes I saw a miracle shimmering before us I refer to
this as the long underwear Miracle there it was hovering like an Angelic Vision
before me a white long sleeved long underwear shirt dangling from an Oak
Branch was just high enough that I could only reach it from Joker's back with trembling hands I plucked the snow
soaked bark Fleck shirt from the tree I squeezed the water from it and examined it for Tears or holes it was
perfect not worn out looking but neither with that embarrassingly new look either
I quickly looked around but there were no signs of people in this area and no tracks I held it close to my body and
whispered thank you I didn't know who I was thaning but I felt sure it was
somehow intended for me my mother was genuinely shocked by my Discovery and
for years after we would joke about some hapless hiker who had lost his shirt in the woods in a storm if this was some
clever Ploy of a sympathetic unknown person it was brilliant who knew of my
long underwear longing besides my mother who hadn't really understood its depth
to this day the whole event remains mysterious at the time others saw it as a coincidental and insignificant
occurrence like so many odd events that make up our lives by the time I was 14
though I already knew that my life with all its strangeness and Brilliance was more than that so Kelly never did learn
where the long underwear came from of but deep in her heart she believes it may have been a gift from Birch but how
he did it she has no idea meanwhile psych Kelly's psychic awareness grew by
Leaps and Bounds daily she would predict who would be on the phone what song
would come next on the radio what someone near her was going to say these usually invol trivial events but it
happened so often that Kelly's mother took notice and actually began to strengthen Kelly's abilities by testing
her with ESP cards and this was a lot of fun for Kelly so she started testing
herself by predicting various events and she quickly learned to take her hunches
seriously especially after one particularly poignant example so there
you go the underwear Miracle very unusual really quite poignant and so so
interesting and she wonders to this day as does her family you know who was responsible for gifting her that pair of
underwear hanging there on a tree in the middle of the forest I mean it's just beyond bizarre but it certainly fits in
with all these weird experiences that Kelly was having it's certainly
interesting to say the least and Kelly's strange events continued she was again always having
experiences with hosts and precognition and all kinds of psychic events but now
she was about to have a spirit visitation that left no doubt in her mind that there was life after death one
morning after getting out of bed I noticed how absolutely still the house felt I knew before opening my eyes that
it meant a deep snow had fallen the night before suddenly an image of my great grandfather who was alive and well
came to me I felt a sharp painful feeling of loss for for no apparent reason as the phone rang which it always
did if the snow was deep I already knew it wasn't about there being no school that day I knew at the sound of the
ringing it would be about my mother's grandfather after a few moments my mother came downstairs and told us
grandfather had just died of a sudden heart attack while going to the kitchen for a glass of water this was my first
of many bouts of sensing before I'd been told that someone close to me had passed on
the fact that my great-grandfather had died was upsetting because it was my first experience of death but I also had
to wonder what it meant to know this beforehand it nudged me deeper into the mysteries of the underworld at age 14
Kelly met a boy I'll call him Jay that's a pseudonym he was a Native American Boy Who Lived
nearby at the Santa Isabel Indian Reservation with his family and Kelly
and Jay soon fell deeply in love and Kelly began to spend a lot of time on
the reservation with Jay and his family and this changed many things for her
life what a gift that is to be able to be visited by a deceased loved one who
lets you know that there is life after death it's very special very poignant very profound she's very blessed to have
had that experience but now falling in love at a very young age with a Native
American Boy her life was now about to take another major turn in fact as she
spent more and more time on the reservation she started to realize that the people that she was living with
viewed the life in the universe in a very different way and this really
altered her thinking to some extent and I think her experiences as well ly soon
learned that Jay's family and the people around him acknowledged paranormal events as absolutely true
they were something accepted as a part of life people would report strange
entities that would come into the room causing temporary paralysis there was all kinds of strange Poltergeist likee
activity knockings on Windows and Doors objects being tossed around on one
occasion Kelly and her friend had just driven to the reservation and parked when something struck the car with such
Force the vehicle actually lifted up on two wheels and then slammed back down
after recovering the two of them exited the vehicle and searched the area there was no sign of anyone no tracks Kelly
wondered what could be so strong as to lift the car like that it was around
this time Kelly had a very powerful outof Body Experience she had taken a long hike went into the house to take a
nap all of a sudden her body became enveloped by a powerful electric
vibration feeling she heard loud crackling sounds and Kelly suddenly found herself soaring through the sky
she realized she was astral projecting and pretty soon got pulled back into her
body another thing Kelly quickly learned about the reservation is that owls were seen as Messengers from the other world
and often harbingers of Misfortune none of the people on the reservation liked
seeing them near their homes or even hearing them and if any owl lingered for too long people would throw rocks at
them at the time Kelly kind of viewed as a quaint Superstition even though she
and her family were having similar experiences strange experiences with ows and later Kelly would have reason to
re-evaluate her outlook on all of this Kelly's boyfriend Jay did have an elderly Uncle who she adored and he
would often regil her with fantastic tales of the supernatural such as about
a man named tokish who went dancing and then turned into an eagle there were all
kinds of stories he had and would share them and Kelly found them absolutely fascinating but once he did something
that really left her wondering one evening the family was sitting in front of the fireplace enjoying the heat of
the Flames when the sound of an owl brought Dead Silence among them and at
this point Uncle jumped up and walking like a bird he approached the fireplace
and grabbed a large red hot coal and placed it on the palm of his hand as
Kelly says he began singing an Indian song and paused only to blow on the coal
which then fired up even brighter the coal was at least the size of a golf ball and it was plain to see it was
glowing all the way through Uncle then popped the coal into his mouth and somehow continued singing like that for
several minutes horrified I quickly glanced over at Jay's father who made a
face that told me not to do anything at the end of what seemed an excruciatingly
long long song Uncle nonchalantly spit the coal into his hand and blew on it
again we could see it was still red hot with no more concern than someone holding a rock he slowly took it back to
the fire and replaced it under the log he wasn't harmed in the slightest way so
that was truly amazing and really made Kelly realize how extraordinary these
people were that she was living with how amazing is that it's clear that uncle
has a very ADV adved understanding of some things I mean being being able to handle a hot coal like that all his
amazing Stories some really interesting events occurred during her time on the
reservation but now as often happens with people who are conaes events were to escalate and Kelly
soon had an experience that made her realize in unequivocal terms that she
was in fact a contacte because was visited directly by extraterrestrials shortly after Kelly
turned 16 years old her boyfriend Jay joined the army and to avoid being
separated the two of them decided to get married before they left Uncle approached Kelly and told her that by
the time she returned he would be gone this was a chilling prophecy that turned out to be true so Kelly followed Jay to
Germany where he was transferred and they stayed in a small apartment in in the city of Ober
weisenborn very quickly Kelly became pregnant and while she was pregnant while she was staying there in Germany
she had an encounter with a truly strange humanoid as Kelly says in her
own words I awoke One Night in Terror there was a short little man not more
than 3 feet tall standing close to my face I cannot recall his features except
that he seemed to be learing as he reached out towards my pregnant belly it looked like a troll I could tell it
wasn't young it had an old feeling to it was leaning towards me it seemed to have
some kind of a hat there was something unusual about his hands or his fingers I jerked away from the side of the bed as
he leaned in and then noticed a long line of similar creatures standing all the way from this one to the door there
would have been 15 of them or more I was scared out of my mind I got up on my knees and started pounding on Jay to
wake up by the time he opened his eyes and was listening to my crazy ranting
they had already vanished to make matters worse Jay didn't try to reassure me in any way or explained that I'd been
dreaming and instead he jumped out of bed grabbed his medicine bags off the wall and I remain there in the center of
the big bed cowering in fear as he went into the other room I suppose to perform
some ritual so strangely Kelly and Jay never discussed this she did mention it
to a few friends but they awkwardly offered their explanation that she must have had a nightmare which she knew
wasn't true whatever this was that came into her room she feels it was very
interested in the fact that she was pregnant interested in her baby she doesn't understand it though because it
didn't touch her at all it was just standing there and when she told Jay about the be beings he didn't seem at
all surprised in fact he acted like he already knew what they were and only
after returning to the US and telling Jay's family about it did she learn that
they had their own theories about what these beings were as Kelly says Jay's
family explained that these guys had been around forever terrorizing women who are pregnant with Indian children
Uncle certainly knew about them and Jay's father told me his brother had been harassed by them when they were
children over the years I've heard numerous accounts from many people about these little people which they called
weapos so Kelly's pregnancy went well she gave birth to a healthy baby boy and
the little people did not reappear at least not for a long time and she
assumed that her experiences with them were over she did have precognitive dreams while she was in Germany she woke
to see her grandmother standing at the foot of the bed radiant and happy and she said I'm going to be with Dad so she
knew that her grandmother had passed away which of course turned out to be true and it really helped her grieving
process and then she had another dream where she saw Uncle Jay's Uncle he
looked very concerned and distress and the next day she found out that her
uncle had in fact been murdered so Kelly and Jay moved back to Southern California grew their little
family had a new daughter years later when her eldest son was 11 years old
these little people that she had seen returned it's Kelly says one early
morning he came into my room scared to death by what he'd seen as he related
the story the hairs on the back of my neck rose with comprehension he said he woke up because our cat who was sleeping
with him was freaking out and when he opened his eyes he saw a crowd of little men standing around him making strange
hand movements over his stomach he said I remember floating down the hallway I
tried to act like it wasn't anything to worry about and probably a dream so I wouldn't scare him then I said he should
try drawing a picture of them to take away the fear and when he showed me the picture I was overcome with disbelief
and confusion they looked just like the little men with pointed hats how on Earth could this be a coincidence I
never told him of my previous experience until he was grown up he doesn't like it when I talk about it even now so many
times Kelly did ask her son for more details he always refused he says
they're aliens and it's a subject he does not want to discuss as Kelly says
he has always been really really against anything that has to do with anything that implies UFOs or aliens if anybody
even talks about anything or he sees a book he just immediately changes the subject I have a couple of times just
said what do you think and he says you know what I just don't want to talk
about that it just gives me the creeps and I don't want to so I haven't been able to get him to talk about these
things because he's just horrified of the idea how interesting is that I me
the way the Native Americans viewed her experiences are a little bit different perhaps in the way the average Western
person does but certainly fascinating also because Kelly's son started having
experiences that were pretty much identical to her this is the pattern we see with so many people contact is
generally speaking generational that certainly does seem to be true in Kelly's case and her experiences
continued CU she went through a very difficult period in her life and this is
when she had an experience that she's really not sure how to interpret was it Angelic was it spiritual was this a
spirit guide she's really not sure but it involved this really intensely
amazing experience with orbs was not long after this that Kelly's life life
started to become a little bit of a struggle her marriage with Jay didn't work out and she got a divorce and had
to raise the kids on her own and she was just having a hard time working and going to school uh she tried to ease her
stress by gathering herbs and doing healing things but life was very difficult and she just wasn't happy and
one evening she lay down on the floor and closed her eyes and as if a switch had been flipped an overwhelming surge
of Joy swept over her and laughter began to bubble out of her was so unexpected
and out of the blue given how depressed she was it made zero sense and as Kelly
says there was no excuse for me to be all of the sudden joyous so I thought my
God I must be losing it I opened my eyes and I saw what looked like a bubble a
round ball of light but about the size of if you blew a bubble it came in through the wall and started floating
through the room I just lay there this emotion Contin continued where I felt these waves of intense Joy I don't know
why I sat there and watched it and pretty soon it started making all these strange movements the feeling I had was
that it was like dancing was moving around like it was aware that I was aware like we were almost interacting in
some strange way as I continued to watch it and the emotion was getting stronger
was so strong that it was almost devastating it was like being in love only a zillion times just overwhelming
emotion I just lay there looking at this light and having these feelings and then pretty soon more of them came into the
room and they started doing these almost like a choreographer designed dance and
went on for a long time I had the feeling that I couldn't stand it anymore was just too intense and I closed my
eyes and when I opened them I saw them just going out through the wall and just disappearing and going
away so this left Kelly quite confused what were these Ang Angels Spirits UFOs
she really had no idea but whatever they were the whole experience was very healing and her depression completely
lifted as she says I can't say what that was but the emotion was just something
else I've never felt or seen anything like that before and I hope someday I do
again how amazing and profound is that it's an experience that Kelly looks back
on with extreme fondness and I don't blame her truly amazing Angels Spirits I don't
know but certainly a very very positive experience but as happens with
contactees the experiences are pretty much unending if you the Paranormal becomes
normal when someone is a contacte and with Kelly Anderson I mean her experiences are off the charts by
strangeness owls are known to be a part of the ET contact experience
she dealt with them throughout her life again it was a big part of the whole uh
paranormal with her life on the reservation but now she was about to
have an owl experience of such high strangeness that it is
mindboggling and I'm glad she wasn't the only witness or I don't think people would believe her I mean this one is
just so weird so time moved on and one day Kelly wrote an article about her and her other people's experience with
what they called the weapo and to her amazement people responded to her
article implying that these little men were actually extraterrestrials she hadn't really
considered this idea not seriously so she began to research the subject and
was amazed to hear how closely her experiences and others matched with what
people called ETS she also learned that many people reported seeing owls in connection with ETS and she became even
more astonished cuz she and her family had just had this really crazy sighting
with an owl many of them actually but one was just off the charts weird as
Kelly says I really got spooked because when my son had his experience we were
constantly having unusual owl sightings besides seeing them in the driveway and on fence posts in great numbers by
daylight we had a highly unusual incident while driving home one night we
were coming back from a birthday party at my aunt and uncle's house the back road was very dark and no other cars
were around suddenly I came around a turn and had to stop abruptly because a
gigantic owl the size of a small person was standing in the middle of the road
it was just an impossibly ridiculously large owl we sat there for a long time
the kids leaned up over the back seat in amazement and were like oh my God Mom
Mom and we just stared at it and it stared right back straight at us was tripping me out because it was staring
into my eyes the kids were excited and scared at the same time and my son said
we needed to go see his grandpa his grandfather being of the owl Clan would
surely know what it meant I didn't take my eyes off the owl but after a while it
became so uncomfortable about its refusal to move that I let my truck roll
closer to it hoping to scare it off the road it didn't budge but just continued
to stare seemingly into my eyes after what felt like a very long amount of
time the owl slowly turned and flew off when I later told the kid's grandfather
about it he didn't know what to say but it clearly Disturbed him very hard to
say what's going on there I mean when you have a four five foot tall owl
probably not an owl uh and fact I mean it was not only looking looked strange
but there it was standing in the middle of the road blocking the way staring right at them this could very well have
been a screen memory hard to say for sure but definitely unusual and now Kelly was going to get
some answers about these strange visitations she had with these little people because she finally decided to
bring it up to the folks on the reservation and she got a really interesting response about how they
viewed these visitations that she was having so was some years later Kelly was driving home with Jay and his friends
and she decided to bring up the subject of the weapos and again shared her own encounter with them and asked them so
are they real or what and Jay said they're real if you notice them and his
friend nodded in agreement and Kelly shook her head and said what kind of answer is that Jay repli replied they
are there but not everyone sees them they like to pray on little kids and people who don't have a strong identity
and Jay's friend nodded and said yeah yeah so Kelly turned to Jay's friend and said have you seen them and he said yes
I've seen the little bastards but I Chang chased them away you can't be afraid of them or they will never leave
you alone and she said for some reason I can't remember what they looked like and
this is when both Jay and his friend explained cled that these weapos these little people were nearly
featuress these guys made it clear that they didn't want to talk about it anymore but Kelly dropped the subject
but she couldn't help but speculate about these little people what were they you know beings From Another Dimension
ETS were they like fairies or elves or the so-called mythical people that seem to be present in various cultures
throughout the world she didn't know but having experienced them herself and heard about other people's in Ms she
knows only one thing that they are real now she says I feel more certain every
day that something real is happening to us that defies ordinary explanations if
and how the psychic experiences are connected I do not presently
understand she did take the step to ask her mother about UFOs and to her shock
her mother revealed that she once did experience a missing time incident but she didn't want to talk about it so she
asked her dad and he also admitted that he had once seen a UFO and as Kelly says
my dad totally doesn't believe in anything he's one of these total Imperial realists he has even told me
that when he was a teenager he saw something that he could never explain he said it was a round glowing object that
seemed like it was under intelligent control that was in the distance sounded like a UFO to me but he wouldn't use
those words he just shook his head and said that was the darnest thing I don't
know what it was but other weird memories that were possibly UFO related
began to surface because twice several years apart Kelly woke up at around 4
a.m. to a very unusual sight as she says both times I woke up in the middle of
the night and the entire house was lit in a red light inside evenly through the
house not like coming through a window or anything red light on everything everywhere and both times that it
happened they were within a couple of years apart so I wasn't expecting it to happen again but it was so similar that
I immediately thought there was a fire it was that bright when I started walking around the house I realized it
was not coming from anywhere so my next thought was I must be getting some kind of Horrid eye disease and going blind
and of course that didn't happen and I just sort of filed it away how interesting is that I mean with so many
Native American cultures seeing all different kinds of little people we might have to keep our minds open to how
we interpret these events because there still are all kinds of questions
surrounding contact I suspect there's a lot of stuff going on here it's not just
ETS but all different kinds of things do think Kelly is having contact with
extraterrestrials in the classic sense given that she did C UFOs did have
missing time she was pregnant at the time of her encounter I find that interesting because that is a pattern
I've seen with many other people but you can make up your own minds about it and
now we move to another really amazing experience in which Kelly got some
answers about a very mysterious event in her childhood involving this tree Spirit
by the name of birch it was around 2005 Kelly went to bed one evening and as she
sometimes did she began to reminisce about her childhood experiences with this tree Spirit called Birch the
mysterious dream friend who had had such a huge and lasting impact on her life
she constantly wondered who was he where had he come from why had he left so
pondering these questions on impulse she reached out to him telepathically
mentally as she had often done before but this time she asked out loud who are
you Birch really and the last thing she expected was what happened next she
heard a telepathic voice in her mind and it was Birch and he said I am here she
asked are you a tree and he said I was able to share the energy of the trees to
meet you she asked are you an angel or what he replied you may call me a
messenger what's the message she asked love Burch replied what about it Burch
said you can have it you can give it she asked is it your mission to tell people
this bur said yes and she asked like you did with me and berch replied always
different so she asked him how do you decide what to look like and Birch
replied like what you already love so she asked him why did you come to me
and he said you were searching for a message so I brought it and then she
asked him what is your message for me now and he said heal that's why my name
to you is birch and she asked have you been with me since and she's thinking since these
dreams stopped she had not sensed his presence and he said yes and she said
how he replied music and poetry this point Kelly asked am I supposed to heal
others Burch replied yes how she asked and he replied by going
up Kelly wasn't quite sure what that meant and asked him you mean leaving my
body and he said yes so she asked how and he said the answers are
there so she asked him were you the voice because she once recalled hearing
a voice While She Was Out of Body and he said yes yes without form and she asked did I want to come
here to be born on Earth he said yes and she asked did I have a plan and he said
yes I am your reminder and with that he was gone never to return again again
this entire conversation was telepathic and it transpired very quickly and immediately afterwards Kelly did her
best to write it all down as accurately as possible but this convers ation
answered many of the questions she had about this strange and mysterious entity from her childhood and she became really
interested in the fact that his name was Birch because she learned that the birch tree had numerous medicinal healing
properties it's a powerful anti-inflammatory to treat such conditions as arthritis rheumatism
digestive troubles urinary tract infections insomnia detoxifying and more
and in fact indigenous cultures have used Birch for many purposes for centuries there's a very strong
mythology in many cultures about the tree so she realized that that name was
very significant how amazing is that Kelly looks upon that particular
experience as a highlight in her life because it provided some answers as to what was going on during her childhood
experiences with this apparent tree spirit so interesting and really unique
just amazing and as Kelly's life continued as is true with pretty much all contacts
the high strangeness continued through this day Kelly continues to have many unexplained and very deeply spiritual
experiences and UFO experiences for example in 2008 she invited a friend
over to spend the night and in the morning her friend said wow something really weird happened last night and
Kelly said like what and her friend said that she woke up to find the interior of the house entirely
illuminated by an eerie green light she actually got out of bed and wandered through the house looking for the source
but the light was everywhere she couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from and after about 10 minutes she gave
up looking for it and climbed back into bed now her friend thought it might have been a spiritual experience kelly didn't
offer any explanation because she didn't really have one so they just kind of sat
there stared at each other and finally said whatever so that sounds like another UFO visitation to me hard to say
for sure but it's certainly looks like it uh there's been quite a few of them I suspect that Kelly has been on board
craft it's unfortunate she has no memory of this but that is not that unusual but
either way what an amazing story of contact she has so much to it so many
different types of visitations so many different kinds of experiences and I
would say actually that that's more the rule than the exception said it before ET contact is not an isolated event and
often comes along with a wide variety of paranormal events and as you can see that's 100% true with Kelly Anderson I
really have to thank her for sharing her experiences with me I know it's not easy
for a lot of people she did again insist upon anonymity and as you can see her
experiences are strange enough where I totally understand why she didn't want people to know her real name again I did
write about her experiences in much more detail in my book humanoids and high
strangeness it's one of 20 accounts where people have had Direct contact
with humanoids of one kind or another but I have to say Kelly's story is one
of my favorite in the book just because it's so unusual so unique and so very
so I really want to thank you guys for watching I truly appreciate it it's because of you I do this research so
thank you thank you thank you and until next time keep searching for the truth keep asking those hard questions and
most important of all CU I really think that's why we came to Earth keep having fun I will see you next time bye for now
