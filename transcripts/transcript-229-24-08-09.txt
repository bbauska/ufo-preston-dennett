BEWILDERED: TEN HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Aug 9, 2024

Summary:
Aug 9, 2024
A close encounter with a UFO, and especially humanoids, challenges a person on multiple levels: physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Almost without exception witnesses are left stunned, surprised, bewildered. The ten cases presented in this video come from across the world and involve a wide variety of humanoids. They contain a wide variety of evidence. And each case shows how the witnesses are deeply and profoundly affected to a degree that their lives are never the same.

BLACK HOLE ALIENS. On August 26,1974, Jean Marie Bigorne stepped outside his home in Feignies, France and saw a black hole in the gray night sky. As it started to descend, he rushed inside, got his wife, and together they watched it split into two half-circles. The right side disappeared, but the left side suddenly revealed two robotic-looking humanoids. The witnesses became entranced and watched it for 45 minutes until going inside. They never saw it leave.

ALIENS IN THE ANDES. On the evening of February 17, 1981, cattleman Jose Fermin Albornoz was sleeping after protecting a herd of sheep in the Manzano-Amargo area of the Argentinian Andes. A brilliant light and buzzing noise woke him up and he saw a saucer land next to his campsite. As the animals scattered, two strange humanoids appeared and spoke to him in a strange language. Jose fainted in fear.

HUMANOIDS AT THE CAMPGROUND. On evening in 1981, a group of people were camping at Laguna Sofia National Park in Puerto Natales, Chile. One of the campers stepped outside her tent and saw a strange craft drop from the sky and land nearby. As she approached, a door opened and three tall humanoids exited and began taking soil samples. She fled and woke everyone up in time to watch the craft dart away.

THE LIGHT-HEADED ALIEN. On the night of October 9, 1984, doorman Isidoro Ferri was woken up in his bedroom at the Villa La Radicchia in Polcanto, Italy by a brilliant light streaming in through the window. Paralyzed, he saw that the light was coming from the head of a humanoid standing outside. Shortly later, he saw a craft. The light flashed and fluctuated, causing alarming physiological effects. Afterwards, landing traces were found, and researchers found many other witnesses.

THE ALIENS AT SCHOOL. One day in June 1986, “Leif” was parked next to a school in Ytteroya, Norway when he noticed a three-foot-tall figure with a bald head and huge dark eyes approach. It wore a shiny blue jumpsuit. Fifteen feet behind it was a landed UFO. Leif hid behind the truck as the being turned around and re-entered the craft. Two of the figures turned and stared at Leif as the craft rose into the sky and departed.

THE HUNTERS AND THE ALIENS. On the night of June 26, 1987, three men were hunting in the countryside near Badajoz, Spain when a brilliant light appeared in the sky. It zoomed towards them and landed, disgorging two tall, strong-looking figures. The two humanoids approached the hunters, who panicked and fled the scene. Moments later, they saw the craft depart. Later, landing traces were found.

KT & THE GRAYS. One day in May 1992, wildlife researcher K.T. Frankovich was walking her dogs through a lime grove next to her apartment in Miami-Dade, Florida. Suddenly a gray alien appeared. K.T. watched it for several minutes, receiving several telepathic messages before fleeing the scene. A few nights later, two grays appeared outside her apartment with another profound message.

HAVANA HUMANOID. On the morning of November 27, 1995, security guard Samuel Rodolfo Barreras was shocked to see a flying saucer approach and land next to the buildings he was guarding outside of Havana City, Cuba. A door in the craft opened and out stepped a robotic-looking humanoid who approached Samuel (who was now paralyzed.) The being scanned the area for 15 minutes before returning to the craft, which promptly departed.

THE HUMANOID IN THE BATHROOM. Late on the night of June 24, 2001, Mr. G.H. a university professor from Patras, Greece, walked into his kitchen and was confronted by a tall faceless humanoid wearing a shiny blue coverall. It ran into his bathroom and disappeared. For the next few minutes, he chased it around the house, back into the bathroom twice more until it was gone, leaving the witnesses utterly bewildered.

IT APPEARED THREE TIMES. One night in December 2001, a young man was watching TV alone in his family’s home in Tampa, Florida. Hearing an odd crinkling sound outside, he looked and saw a gray ET standing in his backyard. It quickly disappeared. Later, the witness heard the same sound again and saw that the ET had returned to his backyard. Then the gray-skinned humanoid returned a third time.

These ten cases show how incredibly strange a UFO/humanoid encounter can be, and how profoundly it changes a person. Nobody but a firsthand witness can ever know what it’s truly like to have an encounter with a humanoid from a UFO.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is called bewildered 10 humanoid encounters I gave this episode that
title because it's a common reaction to a humanoid encounter an encounter with a humanoid challenges a person on multiple
levels sometimes physically but almost always emotionally mentally spiritually
psychically it causes profound change ches in a person completely changes their world view changes how they look
at themselves and the universe that we live in so these cases certainly show
this I've chosen of course 10 cases from all over the world spanning 40 years
from the 1970s to the 2000s and the cases today come from the
United States also South America including Chile and Argentina but all
over the world I've got a case from Cuba one from Greece another from Italy Spain
France and Norway so quite a number of different locations and of course
different kinds of humanoids these cases are so interesting and I think each of these
cases does have something to teach us not only about the universe we live in but about
ourselves these cases are some multiple witness some are single Witness a good
number of them do have some pretty compelling evidence in the form of physiological effects or perhaps animal
reactions Landing traces and so forth but it's going to be a pretty long
episode so let's just get started in the first case I'd like to talk about today I call black hole aliens and you'll see
why I gave it that title in just a second this one took place on August 26th 1970 for in feni France and it's a
really remarkable case the investigators to this case kind of looked at this one
as an example of how truly High strangeness is a part of the UFO
experience and how ETS apparently put on a display
sometimes so this one yeah it's quite unusual it is a multiple witness case
and I hope you find it as interesting as I did this case comes from jeene Marie
bejour and was published in the French publication lumier Donan lights in the
night it begins when the witness's daughter Cil Moray normally very
punctual while she failed to return home at her curfew of 8:30 p.m. on August
26th 1974 after going to a party in the town of finei this is in France now her
father Gerard stepped outside to take a look around see if she was coming home
did not see her it was now just before 900 p.m. but looking up he noticed
something quite odd in the sky a perfectly round black hole a circle in
the sky which stood out starkly against the gray
background now this circle seemed to Glow slightly around the edges sort of a
white Aura and looking at it he said it look pretty close maybe about 600 to 700
ft away he estimates but when he first saw it this was stationary in the sky
perfectly still but as he watched it now seemed to be descending slowly and
seeing how strange and unusual this was he rushed back inside got his wife and
together they went back outside and watched as this black circular object descended until after almost 10 minutes
was only 60 or 70 ft above the ground this point they estimated it was about
25 ft in diameter and it was then that this object did something amazing it
split in half vertically forming two semicircles the right semicircle began
to either decrease in size or move away they couldn't quite tell but it did this
slowly and finally disappeared meanwhile the one on the left remained but it also
did some something peculiar a line or a veil of some kind kind of like a curtain they said went across its surface from
left to right and this revealed two figures standing next to each other
inside this semicircle according to the witnesses they looked kind of like astronauts
complete with white fullbody metallic space suits and helmets sort of
white gray they said they could clearly see their arms and legs and as they watched these two figures
began to move around they moved strangely almost more like puppets they said than living beings in fact these
two figures looked almost two-dimensional just were not walking normally they sort of blundered and
waddled around inside the semicircle moving almost mechanically from one side
to the other and they looked quite short about 4 and 1/2 ft tall so Gerard and
his wife were absolutely stunned by this site and they watched it almost entranced for a full 40 minutes they
said that dur during this time the object made no noise and in fact an
unnatural silence settled over the entire environment also strange they
noticed that no other cars passed by suddenly snapping out of their trance
and seeing that it was now 10 p.m. Gerard decided to go fetch his daughter
he left by bicycle to find his daughter's a seal and his wife went back inside this object was still there when
they both stopped looking at it when Gerard returned home with his daughter neither of them bothered to look up into
the sky to see if this object was still there which is also strange and
researcher jeene Marie Bourn who looked into this he interviewed the witnesses
he said that the Witnesses were quote completely without any interest in the UFO phenomenon he called the encounter
quote a high strangeness display and this exemplified how difficult it is to
explain UFO activity so definitely some high strangeness there it's really
interesting to me that at some point they just stopped looking weren't interested in what was going on
any longer uh we do see this sometimes perhaps it's just mental overload I
don't know but certainly a fascinating case and here's another I wanted to
include this one because it's such a common pattern we see with these Landings and humanoids where a craft
comes down ETS come out they walk right up to a witness give a very short message and then off they go on their
merry way I called this one aliens in the Andes this took place on February 17
1981 in menzano Amaro in the curilla the foothills of
the Andes this is in Argentina and it's a truly fascinating multiple witness
case some really fascinating aspects to it and I think you'll find it definitely
an unusual case this case comes from researcher Carlos Daniel Ferguson the
main witness is Jose ferine albos he's a 49-year-old Catman married with seven
children unable to read or write Jose has spent pretty much his entire life in
this remote area of Manzano amargo this is located at about 12,000 ft altitude
in the Cordillera of the argentinan Andes it was on the night of February 17
1981 that Jose rode by horseback up to La Vira niata this is a step in the
mountains where he and his two co-workers look after a pen of fenced in
sheep it was around 4 A M that Jose woke up when the sheep and the horses and the
dogs and all the animals in the area began acting up and sitting up and
looking around Jose was shocked to see a glowing blue circular object about 10 ft
wide hovering just a few feet above the ground only 65 ft away it was close
enough that Jose could actually feel heat coming from it and as Jose says the
light was a lovely light bluish clear clear a beautiful light I don't know
what it was because I don't study I don't know how to read so I don't know what these things might
be but he knew it was strange so he immediately woke up one of his companions but his companion seeing the
craft immediately shrieked with fear and hid under his blankets Jose at this point could hear a
loud buzzing sound and it seemed as the if the ground itself almost vibrated and
this is when without warning two humanoid figures suddenly appeared before him and as Jose says I don't know
where they came from they just did it they appeared these were not normal people They were about 3 to 3 and 1/2 ft
tall with disproportionately large heads Stout bodies they both wore dark blue
tight fitting full body jumpsuits no buttons no zippers no markings of any
kind he couldn't see any fa features but he did say that quote they had something
on their heads like a sort of helmet so as he watched they stood motionless only
about 6 feet away from him and they both began to speak in an incomprehensible
language as Jose says I didn't understand what they told me but they
did speak to me I couldn't look at their faces but I wanted to I was very frightened and shook all
over so at this point Jose was filled with fear in fact he thought that he was
about to die and he told himself dear lord it's the end of the world and I'm not with my family and as Jose says
that's when I lost control and was out of Courage I wanted to run off to where the others were but my heart was beating
too fast I was shaking from Fear I passed out from Fear so he fell to the
ground and awoke just seconds later in time enough to see along with his companion this weird weird glowing blue
sphere move off to the West now His companion did not see the humanoids but
he was in such severe emotional shock from seeing this craft that he actually refused to speak about it to
anyone course all the animals in the area did react to the presence of this craft and humanoids several of them ran
off which entailed a long search to find them the next day an inspection of the
site where this object hovered in the humanoids stood revealed no evidence no
investigators asked if the witness might have mistaken this object for a helicopter and its Pilots which Jose of
course denied he had heard of flying saucers in fact he had seen an unexplained light uh earlier while in
the town of chidos but he didn't talk or think much about UFOs in general when asked if his
experience might have been a dream he said no sir I was completely awake so
there was an investigation done uh the witness was interviewed thoroughly and
the investigators learned that all those who knew Jose vouched for his honesty
and integrity to me the most interesting thing about that case is how the ETS
behave walking right up to this witness and then walking back into their UFO I
also like it cuz it's a really good witness he's clearly sincere very well respected Ed the location itself is also
very interesting I mean there are a lot of things we can learn from each of these cases and now we move to another one
which is remarkably similar actually I call this one humanoids at the campground this took place in 1981 in
Laguna sopia Chile in a very remote location in a campground of course again
multiple Witnesses in this case very close up counter with a landed UFO and
humanoids and some really compelling aspects to it it is quite brief but I
think it's an important case the researcher in this case is Jose Antonio
kavaka it's quite a brief case but quite interesting and it took place at a campground in Torres Del pain national
park at Laguna Sophia Puerto natal's Chile it was one evening in 1981 that
the witness in anom omous woman she was with several other people at this
Campground they were all in their tents retired for the evening when the witness decided to step briefly out of her tent
to take a look at the scenery to her amazement she saw this craft a large
craft about the size of a two-story house was your typical saucer shape had
rounded white Windows around the edge and she watched it drop down from the sky and actually land on a small hill
about 200 ft away immediately a door opened and a ramp with steps extended down to the
ground now she became curious and she approached this object and was amazed to
see three tall humanoid figures walking around it she said they each wore what
looked like diving suits with a mask much like welders use with a face plate
and she did notice that a spiral cable like device was at the tip of each mask
these beings first walked around the craft as if inspecting it and then they
proceeded to take soil samples this is what it looked like to her she was close
enough that she could actually see directly inside this craft and this is the most interesting part perhaps of
this case because she was amazed to see lights Machinery with buttons on it a
few computer-like monitors which had weird symbols like x's and other symbols inscribed on them needless to say she
was quite shocked by this she ran back to the campground woke up the other campers everyone ran out of their tents
in time to hear a loud noise and watch this object take off and move slowly
away to the north there were at least 10 witnesses to this event so there you go
another case of a landing and a humanoid humanoids and so interesting cuz here's
that pattern again where a craft comes down humanoids come out stay for just a little bit
and return into the craft and off they go not quite sure what they're up to but
it does appear in this case they were taking soil samples so perhaps that was the motive here hard to say for sure
don't like to speculate but that's what it looks like and now we move to another case and this one is really compelling
this is a single witness case for the most part but it does have Landing traces it's got physiological effects
and animal reactions and there are some corroborating witnesses as well to what
the main witness saw I call this one the light-headed alien this is on October 9
1984 in panto Italy and it's a
really bizarre and unusual case in a lot of ways this next case was very
thoroughly researched by researchers journalists Military Officers but the
main researcher is Pierre Luigi s it was about 3:30 a.m. again on October 9
1984 when the witness Eid Doro fery he was a d man who worked at the Via La
Radia he was awoken up by a bright light streaming onto his face from his bedroom
window he says as soon as this happened there was an overpowering silence that filled the environment this is that
weird Oz effect we here about so often and looking out the window he's still in
bed he saw that the light was coming from a figure standing about 120 to 130
ft away standing on top of a hill next to the house this is just on the other
side of his street via tasa now this light itself was coming
from the being's head or face and isidoro wondered if this figure might be
a thief when suddenly it seemed to disappear into a weird foggy blur and in
its place he could now see a dark horizontal line with a koua on top
there's some confusion about what exactly he saw but he did see three Flames pointing down to the ground he
now wondered if someone was trying to set fire to his Hut where he stored hay not far from here but he immediately
rejected this Theory when he saw that these Flames were not normal they looked like pinkish quotes cones of light one
was going straight down from this object and the other two were flaring off slightly to either side so he stared at
it absolutely bewildered trying to figure out what he was looking at when it too
disappeared wasn't over yet because moments later a brilliant blindingly
bright white light started to move towards his house Illuminating the entire area like daylight including the
interior of his room at this point izidoro tried to approach the window but
as he did he found himself paralyzed he could feel the heat from this light hitting his face he was able
to turn his head slightly to protect his eyes as this light seemed to sort of pulsate or Flash at intervals now he
wasn't sure if it was his own fear or the light itself which caused him to be
unable to move but at one point the light retracted and now looking out he saw a
vivid red sphere was completely smooth and it began to flash painfully bright
beams of light directly into isidor's eyes and this light was strange because
although it was far too bright to even look at it did not illuminate the area
around it so not a normal light at this point the sphere Rose upward moved off
at an angle and disappeared behind the hill and the encounter was essentially
over now there were other family members in the house his son was in the same
room but nobody woke up nobody noticed anything it was just Eid Doro and there
were some strange after effects he felt strangely calm didn't talk about it and went back to bed waking up the next
morning he was quite concerned about what happened uh he reported to the police who showed up shortly later along
on with UFO researchers and journalists this case did draw a lot of interest and
there were some major after effects for several days isidoro suffered from red
and irritated eyes he said he also felt disoriented and weak there were some
strange animal reactions as well their dog who slept outside did not bark
during this encounter but for the next two weeks his behavior changed
dramatically he refused all food and would stay inside his dogghouse for two
full weeks he used to always bark at people who passed by not for these two
weeks he didn't and there was more evidence because as the researchers converged on
this area they found three circular Holes about 4 in wide 1 in deep in an
irregular triangular formation on the ground and it was clear that this was
was unusual because inside the marks the Pebbles inside him looked almost
polished and the grass in this area was also crushed to the ground they did
measure it for radiation but found no evidence of radiation but they did
discover that there were many other Witnesses in the area who had seen a red light in the sky at the time of easy
Doro encounter so there you go physiological effects animal reactions Landing traces
what more could you ask for it's a really undeniable case of an ET
visitation as you can see it did affect the witness profoundly I have to give
him kudos for stepping forward I always wonder how many people have these kinds of experiences and tell nobody except
perhaps their closest family members or friends or perhaps not even them I've
certainly talked to Witnesses personally who told me that they've told no one not even their spouse so again the vast
majority of cases go undocumented and any estimates as to how common this is
probably vastly underestimated it's far more common than most people realize and
again occurring all over the world as this next case shows I call this one the
aliens at school and I found this one really compelling because I have done a lot of research into UFO encounters over
schoolyards this is another one it is is a single witness case but it did land
next to a school there are humanoids and wow this is a really unusual case to say
the least this occurred in June of 1986 in Ova Norway and I just found this
really poignant case and I think you'll agree this case took place in eter Roya
Norway the main witness is leaf I believe that is a pseudonym but it was a sunny day in June of 198 86 as Leaf
finished delivering supplies to the Sam verola jet store which was located on
the island of etoya in levanger Norway at this time the store was
located next to the sports field of a school on the south side of the island
Leaf had just gotten some needed paperwork and was returning to his van which was parked at the corner of a
building and this is when he walked into one of the strangest experienced of his
life as he says as I rounded the car I met a small creature in a bright blue
suit now he described it vividly he said this being was very short about 3 and 1
half to 4 feet tall it had tiny little hands and feet a very thin body a bald
head but it was really the eyes which most caught his attention because they were much larger than a human's eyes
almost completely black they were slanted up and around the side of its head it wore a blue suit that was
featureless and covered its body from the neck down but most alarming of all
to Leaf was that the figure was now walking straight towards him and it
marched in a way that reminded Leaf of a soldier raising its knees and forearms while keeping its upper arms straight
down against its body and it covered the distance between them pretty quickly
approaching as close as 6 feet away needless to say this really frightened
Leaf he stepped back ducked down and hid slightly behind his van and thoughts
began to race through his mind like who was this little man was he dangerous now no sooner had he thought
this when this little man did a quick uturn and began marching back the way he had come seeing this Leaf straightened
up and looked towards the man and he could now see that this guy had returned
to a small craft that was parked on the asphalt just behind the store about 15
ft away from where Leaf stood very close so he got a good look at this craft
which he said was shaped like a half sphere was flat on the bottom it rested on three Landing legs was quite small
about 6 feet wide he said it was solid gray on the bottom section but had a
transparent Dome on top and looking in inside this transparent Dome he got a
real shock cuz he could clearly see two figures sitting side by side next to
each other both looked identical wore the same blue jumpsuit and as he's
looking at them suddenly both of them turned their heads together in perfect
synchrony these two little men then stared at him with an intense piercing
gaze at which point the craft promptly took off in perfect silence it flew at
an angle up into the air increasing speed for a few seconds and then it
darted off with an instant acceleration to the Northeast leaving nothing but a puff of condensation trailing it off
into the distance so Leaf was quite shook up he went directly home his wife could
instantly see that something was wrong and she wondered if perhaps her husband had gotten into some kind of accident
but he told her what happened and seeing how upset he was she knew he was telling the truth now being afraid of ridicule
and disbelief Leaf shared his experience with only a few people but 20 years
later still thinking about what happened he no longer cared what people thought and decided that it was his duty to
report his experience officially because he says that sometimes he still wakes up at night and can remember the intense
piercing eyes in the way these two two beings turned their heads and stared at him just before this craft took off so
many cases like this one there again we have a UFO landing he's coming out
walking up to the witness turning around going back into the craft and off they go just not sure what's going on here
unless this is sort of a introduction a way to let people know that ETS are real
in a way that's absolutely undeniable and it certainly was for the witness his
description of how he still thinks about this incident is very compelling and I
have to give him Kudos again for stepping forward after quite some time
yes but he did and I'm glad he did because otherwise we would never have heard about this and I just know so many
people are having these kinds of experiences and now we move to another
case which is also really interesting it's a multiple w in this case some really unusual humanoids I call this one
the hunters and the aliens this took place on June 26
1987 in badas Spain it's a very close encounter this typifies how people can
react with extreme fear when they have one of these craft land nearby and
humanoids come out and approach them this next case is from researcher ier
himz there are three Witnesses yento Taya a construction worker alio Gonzalez
a 34-year-old bar owner and his 16-year-old employee adalo Jose deila
they were all friends and it was at 2:30 a.m. on June 26
1987 that they were hunting in a Wilderness Area of huerto Moreno this is
near Higuera de Serena in BOS Spain and their outing was pretty much uneventful
until suddenly this very bright and unexplained light appeared in the
sky all three men turned in unison to observe what appeared to be a large
luminous sphere they thought for a split second it might be a star but it was way
too big it was about the apparent size of a full moon and it glowed This brilliant clear yellow white light so
they began talking excitedly among themselves speculating about the nature of this object when suddenly without
warning it zoomed towards them at high speed they said it was quote much larger
than that of a Jet Plane meaning much faster but it made a loud whistling
sound as the object in mere seconds stopped above some nearby olive trees
and was only about 12 ft above the ground they estimate and 75 ft away so
quite close in fact it illuminated the area around it like the Sun at full noon
they said including the hunters themselves now all three of them felt
deep fear as this object remained stationary above the trees they estimate
it was quite large 45 50 ft in diameter they could hear a loud Whistling noise
coming from this object which was decreasing in volume but becoming more high- pitched and this is when two very
tall heavy set and strongl looking figures appeared next to this object
they couldn't see them well they were featureless just two dark forms but they
said they looked almost like polished Shadows with no features and they were
big they estimate these figures were about 7 and 1/2 ft tall and almost
immediately these two figures began to approach the witnesses who of course
became even more frightened now these two figures marched slow at first taking
long strides but then began to increase their speed perhaps hovering above the
ground the witnesses thought this caused yino allejo and adalo to panic they
turned and fled the scene without looking back and they kept running at top speed until they came up to a river
which blocked their way here they hid in the undergrowth and looking back to
where they had been they could now see that this giant sphere of light was was rising up making the same loud Whistling
noise and to their great relief it moved off into the distance now the men returned home
telling nobody at first what they had seen because they were again afraid of being disbelieved or
ridiculed but they did share it with a few people and news of their encounter spread quite quickly and was shortly
later published in a local newspaper this reached the ears of investigators and researcher Pedro Maria
Fernandez spoke directly with the witnesses and following the directions
of the hunters he went to this area exactly where this object had hovered
and he found some evidence he was amazed to see that the leaves on the trees showed evidence of exposure to high heat
they were all dried up and yellowed it's hard to deny a case like that when you
have three Witnesses Landing traces as well it's such a shame that they didn't
just stand their ground and see what would happen because it might have been a much more extensive encounter
certainly not going to blame them for running who knows how we would react when we're in this
situation and now we move to the next case which is probably my favorite in
this little compilation and it's certainly the most extensive and I think the strangest and the most interesting I
mean there's a lot to learn from this case I call this one Katie and the Grays it's
a very extensive series of events two main encounters it took place in May of
1992 in Lime Grove this is in Miami Dade Florida and I'm so glad the witness came
forward she actually wrote a book about her encounters as we'll see but this is a case everyone should know about the
main witness in this case is Kitty frankovic she's the daughter of a Navy Commander this case took place about 2
months before the devastating Hurricane Andrew now Katie's case did receive
quite a bit of publicity and attention it certainly caught the attention of so many prominent researchers such as Daryl
Sims Linda Molton how Bud Hopkins John Mack and
others Katie at the time of her encounter lived in an apartment that overlooked 10 acres of semi Wilderness
known as lime Grove this is in Miami Dade Florida now living in this apartment
when she moved in she was warned by her neighbors not to go into this area of lime Grove that strange things happened
there nobody elaborated and Katie didn't think too much of it she had worked for
a long time as a wildlife researcher she didn't have any worries about being out
in the Wilds she also had four dogs who were trained as attack dogs and she
enjoyed taking them on walks through lime Grove now when she would do this she did
say that she sometimes had the feeling of being watched but again didn't think too much of it she felt safe there with
her dogs but it was late one afternoon in May of 1992 that she was walking two of her
dogs and this is when she heard a strange kind of a chopping sound she said and looking around she saw
something amazing and I'll just quote Katie directly as she says exactly three
rows over approximately 30t from Where I Stood was the strangest sight I had ever
seen standing there quietly watching me was the oddest the strangest the most
bizarre looking being I had ever laid eyes on so outrageously strange that at
first glance I honestly thought someone was standing there in a Halloween costume
I clearly recall thinking is this some kind of joke then it hit me really hit
me hard that was no costume it was real I absolutely froze too shocked to move
or even think about trying to the dogs looked directly at it their reaction was
unbelievable instead of lunging forward to aggressively Ward it off both dogs
simultaneously laid down on the ground putting their heads on their front paws and closing their eyes Eyes Two trained
attack dogs who would not hesitate to attack laid down and appeared to be
asleep the entire situation was so bizarre that I could not believe what was happening so what kitty was looking
at was a figure a gray ET she knew that whatever it was was not human she didn't
think ET she had never really given any thought to UFOs or
extraterrestrials but as Katie says it was The Haunting eyes that took
my breath away those big black almond-shaped eyes staring back at me
not human not animal solid black eyes without pupils without eyelids and not a
trace of any white of the eye showing so big in proportion to the rest of the
strange face they dominated it like the spine chilling effect of a hooded COBRA
they stared back daunting not blinking the harder eyes tried to identify what
what I was looking at the worse it got the being's head was similar to a
human's but with obvious striking differences there wasn't any hair on the
head or the rest of the body and from the looks of it never had been the skin
was a grayish color with a slight pinkish Hue the texture of it reminded me of the soft skin of a dolphin the
circumference of the head was much larger than that of a human the overall structure was pear-shaped coming down
into a non-descriptive chin the nose appeared too small in contrast as if
nothing more than two tiny nostrils the mouth was about half the size of a
humans the arms were long and emaciated looking with no visible muscle tone but
following the arms down to the hands I was reminded of the orangutan ape only
because this emaciated arm extended into a hand with long fingers but unlike the
ape the thumb was located in the same place as the human hand now KT looked at this and she could
see that this being did have six fingers on each hand she said it had strong muscular looking legs small feet it
appeared to be about 49 in tall she had the distinct impression that this figure
was male she said it wore tight fitting metallic looking clothes kind of like
spandex with black boots that had no laces or buckles she wondered how he got
these shoots on shoes on because there was nothing on them so they stood and
watched each other for several moments until this figure moved partially behind a tree at this point Katie was afraid
but she was also curious and fascinated and this is when movement on a nearby tree branch caught her eye and
she saw this strange hairy trible like creature sitting on a branch now she's very familiar with animals and
she went through various theories as to what this creature could be but none fit
and as she's staring at it it was covered with grayish brown fur she received a very clear distinct
telepathic message saying this is a possum but she immediately rejected this
explanation did not believe it was AUM and immediately a second message came
which said this is a raccoon she did not believe that she rejected that
explanation and then Katie surprised herself by reacting in a way that she
never would have this was totally out of character she calmly walked away as she
said quote as if nothing had ever happened so she took about 15 steps away
when she snapped out of what almost felt to her like a trance and realizing what she had just seen she immediately ran
back to the site she did notice at this point that everything was eerily quiet
then she did hear a sound and suddenly saw this gray coming out from behind a tree and it appeared to be clutching
this bag to its chest and looking at this bag she could see this grayish creature inside it and this is when the
gray began running she said it was like a gazelle leaping three feet into the air with each step moving at impossible
speed almost gliding through the air this really amazed her so she chased
after him and she was surprised to see that he didn't outrun her because she she said it looked like he could have
easily but instead he seemed to intentionally keep Pace with her off to
the side they both ran about 30 ft away from each other side by side for a good
distance she says about five small blocks and this is when she heard this
strange telepathic message over and over biente biente which she later learned
meant come friend this is in castian Spanish so that's certainly interesting
and after running for several minutes suddenly the being disappeared this is
when Katie noticed a terrible stench which she said was somewhat like for Malahide she immediately sensed at this
point that there were several other Grays ahead of her she's still in this Grove of trees by the way
so she decided to turn around and run and her two dogs ran with her right out
of the Grove running up to Southwest 137th Avenue then she walked the quarter
mile back to her apartment now again before this Katie had never given any thought to aliens
but she called her friend and told her what happened and this is what when her
friend said you know this sounds like ETS so that really floored her and
although this experience had been scary and although this experience had
been scary Katie's curiosity was stronger than her fear and she returned the next morning to investigate but she
could find no evidence no Footprints nothing but her experience wasn't over
yet she was about to have another one it was just a few nights later around 11:15
p.m. she was in her home her dogs were asleep and suddenly this strange green
Mist started to appear on the ceiling and she watched it for a few moments when she decided to call a friend and
speak to her and she was on the phone with her describing this Mist as it
formed when she looked out the window and lo and behold there was the same
type of gray ET that she had seen earlier but it was now staring at her from outside it was not the same one it
did look slightly different she said and she had the distinct impression that this one was female and even more
amazing was that directly behind it stood a smaller gray who she sens was
male and who she sensed was an adolescent and I'll just let Katie
describe this event because she describes it well as she says I was amazed at how delicate and in an unusual
way how startingly beautiful she truly was her huge almond shaped eyes were
solid black with no apparent eyelids or eyelashes once I adjusted to the strange
physical features I found the female to be quite precious she was obviously
inquisitive yet at the same time a little timid I could not help wondering
what I looked like to her did she perceive me as intimidating or had she been able to
adjust to my strange appearance quickly I had to smile at the smaller one behind
her with his peekaboo glances he behaved just like a shy human youngster to be in
their presence and take this all in was one of the most breathtaking moments of my life what could possibly be more
extraordinary more fascinating than the incredible beings right before my very
eyes all I could think of was how wondrously gentle they were was very
obvious from her body length anguage and non-aggressive behavior so she's watching this while
she's on the phone with her friend and she's describing this all to her friend her friend was more scared than Katie
and as she watched this gray this female gray reached out and put her hand up
against the screen of the window Katie was amazed not only at this but her own courage because she stepped
forward reached out and placed her hand against the window in the same way in
this sort of communication of greeting and again I'll just quote Katie directly
and she says our eyes remain fixed on each other locked into position exactly
like our extended hands precisely then I distinctly perceived a telepathic
communication every bit as clear as if the words had been audibly spoken
protector of life protector of life life the gentle words echoed through my head
in my native language she moved her head ever so slightly and I heard the words
again protector of life I instantly perceived that this was the designated
name chosen for me there have been few times in my life when I have experienced
such tender feelings of compassion and gentleness emanated by another any
lingering fears or doubts I may have had seized to exist from that point on I
perceived us as two individuals bonded by a mutual admiration and respect for
one another she was standing before me as the caretaker of the Adolescent her
role identifiable as protector of life as I watched it suddenly occurred to me
I too was a caretaker for a male adolescent my role as his mother
identifiable as protector of life it was that simple yet that profound thank you
I thought back humbly thank you and with that the younger being peaked out again
lingering there as he watched the female removed her hand from the screen and I
slowly lowered mine so it was at this point that the gray turned around leaped off the porch
followed by the other gray and they both moved off and as Katie says it never
ceases to Intrigue me the way which this encounter was handled the beings had
chosen to approach me in a gentle unobtrusive manner indicating to me
their intentions were not to instigate alarm or fright the very presence of a
female with an adolescent was something I as a female could readily identify with this in itself put me at ease
immediately the behavior I witnessed that evening was definitely based upon a trusting nurturing and protective
relationship the same kind of bond we humans associate with love the following day I felt driven to
do a drawing on a circular piece of wood and paint it I am not the best painter
in the world however when it was completed I could not help but admire the unusual Creation The Strange design
resembled a three-point symbol of some sort although I had no way of proving
what the symbol meant I intuitively felt it symbolically represented the words
protector of life a symbol that became so dear I would always keep it as an
invaluable Keepsake right outside my door it remains there as the symbol of universal
motherhood I found this so interesting because Katie was a protector of wildlife as well lots of contact tees
have this incredible relationship with nature their environmentalists I think this might be
part of the reason behind her contact now it was just 2 days after this that
she was confronted by two well-dressed men in black suits who flashed a badge
at her told her that they were from the federal government and they wanted to know if she saw anything strange in the
Grove Katie said nothing about her experience and said that she had seen people picking limes but that's about it
she played dumb the man persisted Katie continued to play dumb they kept asking
her over and over if she had any seen anything strange which she denied but
she says they followed her for the next few weeks keeping her under constant
surveillance now it was just a few weeks after this that hurricane Andrews struck destroyed her home caused her grave
injuries but she did end up writing a book titled where Heaven's meet which is
about her encounter and her struggles following Hurricane Andrew I do think
that's a very important case it's really unusual uh it shows how an encounter can
be very frightening when in fact it's overall benevolent and friendly I love
how the ETS were basically telling her hello and welcome friend uh giving her a
message as well in her second encounter and it's just a really beautiful series
of events and I'm so glad she came forward and talked about it it's the
kind of case I think that really shows how an encounter that's initially quite
frightening reveals itself in fact to be quite benevolent overall so a fascinating case on
multiple levels and now we move to another case which I call Havana humanoid this one
took place on November 27 1995 in Havana Cuba don't get a whole lot of cases from
Cuba I think that alone makes this case very interesting also interesting is
that the main witness is a security guard we have a lot of cases of night Watchmen and security guards and
policemen who see UFOs because obviously it's their job to be up outside late at
night and they get to see things that a lot of other people wouldn't necessarily see that's certainly true in this case
of a landed UFO and humanoids this amazing case was
presented in the film aves on Cuba this is a documentary by Octavio cazar
Armando lerz and Hugo parado Francos the witness is Samuel Rodolfo
barreras who worked as a security guard at El trial this is located right
outside of Havana City in Cuba and it was early on the morning of November 27
1995 that Samuel was sitting at his post which overlooks the courtyard of all the
buildings that he's protecting when he saw this bright light approaching now seeing how low and
bright it was he first assumed that this was some kind of aircraft in trouble and in danger of crashing but very quickly
he watched this strange light approach and his astonishment grew as he realized
that this light was actually a classic Flying Saucer and in fact it came right
up to his location hovered directly over the roof of one of the buildings so he
was absolutely a struck at this point in fact he now realized that he was
completely paralyzed he could not move not a muscle as this craft maneuvered
and descend descended to the center of the courtyard in the middle of the building complex that Samuel was
guarding now this craft came down reaching about 3 feet above the ground
at which point it stopped and stayed completely still was now about 35 ft away from him he said that this craft
had little round lights around the lower circumference of it it was after about 1
minute a small rounded hatch opened from the lower section of the craft and a
strange humanoid entity came out he said it was over 6 feet tall had kind of a
light bulb shaped head bald large round eyes that reminded him in some ways of
the iris of a camera he said it also wore dark shiny clothing and this end began to walk in
an almost mechanical way away from the ship and directly towards Samuel this
scared Samuel quite badly he wanted to reach out and find something to protect himself but he was still unable to move
a muscle then to Samuel's relief this entity stopped its approach Stood Still
and began to move its head around in different directions as if surveying the area and it did this for quite some time
about 50 15 minutes at which point it retraced its steps back to the craft and
re-entered through this hatch this hatch closed and it showed no seams at all on
the surface of this craft after the hatch closed lower part of the craft lit up with the series of
bright blue lights it then made a loud humming sound he says kind of like a
swarm of bees but much higher pitched and the craft now rose up slowly
vertically the blue lights around the base became brighter and brighter and once this
craft reached the level of the roofs it shot off at high speed and was instantly
gone in a split second Samuel's paralysis immediately broke he quickly
rushed inside got a piece of paper to draw the entity in the craft that he had seen so he wouldn't forget it and then
reported it to his superiors and of course the whole experience soon reach
investigat and that's how we heard about it today in many ways that's a very typical case
and again showing this very common pattern of a UFO dropping down from the sky Landing right next to a witness ETS
coming out and walking up to the witness and then returning back inside so I
don't know again I'm wondering if these are simply displays little introductions hard to say for sure but
it certainly is interesting and now we move to another
really fascinating case this one is so bizarre and in some ways quite
frightening for the witness understandably I think I call this one the humanoid in the bathroom this one
took place on June 24th 2001 in pipines
Greece it is a single witness case but what's so fascinating about this case is
how this ET was running around inside this person's house and well let's let's
just get into it and you'll see this very bizarre and high strangeness case comes from Greek researcher thanasis
vmos he's written quite a few books on these kinds of subjects now the sole
witness is known only by his initials Mr GP but he's considered by thanasis to be
a very reliable witness and is in fact a professor at the University of patrus
this is in pipines Greece where this encounter took place it was at 1:50 a.m. on June 24th 2001 Mr
G was watching television in the living room of his home his wife and young child were asleep in their bedrooms his
other daughter was away from the house at this time and Mr G was getting ready to go to
bed he turned off the television he saw that the light in the kitchen was still on so he went to turn it off flicking it
off and turning around he suddenly felt this unusual cool chill sweep over his
body almost like a cool wind so turning back around he got an incredible shock
cuz he was standing face to face with a strange humanoid it was tall 6 feet
maybe 2 Ines tall and was wearing a strange tight fitting blue coverall
covered his entire body it had wavelike patterns on the surface he said his body
was thin and lanky but but it was his face that was most strange or rather lack of it because all Mr G could see
were vaguely human features sort of small bumps where the eyes nose and
mouth would be so he couldn't see any face it almost looked to Mr G like a
computer graphic he said and he was close it stood only 6 feet away from him
then things became even more strange when this being started to bound around
like an athlete like an athlete leaps over hurdles is how Mr G described it but moving in this
weird slow motion it reminded him of quote a dancer with his toes not
touching the ground and Mr G watched this figure flee from the kitchen and
enter into the open bathroom just off of the kitchen Mr G chased it into the
bathroom but to his shock the bathroom was empty there was no Escape so where
did The Entity go of course he began searching the house and he was now shocked to see this entity coming out of
his daughter's room apparently having moved through the wall of the bathroom into there it moved into the kitchen and
back into the bathroom where it again disappeared Mr G chased it again but it
wasn't there apparently this happened a third time he watched it come out of the
bathroom and now vanish into the living room and after that it was gone and did
not return Mr G did have the strange impression that it was quote running
away from something or quote being hunted by something and wanting to avoid
any contact he said that although it was able to move through walls in an
ethereal way he felt absolutely certain that this creature was quote something
solid so this did not look like an apparition to him he was understandably
shocked by The Experience he doesn't remember it making any sound he's not
sure if this weird feeling of cold persisted through the encounter because this whole incident which lasted no more
than 30 seconds was so shocking that he stopped paying attention to the temperature he says he did not smell
anything unusual he wonders however if this might have been connected in some way to two
other unusual experiences earlier in his life because once in
1974 somebody knocked at his door he answered the door and there was a strange woman at asking for money and as
she's talking suddenly she vanished Into Thin Air so perhaps a spirit of some
kind and another time in 1986 he saw his mother-in-law on a bus actually watched
her for 5 minutes the thing is his mother-in-law had already passed away
some time earlier so perhaps he has mediumistic abilities but he still
insists that this figure with the blue jumpsuit was a solid ID
figure I mean there's no denying that that is high strangeness for you can you
imagine going into your kitchen and seeing this very tall humanoid without
any apparent face and dressed up in this tight blue jumpsuit ETS do seem to love
these jumpsuits it's a very common alien fashion I'm going to have to do an episode on alien Fashions one of these
days just to take a look at how ETS dress but yeah that's very common I also
found it interesting that the witness had some really profound spiritual experiences as well with what are
apparently ghosts though he's convinced up and down that this was not a
spiritual being but a physical being and you know sure sounds like it there was
no UFO directly involved but it certainly matches what many other people
describe with humanoids coming out of craft
and now we move to the final case in this compilation this is a really interesting
series of events which occurred to a single witness though he did try to get other Witnesses I call this one it
appeared three times this occurred in December 2001 in Tampa Florida involves
a young man who had three Encounters in a row with a gray type ET all of which
began in kind of the the same way I wonder if there's more to this case than we're hearing about if he's had further
encounters since then fortunately I don't have any way of following up with the witness on this case but I think
it's an important one and that's why I wanted to share it with you today this very bizarre case comes from researcher
Albert Rosales who did a firsthand interview with the witness it was one evening in December
2001 that the witness was inside his home near Tampa Florida when he heard a strange sound coming
from the backyard he said it reminded him of somebody crinkling the package of a bag of chips but as he was watching
his favorite show he ignored the sound but then a few minutes later he heard it
again so he thought it might be one of his dogs there was a commercial playing
on the television so he decided he'd walk into the bathroom which was sandwiched between his and his brother's
rooms and had a window facing the entire backyard and looking out through the bathroom
window he didn't see his dogs but he saw something much stranger a three-foot
tall human looking figure with a weird lump on its head and as soon as he saw it this
creature ran towards the fence and vanished so he stood there in shock for
just a few seconds but immediately ran into his brother's room and told him what happened his brother unfortunately
did not believe him so he went and told his mother who was also
skeptical but the witness knew he had seen something so he grabbed a flashlight and a knife from the kitchen
went out into the backyard and this little man was gone and there was no evidence that he had been there but this
was just the first incident because it was just a few weeks later around dusk the witness had walked into the
kitchen to get something to drink when he heard this same weird crinkling sound
so he ran to the window and there it was this same tiny figure but this time he
said while it looked identical it had a bluish tint to it and he watched it for
about 2 seconds when it promptly vanished Into Thin Air so he ran back to
the kitchen grabbed a knife rushed out into the backyard checked all over for any trace of it but again there was
nothing now his dogs were in the house at the time they didn't react in any way
but he decided to let them out to search the yard and they did not seem to notice anything unusual did not react in any
way and it was just a few days later that the winess had his third and final
encounter he was riding his bike outside through the neighborhood it was a chilly
uh night and he was returning home and he was about two houses away from his own house when he saw this same figure
again only this time it stood in the backyard of the house next to him two
houses down now this yard had no fence obscuring the backyard so he could get a good look at
it and it was the same figure all right only this time it sort of had a reddish glow to it and again had a weird well a
couple of weird bumps on its head so he rushed home ditched his bike returned to
the neighbor's house to tell them what he had seen and warned them about this figure in the back yard but once again
they did not believe him now Albert Rosales who interviewed the witness
wonders if perhaps these were three different figures but again hard to say
and certainly an unusual case another really interesting case that last one
you know it's interesting to me because rarely is a face-to-face encounter with
a humanoid a one-off people who have this kind of encounter usually have other encounters whether it's a simple
sighting or not but rarely is it a singular event what's interesting in
this case is that he never did see a UFO and yet he saw this clearly gray type ET
three times very close up so something's going on there really fascinating stuff
so that's it for today 10 humanoid cases from all over the world the United States South America Europe Cuba just
goes to show these things are happening all over our planet it's been going on for a very long long time and as I've
said before it's much more common than people realize fascinated that the
humanoid form seems to be the universal template and as many contactees have
been told we apparently share a common Heritage with these
ETS and as contes have also been told you know we are you you are us we are
all one and I think we see that in these cases but with each case we learn a
little bit more about what's going on so I hope you learned something I hope you found these cases interesting I really
want to thank you guys for watching it's because of you I do this research also for myself frankly I want to know what's
going on having had several of my own encounters all right thank you again and
until next week keep searching the skies keep looking for the truth keep asking
those hard questions most important of all keep having fun and I will see you
all next week bye for now
