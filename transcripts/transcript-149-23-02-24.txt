THOSE DAM UFOS!!!
Feb 24, 2023

Summary:
Feb 24, 2023
UFO sightings are not as random as they might seem. Researchers discovered long ago that UFOs find certain locations very interesting. These are called “UFO attractors,” and there are a lot them. Some include military bases, nuclear power stations, prisons, graveyards, rocket launches, mines, schoolyards, drive-in movie theaters and more. Another well-known UFO attractor is dams and hydroelectric stations. However, there has not been much research into these types of cases. Until now!

This video presents more than 30 cases of UFOs hovering over dams. And not only hovering, but landing too. Several cases also involve humanoids. The evidence for these cases is astounding. There are multiple witnesses, physiological effects, electromagnetic effects, landing traces, photos and more. In some cases, the UFOs appear to be siphoning water from the reservoirs, or electricity from the power stations. Some of the dams are visited over and over again.

These cases reach back from the modern age of UFOs in 1947 to the present day, and are occurring all over the world: Australia, Canada, Europe, Canada, the United States, South America and more. Why are UFOs visiting our dams? Are they examining our technology? Do they want the water and electricity? Or are there other reasons? The answers are here!

Jul 10, 1947. Three glowing V-shaped objects circle over the Owyhee Dam in Parma, ID for more than 10 minutes.

Feb 10, 1953. Army security guard Jessie E. Kent observes two glowing discs hovering 150 feet above the dam and reservoir at the Richard Quartermaster Depot in Richmond, VA.

May 1953. Two men driving over the bridge of Loch Raven Dam in Baltimore, MD are confronted by a UFO which stalls their vehicle. Five years later, on Oct 26, 1958, two men driving over the same bridge have the same experience. Over the next decades, many other encounters occur.

1950s. An employee of Davis Dam in AZ reports that UFOs would repeatedly hover over the dam, apparently drawing electric power from the hydroelectric station.

Jul 1962. Two men fishing at the Foote Dam reservoir in Oscoda, MI see a huge saucer-shaped craft covered with multi-colored lights right overhead. Moments later, fighter jets from nearby Wurtsmith AFB chase it away.

Oct 24, 1962. Railroad employee Lester Sandler reports seeing a UFO over the Horsetooth Reservoir and Dixon Dam area. Moments later another witness reports a UFO landing at the base of the dam.

Jun 20, 1964. Two witnesses see a UFO and humanoids hovering over the Gorge Dam in Newhalem, WA. U.S. fighter jets chase the object away and a govt investigation follows.

1964. AF Officer Frank Kinsey and his brother see a “USO” rise out of Lake Casitas. Through a porthole, they see a humanoid looking back at them. Kinsey quickly snaps of a photo.

Jan 11, 1966. Hundreds of people observe a UFO maneuver for several hours at low elevation over Wanaque Reservoir and Raymond Dam. Ten months later on Oct 10, the UFO returns and is witnessed by hundreds and even photographed.

Aug 30, 1970, security guard Almiro Martins de Freitas shoots at a UFO as it hovers directly over the Funil Dam. Almiro is struck by a beam of light which temporarily blinds him. The UFO leaves, but returns multiple times over the next week.

Jun 1971, a family has three encounters in a week by the Clearwater Dam in Piedmont, MO, including one “USO” in the reservoir itself. One year later, more sightings occur, generating national headlines.

1971. A man camping in Jamison Valley by the Warragamba Dam in New South Wales, Australia walks upon a landed UFO and several humanoids.

Feb 1973. Numerous witnesses (including police) observe a UFO dive into the waters of Wheeler Dam in Huntsville, AL.

Jun 5, 1973. Two fishermen at Rio Dam in Port Jervis, NY see a glowing UFO sucking water up from the lake. Looking through a porthole, they see a strange, brown-skinned humanoid.

These are just a few of the many other cases occurring all over the world: Dillon Dam in CO, Castelo de Bode Dam in Portugal, Fort Phantom Lake Dam in TX, Blewett Falls Dam in NC, Palmar Dam in Uruguay, Muskrat Dam in Canada, Alfalfal Dam in Chile, Wivenhoe Dam in Australia, El Tunal Dam in Argentina, Scammonden Dam in England, and so many others.

There are too many cases to deny. UFOs are showing a strong interest in our dams and hydroelectric stations. They are clearly keeping tabs on our technology, and in some cases, appear to be taking water and electricity. These cases show that UFOs are not imaginary, but are highly technological craft piloted by extraterrestrials.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and Welcome to our new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode I call those damn UFOs when I say damn I don't mean damn I mean dams as 
in hydroelectric power stations and reservoirs there are quite a few cases of UFOs showing an 
interest in dance these cases reach back decades they are occurring all over the world and there 
are dozens of them and I think this is something important to say about the ET agenda on our planet 
UFO researchers have learned long ago that UFOs are attracted to anything technological 
so we see a lot of sightings over military bases over nuclear power stations I did 
a prior episode on UFOs over prisons so I think that's probably what's going on here 
but what I'd like to do is take you on a journey through time starting with the 
earliest cases going all the way to the most recent and exploring these damn UFO cases 
and I think you'll find it quite interesting I do have a lot of cases so I'm going to just touch on 
the highlights with most of these and we can see what's going on here so let's just get started 
perhaps the earliest recorded Dam encounter certainly the one that I could find occurred 
actually only days after the famous Roswell UFO crash on July 10 1947 and this was in Parma Idaho 
Mr and Mrs go and their friend Peter Edgar were outside their farms in Parma Idaho when they saw 
three glowing objects maneuvering in the night sky over oihi Dam these objects flew in a V formation 
in tight circles appearing and reappearing in the same location and they did this for about 
10 minutes before they finally just took off it's a brief and somewhat unremarkable case but soon 
more cases would occur which would is definitely establish the connection between UFOs and dams 
and here's another early case which occurred in Richmond Virginia 
this occurred on February 10 1953 near the Richmond Quarter Master Depot in Richmond 
and multiple army officers observed two orange glowing discs hovering over a 75-foot water tower 
and shortly later the objects moved to the west and hovered over a dam in the area 
they were observed at this time by a guard by the name of Jesse E Kent and while standing on 
the dam he saw these objects hovering about 150 feet above the surface of the lake they moved 
around these two discs for a few minutes and the guard thought the objects were actually going to dive into the water but instead at this point they took off vertically and disappeared and according 
to him these objects were fairly large about 25 feet in diameter they were featureless and 
totally silent so basically your classic UFOs and again they're hovering right over a dam 
now here's a very famous series of events actually which occurred over the lock Raven 
Dam and Reservoir this is located in Baltimore Maryland and these events became quite famous 
because they there was a few of them and the first encounter that I could find occurred in May 1953 
when two young men were approaching the bridge which crosses the Loch Raven Reservoir and for 
no apparent reason that they could see their car engine died followed by the radio and headlights 
and moments later a quote orange glowing object appeared 300 feet ahead of them over the bridge 
with saucer shaped and bright enough to actually reflect on the water the two men became frightened 
and fled their vehicle and as they watched this object actually sent down a cone of light a beam 
of light into the water it could hear it making a low humming noise and after about 10 minutes which 
is a pretty long time this object disappeared now as amazing as this incident was it was a sighting 
which occurred five years later on October 26 1958 that would bring International headlines 
two men Philip small and Alvin Cohen were again approaching this same exact bridge 
when they came upon a quote large flat and sort of egg-shaped object hovering 150 feet overhead 
they eased the car slowly forward until suddenly the engine died and the electrical system failed 
at this point the object flared in brightness and they felt a wave of heat and heard a loud noise 
and as this light faded they saw this object rise upward and disappear that point the car engine 
came back to life and the two men quickly left the area and reported their sighting to authorities 
at this point both men noticed that they had a burning sensation on their face and they 
went to the Baltimore hospital where they were examined by doctors who did confirm these Burns 
and according to researcher Marcus loath over the decades there would be a number of other 
sightings for example in 1978 a fisherman reported seeing a quote right round light 
actually rise up out of the water hover briefly and then dive back in the lake and years later 
in 1983 there was a Repeat Performance viewed by multiple Baltimore city water department workers 
it's amazing how many sightings there are because there's more in April of 1986 musician Sharif 
Jameel and two friends so that they were on the dam and they saw a quote glowing oval-shaped 
object hovering hovering directly overhead they took off running and a final sighting 
occurred in January of 2000 when a witness says that they saw a glowing green disc over the dam 
and following this encounter the witness says that they suffered from severe eye problems and pain 
in the back and joints so clearly something is going on here as a researcher Marcus loath writes 
that something strange appears attracted to the luck Raven Reservoir is surely Beyond doubt 
just what is the reason for the interest in this region of whatever intelligence lays Behind These 
mysterious crafts well that's the million dollar question isn't it but there are so many cases 
here's another case which we don't have the exact date for but it's somewhere around the late 1950s and this occurred in Davis Dam in Arizona and I will just quote the witness here 
well actually it's the son of the witness and as the son of the witness says my father worked at 
a small dam called Davis Dam in Arizona on the Colorado River across from what is now Laughlin 
it is between Hoover Dam and Parker Dam he would tell of UFOs coming at night to get power from 
the dam he and another man would be out on the top of the dam and would see the UFOs the father told 
his son that these objects appeared often and they were classic saucer shaped and covered with lights 
so here we have the first indication that UFOs are not only hovering dams but perhaps taking some of the electricity and there are other cases like this as we shall see 
and here's another case this one occurred in July of 1962 at the foot Dam near Oscoda Michigan 
this one comes from two fishing buddies they were fishing for wall-eyed Pike on the pond created by 
foot down this is only a few miles by the way from wurtzmurth Air Force Base and they would often 
see jets landing and taking off from there but on this evening the Jets had finished their Maneuvers 
and the two men were fishing in the center of this miles wide Reservoir without warning the 
complete darkness was pierced by a bright light overhead and it's one of the witnesses says in 
his own words and I quote looking up we saw a huge ship hundreds of feet in diameter right above us 
there was no sound it was flashing all sorts of colors it was immense and terrifying almost 
immediately it seemed that numerous fighter jets came pouring out of the runway slowly the 
ship Rose until it appeared the size of a half dollar and zoomed to the West almost instantly 
so it appears that the military did detect this object and scrambled Jets after it 
the men quickly returned to their Camp built a bonfire and went to sleep but the next morning they listened to the radio news and learned that the local police stations had been flooded 
by callers reporting UFOs so apparently there were multiple witnesses to this case 
and here's another case which occurred just a few months later and this was quite far 
away from that location in Fort Collins Colorado this occurred on October 24th 1962 when Southern 
Railroad employee Lester Sandler called the local sheriff to report his sighting 
of a round gray white object which he had seen dropping from the sky just west of Fort Collins 
and the Sheriff's Office sent deputies to investigate and at this point another report came 
into the office describing an object which had actually landed at the base of Dixon Canyon Dam 
this is on horse tooth Reservoir the North End of Horsetooth Reservoir 
and the witness said that this object was orange huge in size and the Air Force was contacted and 
sent up planes to investigate however by the time they arrived at the location this object was gone 
now here's another really dramatic case actually which occurred two years later on June 20th 1964 
at the Gorge Dam in New halem Washington the main witness was a young man who was visiting with his 
uncle who actually worked at the dam they were at the PowerHouse of the dam when without warning a 
large metallic disc dropped from the sky initially it was sideways on edge but it then assumed a 
horizontal position and hovered just above the water directly in front of the powerhouse alarms 
immediately went off and the witness viewed this object very close from he says about 30 feet away 
he estimates that this saucer was about a hundred feet in diameter and 30 feet thick so quite large 
and here's where it gets even stranger I'll just quote the witness directly as he says 
I saw many dark colored small human looking occupants looking at me and moving aside so that 
others could take turns looking at me they seemed to smile at me and I feel like they liked me 
it saw a whirling Motion in the water below the disc and it was humming lightly then the outside 
edge in two places like rains began to counter rotate increasing in speed and the windows closed 
so realizing that what he was seeing was very unusual the witness began yelling for his uncle 
to come outside and view this object and after just a few moments his uncle came outside and 
joined him and at that exact moment this object moved up and over the tree line and both Witnesses 
could now see a clear transparent Dome on top of the object and two brightly dressed human looking 
figures apparently piloting The Craft and the witness shouted out look it's a UFO to his uncle 
and his uncle who was skeptical of UFOs said that he thought it might be a secret Russian craft 
but at that moment U.S jet fighters appeared and apparently tried to intercept this craft which 
quickly darted away and was gone and according to the witness this did get the attention of the 
FBI who was called in to investigate this whole incident to a pretty interesting case involving 
humanoids and here's another one involving humanoids I have covered this case before in 
a previous episode but it's absolutely relevant here so I'm going to repeat this this occurred at 
Lake Casitas which is located just Inland off the coast of Ventura California Southern California 
and this is sort of at the northern edge of the Santa Catalina Channel which is a huge 
UFO and Uso hotspot so this dam is or this lake lake Casitas is an artificial Reservoir 
it was built in 1959 when a dam was put in and one day in 1964 five years later after 
this Lake was created this Reservoir an Air Force officer and pilot by the name of Frank s Kinsey 
was at Lake Casitas with his brother-in-law when they heard a loud sound of splashing water 
and this case was investigated by a mufan field investigator by the name of Robert D Neville 
Frank Kinsey told Robert Neville as he says I looked out into the lake and here's this object 
coming out of the water so this object emerged from the water with such speed that actually 
sucked up a large column of water which came loudly crashing down and this is what drew the 
attention of Frank Kinsey and again as Frank says I was flabbergasted it was a round object and it 
looked like it had a cone on top where a person was looking out at us a being looking out at us 
I could see the eyes staring at us I happened to have a pair of binoculars with me at the 
time I picked them up and looked and could see a person looking out at me 
Frank estimates that this object was about 30 feet wide the outside perimeter of the object 
appeared to be rotating and according to Frank it emitted a painfully loud noise 
you can see several portholes situated around the top cone section of the this object 
and it was through one of these portholes that he could see this being he said these windows 
looked like quote real thick heavy glass of some kind or maybe it might have been plastic 
at any rate this object suddenly accelerated glowing first a lavender color and then bright 
orange yellow and in a few seconds it was Miles Away disappearing over the mountains 
however Frank did have a camera with him and quickly snapped a photo of this object as you can 
see here as it moved away and as Frank says it had a gleam to it it had a shine to it like nothing 
I've ever seen I've seen a lot of medals here on Earth that had a high gloss but nothing like this 
that I've ever seen so that's a very interesting case involving photographs and a humanoid 
now probably the most controversial complicated and widely viewed damn UFO is what happened 
throughout 1966 and really Beyond at the Raymond Dam and the wanak reservoir in New Jersey 
this was on the evening of January 11 1966 when this series of incidents began 
on that day hundreds of local residents including police officers and government officials observed 
an intensely bright glowing orb over the reservoir this object started around hovered glided across 
the reservoir for a period of hours it was silent it pulsed and brightness it changed 
in color from white red and green back to White so calls were flooding the local police station 
and crowds of people converged to watch this object some reported it as being quite small 
only a few feet in diameter While others thought it was larger perhaps nine feet wide 
now this object was viewed throughout the evening and actually into the next day 
um some so that when they saw it was hovering in place others said it was driving around at 
high speeds and there was a lot of witnesses and it was later that year on October 10 1966 
that the UFO returned and put on an even more dramatic display over this same Reservoir 
again it hovered very low over the water performing fantastic Maneuvers and again the local 
police station was flooded with calls and hundreds of people converged to view this spectacle 
and according to some of the witnesses this object at times would swoop very low over the surface 
causing the water to actually rise in the air there were a number of photographs taken though 
to this day they remained somewhat controversial at any rate Stewart Air Force Base was contacted 
and they tried to debunk us saying that the light was nothing more than a helicopter on maneuvers though they later denied this so there was quite a bit of debunking and 
explanations being raised to account for these sightings including everything from weather balloons seismic lights earthquake lights Marsh gas and even Venus and in fact 
there's some indication that there was a cover-up enacted because some witnesses say that they were 
actually approached by government officials who told them not to talk about what they had seen 
but this case did generate International headlines there were so many witnesses and 
today the sightings remain a classic in UFO literature and have yet to be fully explained
so yeah many of these cases are quite dramatic and here's a very dramatic case 
which occurred at the funeral Dam and power station in Rio De Janeiro Brazil 
this is a rather harrowing Dam UFO encounter which occurred on the evening of August 30th 1970. 
the main witness was almiro Martin's de fritas he was a security guard at the funeral down 
and on that evening he was on the dam itself when he saw an object approaching very low 
he said it had about 15 portholes which were shining blue and yellow light and he 
approached within about 50 feet of this object and fearing that the UFO would damage the dam 
in some way he actually drew his gun and fired twice at the object probably not a good idea 
because in response this object whined loudly flared in brightness then struck El Miro with 
a beam of light now this caused him temporary blindness he shot anyway at the object again 
and according to him he actually heard all three bullets strike the metallic surface of this object 
meanwhile other guards came running they heard the gunshots and this object quickly moved away 
while El Miro was rushed to the hospital and his sight uh remained I mean he was blind for 
about two weeks following this incident when his vision was suddenly restored 
so thank God that was a temporary condition but here's another interesting factor to this case 
an investigation of the area where this object had hovered revealed that the cement on the 
dam directly below the object was sort of powdered and cracked and pitted with holes 
so apparently it had quite a hot temperature which affected the dam itself this is a good Landing 
Trace case as well physiological effects Landing traces it's pretty well verified 
and as does occur in some of these cases the object returned was a few days later 
on September 3rd when this object made another appearance over the dam apparently the same object 
and this time the guard on duty did not shoot at it he flashed lights at the object which then 
quickly darted away and three days later on September 6th the UFO came back again 
and on this occasion six guards watch this object circling over the dam area 
pretty clear this object is showing an intense interest in this Dam in so many cases all over 
the world here's another one which occurred at the Clearwater Dam outside of Piedmont 
was late one evening in June of 1971. when a woman was driving home from work across the Clearwater 
Dam Road and saw an incredible sight and I'll just quote her directly as she says I saw a 
huge glowing round object at the bottom of the dam it was under water and it emitted a greenish glow 
I clearly saw what appeared to be a double row of small Windows all the way around it it was glowing 
so bright that I could see it clearly I was terrified that it would come out of the water and 
chase me I'll never forget it so this was a Uso an unidentified submersible object which as we have 
seen does occur in these damn UFO cases and it was actually only two weeks earlier that this same 
witness was driving with her daughter and a friend when they saw a UFO perhaps the same one rise from 
a field nearby and chase their car down the road for a short period of time and it was shortly 
after the second sighting of the Uso when the witness had a third encounter which again appeared 
to be the same object complete with two rows of small glowing windows so a pretty dramatic case 
so damn UFO cases involving humanoids are somewhat rare but as this next case shows they do happen 
and they provide really good evidence of the et's interest in the dams themselves 
this case occurred in 1971 just south of the huera Gamba Dam this was actually in the Jameson 
Valley in New South Wales Australia south of the waragamba dam backwaters and in the middle 
of the night the witness was awakened by a loud humming noise he grabbed a flashlight and went 
to investigate and to his amazement he approached a clearing which was illuminated by the glow from 
an egg-shaped object landed on the ground he saw several dark human-looking figures moving 
around the object he turned on his flashlight at which point the figures quickly entered the 
object which rose upward and darted away at high speed so while this wasn't directly over the dam 
it was damn adjacent and I think it's probably connected to these types of cases which is why 
I wanted to include it but year after year this is happening it was just one year later 
on May 25 1972 when another case occurred at the Piedmont Country Club in Piedmont Missouri 
and this is really interesting the main witness is Marjorie Cundiff she's the manager of the Piedmont 
Country Club and she had a very close-up sighting of a dam UFO or shortly afternoon she was driving 
across the dam and noticed something peculiar the water levels had just recently risen due to the 
recent rains but to her puzzlement the surface of the lake was showing a very strange movement and 
then suddenly she says a quote flat Square topped object Rose from the water they made a sweeping 
turn and then quickly moved away but it was just a few nights later that she was woken up by her dogs 
growling and barking and venturing outside she saw a strange light hovering over the dam area she got 
into her car to investigate and the light was gone but as she approached the dam her radio seized 
to function and when she left the dam this object Rose upward and darted away at high speed so this 
may be very much connected to the case just uh above which also occurred in the same general area 
so moving along one year later on February 4 1973 numerous Witnesses observed a silent 
glowing object hovering over the Waters of the wheeler Dam in Huntsville Alabama 
so police were sent to investigate and they actually watched this object as it disappeared 
into the water and after about 10 minutes emerged from the lake and then moved off over the trees 
there was apparently an inquiry at local airports but they it revealed no known aircraft in the 
vicinity at the time of the sighting it's amazing how many cases there are because it was just a few 
months later many miles away that another rare humanoid case occurred this was at the Rio Dam 
in Port Jervis New Jersey this occurred on June 5th 1973 two men were just finishing up a night 
of fishing and decided to throw their lines in one more time when without warning an oval-shaped 
brownish purple craft appeared over the lake they said it had five glowing green portholes 
and it was emitting two purplish beams of light into the water and both men thought that this 
object appeared to be sucking up water from the lake so there are a few cases like this 
and this object came closer and after just a few moments it approached to within about a 
hundred feet at which point these men could see a figure a humanoid figure inside the object 
they described this figure as having sort of brownish skin around mouth round eyes large 
pointed ears and a wrinkled leathery face so clearly not human it was looking out the 
portholes at then and it appeared to be surprised to see the men there that was their impression but 
at that point the object accelerated at high speed and disappeared over the top of the dam 
so there's quite a few cases in the upstate New York area so this could be connected to that 
but again these are occurring all over the world three years later another case occurred near the 
town of Silverthorne Colorado this is a small town with a population of less than a thousand people 
and it stands at 8 000 feet elevation just below the Dillon Dam which feeds 
into a small Lake directly below this occurred on July in July of 1976. 
now the city Silverthorne is located in a little Valley surrounded by mountains and one evening 
around that time a witness and his friends were getting ready to start fishing on the lake and 
looking up they saw a metallic saucer with small Windows moving across the lake toward the dam 
it was pretty close they estimated it was about 2 000 feet away maybe 1500 feet high 
it zipped quickly across the sky well below Mountain level but when it's called out to his friend who looked up at that moment the object disappeared 
so his friend only got a brief glimpse of it but the main witness got a real good look at it and as 
he says it was traveling fast but not too fast for me to observe the little portholes the object was 
bright I followed it for probably eight seconds and it just disappeared in front of my eyes 
so the next day he called a UFO hotline and learned that several other people had also called 
to report their sighting and this changed the way he felt about UFOs forever as he says I rarely 
tell anyone about this event as people generally seem to think I am a nut or a druggie or some 
other silly justification of my so-called delusion everything that happened is engraved in my mind as 
if it happened yesterday the memory of the UFO remains with me as clear as when it happened 
it's an event I shall never forget from that day on I not only believed in UFOs I knew they existed 
nothing like seeing it with your own eyes and again all over the world here's another 
case which occurred one year later June 17 1977 at the Castello debode Dam in Portugal 
and this did receive national press attention and was in fact investigated by the Portuguese 
military and the government the main Witness was Jose Francisco Rodriguez who was 23 years at the 
time when he was flying over the dam which also by the way contained a hydroelectric installation 
this pilot Jose saw a dark craft emerge from the clouds 
he called the control tower who told him that they had no other aircraft in the area and at 
this point this object approached directly in front of the cockpit of Rodriguez's plane 
and this caused this plane to vibrate violently and its Compass to spin out of control 
thankfully the pilot was able to retain control of his plane just in time to prevent a crash 
and here's where it gets interesting at the same time that all this was going on there was a power 
failure at the dam itself which was described as a quote a huge unexplained drop of energy 
and there were other Witnesses two witnesses were walking along the dam at that time and 
observed the entire incident from the ground so this is one of many cases involving good physical 
evidence in terms of a power failure or it's affecting electromagnetic equipment in some way 
and here's another case and year after year this one's actually the same month the same year this 
was June 1977 at the Fort Phantom Lake in Abilene Texas when two men became witness 
to a low level damn UFO the main witness was a student pilot and quite familiar with aircraft 
he and his friends were sitting on lawn chairs overlooking the lake watching the stars and they 
were actually talking about UFOs went to their amazement an object appeared in the distance 
and moved towards them over the lake and then over the dam hovered reversed course and went back the 
way it had come but when it says the object was silent not much larger than a small car pretty 
small and was very low hovering about 150 to 200 feet overhead he said it glowed red and looked 
almost translucent five minutes later this object reappeared hovered made a few right angle turns 
and then moved directly to the power plant at the far end of the lake it was moving slowly no more 
than 20 miles per hour and remained in view for a long time about 20 minutes really impressed the 
witness as he says I know I am not crazy there was someone else with me who saw the same thing 
I don't I don't know what I saw I only know what it was not it did not look like anything 
I have seen in the air before or since so pretty darn interesting here's another case which also 
occurred in Texas three years later this occurred at the dam B lake near the Angelina River in Texas 
and it occurred on September 15 1980. in this case the Witnesses are two brothers were out 
hunting at night when they saw these two strange lights moving slowly over the high tension power 
lines heading directly towards them and as these lights got closer one of the lights sent down a 
beam of light and it was at this point that the brothers realized they were seeing UFOs 
and I will just quote one of the witnesses directly here because he describes it pretty 
well what happened so this is one of the witnesses talking and I quote we both became very frightened 
and I cranked up the Jeep and drove hastily out of the treeless area and parked about 50 feet in the 
woods we both grabbed our guns I have never been so scared I was shaking I turned off the engine 
and rolled the window down and looking straight up I saw one of the craft had moved straight above us 
it was about 60 feet above the Treetops the bottom of the craft looked very different I recall a 
triangular pattern of Amber lights with some long neon tube lights also craft hovered above us for 
a few minutes and made a continuous shh sound I thought we were about to be dead but the craft 
moved slowly away keeping the same altitude and fear left us as we figured if the craft wanted 
to harm us it would have when it was above us so our mood changed from complete fear to curiosity 
we put down our guns and ran into the opening under the high power lines for a better View 
we noticed one craft had stayed back in a stationary flight position while the other craft 
made a circular horizontal flight pattern the roving craft returned near the stationary one and 
both hovered for a few minutes then as we looked on hoping they would take us for a ride they both 
shot silently into the upper atmosphere like a shooting star in reverse this event blew our minds 
so as more and more of these cases occur over the years it becomes increasingly clear that UFOs are 
in fact attracted to dams I mean it's undeniable here's another really dramatic case which occurred 
at The blewitt Falls Dam near Norwood North Carolina the blue it falls down this is fed by the 
p d River and this Dam holds a 2500 acre Reservoir and a large hydroelectric plant this case occurred 
on August 14 1984 and the main witness is a man and his cousin they're Anonymous they observed a 
quote large black triangle-shaped object hovering directly over the Dam's hydroelectric plant 
they estimate that this object was 300 feet wide and at first they thought it might be a helicopter 
or blimp but when they stopped to get a closer look it turned off its lights and as this witness 
says it was obvious to me that we had been spotted by a person or something inside of the object 
I was of the opinion that the occupants of the object were deliberately trying to hide from us 
when I exited my car I saw the dark underbelly of the object it was huge I could tell due to 
it blocking out the stars above I vaguely recall other people who per pulled over to observe it too 
and the funny thing is that I do not recall talking to them about what we all saw 
I do not have any recall of what happened the rest of that night so that's interesting makes 
me wonder if there was a missing time what's really cool about these cases is how widespread 
they are here's another case which occurred in 1986. over the Palmar Dam in Montevideo Uruguay 
this object was described as being luminous yellow in color and spherical shaped and remained there 
for such a long time that the Uruguayan Air Force actually scrambled two jet fighters to intercept 
it however as the Jets approached this object sped away changing from yellow to Orange and 
then red disappearing off into the distance the Jets returned to the nearby durazno Air 
Force Base at which point the objects reappeared in the same exact location so the two Jets again 
took off and approached the object a second time and again this object sped away changing colors 
the pilots did attempt to pursue it but this craft moved quickly away from them 
and here's where organic gets even stranger following this incident there was a power failure 
in the city of Montevideo and according to Colonel Ariel Sanchez who investigated this case he says 
and I quote yes we believed that the object must have affected the power line in some way causing 
the overheating because technicians detected in overheating in some Transformers in the line that 
supplies the capital city we suppose this might be a result of that incident after all there must be 
a reason why it was over the dam it must have been doing something there what it was we don't know 
security guards and employees also witnessed the object's flight around the dam that night 
the object was seen from the ground and from the air this leaves no doubt about its materiality 
it's amazing how many cases there are here's one which occurred not far away from Verona's Russia 
this occurred at around 1 30 a.m on April 30th 1990 at the bobay pond near petrovskoi paninsky 
and the main witness is Sergey of sianakov and he was fishing at this Pond and as he began to 
walk home he saw a glowing disc shaped object which had landed next to the dam 
he was very curious about it so he approached the disc and he saw he says a half dozen glowing 
humanoids floating around the area seeing that one of the figures was quite close to him he 
fled the area and watched from a distance and after a while he says these figures 
returned to the desk which moved off over the forest and then took off into the distance 
so many cases it seems like there's not an area on the world that doesn't have these kinds of 
encounters the next case I'd like to cover occurred in 1997 at the Muskrat Dam in First 
Nation Ontario this is in Canada and this dam was visited by a green orb-shaped Fireball which was 
bright enough to actually illuminate the entire area this is a huge Lake it covers about 4 800 
acres and is in a very remote area with the local population of only a few hundred people 
but according to one of the witnesses who saw this he says and I quote it landed in the lake in front 
of my house but in the middle of a lake it was a really bright green which is all I can remember 
and he was so impressed by this sighting that 23 years later he reported this to the National UFO 
Reporting Center so again all over the world here's a case which occurred in Santiago Chile 
this was at the tranq alfalfel dam in the El Cajon Del mipo area this occurred you know not far from 
Santiago Chile which does have a hydroelectric power station that actually provides electricity 
to the city of Santiago so it's occurred on January 24th 1998 the main Witnesses Sergio Rojas 
he and his four friends were driving up the mountain toward the dam when they saw two 
balls of light zip overhead followed by a third and arriving at the dam they exited their car 
and peered down into the water which was 300 feet below them to their amazement a huge glowing cigar 
or egg-shaped object almost 60 feet long rose out of the water it said it made a high-pitched noise 
and emitted a quote strange Mist hot and cold at the same time they fled back to their vehicle and 
drove down the mountain and a short time later they saw it again this object was hovering about 2400 feet overhead they got out of their car and watched as this object sort of faded away
so year after year this is happening here's another which occurred over Chile's largest dam 
this is at Lago de calborn and this does contain a huge hydroelectric plant 
this occurred on May 16 1998 and this object was described as a huge dark disc with an orange 
light on the bottom and smaller lights around the circumference Witnesses said that the object was 
so big that it seemed to cover the whole valley so people were actually able to photograph UFOs 
around this area on a number of occasions but at any rate on this occasion on May 16 1998 this 
object hovered at about an estimated 3 300 feet for a good 20 minutes before finally moving off 
UFO researcher Louis Sanchez Perry investigated this incident and he learned that in the previous 
months the objects had been seen at the dam several times causing apparent power failures 
as he writes and I quote they call the UFOs rabones which means thieves because they say they 
steal electricity before they had the high-tech plant they didn't have many blackouts one or 
two in a month but now they have three in a week U.S UFOs have been seen coming out of Lake colbon 
near the high tension wires absorbing electricity absorbing water and some of them have gone at high 
speed through the valley towards the hydroelectric plant so when not coming out of the water itself 
the objects have been seen hovering at less than a thousand feet over the dam before darting off 
here's another case I'm just got a few more I'd like to cover this one occurred on July 7 2000 near the flood control Dam this is in Richfield Utah 
three friends were driving a convertible Jeep near the dam when they saw what they first thought was a helicopter or a flare but it was hovering about three to four hundred feet over the dam 
sending down a bright cone of light so they were curious and drove closer to investigate and as 
they approached this object darted off at amazing speed they said disappearing in a streak of light 
what was weird however was this cone of light remained when they finally reached this location 
they watched this cone of light slowly fade from View they remained for a little while 
looking for any more evidence of activity but nothing occurred however later after talking 
around town and investigating they did find other people who saw UFOs on the same evening 
so there's so many cases here's another which occurred actually at the wivenhoe dam in Brisbane 
Valley Queensland Australia this occurred on September 14 2003 it's a very brief case but 
it's still interesting the Witnesses were Mr and Miss Thompson who observed a gray disc shaped 
object hovering just 100 feet over the Waters of the wivenhoe dam and again it seemed to be 
affecting the water because beneath the disc this water of the lake appeared to be agitated 
after about 10 minutes this object took off at an angle at quote incredible speed 
all right here's another case Nashville Tennessee July 2nd 2007. I'll just quote the witness 
directly here as the witness says it was a sphere lit up at about 500 feet away over an interstate 
by a dam in the local Hermitage area I went out to smoke with my fiance at 30 minutes after midnight 
about 500 feet away over a local Dam we saw what we thought was a local water tower lit 
up but we soon realized this was not near the tower this thing whatever it was was huge and 
lit up was not moving and it looked for a bit like it was on the top of some trees 
we have no clue what this object was but when we came back out after going back in it was gone 
so I don't know the exact Dam but they viewed this object from about 500 feet away 
and here's another case which occurred in South America more specifically at the Rogero Dam in 
Reserva Los Robles in Moreno Buenos Aires Argentina this occurred in October 2008 
and the main witness was Ranger Shaco Ferrer and his assistant Lieutenant Hector R Loza they 
were at the Rogero Dam when they both repeatedly heard strange buzzing noises while on Century duty 
at the dam and in one such occasion Lieutenant Hector Losa exited the shack and was confronted 
by police officers who said that they had seen a strange light hovering directly over the dam Shack 
and on another occasion a group of fishermen on the lake said 
that they saw a six foot tall hair covered figure with a large head and glowing eyes 
so it's another case involving multiple sightings and apparently a humanoid 
and here's another case also from Argentina more specifically from the town of J V Gonzalez 
this occurred on November 27 2009. when numerous residents of the Town watched a huge glowing 
cigar-shaped object hovering directly overhead for nearly an hour they said it was silent it pulsated 
with light and after hovering it moved over the L tunal Dam and hydroelectric power station 
at this point as we have seen in other cases there was a sudden and unexplained power failure 
which affected almost 400 square miles now there was an investigation of this incident 
and it revealed that a turbine had inexplicably burned to the point that it was almost melted 
a group of men were fishing in the reservoir when this UFO appeared and they said it cast a white 
yellow light down on them and they actually watched it hover over the turbines emitting 
a loud humming noise and sending down beams of light directly onto the turbines so this is very 
well uh verified in fact UFO researcher Mercedes Casas investigated this incident and as she says 
I interviewed some field workers in a tobacco farm and they mentioned that there was an object 
in October of last year 2008 I was doing the same thing it emitted beams towards the Earth 
and from the earth there were Flames going upward there are small dams used by farmers in this area 
and more research revealed that five power poles had also been burned out without any explanation 
but this case was investigated by several UFO researchers who found several witnesses who 
reported various effects such as partial momentary paralysis and malfunctioning cell phones and 
digital cameras despite this however one person did manage to snap a photograph of this object 
so as you can see really good evidence there's physiological evidence there's Landing trace 
evidence there's photographic evidence uh Power failures there's a lot going on here 
just a few more cases on July 4th 2010 a case occurred at the Old Hickory Dam near Nashville 
Tennessee and this area was targeted actually by multiple objects described as blood red orbs 
uh yeah this occurred on July 4th 2010 during actually a local fireworks show 
which if you remember my previous episode fireworks do attract UFOs and while watching the fireworks Witnesses saw a three actually orbs hovering about 
seven thousand feet directly over the dam darting at several hundred miles per hour 
so perhaps it was attracted to the dam or to the fireworks hard to say for sure but according to 
one of the witnesses and I quote five police boats on Old Hickory Lake all shine their spotlights at 
them with no reflection of spotlights on the object three more objects appeared moving in 
the same direction these objects appeared the same as the other objects which preceded them 
all six objects after hovering over Old Hickory Dam disappeared North and up towards Kentucky 
so this entire incident lasted about 10 minutes 10 minutes but it was only three months later 
December 10 2010 the UFOs were back over Old Hickory Dam on this occasion there was only one 
object observed which was described as disc shaped and the witness reports that this object hovered 
at low elevation over the dam sending down beams of light this disc descended downward presumably 
into the lake itself though the witness could not confirm this as he couldn't actually see the water 
but after this object disappeared the witness did notice three other orange orbs pulsating and 
hovering towards the south east as he says this was a very strange thing to me so I want an answer 
yeah me too so many of these dams do have multiple encounters and here's one which occurred at the 
scamanden dam in West Yorkshire England this is a big Dam it's 170 feet and holds almost 21 million 
gallons of water and this area became very well known for UFO sightings in fact according 
to the West Yorkshire news it's also a quote UFO spotters Paradise so back in 2010 a Woman by the 
name of Sue cell a contactee said she filmed a UFO hovering over the town of scamandin and another 
witness says he saw UFO hovering directly over the dam for 10 minutes before descending down into it 
lots of witnesses another report comes from a couple who saw a triangular shaped craft 
submerged into the Waters of the dam they waited to see if it would come out and it did 
finally this object comes out it was a classic Flying Saucer and according to the couple at this 
point a strange Mist descended over the vehicle and the next thing they knew they were driving 
in the opposite direction and they later concluded that they had probably had a very close encounter 
and I agree it looks like they had missing time one of the witnesses Mark Gibbons witnessed this 
object and he says we observed it for 20 minutes then decided to leave the craft began to follow 
us we speed it up and it also speeded up I am sure that there is an underground base at the 
dam as it is the only dam in the country with a steel reinforced base under the concrete base 
so the sightings continued there for years the most recent known sighting that I could 
find occurred in September 2016 when a mother and daughter observed a spinning disc shaped 
object with red blue and green lights moving across the sky and as the witness says we were 
an absolute shock we watched in a blink of an eye as it totally vanished so I have just two 
more cases here's another one according to 2010 it comes from a group of witnesses who 
are driving near the hunting run Reservoir this is outside of Fredericksburg Virginia 
this Dam opened in 2007 the Dam created a 420 acre Lake which is now a popular fishing and 
tourist destination and the Witnesses in 2010 were driving by the dam when they spotted a 
gigantic football-shaped object hovering very low elevation 100 feet over the dam they hopped out 
of the car and stared in awe at this massive UFO again I'll just quote the witness as he says I'll 
do my best to describe this whatever it was it's a sight I still can't believe I actually saw I can't 
really give an accurate an accurate estimate on its size but I'll say it seems to be huge easily 
twice the size of the dam wall itself and I feel I'm being extremely conservative on that estimate 
it seemed to be ovoid in shape something akin to a football with too much air pumped in bulbous at 
the top and bottom the most striking blatant feature however was the lights adorning this 
thing they were bright neon green one massive beam or bulb sat at the bottom of this thing 
which I imagine seemed even brighter to me as it would have been reflecting off the surface of the reservoir that hovered above I believe it couldn't have been more than 100 feet above 
the surface of the water very low running up and down the sides of this thing in lines were 
rivulets of the same green light we just stood there for a minute slack jawed I remember after 
the initial shock passed the first thing I felt was an initial intense wave of dread 
the dam probably wasn't even a mile from where we were standing so they hopped in the car to get a closer look but when they arrived at the lake this object was gone 
one last case this one occurred in sandrio Italy this is at the Campo Morrow Dam near 
Belmont in sandrio Italy that occurred in August of 2011. and more than 50 Witnesses 
observed a UFO moving over the area but it was one month later in September 2011. when 
a local Pastor was hiking near the Campo Morrow Dam when he came Upon A group of quote gray men 
so another case involving humanoids and one year later September 30th 2012 a family was 
camping at the area of the dam the sun had gone out hiking and he says came face to face with a 
short blue gray-skinned humanoid with large black eyes he attempted to take a photograph but wasn't 
successful because the figure the figure quickly darted away he returned to his family and they 
went back to the location and actually observed a 30-foot wide metallic disc rise up and fly away 
the father really wanted to keep this encounter secret but the sun was so impressed by it that 
he later contacted a journalist and reported his encounter those are all the cases I found of UFOs 
showing an interest in dams and as you can see there are a lot of cases and I suspect there are 
quite a few more that we don't know about it does not appear that UFOs are putting on a display here 
I think they've got another agenda I did Cover these cases in my book not from here volume 4. 
so if you'd like to check them out in a little more detail I'd recommend checking that out 
but yeah there is something important and profound going on here I think 
it's clear given a huge number of cases that are so widespread and have been occurring for 
so long that UFOs do show an interest in dams I think that's undeniable the question of course 
is why we can only speculate but as I mentioned earlier I suspect that these UFOs are showing 
an interest in our use of electricity how we make it how we are affecting our environment 
our power sources this sort of thing again there's no clear evidence that this is sort of a display 
or a showing off type Behavior which does occur often I don't think that's what's going on here 
I think they're just purely interested in our technology and are keeping tabs on it 
one or two contactees did tell me that they're checking out these dams to make sure they're safe 
so certainly that's a possibility that we can't discount but again we really don't know all that 
is really I think confirmed here is that they are showing an interest in dams and that alone I think 
is important and is really why I wanted to present this information to you today I hope you found it 
interesting I truly appreciate you watching and once again keep searching for answers they're out 
there keep looking for the truth most important because that's why we're here keep having fun
