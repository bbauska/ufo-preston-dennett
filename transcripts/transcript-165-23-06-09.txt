UFOs can have many weird effects. They provoke strange alterations in plants. They cause bizarre electromagnetic disturbances in machines. They create a wide variety of landing traces. They make animals behave in weird and unusual ways. They affect people physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. When UFOs show up, almost anything can happen. This video presents a dozen cases spanning four decades and occurring to all kinds of people from all over the world.
 
Apr 24, 1954: Buyere, France. Two lumberjacks, Roger Mougeolle and Gilbert Doridant see three huge metallic UFOs. One of them lands in a field. Gilbert runs away in fear, but Roger walks up and taps it with his axe. He then raises his axe and strikes it. He is promptly thrown to the ground and temporarily paralyzed.

Aug 16, 1965: Montes Claros, Brazil. When 32-year-old banker, Filomeno Bido de Oliveira goes fishing one evening, a UFO drops down and hovers 150 feet overhead. After it leaves, Filomeno body reacts strangely. Although he felt no fear during the encounter, his heart is racing, and he urinated in his pants. The next day, his entire body is weirdly numb.

Feb 14, 1967: Miller County, MO. Early in the morning, a farmer sees a domed-shaped object with colored lights in his field. Strange-looking figures stand beneath it. He picks up two rocks and tosses them at the craft. Inexplicably, the rocks hit an invisible barrier and fall to the ground. As the witness approaches closer, he hits the invisible barrier himself.

Nov 25, 1968: Necochea, Argentina. Local farmers are concerned when they see UFOs and then find burned circles in their fields. Even stranger is the appearance of many giant-sized mushrooms outside the circles. They grow so quickly that some soon reach the size of footballs, two feet across and one foot high.

Jan 29, 1969: Matadepera, Spain. An 80-year-old woman is picking wild herbs when a weird metallic craft emerges from the trees, swoops below the powerlines and zooms off. Returning to the site with investigators, they discover four tunnels dug horizontally into the ground in a weird pattern, and in a way no animal or known machine could do.

Jul 20, 1971: Vitry-en-Artois, France. Monsieur F. Laisne was outside his home and sees a large spherical object move over his own house to a tall poplar tree. The object emits brilliant lights, snapping off a branch from the tree. As it moves away, his dog barks, his cows scatter, a railway near his home sparks, and his alarm clocks in the house all stop.

Aug 1971: Sarcee, Canada. An doctor is horseback riding when his horse becomes agitated. A saucer-shaped object swoops down, causing the horse to panic. After the object leaves, the horse remains shy and nervous. In the days that follow, his own horse develops a strange illness.

Jul 31, 1975: Loxton, South Africa. Danie Van Graan is checking on his sheep and sees a landed UFO and occupants. Getting closer, he is struck by a beam of light, causing a choking sensation, a nosebleed and vomiting. Van Graan then realizes his eyesight has also been affected. At the landing cite are weird landing impressions and a strange green substance.

Oct 5, 1978: Wellingborough, England. When many witnesses across town report a low-flying craft, it’s clear that something strange is going on. Then15-year-old Caroline Muncey and her friend Mandy are walking home, the UFO swoops down and chases them down the street. Afterwards, Caroline finds a strange rash on her hands and arms.

Aug 1979: Oktyabrskiy, Russia. A team of eight oil-field workers are terrified when a UFO lands on their worksite. Going to investigate the next morning, they find three deep marks in a triangular formation on the ground. In the center is a hole reaching 100 feet in depth.

Late 1980: Frankfurt, Germany. When a crew of a 707 jet leaves New York for Frankfurt, they are tailed by a saucer which illuminates the interior of their cockpit. It’s caught on radar and viewed from the ground. Afterward, the captain begins having nightmares of weird alien creatures.

Feb 1981: Mojave Desert, CA. A prospector returns from a trip into the desert with an incredible story of a UFO landing. After it takes off, he notices weird silvery spheres which glowed for two days afterwards. He picks up one of the stones, which shows many unusual properties. When it’s analyzed by scientists, it defies identification. Only later do they discover its strange composition.

These cases reveal some important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. They show that UFOs are visiting many locations on our planet for a long period of time. They show that UFOs can affect the soil, the vegetation, animal life, machines and most importantly, humans…all in a wide variety of unexpected ways. They show that the ETs display an interest in all things Earth and all things human. And they also provide compelling evidence for the reality of UFOs.

Intro
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
this episode is called weird effects from UFOs of course a UFO encounter byte itself 
can be quite strange but the effects from UFOs can run the gamut of just High strangeness it 
can affect the environment in many different ways by that I mean plants Landing traces weird 
animal reactions electromagnetic effects on machines just a huge variety of weird effects 
and that includes people as well physically mentally emotionally that's what this episode is 
about today I think it shows just how profoundly a UFO encounter can affect the environment around it 
these are cases that occur all over the world we're talking North America South America all across Europe Africa is even the case in Russia this shows again that 
this is a worldwide phenomena and the cases I'm presenting today do span actually several decades 
which shows that this is an ongoing phenomena so these are all important points these are cases 
that involve not only sightings but Landings as well and of course humanoids I love the humanoid 
cases I think they teach us the most about this phenomena and what it's like to have ET contact 
and yeah as I think you'll see with these cases it can be a very profound and strange experience 
got again about a dozen cases I'm gonna take you chronologically through them I think these are 
mostly cases you probably haven't heard before I like picking the unusual and lesser-known cases 
and I think we'll all learn something today about what it's like to have contact with UFOs 
and extraterrestrials so let's just get started the first case I'd like to cover today occurred on April 24 1954 in Brewer France this was investigated by prominent 
The Big Chimney
French investigator Joelle Maynard and it involves two men Roger mugel and Gilberto 
Rogers at the time of the incident was 37 years old and His companion Jill Bear was 19. 
unfortunately both are now deceased but this is a very interesting case with some really unusual 
effects these two men were logging on a hillside that's called La Grande the big chimney and as 
you can see from the shape of this mountain that's why it's called that and I will just let the main 
witness Roger describe his experience in his own words as he says I heard a loud noise at first 
it looked like a train passing over a metal Bridge or the detonation of a high caliber bomb 
I instinctively threw myself behind a big rock while looking up and I saw three huge wingless 
machines pass over me the amazing thing was their slowness and mass at the time I thought they were 
huge airships but not long after the first two Advanced without making any noise and the third 
which remained behind did not move and seemed to descend slowly without making any noise either 
curiosity pushed me to wait for the sequel the craft had landed about 15 meters from me and 
40 centimeters from the ground therefore did not touch the ground and it was about 300 meters long 
I am certain of this because after its departure half an hour later I surveyed the land at the time 
I was a lumberjack bounded at each of its Ends by a small fur tree at one end and a birch at 
the other end and as for its width it reached about 60 meters so this is a very large craft 
that's 180 feet thick and he was quite close to it 150 feet away and this thing was huge I mean 
about he's estimating 900 feet long so I'll just continue his testimony as Roger says I approached 
the machine I went around it it was round and referring to a 39 meter beech tree that was filled 
eight days later I estimated that the device was about 60 meters high so that's huge that's 180 
feet and as Roger says then I put my hand on it it was cold and hard I tapped it first with my 
fist then with the back of my ax and then with The Cutting Edge the sound was dull as if fall 
so he's right up next to it he's touching this thing and in a letter when he first related this 
incident he said he stepped back but later after talking to researcher Joel Menard he says that 
he actually took the flat end of his ax and struck the craft as he says just to see what would happen 
and this is when there was a really unusual effect and I'll just quote the investigator 
Joel Maynard here as Joel says as he struck he was instantly hurled a distance of six meters or so 
lying where he had been thrown against the foot of a rock musel found himself unable to move 
what had hurled him was no blast of air or anything like that but something totally unknown 
to him something that seemed to act uniformly upon every part of his body and now as he lay there 
he realized that what was keeping him pinned down there was the monster Itself by its very presence 
so yeah there's apparently some sort of force field we'll see that in another case hard to say 
for sure without talking to the witness directly but as the witness Roger says I began to get 
afraid I wanted to go back to work I couldn't unable to move I remained glued to the Rock 
the craft then Rose slowly in the air and was only when it disappeared that I was able to move again 
it's been 21 years since this happened to me and until now I had never talked about it I suspected 
that I had not seen an Airship because airships are never made of steel or iron in addition the 
machine had no doors or portholes what I had seen I did not understand until much later 
so yeah this is your very much typical smooth featureless saucer type craft and a very strange 
case in that he was able to get so close to it actually touched this thing and it hurled him back 
No Fear
now this next case is quite brief it occurred on August 17 1965 near Montes claros in minus 
Jairus Brazil and it was investigated by one of Brazil's leading UFO researchers Walter K Buehler 
and it involves a 32 year old Banker by the name of philomino Bida de Oliveira 
it was around dusk when Phil and minnow had lit a fire using cow dung and was fishing along a river 
when he heard a whining noise above his head which he described as quote like a failing refrigerator 
and looking up he saw a metallic saucer shaped craft as you can see here about 150 feet above 
his head so this is quite low it was bobbing up and down about 15 feet up and down and 
then it hovered still for about 20 seconds and darted off so philomino insisted that he felt 
no fear during this encounter or after but he didn't notice that after the craft left 
his body was reacting in some weird ways first his heart was racing out of control 
and second he noticed that he had involuntarily urinated his pants so he has no idea why this 
happened it certainly wasn't the fear he felt no fear and he also noticed something 
else for a day afterwards about he felt A peculiar quote numbness in his entire body 
now Dr Walter Bueller who investigated this case believes that fear was not the cause 
and instead he believes quote some electrical or magnetic or ultrasonic effect on the unstriated 
muscles or on the neuro-vegetative system of the witness was the cause hard to say for sure 
but it's not the only case like that so those are what we call physiological effects and yeah 
they're quite unusual this next case occurred on February 14 1967 in Miller County Missouri this is 
a pretty rural area and this case comes from apro the aerial phenomena research organization headed 
Apro
by Jim and Carl Lorenzen and of course it involves some very bizarre effects this is probably one of 
my favorite cases in this collection the witness is anonymous he's called Mr X and he was outside 
his farm early one morning this is just Before Sunrise but it's still light out and he saw one 
of his cows looking out into the field east of the barn and wondering what his cow was looking at Mr 
X looks up and he saw what he first thought was a parachute landed on the ground about 335 feet away 
so he walks closer and sees that this object is actually hovering just above the ground 
and underneath it he can see strange little figures walking around 
so he walks up to it until he's about 30 feet away from it and you can now see that this object was 
rocking sort of back and forth and that it was a disc he estimates it was about 12 to 15 feet wide 
six feet thick and it appeared to be resting on a shaft of light perhaps about two and a half 
feet high and as the witness says in his own words it just looked like a big shell grayish 
green and underneath it there were oblong holes where the lights were coming out they 
were so bright you couldn't see when you got up there they were all the colors of the rainbow 
so as he's staring at this thing he sees these figures which were moving around rapidly and they 
seem to have arms and what looked like perhaps wide set eyes uh with what looked like a visor 
on top they were quite unusual looking so he's trying to figure out what is going on what this 
object is so what he decides to do is throw some rocks at it and as the witness says I picked up 
two rocks pretty good size one of them was and I thought boy here goes I'm going to knock a hole 
in that thing and see what the hell it is so we threw the first rock and something very strange 
happened as he says the rock stopped along about 15 feet from it and just hit the ground 
the next Rock I thought I would throw on top of it and it just hit something and bounced 
so it looked as if there was some sort of force field surrounding this craft and puzzled as to 
how these rocks were being deflected you decide to approach closer and he walked up to within 15 
feet of this craft at which point the little figures beneath it and around it scored into 
the shaft and disappeared and the witness tried to get closer but this is when he hit a weird force 
field he could not move forward as the witness says I thought I was going right up to it and I 
got to about here 15 feet and there it was I just walked up against a wall I couldn't see it at all 
there was just a pressure so that's definitely weird so as he's standing right next to this 
craft it starts rocking back and forth about six times the beam retracted and the object took off 
he heard no sound nor did he find any Landing traces but as Jim and Carl Lorenzen say 
the investigator of this incident is one of the most cautious and competent men in afros 
field investigator Network and we feel that the complete report is an accurate presentation of 
what he obtained from the witness this next case occurred around November 25 26 in 1968 and this is 
Argentina
in Argentina in an area called nekochia this was researched by John Livingston learmonth and he had 
traveled to necachia where he had the opportunity to visit some very unusual UFO landing traces 
these were found primarily on the berry Taco farm and it involved a scorched circle 
of Earth about 24 feet wide but it's not that that's really strange what was really strange 
was that there were 14 giant mushrooms which had blossomed overnight just appeared there 
now neighbors had seen unusual lights in the area and the nights before this scorched Circle 
was found and inside the circle itself the grass was burned the ground looks scorched 
but the mushrooms were unlike anything Farmers had seen in the area according to those who would 
examine them the mushrooms appeared to sweat when exposed to the sunlight and were growing larger 
even in the space of a few hours so these were quite large about the size of a football they said 
an inspection revealed a couple of other sites this did cause quite a bit of attention from 
the local population and even the Argentine military came to investigate and in each area 
the insides of these circles were burned and the mushrooms as you can see were on the outside and 
they were huge somewhere as large as two and a half feet across and one feet high 
so there are other cases of unusual growths of mushrooms at Landing sites that's why I want to include this case and there's speculation that's perhaps exposure to some sort of radiation 
that these objects give off that causes rapid growth hard to say this is pure speculation 
but yeah there's some unusual effects on Plants around UFOs that is why I want to include this 
case it's very unusual this next case occurred on January 29 1969 and meta de Pera Spain this is a 
Spain
very unusual case involving weird Landing traces of a kind I don't think I've ever heard before 
this case comes from UFO researcher Jose Maria Casas fugue he's quite well known in Spain he's 
the president or was of the Spanish UFO group Centro De estudios interplanetarios or the center 
of interplanetary studies now the main witness has Preferred to remain anonymous she's a local 
woman around age 80 years old she went out for a walk and was picking wild herbs as she often 
does when she heard a strange sound approaching and looking up she saw what she called a quote 
curious flying object emerged from the trees and move over the road that she was walking along 
and she estimates it was about nine feet wide or nine feet long rather four feet wide and seven 
feet high was metallic and brightly colored in green and yellow and she said it was actually 
really beautiful it was quite a strange shape as you can see here and very low to the ground in 
fact it was about to hit the power lines when it actually Dove below them at which point it reached 
no more than 15 feet above the ground after diving underneath the power lines the object moved off at 
about Tree Top level into the distance and the witness was very much impressed and reported her 
sighting eventually it did reach investigators who contacted her and together they returned to the 
spot of the sighting and this is when they found what appeared to be very unusual Landing traces 
these consisted of four parallel lines and two groups each but instead of being depressed into 
the ground the marks looked raised as though something had been inserted into the soil 
and as they inspected it that's exactly what they found because according to the investigator 
Mr Casas huge the markings when dug up revealed small tunnels just beneath the surface of the soil 
and as he says it seems clear that such marks cannot possibly have been produced 
by any animal nor could they have been caused by any machine of which we have knowledge 
these were short little tunnels they had an exit and an entrance point you can see us a sketch of 
them here but inside these tunnels the sides of the tunnels showed that the Earth had been tightly 
compressed against the walls of the tunnels so it definitely looked as if some sort of device 
had been inserted into the ground to make them perhaps these UFOs were taking samples of the 
earth that is something we do see in quite a number of cases but I don't think again I've 
heard Landing traces quite like these before it's a very unusual case here's another one 
of my favorite cases because it had so many weird effects this occurred on July 20 1971. this is in 
Victory on Artois France and this was investigated by Jean-Marie bijorn and other investigators 
it was early morning when the main witness Monsieur F Lane age 32 was in his garden 
outside his home and he heard a loud Whistling noise looking up he saw a large glowing sort 
of flattened sphere at very low level less than 25 feet high moving directly over his neighbor's 
house he it was he estimates about six feet wide and was surrounded in a greenish Halo 
and as he watched it moved from the neighbor's house over directly directly over his house 
and out over his field where it stopped abruptly just a few feet next to a very large poplar tree 
it was at this moment that this spherical object light emitted a huge burst of light sending beams 
down to the ground at that exact moment a large Branch over one foot thick and about 10 feet 
long or larger snapped off of the poplar tree and fell to the ground the object instantly ascended 
right up to the top of the tree it blinked a few times and moved off into the distance 
and it wasn't over yet because as it passed over the nearby railway lines the railway itself seemed 
to undulate and give off Sparks at the same time the cattle in the nearby Field became 
terrified and Scattered in all directions and the main witness Mr Lane did have a dog who was 
barking up a storm the whole time and when he went inside the main witness went back inside 
his home he found something else strange three of his alarm clocks had all stopped at the same time 
he then went to inspect the branch and the stump where it had come off the tree and he said it 
looked as if it had been exposed to high heat but did not actually burn this was confirmed by UFO 
researchers as well so all of this very strange strange effects on animals on electromagnetic 
instruments and on Plants it's a very unusual case this next case occurred in August 1971 at 
Canada
the sarsi Indian reserve near Calgary Canada and this one involves some very unusual animal effects 
this was investigated by researchers Bill Allen and Max Edwards these are major UFO researchers 
in Canada and the main witness is an anonymous chiropractor who does not want to be identified 
at any rate he was riding his horse this is in a rather rural Wilderness Area when suddenly his 
horse began to act very strangely and I'll just quote the witness directly as he says 
suddenly for no apparent reason my horse a mare became very alert and stiff and started 
to pass manure a sign of nervousness then very quickly it became extremely violent 
and practically uncontrollable turning and twisting I had to be very careful because 
the river was on my left and on my right there were trees and a barbed wire fence 
so he is trying desperately to control his horse and this is when a UFO swooped down out of a 
nearby cloud and as the witness says it came out as if to observe what was happening below which 
I guess was me on my horse so he didn't have a chance to really look carefully at this object 
because he was really trying to control his horse but he didn't get a good enough look at it that 
he could see that it was about 40 feet across and in most respects a typical Flying Saucer 
he did a sketch of it which you can see here and as he says it was made of a material that 
looked like a plastic or fiberglass of a bluish steel color or a silvery blue 
the under part of it which was all I could see was slightly oval in shape and contained two 
circular vent-like structures like the bottom of a mushroom rotating in opposite directions 
it had three or four spike-like antennas sticking out of it and I could see by the motion of these 
that the whole thing was able to revolve would turn a bit in One Direction stop and go on or 
turn back in the other direction these rods are antennas gave me the impression that they 
were a searching device in fact the whole Central Dome seemed to be a sort of observation station 
so these vents according to the witness were about two by four feet wide you couldn't hear anything 
but he wondered if perhaps his horse could because it was thrashing its head around pretty violently 
and again he couldn't pay too close attention to the UFO because he was trying so hard to control his horse but he watches this disc moved kind of leisurely off to the Horizon and out of view 
he managed to calm his horse in time enough to hear a sort of soft vibrating or swishing 
noise coming from the craft and another important detail is he said that he saw 
a very bright light like a quote welder's Ark glowing along the Leading Edge of this craft 
so it took his horse about an hour to calm down and then he got back on the horse to go home 
and as he's riding along his horse began to act nervous again and that's when he came upon another 
horse unfortunately lying dead on the ground and it was bizarre because as the witness says 
the strange part was that its exposed side was badly singed though there was no sign 
of a fire having been there so he dismounted and examined the carcass of this horse which 
was still warm and he could actually smell the burned hair he was quite puzzled by it he left 
the scene and returned the next day with a neighbor to investigate but the carcass was 
gone which was mystifying as because it was in an area where there was Heavy growth surrounding it 
and none of this growth was affected in any way it was completely untouched so it looked as if 
the horse had been lifted directly from that spot and hauled away as he said by an Airborne object 
so in the days following this incident his horse remained very quote head shy 
and acted as though its ears had been affected in some way by the experience 
it's a very interesting case and there was one other possible side effect it's hard to say for 
sure whether this was caused by the siding but it was several weeks later that he noticed his 
horse had some what looked like sores or Burns along its neck so it's a very interesting case 
involving animal effects and here's another very strange case involving humanoids and landings 
and weird effects on the ground and others this occurred on July 31st 1975 in loxton South Africa 
so this case was investigated by Cynthia hind who writes certainly for physical effects the 
Physical Effects
case of Dani van Gran of loxton in South Africa was the best ever so this has got some really 
good physical evidence again the main witness is Dani van Gran the time of the incident he's 
69 years old and this is a tiny little town as you can see here and while inspecting his 
sheep enclosure Donnie Came Upon what he first thought was a trailer being used by government 
men who he knew were currently surveilling the area searching for Uranium deposits 
but as Donny got closer he saw that this was not a trailer couldn't be a trailer because first it 
didn't have wheels and second the windows were too large and it just didn't look like a trailer 
the object which was kind of silvery aluminum in color appeared to be resting on small Landing legs 
and Looking Through the Windows of this object he saw four unusual looking men 
they were human looking but they were very short they were wearing tight-fitting cream-colored 
jumpsuits had Asian looking eyes and one of them stood at a console with colored blinking lights 
while the three others appeared to be examining something through a microscope type device 
and he later thought perhaps they were observing him as the witness says 
I could immediately see beings who look like people they'd rather long faces though they also 
had high foreheads there were four of them three of them I felt had me under their observations 
I felt like I wanted to get closer so he was very curious he felt no fear and he approached 
to about 15 feet when all four men inside the craft lifted their heads and looked up at him 
and at this instant there was a clicking noise and Donnie was struck by a beam of light as he says 
some sort of flap near one of the windows opened with a bang and a streak of light Shone in my face 
I felt very uncomfortable and started to bleed from the nose so according to the witness he says he felt as though he was drowning and nearly collapsed he 
felt ill and confused and kind of staggered away and leaned against the fence to observe 
and he washed this craft for a good time about a half an hour and he was able to get more details 
he estimates that the men were about four and a half feet tall you could see that they had Fair 
hair high cheekbones and a kind of pointed chin but otherwise looked like normal people 
the craft was making a low humming noise which would vary in intensity and after about a half 
an hour this craft rose up from the ground coming very close to colliding into a nearby windmill 
and he just lay there against the fence trying to recover uh at one point he actually vomited and 
returning home he realized another physical effect he was suffering from conjunctivitis and double 
vision now returning later to the site he found strange Impressions on the ground in the shape 
of a crow's foot or kind of like an arrow and the area between the marks also appeared to be burned 
though he couldn't be certain if this was from the craft itself or from earlier when he had burned 
some vegetation on the ground but there were also these strange green granules kind of like putty he 
said and there were also several small Footprints surrounding this area where the craft had landed 
and as investigator Cynthia Heinz says I have never had a report on these marks from elsewhere 
but they are the clearest unexplained marks ever recorded well that's arguable uh it's an 
interesting case in terms of Landing traces I'm not sure I would call them the clearest ever but interestingly these green granules were collected and studied by the South African Geological Survey 
Department and the analysis showed that they were mostly composed of a mineral called thomasite 
there was another effect as the main witness says ever since that machine landed here nothing will 
grow in this spot it used to be an alfalfa field by the way so those of you who have 
watched my previous episode on UFO's Landing in Alfalfa Fields might find that interesting 
at any rate this did cause quite a bit of attention to be paid do it investigators 
interviewed the main witness and were able to confirm at least part of his story 
because they did talk to a friend of Danny's by the name of Ben Brewer who 
confirmed the presence of blood on Danny's clothes that morning from his nosebleed 
Cynthia Hein was able to locate other Witnesses including Jean Van Der waist-huizen who had seen 
nothing but had heard a humming noise at approximately the time of this sighting 
and there were three other Witnesses a young boy eight or nine years old saw the object landed on 
the ground and he ran to call his mother who was sitting with another man nearby and all three of 
them saw this object but they were so terrified by the implications of this and the possibility 
of being questioned by the police that they actually moved out of town and did not return 
so yeah this is a very unusual case in a lot of ways there is a final sort of sad end note 
to all of this two years following this encounter Danny did die of cancer well there's no reason to 
directly link this to his previous UFO encounter he was 69 years old but I thought it was important 
at least to mention here's another case which I find quite interesting because there's so many witnesses and we know the exact location and again there's some very unusual physiological effects 
Wellingborough
this occurred on October 5 1978 in Wellingborough England this is a pretty populated area and 
several witnesses in Wellingborough saw something very strange on that night one witness was Martin 
Batley who was driving along finding Road near Wellingborough when he saw a strange object as he 
says it was Delta shaped like a v it was enormous and had two huge white searchlights at the front 
and a green light behind so he and several other people on the road stopped their cars actually 
got out and watched and as Martin says the object was making a thin whining noise it was stationary 
for about five minutes and then zoomed off one woman was really panicking and I was terrified 
so meanwhile there were other witnesses to apparently this same UFO Taxi Driver Victor 
anger angers was on the A45 road with his customer Malcolm Young this is very close to finding Road 
and he pulled over near the skew Bridge Ski Club and watched this same object as it hovered 
only three maybe 400 feet overhead and as Victor says we wondered why it wasn't making any noise 
so this object was moving all over Wellingborough and was being viewed by a lot of other people 
because in another area there was a football team including one of the members Jimmy Middleton all 
who saw this object move from Weldon towards beanfield as Jimmy Middleton said it was far too 
big to be an airplane took at least seven minutes to disappear and there were 16 of us who saw it 
but the most compelling testimony and interesting here comes from Caroline Muncie age 15 and her 
friend Mandy Dooley they had the closest encounter they were walking along Queensway pictured here 
to their home on vicarage Farm Road this is in Wellingborough when they saw a bright light in the 
sky now they didn't think much of it at first they ignored it until suddenly it swooped down behind 
them and began chasing them down the street and as Caroline Muncie says in her own words 
I looked back and I saw the lights bathing the road and I ran I tripped and fell it 
was right behind me Gliding Over The Bridge so you can see the very Bridge right here 
as Caroline says it was getting so near I knocked on somebody's door and the UFO turned up into the 
sky I was terrified and crying so yeah this really quite scared them but the weird effect came after 
the encounter as Caroline says I broke out in a rash all over my hands and arms so whether this 
is from the UFO some sort of radiation from it or from her being so scared is debatable but either 
way it's definitely a weird effect this next case occurred on August in August 1979 and I'm 
Octiabrisky
gonna butcher this place name I'm just gonna do the best I can it's called octiabrisky in Russia 
now this case comes from Russian geology expert Dr Alexi zolotov pictured here 
who was called in to investigate and it was also researched by UFO expert Professor Felix 
zeigle who's very well known in Russia one of Russia's most prominent UFO researchers 
now what's interesting about this location octiabrisky is it was founded because of the 
oil reserves found there and this is where this encounter happened at an oil field 
it was around midnight when an eight-man team of oil field workers were woken up by a UFO landing 
in the oil fields now this was about a quarter half mile away the men were too frightened to 
get close but as one of them Ivan sherbikov says for a while I couldn't get a word out I 
just stood there shaking thinking what the hell is it so they were too afraid to investigate 
this is this is you know at midnight they all retreated into their Hut and waited until morning 
when they came out of course the object was gone and they went over to investigate where this UFO 
had landed and this is when they found something very strange there was a one foot wide hole 
and it was very deep so deep they couldn't see how deep it was at first surrounding this hole were three indentations in a triangular formation this was about 50 feet 
wide and each of these indentations was three feet deep so whatever had landed there was quite heavy 
and the center of this triangle was burned and the hole in this Center turned out to be 
very deep about a hundred feet deep there was a months-long investigation where they dug it out 
and inside this hole revealed something truly astonishing at the main researcher Dr zolotov says and I quote the vertical hole led to a chamber below 
intense heat had turned to the chamber and Hull into a ceramic bottle some 30 feet tall somehow 
all the clay in the chamber had been scooped out probably sucked upwards tons and tons of it all of 
it was gone without a mound of loose clay anywhere the hole is totally unnatural no man could have 
dug it my conclusion is that an alien spaceship using technology not known to us on Earth sucked 
out the clay and placed it in the ship's hold I firmly believe they were taking samples 
Lufthansa
so this would make sense because there are a lot of cases as we have seen of 
UFOs and extraterrestrials taking samples and again this was in an oil field so perhaps there was some interest in that particular aspect of this location 
hard to say for sure but it's absolutely one of the strangest UFO landing cases on record and very 
well verified here's another case which occurred in the late 1980 or so and this occurred on an 
airplane flight from New York to Frankfurt Germany technically it occurred over Germany itself 
there were several witnesses pilot Dieter Spangler was piloting a Lufthansa cargo Boeing 707 aircraft 
late at night when the Frankfurt approached control tower radioed that they had a positive 
radar lock-on that was tailing his plane so there were some unknown object following this Boeing 707 
and it was at that moment that a brilliant red orange light up the whole area coming 
from behind the plane and this was verified by the whole crew including co-pilot Hans Mueller 
flight engineer Peter lachmann and stewardess Krista Hanish all who saw this incredibly bright 
red orange light filling the cockpit and as it turns out this object was also seen 
by ground observers who described it as a smooth featureless disc glowing a fiery red 
which is what Captain Spangler and the others described as well now he maneuvered his plane 
to avoid it but this object stuck right along with them and as Captain Spangler says in his own words 
it was eerie ominous approach control was shouting UFO UFO Krista cried out it was a spaceship it 
kept bearing down on us it didn't fly away it just disappeared poof it vanished Into Thin Air 
so it was a relatively Brief Encounter and only affected them in terms of quite scaring them 
but it was the after effects that really caused a problem particularly for Captain Spangler as he 
says that wasn't the end for me it was only the beginning the first after effect was terrible 
ridicule from his friends and others around him who joked and harassed and ridiculed him 
mercilessly this is important because this is a real problem we have in this field but that wasn't 
all then came the psychological effects including recurring headaches tension anxiety self-doubt 
and worst of all according to the captain nightmares of UFOs and strange alien figures 
as Captain Spangler says in his own words I would wake up in the middle of the night in our bond 
apartment trembling after a dream where the UFOs seemed to fill the sky above me and come rushing 
down like a falling planet I'd look down at my wife Sylvia and actually resent her for being 
able to sleep I would feel spooked I began to wonder if I could recover from my anxieties 
so he ended up seeking out help from a psychiatrist by the name of Adrian selwick 
and he began to wonder this was more than just a sighting or if there was some sort of communication with him and the occupants of this UFO 
and as the psychiatrist Adrian selwick says who became quite good friends with Captain Spangler 
selwik says this man has been subjected to the most unreasonable harassment and 
ridicule by friends who should have helped so these After Effects lasted even a year later 
so it really traumatized him emotionally mentally I guess spiritually and yeah I do wonder if he had 
some levels of deeper contact because he started seeing these figures you can see pictured here 
yeah very unusual case I've got just one more I'd like to present today which fascinates 
me because of some really unusual Landing traces this occurred in February of 1981. 
and the main witness is a lady by the name of Elita carbonneau from Poway California 
The Rock
she's a good witness an artist but she's a retired bailiff for the San Diego Sheriff's Department 
and one day she made friends with this Old Prospector who had an amazing story 
he wanted to share with her he said he was out prospecting in the Mojave deserts of California 
when he came Upon A landed UFO now he watched it from a distance for just several minutes 
he was too afraid to approach closer but he watched it until this object took off 
and as he walked up to where this object had landed he was amazed to see this glowing mass 
of ground that had been left behind he thought perhaps they had dumped some sort of material 
and this mask load for a long time as Alita carbonneau says he said the mask load for 
two days and when it cooled he went close enough to see a bunch of silvery stones 
he said he wanted to fill his pockets with them but he was afraid they might be Radioactive 
he took a chance and put one of the rocks in a Leather Pouch and he showed it to me 
so this prospector was able to gather a sample of what he believed had been left by this UFO 
he later returned to locate the site but was unable to find it this was out in the middle 
of the Mojave Desert somewhere but he did have this one stone and he agreed to give it to Elita 
carbonell so she could have it tested and as Alita says The Rock looked to me like a metallic piece 
of coal except that it had pores unlike coal so Elita eventually found a scientist to examine it 
and this is when it became very unusual as Elita says it was checked for Trace elements known 
to man and they said it was none of them they broke a 300 dollar diamond saw trying to cut it 
The Rock doesn't conduct electricity and they said it was like nothing they'd ever seen before 
the scientists put it in an oven at extreme temperatures it glowed but it didn't burn 
so Elita did show this at one point to a reporter and actually demonstrated its hardness 
by scratching the glass of a soda bottle now was it really from a UFO Lolita doesn't know she's a 
little unsure about that as she says I'm skeptical I don't believe in UFOs and men from outer space 
not really but I'm almost afraid to talk about it they made haul me off to the Looney Bin 
now the prospector she talked to wanted this rock back but he never returned so Elita gave it to 
Al Michaels another researcher who gave it to a professor at San Diego university in California 
and this is when some further answers came the professor was able to identify 
this sample as calcite which he believed had been exposed to very high temperatures 
but as the professor from San Diego university says the question
he says is how it got in that form there is a lot of calcite floating around in space 
and this piece looks as if it were boiled or cooked or maybe used for fuel in some machine 
so as it turns out when exposed to high temperatures calcite does in fact glow and 
remains glowing for a long time which provides I think corroboration to the prospector's account 
that these Stones were glowing for a couple of days afterwards however I'm not sure this 
answers everything because calcite does not have a high hardness certainly not as hard as 
diamonds so perhaps there's something else going on here hard to say without access to the samples 
so this case I wouldn't call it fully investigated but it's certainly an unusual account of UFO 
landing traces I haven't heard any quite like it there you go I think these cases show just 
how truly strange and interesting a UFO encounter can be and it can have so many different effects 
each case does follow patterns but as you see there are unique elements and practically every 
case out there and these 12 cases again are just the tip of the iceberg we're just barely 
scratching the surface of the ways that UFOs can affect the ground animals plants 
on you name it machines humans of course these are all different types of physical 
evidence which is really important we're not just relying on eyewitness testimony 
here UFOs affect the environment in ways that can be scientifically tested so I think that this is 
really why I wanted to do this episode today just because it shows the variety of UFO encounters 
the ways it can affect everything around them and that's sort of high strangeness of it all 
so thank you very much for watching it's always appreciated and until next time keep searching 
for the truth keep asking questions and most important of all keep having fun until next time.
