THREE CASES OF MISSING TIME
Sep 4, 2021

Summary:
Sep 4, 2021
Millions of people across our planet have seen UFOs. Some people see UFOs and also experience missing time. When a witness experiences missing time, this is a very strong indication of a possible onboard UFO encounter. In case after case, people who have a close-up sighting experience a period of amnesia, and are unable to recall what happened during the missing time.

Missing time used to be thought of as very rare, but now investigators believe it might be fairly common, involving perhaps as many as one in fifty people. If true, this would mean that millions of people have been taken onboard UFOs.

This video presents three cases of UFO encounters with missing time:

CASE ONE: A mother and her two daughters are confronted by three objects. As they rush home to get a camera and binoculars, they mysteriously forget everything.

CASE TWO: A man in Malibu begins meditating and trying to call down UFOs. After a series of sightings, he experiences a mysterious event in which a UFO apparently lands in his backyard.

CASE THREE: Two friends driving along a remote desert highway late at night come upon a glowing object which strikes them with a beam light, causing missing time, followed by a radical shift in their lives.

What is it like to see a UFO close up and experience missing time? How does it affect a witness? How do people deal with this kind of an encounter and still try to live a normal life? 

This video is a glimpse into the experience of missing time and the secret life of UFO contactees. While having missing time does involve amnesia, it is also ironically an unforgettable experience, one that witnesses think about every day of their lives.

Three Cases of Missing Time
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos on the paranormal I call this episode three cases of missing time I wanted to do this video because 
i think missing time is far more common than people realize people will have what appears to 
be a simple sighting and it's not until much later that they realize they had missing time and what I 
have come to discover is that when someone has a close up sighting within a couple of hundred feet 
your chances of actually having missing time or deeper levels of contact go way way up missing 
time is of course the number one indication that you've had an on board ufo encounter and yet it 
can slip by very easily unnoticed so that's why I wanted to do this video and i've got three cases 
for you i'd like to present that I don't think you've heard before so let's just get started 
and the first case I want to talk about I call missing time on grandview drive 
this occurred in 1961 which is actually the same year as the betty and barney 
hill case at that time missing time in association with ufo encounters 
was pretty much unheard of we certainly didn't recognize what it meant at that time 
so that's significant I think in this case this occurred on grandview drive in topanga 
canyon in southern california which is a major ufo hot spot there were three witnesses beverly smith 
and her two young children there was lisa age seven and kim age five they lived on observation 
drive which is located pretty high up in elevation in the center of the canyon 
and one afternoon they decided that they were going to drive down to the local fernwood market 
this is just a 20 minute drive from where they live so they drove down from their home through 
the canyon and visited fernwood market bought a few items and were heading back up to their home 
and some point on their way home they saw something very strange what appeared to be 
silver disks hovering not too far away maybe a quarter mile low in the sky in the canyon 
all three of them saw them and they decided to pull over and take a closer look 
and they pulled over at the intersection of observation drive and grand view 
and uh take took a closer look at these strange discs that were hovering in the sky 
beverly saw them first uh she remembers there being two discs and as she says I saw these two 
what we referred to then is flying saucers or whatever outer space things it's over 
near where the park is I saw these two things it was right there and so all of a sudden they came together and one just kind of sat down and stopped you could 
see them really clearly and it was just really strange they were round like the pictures you 
see these days round similar to those tops that you push and spin the old-fashioned 
spinning tops the cone was on the top and they seemed flat on the bottom 
according to beverly these were bright silver and glinted brightly in the afternoon 
sun she did not see any lights nor did she hear any noise but her young daughter seven-year-old 
lisa also remembers this event clearly according to lisa's memory there were actually three discs 
and she's pretty sure about this because she remembers they were hovering in a triangular formation as lisa says and I quote we saw these three objects in the sky and to me I remember 
them being kind of multi-colored and soft they weren't hard shaped things they didn't really 
have distinct edges they were saucer shaped but they looked diffused at the edges and I remember 
them being kind of multi-colored kind of pastel as opposed to primary colors I don't remember them 
moving kind of like moving but just hovering each in place they definitely appeared solid but their 
edges and lights and colors were just diffused almost like a fog was around them or something 
kim also remembers this event even though she was only five years old at the time she doesn't 
have quite as much detail as the other two but she does remember at least one of these discs hovering 
and glaring brightly in the sunlight as kim says and I quote we looked over on the mountain there 
and on top of the mountain was a flying saucer and it was silver and just hovering over this mountain 
we all got out and looked at it we were like wow look at this flying saucer I felt no fear no fear 
at all we were just totally amazed we just stood there got out of the car stopped stood there and 
looked at it it seemed close it didn't seem high in the sky and far away it seemed close enough to 
see the details that it was a silver disc type thing like the old type disc silvery round that 
is what I remember so the three witnesses stood there for at least 5 10 maybe 15 minutes just 
watching these things they were very beautiful all of them were very much impressed and at some point 
something weird happened they apparently had missing time as beverly says and I quote 
the discs just kind of came together and I can't say that they landed they just kind 
of settled there and all of a sudden they just came apart and went off separate ways 
one went one way and the other went the other way at this point they decided they 
were going to run home and get a camera and binoculars and see if they could 
see these things more closely because one of them was apparently still there and as beverly says 
it was so strange because I said well let's run home let's get in the bus and get home real quick 
and get the binoculars and look at them real good see what's going on so what was so strange that 
we we got in the bus I guess came home but none of us remember coming home and we didn't think about 
it until the next day I don't know what time we got home or anything it was really strange 
so I just said oh we won't say anything about this because everybody will think we're crazy
kim also remembers this weird missing time aspect as kim says and remember kim is the five-year-old 
we were going to get a camera in binoculars and come back to look at it but we forgot 
about it until the next day and when we went home we didn't remember it was broad daylight 
and then that was it it's lisa who actually has a little bit more recall 
than the other two of what happened following the sighting as lisa says 
i just remember standing there and looking at them and as I was looking at them my mom's saying let's go get the binoculars I remember feeling like I didn't want to leave you know 
how you feel like you might miss something if you leave I don't remember getting into the car 
we went home to get the binoculars but we didn't remember to get the binoculars 
i do remember somebody saying we had been gone an awful long time just to go to the store 
and we couldn't figure out why nobody remembered about the binoculars until the next day 
we didn't remember why we had gone home I just remember somebody saying we had been gone 
two or three hours I wouldn't say I remember coming home I remember being home I would put it that way do I remember the drive home 
no I remember the drive down the hill standing at that place and looking at these three objects 
it seemed to me there was a fight about how long we were gone between my parents 
so it is clear that these three witnesses did in fact have missing time but they don't 
don't understand what happened to the time and again back in those days there was no 
correlation between missing time in onboard ufo encounters so they didn't even consider 
that possibility until years later but currently they do know that missing time is 
a good indication that there was an onboard ufo experience but none of them 
really have any desire to go under hypnosis beverly the mother doesn't talk about it much 
but her kids who are now adults uh still remember it quite vividly and have considered hypnosis as 
lisa who was seven years old at the time says for a time I was interested in having maybe regressive 
hypnosis or something to see if anything happened to me but since I didn't have any recurring dreams 
or apparent losses of time except for that time I just decided that it wasn't worth going into 
mostly because I have a sense of well-being and a good feeling about it and since it feels that way 
since the reading i've done indicates that some people have pretty traumatic experiences 
and that sense of well-being is put there to protect you I think i'd like to leave it that way 
uh kim pretty much feels the same way she's never really seriously considered hypnosis and she doesn't really talk about it too much either as kim says 
it's not something i've told anybody about because nobody believes you it's not something 
you go around and brag about it was just something that we all saw and i'll never forget
so they kept it secret they told no one except friends and family and it wasn't until there 
was a huge wave of sightings in that area to panga canyon that they decided to go public 
they called the local topanga kenyan newspaper the messenger and that's how they were put in 
touch with me and they agreed to be interviewed it's a very interesting case of missing time 
i'm pretty confident that they were probably taken on board but hard to say 
they have no dreams they have no mysterious scars on their body that they can relate directly 
to this but the fact that all three of them have had missing time indicates to me that yeah they 
probably had an onboard encounter and now we move to the second case the second case I call missing 
Missing Time in Malibu
time in malibu and this occurred actually not too far away from the previous case malibu is right 
next to topanga canyon and the main witnesses in this case are robert and his wife who owned a 
home in malibu canyon right off malibu canyon on a little road called payuma it was actually a street 
right off of payuma a dead-end street this is a very rural area quite a few homes there but it's 
surrounded by wilderness and again this is a very active area when it comes to ufos 
and roberts had robert had always been interested in ufos but his encounters began around 1975 
when he began meditating and one evening in 1975 he decided to sit down and meditate and 
concentrate on calling down a ufo he wanted to see one so he sat down and meditated and imagined 
bringing down a ufo and to his shock it worked like a a charm he says following his meditation 
he saw quote a brilliant orange globe of light floating lazily towards the ocean 
so this apparently opened the door to a number of other encounters because he started having 
sightings fairly regularly after this in fact it was two months later he saw quote a brilliant red 
ball of light it zoomed overhead at about 200 miles per hour he estimates it was moving very 
fast and he saw it for maybe 10 11 seconds before it uh disappeared off in the distance 
but it was just a short time later that he had another sighting in 1977 it was two years later 
he saw quote a yellow orange sphere again it was in the same area over his home in pyuma 
and this object was at very low altitude low enough where he lost a view of it behind some 
trees was a very brief sighting just a few seconds but he's absolutely convinced it was unexplained 
so he had three sightings over a space of about two years and this was when the ufos 
came much closer and he apparently had missing time or a ufo landing involving missing time 
this occurred in october of 1978 robert had retired to his bedroom to lay down 
this was during the afternoon and he was alone in the house just laying in bed his bedroom has 
a glass door which overlooks the backyard at any rate he was laying down in his bed 
just dozing and relaxing when suddenly something strange happened 
he heard and felt a very strong and intense low vibration and as robert says and I quote I was 
completely paralyzed and could not even open my eyes until the vibration stopped 
he's not really sure how long this went on so there was a period of disorientation there 
that's definitely a red flag pointing towards missing time but at any rate at some point it 
did stop and he immediately jumped up and went all through the house looking for any indication of 
something strange and found nothing and uh he was pretty sure it wasn't a dream or anything because 
it seemed so real and it was a short time later two days later actually that he got proof or at 
least evidence that something very strange had happened because he went out into his backyard 
and saw something that really shocked him you saw quote a lush vibrant green 
17 foot diameter ring of grass about 8 inches wide this was directly outside his 
glass sliding door outside of his bedroom and as he examined the area he saw something else which 
puzzled him the tip of a 30 foot tall pine tree which grew alongside his yard had been broken 
it was cracked and hanging down so this was a pretty good indication to him that 
something bizarre had happened and uh putting all the pieces together this vibrational noise 
his being paralyzed the cracked pine tree the ring of grass it looked to him like a 
very large 17 foot wide object had come down and hovered over his backyard or perhaps even 
landed there and this mysterious ring remained visible it slowly faded as the months went by 
but after a year it was still faintly visible and then the same thing happened again it was now 1979 
and robert was again resting in bed when he had a strong impression that someone or something 
was standing outside his bedroom door out in the backyard and he was about to get up 
but didn't as he says I intended to get up and investigate then woke up sometime later and 
thought nothing more of it until later that week when a second lush vibrant green 17 foot diameter 
ring of grass appeared on my back lawn right next to the first one which was still there at this 
point he became absolutely convinced that this was a ufo and he had probably had missing time again 
he saw no marks on his body had no dreams he has not elected to go under hypnosis but it certainly 
made him realize that he has probably been taken onboard a craft he's probably a contactee 
and his sightings continued it was two years later in 1982 he had his fourth ufo sighting of a red 
light that moved overhead he saw it the next night and the next night after that three days in a row 
but then it never returned but it was two months later he had what he counts as his eighth sighting 
so when someone has eight sightings I mean this is another huge indicator that they're a contact d 
uh he was outside looked overhead and was watching a jet go overhead heading towards lax which is not 
terribly far from his home he knows the flight paths very well and was just watching it go 
overhead when this weird green light sped up behind the jet and actually overtook it and zoomed 
off into the distance he estimates this object was moving at about three times the speed of 
the jet so that's many many hundreds of miles per hour perhaps up to a thousand miles per hour very 
fast and like all of his sightings this object was completely silent at least as far as he could tell 
at this point the sightings seemed to stop robert and his wife went on with their lives but 
10 years later on may 12 1992 robert had a sudden impulse to try to meditate and call down a ufo 
so he and his wife did it together they meditated together on seeing a ufo and it 
worked it worked like a charm as robert says and I quote we both observed a brilliant incandescent 
white sphere suddenly appear while descending at a very rapid rate from five to from about seven 
to five thousand feet it appeared below a ridge line without slowing down with super fast and 
again totally silent what's really interesting about this sighting which occurred on may 12th 
1992 was almost exactly one month later on june 14th 1992 when there was a huge wave of sightings 
involving hundreds of objects seen by scores of people all throughout the santa monica mountains 
and this was the beginning of a massive ufo wave which swept through this area and lasted for 
well over two years unfortunately at this point due to financial considerations 
robert and his wife moved out of malibu and up to oregon and their encounters pretty much stopped 
so that's that case it's a very interesting case involving missing time and once again the witness 
has no real memory of being on board a ufo but it's pretty clear at least to me that that's 
what in fact happened and now I want to talk about the third case which I think is the most 
dramatic case and I call this case missing time on highway five the main witness is keith boyer 
Missing Time on Highway Five
that it is a pseudonym uh and he had a friend along with him they were driving 
from los angeles to san francisco along highway 5 in 1982 and they were about half way between 
la and san francisco in the middle of the central valley sort of near the fresno area 
and uh it was late at night around 2 a.m there was very little traffic on the road 
they were moving at about a good clip of about 70 miles per hour when looking ahead of them 
they saw something very strange on the road it was a bright bright multi-colored object surrounded by 
this weird foggy mist now keith had always been interested in ufos he's read a number of books so 
he was super excited and he gave a very really really good description about what he saw so I 
just like to quote keith extensively and let him describe in his own words what happened as he says 
i was driving through the central valley on interstate 5 and I was approximately halfway between san francisco and l.a I was with a good friend who is a very hard-headed individual 
a firm pillar of the community type not given to hysteria or anything and I probably wouldn't tell 
you the story and wouldn't even be thinking about it a whole lot anymore if this guy hadn't been with me but we were driving down the road and sure enough there was something strange 
hovering on the horizon as we were driving towards it it appeared to be some kind of flashing light 
something that was hovering over the freeway well we drove along towards it and you know everyone 
drives through the central valley at 70 miles per hour there wasn't a car behind us and not much 
traffic on the road at all really it was 2 a.m and so the object was pretty indescribable from 
a distance the colors and lights seemed rather striking and the conversation turned to what is 
that well it might be a plane flying along and maybe it's a police patrol or something no it's 
pretty bright well maybe it's a crop duster plane so as this conversation progresses we're heading 
directly towards this object which apparently is a hundred feet off the ground above the freeway 
on our side of the freeway and as we got closer to it more and more details became clear 
the object was a series of lights seemingly merging and rotating into each other 
with a kind of indefinable mist surrounding the object a fuzzy atmospheric phenomenon 
at this point the conversation between my friend and I became extremely animated and it was like 
well maybe it's a crop dusting helicopter no that theory was rejected because there aren't any crop 
dusting helicopters that i've ever heard of so we're continuing to drive over towards this object 
which is now beginning to move over to the right of the freeway but it is also descending
at this point keith and his friend hadn't felt any fear they were just pretty excited about it 
keith always likes to drive by the way he will not get into a car unless he is driving this fact will 
become important later but i'll just let keith continue describing what happened as keith says as 
we continued to zoom towards this object the light became almost uncomfortably bright very odd colors 
deep rich blues greens yellows reds a number of them shifting and merging into each other 
and this ominous looking fog or mist surrounded the whole thing it was hard to make out an outline of anything so our conversation became extremely agitated 
at this point as I remember constant you know both talking virtually at the same time 
comparing notes about what we thought this thing was and as the object descended and as we began 
to draw abreast of it it was maybe a hundred feet over the side of the freeway and landing and it 
seemed to be kicking up dust or maybe it was more fog or whatever the object seems surrounded by 
fog or haze a hazy mist kind of cloudy white kind of swirling tendrils of stuff so at this point I 
perceived that the object was unlike anything I could possibly explain rationally with what I know 
and having spent years studying the topic of ufos it seemed clear to me that I was finally 
seeing a genuine ufo and unlike what I thought my reaction would be one of they do exist yay hooray 
i felt horror this was something that seemed to me at the time that was not only reading my mind 
and knew everything about me but I was no more than a bug to it maybe an interesting type of bug 
but this is my perception of what the object was it seemed to me that the object wasn't a 
spaceship is almost something that was an entity into itself unto itself so my friend and I are 
continuing to observe this object and as we draw a rest of it in its landing my reaction was to 
get the hell away from this thing I always thought my reaction would be here is a very 
interesting thing that has befuddled hundreds of thousands of americans and people all over the world and i'm actually privileged to see one let's stop the car walk over and knock on the door 
it was nothing like that it was an odd and terrifying bright object that was scary and 
i wanted to get away from it as fast as possible because with what I had read of ufo effects is 
there does seem to be a rather harmful effect some people have been burned and have been affected 
negatively by ufo presences so my response was as I said to get away uh keith is not quite sure how 
big this thing was as he says it's hard to tell because the perspective of the object 
kept shifting and the light in the mist made for a very confusing effect but I had to make 
if I had to make a very rough ballpark guess i'd say maybe 50 feet across and 50 feet wide 
roughly circular but oozing changing transmogrifying it was a profoundly disturbing 
sight because it could not be explained by the brain the brain kept trying to impose things like 
helicopters or airplanes as explanations but there were no explanations and that was when the shock 
began here was a completely inexplicable object disturbing I mean distressing it bothers one
so they were pretty uh fearful at this time and uh 
just totally entranced and watching this object and this is when they apparently had missing time
because as keith says the next thing I remember he his friend was driving and at that point 
a very strange phenomenon began happening instead of speaking to each other in english 
we began babbling speaking in tongues it's been called 
and it was a profoundly disturbing experience it seemed right at the time but there was also 
a part of the brain that was observing all of this and going well what the hell 
are you doing so that continued for about 10 or 15 minutes afterwards the effect 
seemed to slowly wear off and we numbly continued our drive into the san francisco bay where I lived
so after returning home they did not discuss it not not for some time and it was about a year 
later that they finally uh mentioned it to each other and this is when another very strange thing 
happened as uh keith says and I quote now we get to a very interesting thing my friend told 
me about a year later about a beam that had come out of the object and I had forgotten all about 
it which is odd but as one studies these things one finds that there is missing time and so forth 
but at this point I don't remember any more than suddenly realizing that my friend was driving and 
i wasn't which is odd because i'm a very obsessive driver who loves to drive and always drives 
and he described this beam that came out of the object and swept across the field towards us 
well when he said that I had a horrible memory of it I remember neither of us wanted to get 
hit by that beam but it hit us at that point both keith and his friend blacked out when this being 
struck their car this is when they actually had missing time uh and neither of them 
really remember what happened during this missing time though keith did have a few flashbacks as he 
says it was funny I was driving and then suddenly he was driving I can't explain that not very well 
i seem to I don't know do I have memories of stopping the car and shuffling around 
i don't remember we were very upset both of us were very upset by the sight of the thing
so following this encounter uh keith did have a very strong reaction it chained him changed 
him profoundly and in fact it completely altered the path of his life he quit his job 
he left his girlfriend he ended up going to school to pursue the profession he always wanted to do 
which was being a disc jockey on a radio station and he feels that this encounter although scary 
at first was ultimately beneficial because it really led to a huge spiritual awakening for him 
and as keith says and I quote this is another thing that seems not uncommon when one studies these things ufo encounters often change a person's life 
in my case it was for the better so whether there was actually any effect I can't prove but I suspect that there was some kind of an interaction between the object 
and myself and my friend and certainly at this point I feel like the encounter was beneficial 
but I remember feeling great horror and fear up to the point that I don't remember anymore like 
an animal that was trapped and wanted to get away from a superior force that was incomprehensible
keith did consider hypnosis but as he says i've thought about it but I don't know any hypnotist 
i can trust I really am reluctant to pay some hypnosis I don't know how to hypnotize me the 
whole effect of hypnosis to me I don't trust it so if there was someone I knew someone recommended 
who was good who could be vouched for but right now i'm reluctant to tamper with it any further 
to tell you the truth I have a horrible feeling that there was more to it and I really would like not to know about it so this is an effect a reaction that i've heard 
from many other people who have missing time they're afraid of opening up a can of worms 
they feel like their encounter was benevolent and they're scared of what they might uncover that's certainly true in keith's case his friend however has gone much farther to try to 
not think about this as keith says every once in a while my friends and I get together and 
we'll look at each other and say what was that thing and the topic will change
last I heard keith actually ended up moving to hawaii and was living in a cave and stocking up 
food and preparing for quote the end times he really believes like many contactees 
that our earth is coming up for some major major environmental disasters 
and uh that people need to stock up food and water and there could very well be widespread loss of 
life I hear this quite often so I wasn't actually that surprised when I heard that this is how keith 
is has reacted to all of this so even though he doesn't remember what actually happened 
when he during this missing time when he was presumably taken on board I suspect his reactions has something to do with this that he was given warnings 
of environmental disaster because that is the number one message I hear from people 
so those are the three cases that I wanted to present involving missing time and again the 
reason I wanted to do this is because I want people to realize that if you have a close-up 
sighting within a couple of hundred feet it's really quite possible that this is more than just 
a simple sighting and that you have had missing time and were possibly taken on board and yeah 
again this is much more common than people realize I heard a quote from j allen heineck 
that one in 40 people have been taken on board and I think that's probably pretty close to accurate 
that's what really got me into asking everyone I knew have you had an encounter and I didn't have 
to ask 40 people and I found about five people who have had this missing time including keith 
and it was a year later when the roper poll the roper organization found that one in 50 people 
have had an onboard ufo encounter so I do think this is much more common than people realize and 
that's really why I wanted to do this video because this is something this phenomena of 
missing time and being taken on board I think is fairly widespread and people should know about it 
so that's it for today I hope you've enjoyed this episode I really appreciate you watching 
thanks very much hope you're having a great day and until next time keep having fun
