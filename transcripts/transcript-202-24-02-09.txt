Face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials onboard a UFO! There’s no experience quite like it. It’s the ultimate UFO encounter. An onboard experience takes a person right into the very heart of the UFO phenomenon, answering many of the questions surrounding this subject. And there are so many cases! This video presents five strange and fascinating accounts of people who were taken onboard an ET craft and met extraterrestrials face-to-face. Want to know the ET agenda on our planet? The answers are here!

LORD MOUNTBATTEN’S BRICKLAYER. On Feb 23, 1956, Frederick S Briggs, a former Army officer, was riding his bike on the estate of Lord Mountbatten of Burma in Romsey, England when he saw a flying saucer hovering overhead. He found himself unable to move as a platform holding a human-looking figure descended from the bottom of the craft. Upon reaching the ground, the ET apparently saw Frederick, and the platform retracted back into the craft, which flew off. But the next day, the ET was back. And this time, Frederick had a face-to-face meeting, and was taken onboard the craft. Frederick says the craft took him on a trip around the world before returning him to the Mountbatten’s estate. It was an encounter he would keep secret for a long time.

THE UFO PROPHET. Born in 1898 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Benjamin Solari Parravicini displayed psychic talents from an early age. He told his parents that he was having contact with angels, fairies and other supernatural beings. He grew up to become a talented artist, and began to make prophetic drawings predicting many momentous world events. His predictions turned out to be uncannily accurate, and his fame grew quickly. Then, on the evening of Jun 4, 1968, a few months before his 70th birthday, Benjamin was walking through downtown Buenos Aires when he met a human-looking ET who took him onboard a craft, which proceeded to circle the planet. The ETs told Benjamin that they were protecting the world from catastrophe, and that it was important that he preach love to all humanity.

TAKEN ONBOARD. Jan Wolski was a simple farmer from the small village of Emilcin, Poland when, on the morning of May 19, 1978, two short, green-skinned figures in dark jumpsuits jumped on his horse-drawn wagon and led him to a UFO. Jan was invited onboard where he underwent a physical exam. The ETs were kind and gentle, he said, and they offered Jan some strange alien food, but he declined. While onboard, he noticed a small group of crows which the ETs had evidently collected from Earth. After the short meeting, Jan was returned to his wagon. He rushed home and told his family. News of his encounter spread fast, and soon others in town reported that they too had seen the craft. Investigators arrived and after investigating the case, declared it genuine. It soon became one of Poland’s most famous UFO cases.

THEY NEED ME. Mark James of Stone Mountain, Georgia was 18-years old when, on the night of Jun 23, 1981, he had his first encounter with gray aliens. He and his girlfriend, Linda, had pulled off the road in a rural area when a brilliant light appeared overhead, followed by a period of missing time. Years later, under hypnosis, Mark recalled that he and Linda were pulled onboard the craft. Mark was taken to a large round room where he saw dozens of other people, some waiting in little booths, while others were placed on tables being examined by grays. Soon Mark was examined, and afterward, a tall gray he described as kind and loving warned him of future catastrophes, such as a disease called Ebola, and a possible nuclear attack on the city of Atlanta. He was also shown his future wife and child. Mark was then returned with Linda back to his car with almost no memory of the event. Soon, more encounters would occur.

I COULDN’T GET OUT. On the evening of June 14, 1986, Bete Rodrigues and her cousin Debora were returning from a dance club near their home in Sao Paolo, Brazil when a UFO began to pace their bus. It darted away, but as the two walked home, the UFO returned, following them. By the time they arrived home, the two had experienced a period of missing time. Afterwards, they had dreams and flashbacks of being examined by ETs onboard a craft. Five years later, they sought hypnosis and learned that both had been pulled onboard a craft. They were taken into different rooms where both underwent a strange physical examination. Bete believes she was implanted by the ETs. Bete also recalled other encounters from her childhood.

These five amazing onboard UFO encounters reveal the many ET agendas, such as studying human physiology, providing warnings about our future, and informing people about the ET presence on our planet. These cases show that there is a wide variety of ET types, and that an encounter can occur to anyone, anywhere, anytime. The truth can no longer be denied. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.

Hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and
the Paranormal today's episode is called extraterrestrial meetings five true
onboard UFO encounters I love all kinds of UFO encounters it's the subject I
love to cover most and honestly my favorite type of UFO encounter are on
board UFO encounters I like them because as I've said many times these are the
cases that I find the most fascinating that certainly contain the most information about who ETS are where they
come from what their agenda is and what it's like to have ET contact and there
are a lot of cases of this kind far more than most people realize and I've said
it before but I think it Bears repeating pretty much everything we know about extraterrestrials comes from cases like
these not from our governments not from from scientists who've never had an encounter but from the people who've had
face-to-face contact with ETS and there's so many different kinds all
humanoids pretty much we all do seem to share a common Heritage have so many
contact have been told but there's still a lot of variation between cases and we
always learn something new from each case I've chosen five cases today coming
from all over the world and I think you'll find them quite interesting because they reach back pretty early in
time all the way to the 1950s and up through several decades and
involve a wide variety of ETS and of course all kinds of evidence and they
are just some really unusual and interesting encounters with a lot of insight into the UFO phenomenon so let's
get started with our first case which I call Lord mount botton's brick layer
this is a super fascinating case which I think is somewhat well known if you
haven't heard of it you definitely should know about it because it's really
unusual especially given the location of where this incident happened it occurred
on February 23rd and 24th in 1956 in Romy England on the actual
estate of Lord mount Boton of Burma I think you'll find it a truly fascinating
case this is an encounter which has proved to be something of a headache for the British aristocracy as it occurred
on the estate of Lord Earl Mount Boton of Burma in romsey Hampshire England and
the witness is actually of pretty high credibility he's more than just a brick layer he's actually a former British
army Sergeant by the name of Frederick s Briggs now at the time of his encounter
he was working for L Lord mount button as a brick layer and doing various other
odd jobs on the estate and it was around 8:30 a.m. on the morning of February
23rd 1955 and he was on the estate itself
biking near the second gate when his encounter began and actually at the request of
Lord mount Boton he did write a very detailed account of his encounter so I
will just quote Frederick Briggs directly as he says in his own
words I was cycling to work from romsey when I was about halfway between the
Palmerston or Ramsey Lodge and the house just by where the drive Forks off to the
middlebridge lodge and the house I suddenly saw an object hovering
stationary over the field between the end of the gardens and middlebridge drive and just just on the house side of
the little stream the object was shaped like a child's huge humming top and halfway
between 20 ft or 30 ft in diameter its color was like dull
aluminum rather like a kitchen saucepan it was shaped like the sketch
which I have endeavored to make and had Port holes all around the middle rather like a steamer has I turned off the
drive at the fork and rode over the grass for rather less than 100 yard I
then dismounted and holding my bicycle in my right hand watched while I was
watching a column about the thickness of a man descended from the center of the
saucer and I suddenly noticed on it what appeared to be a man presumably standing
on a small platform on the end he did not appear to be holding on to anything
he seemed to be dressed in a dark suit of overalls and was wearing a close-fitting hat or helmet at the time
the saucer was certainly less than 100 yard from me and not more than 60 ft
over the level where I was standing as I stood there watching I suddenly saw a
curious light come on in one of the port holes it was a bluish light rather like
a mercury vapor light although it was quite bright it did not appear to be
directed straight at me nor did it Dazzle me but simultaneously with the light coming on I suddenly seemed to be
pushed over and I fell down on the snow with my bicycle on top of me what is
more I could not get up again although the bicycle weighs only a few pounds it
seemed as though an unseen force was holding me down whilst lying on the
ground I could see the tube withdrawn quickly into the saucer which then Rose
vertically quite as fast as as the fast jet aircraft I have seen or faster there
had been no noise whatsoever until the saucer started to move and even then the noise was no louder than that of an
ordinary small rocket let off by a child it disappeared out of sight into the
clouds almost instantly and as it went I found myself able to get up although I
seemed to be lying a long time on the ground I do not suppose in reality it was more than a few seconds
so this was a written testimony he wrote down at the request of Lord mount Boton
but of course we do know a few further details that were not included in
Frederick Briggs statement and so this craft was about 50
ft in the air and as he's watching it he did notice a trap door of sorts opening
up from the bottom section or it seemed like a portion sort of detached itself
and this revealed the descending column and the platform with the man on it and
he said this man looked human he was about 5 Fe 6 in with fair or silvery
hair His close-fitting Garment was blue in color and as the column was about to
touch the ground Frederick had the impression that the man was about to step off the platform but then seemed to
change his mind when he saw Frederick who was by this time almost directly below the object so this is when
Frederick was thrown off of his bike and interestingly reports being unable to
move that's a detail we see in a lot of accounts so the object went off and at
this point Frederick rushed to the estate and was greeted by the mount botton chauffeur who said quote you look
as if you've had a shock now Frederick was friendly with the chauffeur and said
you're never going to believe this and immediately shared his story and after
Frederick told this to the chaur the chauffeur said you must tell the boss this he's interested in these things and
this was true in fact it was later confirmed that Lord mount botton did in
fact subscribe to the UFO Journal Flying Saucer review and it's well known he
expressed a great interest in this subject Either Way Frederick did not want to
share his story but the chauffeur insisted and ultimately it was the chauffeur himself who went up to Lord
Earl Mount Boton and told him what Briggs had told the
chauffeur so Lord mount Bon hearing what had happened on his own estate right
near him he took Frederick's story very seriously he reportedly produced a
number of UFO photographs s in his possession showed them to Frederick and
asked him to point to the photo which most resembled the craft he had seen
encouraging him by saying quote we know about these things and are very
interested in them this at least is what Frederick Briggs told researcher Desmond
Lesley in a later interview so again Lord mount bton had
asked Frederick to write down the whole experience and in fact afterwards or
around that same time went to investigate and made his own written statement of the event which is quite
positive in terms of believing what Frederick Briggs experienced I'll just
quote to you this letter from Lord mount Boton himself and I quote the attached
statement was dictated by Mr Briggs to miss Travis on the morning of the 23rd
of February at my request my own electrician Heath reported his
conversation and I subsequently interviewed Mr Briggs with my wife and younger daughter and as a result of his
account Heath and I accompanied him to the place from which he saw the Flying
Saucer we followed the marks of his bicycle in the snow very easily and
exactly at the spot which he described the tracks came to an end and foot marks
appeared beside it next to the foot marks there were the marks of a body having fallen in the snow and then the
marks of a bicycle having been picked up again there being a clear gap of 3 ft
between where the wheel marks originally ended and then started again the rear wheel marks continuous
but blurred from then on the bicycle tracks LED back to the drive the bicycle
tracks absolutely confirm Mr briggs' story as far as his his own movements
are concerned he Heath and I searched the area over the spot where the Flying
Saucer was estimated to have been but candidly we could see no unusual signs
the snow at the bottom of the meadow had melted much more than at the top and it would have been difficult to see any
marks this statement has been dictated in the presence of Heath and Mr Briggs
and Heath and I have carefully read Mr briggs' statement and we both attest
that this is the exact story which he told us Mr Briggs was still days when I
first saw him and was worried that no one would believe his story indeed he
made a point of saying that he had never believed in flying saucers stories before and had been absolutely amazed at
what he had seen he did not give me the impression of being the sort of man who would give who would be subject to
hallucinations or would in any way invent such a story I am sure from the
sincere way he gave his account that he himself is completely convinced of the
truth of his own statement he has offered to swear to the truth of this statement on the oath of the Bible if
needed but I saw no point in asking him to do this so this is Lord mount
botton's written statement which he signed Mount Boton of Burma and in fact low Mount Boton
signature his electrician RR Heath also signed his signature and wrote I confirm
that I have read and agree with the above statement now there is one detail which
is a bit at odds with this written statement because according to researcher Desmond Leslie who
interviewed freder Frederick Briggs uh he said that there was a quote
Perfect Circle of melted snow in the Dell below where the UFO hovered and
after having interviewed Frederick Briggs Desmond Leslie wrote down his
impressions of Frederick describing him as quote a good honest down-to-earth
fellow who' had an extraordinary experience which he could not explain so this experience alone I think
would be enough to astonish anyone but events had just begun this was a face-
to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial not an onboard experience but just wait there's more
because it was the next day that Frederick Briggs had a second and even more astonishing encounter which she
swore to secrecy in terms of being published until Lord mount bot passed
away and in fact he's told the story only to researcher Desmond Leslie and
here's the story on February 24th again around around 8:30 a.m. Frederick was
again biking to work when he came upon the same man he had seen the day before coming out of the saucer only this time
this ET was standing in the middle of the road as if waiting for Frederick he
was dressed in the same tight fitting blue jumpsuit and as Frederick came closer he
signaled Frederick to get off his bike and held out his hand Frederick strongly
shook the man's hand greeting apparently too strongly because according to Frederick the man winced slightly and
speaking telepathically in English to be gentler and that quote we are not as
strong as you please be careful and in fact Frederick Briggs
told Desmond Leslie that he was struck by the softness and delicateness of the man's hand which he said was as smooth
as a baby's hand so Frederick mumbled an apology and the Man actually led him to
the saucer which had landed a short distance from the house though apparently still on the
estate now Mr Briggs told Desmond Leslie that he was actually invited aboard the
craft by this ET gentleman which he did he went on board
and inside he found himself in a small room there was a single chair there was
also a single sort of triangular-shaped window against one of the walls
and the man asked Frederick if he would like to take a trip and Frederick had no
fear whatsoever he felt that the man was very friendly and said that he would be happy to the man asked him where he'd
like to go and Frederick responded speaking out loud and said that when he
was in the Army he had visited the pyramids in Egypt and had always wanted to see them again and this man agreed
and in the space of about 10 10 minutes they were there Frederick looked out the window of the UFO and he could see the
Pyramids of Giza and he told Desmond Leslie with a puzzled expression and I quote I was
able to see them from above and from the side at the same time so this was
somewhat confusing to Frederick Briggs because he's looking at the pids from two different angles out of the same
window but he states that he was sure this was not a window or screen because
he was watching the landscape pass by the whole time so that's pretty much the extent of
the encounter Frederick rggs was then returned back to England the saucer
landed again on the estate and the ET said to Frederick Briggs and I quote if
Lord mount Boton met us he could change the world so this entire encounter lasted
about a half hour Desmond Leslie was intrigued by this statement about meeting with Lord bount
and after receiving the testimony of Frederick Briggs he contacted Lord mount
Boton about it and this is when Lord mount Bon started to backpedal a little
bit and said he was skeptical of this onboard experience now Desmond Leslie
found this somewhat strange considering that Lord mount Boton had already affirmed in in
unequivocal rhetoric uh that Brigg's first encounter was
genuine and again Lord mount bont's interest in UFOs is very well
attested and his daughter Lady Pamela Hicks who was there when Frederick
Briggs shared his first story certainly said that one year earlier in 1954 she
and her father were visiting with King ID of Libya when the subject of UFOs
came up and the King admitted that he had actually seen two UFOs himself of
the quote fiery sphere kind so the story of the first sighting
by Frederick Briggs did receive considerable publicity but when the Second Story
started to come out both Lady Pamela Hicks and her father Lord mount Bon both
did their best to sort of backpedal the story with Lord mount Boton now saying
that he thought briggs' second story was unproven and Lady Hicks actually went so
far as to call brck Briggs story an excuse for being late to
work but it's really interesting because behind the scenes it's apparent that they did believe it because musician
Molly Thompson who was quite famous said that in 1963 she had the opportunity to
meet with Desmond Leslie who told her about Frederick Briggs story and she
says that she was actually invited to visit the estate of Lord mount Boton and
interview Briggs herself unfortunately she never did this but it's certainly
good indication that Frederick Briggs was believed about what he experienced
and as for Frederick Briggs himself he has never wavered from his account and insisted that he is telling the truth so
how about that what an unusual case I mean that would have been so awesome to be able to take a trip like Frederick
Briggs did traveling really all the way around the world on board a UFO it's a
shame that there wasn't a face-to-face meeting with Lord mount Boton perhaps
there was if there was we certainly didn't hear about it it's pretty clear that they started to backpedal Lord
mount button and his folks on this case even though initially they were all in
and absolutely verified it it's one of the things I like about this case is it's so well verified and it's a really
fascinating case which once again shows that the ETS are aware of our world
leaders and have made attempts to contact them that alone I think makes it an important case and here's our next
case number two in this list of five and I call this one the UFO profit there
are a lot of cases where ETS have given people information about the future and
this case certainly ranks high among them it's not very well known out
outside of the country of Argentina where it occurred the main UFO encounter
involving this gentleman his name is Benjamin Solari
paravicini uh his main encounter occurred on June June 4 1968 in buis Aris
Argentina but it's clear he's had a lifetime of Encounters of all different types of entities he's a very
influential figure in his country and I think you'll find this a truly fascinating case born on August 8th 1898
Benjamin Solari paravicini was the oldest of eight siblings and from a very
young age age Benjamin claimed to have contact with a wide variety of Supernatural entities such as fairies
and angels and more and he displayed really prominent psychic abilities in
fact he was able to find lost objects and missing people with ease and he had
so many paranormal experiences that his father who was a psychologist had him tested extensively
to see if there was any m mental illness which of course they did not find and from a young age Benjamin also
displayed a great talent for art and by his 20s was a very successful artist he
became an art professor and the director of an art G Gallery in fact he received
a gold medal in Le Belgium for his work and was commended by King Albert I who
actually bought one of his paintings and was later congr congratulated by Argentine president marelo torquato de
Alvar but it was starting in 1936 when Benjamin began producing
prophetic drawings what he calls psychography which he says were inspired
by his Guardian Angel and these are somewhat simple drawings but they're always accompanied
by little writings and what are apparent predic itions and Benjamin became very quickly
well known because his his predictions were uncan accurate in
1938 he reportedly predicted the arrival of Television saying quote through small
screens external happenings will be seen at home also in 1938 he predicted Satellite
Communication he did his little drawings and wrote next to it it comes a new
communication system in the world by artificial planets so this was his
method of apparently accessing his psychic abilities he would draw a little picture
and then make a statement next to it again in 1938 he predicted invitro
fertilization doing his drawings and writing quote artificial motherhood
cultivated so he made an enormous number of predictions of this kind
he predicted Atomic power did his little drawing and wrote quote the atom will
come to dominate the world and this proved to be absolutely true he
predicted the artificial heart and in fact said the heart will be artificial
and gave the year which turned out to be a very important year in the development
of the artificial heart so he made many many other predictions predicting world
War I which was apparently his first prediction but also the launch of Sputnik
2 the 1950 56 Suez Crisis the rise of
Fidel Castro a really interesting prediction of his was the fact that the first being
in space would be a dog which it was the Russian dog Leica he also predicted the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki he predicted the assass assassination of John F
Kennedy in fact way back in 1939 he made a prediction about a terrorist attack on
New York actually drawing the twin towers and he wrote the freedom of North
America will lose its light its torch won't illuminate like yesterday and the
monument will be attacked two times so again all accompanied by drawings many
of his predictions did focus on his home country of Argentina but many were about the world
in general and due to the accuracy of his predictions his Fame grew very
quickly and he has often been given the label the Nostradamus of
Argentina but important here is that according to his good friend and UFO
investigator Fabio zerpa Benjamin claims to have been taken on board a UFO by
human looking ETS and this occurred on a foggy night
on June 4 1968 Benjamin was walking to his home in
buenus Aris Argentina after visiting the theater and as he arrived at the corner
of avenita belgrano and avenita N de Julio this was sometime after midnight
in downtown buenus arz Benjamin was suddenly confronted by someone he
described as a fair skinned man who he first frankly thought was a mad man in
fact Benjamin said his eyes were quote so light in color that it looked as
though he was blind so the man had very unusual eyes this man stopped Benjamin
spoke in what he perceived to be a foreign sort of guttural language but at
the same time Benjamin was deeply impressed by this man's manner which he described as quote kindly and even
gentle so the man apparently using gestures instructed Benjamin to look
upward and hovering about 150 ft in the air very close to the Argentine Ministry
of Public Works building Benjamin saw a dark mysterious looking
craft and the next thing he knew he was being struck by this huge beam of light
he was overcome with dizziness and when he recovered Benjamin found himself
apparently inside the craft standing next to three other human-looking
individuals very much like this first gentleman of Benjamin described this
room that he was in as being round he said there were some glowing panels
along the walls what looked like a central tube in the middle Benjamin said
that these ETS were very goodlooking one of them spoke to him in that same strange guttural language but Benjamin
discovered that he was actually able to understand through telepathy and the man who spoke to him
told Benjamin not to be afraid and that they were going to take him on an orbit
around the planet Earth and he would then be returned and the craft quickly moved off
and as it did Benjamin was able to look down and see various countries
including he says Japan France and
Chile he said this trip seemed to take only a few minutes and the ETS spoke with him at
this point they told him that they were watching over Earth and protecting the
planet from any catastrophes and they told him quote you
have to preach love the universe is harmony your behavior meaning human in
general your behavior is aggressive we have several chosen ones we will meet
again Benjamin says that he was then returned to the sidewalk location exactly where he had been taken and More
Than 3 hours had passed so this turned out to be the first of several
encounters with ETS now Benjamin did continue to produce
his prophetic drawings up until his death on December 13
1974 there are literally hundreds of them and since then his prophecies
continue to unfold he's very well known books have been written about his case
and he certainly been very influential in his country of Argentina so there you go another
amazing case of UFO contact in which a witness was given quite a bit of
information about our our planet and the fact that his track record of predictions is so accurate I think
speaks volumes to The credibility of his case it's a really unusual case and
certainly High Praise to be called the Nostradamus of Argentina I think his case is definitely
worth looking into with books being written about it and he having
influenced so many people and it should be very interesting to see if some of
his future predictions come true or not but yeah a pretty good track record to
say the least and now we move to the next case which I call taken on board this is a
pretty unusual onboard UFO encounter which took place on May 19
1978 in the very small town of emilson Poland in fact this is probably Poland's
most famous onboard UFO case very well investigated corroborated by multiple
supporting Witnesses though technically it is a single witness case involving a
gentleman who was taken on board a UFO and had a really unusual experience with
these really unusual ETS as well it's an amazing case this case is so amazing
probably my favorite of these five I'm presenting today the main witness is Yan walski he's a
simple farmer from emilson Poland in fact he had spent his entire life in his
village never traveling far from it but it was on the morning of May 19
1978 that Yan would have an encounter and see things that most people could hardly even imagine he was not too far
from his farm sitting in his horse cart heading home and he noticed two short
men ahead of him now he thought at first they might be hunters or something but
upon seeing him approached they slowed down and they began to sort of move
towards him with this strange hopping motion not normal and suddenly each of
them jumped up on his cart one on either side now this alone wasn't unusual as
people in that area often gave each other rides but when he saw these men up close he was very much struck by their
odd appearance again each was short about 5T tall and as Yan says they were
quite small I noticed only their faces and hands they were green I remember
quite well that they had sort of membranes between their fingers their eyes were sort of dark and slanting and
their cheekbones stuck out more than ours their teeth were very white their necks were quite different they had
something like a hump they wore dark dark overalls that went from head to toe and there are other details that he
describes he says that their heads were larger than normal they did not appear to have whites in their eyes their noses
were extremely small they had no hair on their heads and they began talking to
each other over Yan in a foreign language that he couldn't understand now
Yan realized at this point that this was quite unusual and he became a little bit frightened
too frightened to take a good long look at them so he just kind of kept driving his cart nervously looking straight
forward but he became even more alarmed when they approached a clearing and he
saw what looked like a sort of bus quote hanging in the air this object was white
it had no markings on it it had what looked like vertical rotating tubes at Each corner four of them it was fairly
small about 15 ft long 9 ft High 9 ft wide and it was totally silent as it
moved slowly around the area in a hovering fashion now as they approached it these
two men motioned for Yan to stop his cart and accompany them to the
craft so he did they walked together one figure on each side of yan right up to
the craft which was now just a few feet up in the air and as he wased
there was this transparent sort of quote elevator type device which extended from
the bottom of the craft almost to the ground itself about a foot above the ground one of them stepped up on the
platform and gestured for Yan to do the same which he did and very suddenly this
platform moved smoothly upwards and Yan found himself inside this small room and
inside there were two additional short figures looking very much identical to
the ones he had already seen Yan says he felt no fear at this point because they seemed to have a very kind and gentle
demeanor and as Yan says in his own words the room was dark no bulbs no
engines there was nothing the walls were as if plastic molded from One Piece
there were small pews fastened to the wall by that he means shelves or benches
he says quote The Light from the outside poured in the door was also strange it
had no hinges it scrolled like a carpet so the beings now instructed Yan
to undress he took off his jacket and he thought that would be enough but no they
told him that they wanted him to undress completely take off all his clothes so
he began to undress they pulled out some what looked of apparently was food and
began eating it and through gestures they asked if Yan wanted to try the food
he looked at it he said it looked kind of like icicles or popsicles it was clear but it crumbled like cake
unfortunately Yan declined so he doesn't know what kind of food this was or what it tastes like but at this point one of
the beings continued to help Yan to undress by undoing his shirt
buns and after he was undressed the beings examined his clothes and they
seemed fascinated by his belt and how it buckled so at this point two of them
held a small disc in their hand which seemed to actually just stick to their hand and they used these discs to
examine him they had him lift his arms up this point he could smell a strange
old odor which he kind of likened to burning sulfur in fact it was strong
enough that it would Linger on his clothes for days afterwards and looking around the craft
which he said there was really nothing in there but he did see one thing he noticed that there was a small group of
crows or Ravens but they were not moving at all just sitting on the floor though
it was clear they were still alive so at this point the ETS seemed to
be finished with their examination and they instructed Yan to
get dressed which he did and this is pretty much the extent of his
experience he was escorted back to this elevator like device he sort of bowed to
them and they bowed back and this elevator quickly deposited Yan back on
the ground he walked away from the craft and turning around he saw these beings
were looking down at him from the doorway and this craft was still hovering overhead at a very low
level and he didn't see it leave Yan just turned around to quickly go to his
house and tell his family which he did he immediately went home told his wife and his two sons they of course ran
outside to see if the UFO was there but unfortunately it was not it was gone but
Yan stories spread like wildfire through the village and very quickly people from
all over the village came to check on the area and they did in fact find strange footprints on the muddy ground
where the crow had hovered and Yan said he had seen these beings Yan was absolutely sincere about
his encounter and in fact he later signed a sworn statement as numerous
scientists and researchers came to hear his account and it turned out that there
were other witnesses there was a six-year-old boy named Adam was playing
outside his home about a half mile away and he said he saw a very strange plane
flying very low to the ground and saw a pilot with a green face inside looking
out reportedly there were other witnesses as well some of who heard strange sounds some of who apparently
saw the craft as well so investigators found Yan walski to be very sincere very
believable he was in fact a devout Catholic uh his case was published in
some newspapers who tried to debunk it and say that Yan had seen nothing but a helic helicopter which is absurd but
nevertheless Yan's case became very well known and later in 2005 as you can see
here there was a small Monument put up near the site of his encounter to commemorate his experience and it is
perhaps Poland's most famous onboard UFO encounter another Super interesting case
for sure it reminds me of the Alfred ber two case in England cuz this gentleman
also was 71 years old took the case his experience in stride and was very
forthright and sincere about it and all the people who have investigated his
case have come away absolutely convinced and as you saw there is an
actual Monument commemorating his case it's a really interesting onboard UFO
encounter and here is another one which I think you'll find equally
fascinating uh this is the fourth encounter in this little bunch and I
call this one they need me this took place on June 23rd
1981 in Stone Mountain Georgia it is a multiple witness case it's a quite
extensive onboard encounter in which this gentleman was able to converse with
the ETS and they gave him some really startling predictions which I think we
all need to take seriously given that one of them has already apparently come
true and it's certainly an important case in that regard alone but the
details he describes with his contacts with gray ETS are really fascinating
this case was published in UFO encounters magazine and the main witness
is a gentleman by the name of Mark James who reports multiple encounters but it was an onboard
encounter his first encounter that he knows of at age 18 in 1981 which is perhaps his most
significant meeting with these gray type extraterrestrials was on June 23rd
1981 Mark and his then girlfriend Linda were driving to a party near Stone
Mountain Georgia when they arrived this party was actually being broken up by the police
so Mark and Linda did not attend the party they just continued driving it was
a short time later that they pulled over at a culdesac near Martin's Crossing
Road which you can see here this is a short little road with a lake next to it
and just moments after parking in this culdesac Mark noticed a brightly lit
object in the sky moving towards them at quite low altitude and he first thought
it might be a helicopter but for some reason he felt like it was coming for
him and the next thing they knew they were driving home wanting to get away
from this helicopter and when he dropped Linda off at her home her father bered Mark for
bringing her home so late this made Mark angry because he didn't think they were
late they had pretty much drove directly home he hadn't done anything wrong uh and by the time he woke up the next
morning he had really no memory of this experience at all it was only years
later after further experiences that he recalled it he decided to go under
hypnosis and under hypnosis he did recall this incident at age
18 which resulted in a lengthy onboard experience
uh the researcher in this case is C Lee Culver and he placed mark under hypnosis
and this is when this entire onboard scenario emerged Mark recalled seeing
this light which he thought was a helicopter get closer and closer at this point Linda his then girlfriend began to
become fearful he reassured her saying it's all right Linda it's just a
helicopter let's get out of here and he tried to start the car but it would not
start and suddenly this craft was right over them and it wasn't a helicopter as
you can see from Mark's drawing it was a large saucer-shaped object with Port holes there was a resonating humming
sound feeling the air a brilliant light Shone down on them from this object and
suddenly there were five or six short thin gray skin figures approaching
Mark's Car the figure quickly surrounded the car and although the car doors were
locked the figures opened them easily and pulled the young couple out now at
this point the light around them was so bright Mark said it was like daylight in fact he could see the trees and the
nearby nearby lake with perfect clarity he looked over at Linda and saw that she
had a sort of Dazed expression on her face the next thing he knew they were
both floating up into the light and very quickly they were both inside this
craft once inside Mark smelled a musty odor he said it reminded him of being
quote under a house he said the temperature was somewhat cool he found
himself walking down a ramp said the walls and Floors were made of very
smooth gray metal two gray type ETS walked on either side of him escorting
him down this curved corridor at this point he did see a weird sort of box-shaped device with metal plates on
it which he couldn't describe too well but you can see his drawing here and he said it was emitting a loud humming
sound but from there he was taken into a large well-lit circular room and placed
in a little Al Cove or what he described as a holding Booth it was just big
enough to hold him he sat down on this little metal bench which he said was
weird because although it was metal it seemed to flex to his weight he noticed
that there were about a dozen of these little El Cove booths lining the curved wall and each one of them had a person
sitting in them everyone that he saw looked a little bit dazed and just ahead
of him this room actually opened up and he saw about a dozen examination tables
each was of which was supported by a single column coming from from the floor up to the center of the table and each
table had a person lying on them while gray ETS examined them now this
frightened Mark deeply he told himself I've got to get out of here I've got to
get out and he watched as a gentleman was led from one of these little holding
booths to an exam table shortly later another person a pregnant woman was
taken from the booth to one of the tables he says now he could detect detect an odor which kind of reminded
him of dirty laundry and this was a big room he estimates this room was about 60
maybe 70 ft wide and about 12 or 13 ft
High it had a curved ceiling and as Mark says in his own words it's a big room
lots of tables lots of aliens there are people on them as far as I can see so
the next thing he knew it was his turn two Grays came for him
he was led to a table undressed and told to lay down on the table which he did so
the grads began to examine his body touching him starting with his feet moving up his legs they bent his leg and
James found this interesting because he had this problem with his knee which would cause it sort to sort of make a
popping sound when his knee bent and as he says they seemed fascinated by it so
they they continued to examine his entire body moving from his feet all the way up up to his stomach to his chest
during this time he was unable to move and he was thinking to himself I wish they would leave me alone he said the
Grays who were examining him were quite short and moved with very purposeful sort of jerky movements but as he
watched a taller female gray arrived and he said she moved very gracefully among
the tables he looked and saw that she had four fingers no fingernails and here's Mark describing
what he recalled under hypnosis as he said she's coming closer she is caring
sympathetic she's trying to calm me down she's right in my face she is telling me
that I have no reason to fear that I am needed they do not intend to harm me
they just need me I am needed for genetics and future events now at this point the female gray
began to speak to him telepathically saying You must remember this it is
important very important and then she started repeating this word ebola ebola
ebola and as Mark says she's telling me that I am to remember that it is very
important that I remember Ebola she's close to my face she's almost touching
my face with hers staring at me a sense of caring even
loving so she continued to repeat this word several times at the time Mark
didn't know what it meant but later in hindsight he of course learned that this
was a disease and Mark had the impression that she was telling him about this disease and that it was
coming in the future and would be very difficult to contain now she held a wand-like device
in her hand at the T tip of this wand-like device there was a little leaflike structure which sort of glowed
with light and she began to move it towards him and as she moved it towards
his forehead it increased in brightness and then she tapped his forehead with it and
as Mark says it just exploded like a bright light and this is when another
strange image filled his mind and she was speaking to him and as Mark says
again in his own words she's telling me the future the future when I am old so
he saw a city and he recognized it as Atlanta Georgia and the scene that he
was shown focused on a highway which was filled with cars and
in fact both lanes were filled with cars but it was very odd because they weren't
going in two directions they were all headed in One Direction away from the city center and he recognized this
highway as Interstate 20 and he saw that the cars were so
close to each other some were hitting each other and in fact many people were on foot loaded with belongings and
luggage and it was a very distressing scene he began to shake and cry because
at this point he saw a mushroom cloud rising up from the city center
and as he said under hypnosis they blew it up they nuked it a big mushroom cloud
over Atlanta an atomic bomb it came down from the sky they want me to know
everybody's gone it's all gone so this was extremely distressing to him he was
Weeping at this point and this is when the scene shifted to another scene which
showed him with his wife Janet who who
at that point he didn't know but he would later meet uh this scene also showed him with a six-year-old son Allen
who at the time of hypnosis was actually only two years old but at the time of
the incident he didn't know at all of course but this scene showed to him by the ETS showed Mark with Janet and his
son Allan having a wonderful picnic along the chattah huchi river in fact
his son was picking flowers while he and his wife ate tuna sandwiches he said this scene felt
filled him with absolute peace and joy uh C Lee Culver the investigator of
this case wonders if the ETS are just studying his emotional reaction or if
these are actual predictions in any event after this scene the image is stopped and the
female gray said we are almost through with what we need at this point he saw a
smaller gray moving towards him with another little wand with a sort of round little BB like object on the end which
they placed in his left ear and told him that this would help them now next Mark did say he saw what
looked like glass containers along one side of the room he saw one had a baby inside of it with quote a really big
head and a really small body he didn't get a good look at that but he looked up
and saw the ceiling seemed to be transparent and he was amazed cuz he could see this beautiful
Starfield he believes that next they took a sperm sample he's not entirely sure but he was told to sit up and put
his clothes on and this is when he did get a pretty good look around at the room he was shocked to see so many
people in the room pretty much all of them out of it with dazed Expressions Mark says at this point he
was escorted off the table very quickly back down the corridor he had entered at the beginning of his experience he said
at this point he did see what he believed to be a strange marking or symbol on the wall uh
it was composed of four dots and a sort of triangular pattern three making a
triangle and one on top and another what looked like a marking of some kind which
was composed of a curved triangle with a circle inside and a semicircle with two
parallel lines inside that which you can see here he produced the drawings of
this at any rate from this point he was led down to the end of the corridor and
suddenly he found himself floating in the air quite high above his car he could see his car tiny little thing down
there he saw his girlfriend Linda they were put on the ground and placed back
in the car and the ETS left and he says that he and Linda sat in the car for
quite a few moments when suddenly he seemed to wake up out of a trance turned to her and saids we've got to go we've
got to get out of here and he started the car which started up normally and drove off to escape what he still
believed was a helicopter coming for them and he drove quickly hoping that it
wouldn't follow them so that was his experience but very
interestingly one week later on June 30th 1981 Mark uh and a neighbor girl named Jan
were playing basketball this is around 9 p.m. and this is when Jan uh Jan noticed
a figure off in the woods and this concerned Mark uh he told
Jan to go get help and suddenly Mark felt himself walking into the woods
somewhat against his will he felt compelled to just go Jan told him not to
but he went anyway and he went into the woods where he saw this very small being
who was wearing a large hat and a black trench coat that didn't fit him at all
and he saw this was a very skinny being with long arms and he now recognizes it
as a gray who basically told him that it was time for a quick checkup and as Mark
says in his own words he's got something in his hand and he's holding it up to my
face there's a little black thing in the center of it uh this object was circular
the gray held it up to Mark's right Temple Mark had the impression that the gray was taking some kind of reading in
fact he could feel quote little pulses was a very quick encounter Mark was told
to exit the woods which he did and the only real after effect was that he felt
a deep tiredness but it would be 15 years after his initial encounter at age 18 that
James finally sought out hypnosis and years later as the ETS had
shown him he did meet his wife Janet got married had their son Allan and when Alan was only two years
old he saw the cover of the book communion which uh Mark had
bought and his son pointed to the picture on the cover and said that the people like
that come into his room at night so this does appear to be a
generational contact te case interestingly the disease Ebola had its
first recorded outbreak in 1976 about 5 years before James was
warned about by the ETS but long before it had received any real
publicity so this case makes it clear that the ETS are watching over us very
closely a very concerning case to say the least those are some pretty dire
predictions but ETS have been warning people a long time about the dangers of
nuclear power in particular so this could be perhaps well you might call
Scare Tactics to sort of just get people to shape up hard to say for sure but
there are being so many cases of people being warned of nuclear war and this sort of thing I think
we should take it seriously either way it's definitely an issue on this planet and it's clear the ETS are aware of
it and now we move to the final case in this little episode and I call this one
I couldn't get out and this case I think speaks to the fear a lot of people have
when they're taken on board and their impulse to just want to get through the
experience uh a lot of people do have fear was clear in this case I think they
were the witnesses two of them were simply being physically examined but
yeah they did find it quite fearful it took place on June 14
1986 in sa Pao Brazil this does to be appear to be your typical graze but what
I like about this case is it is a multiple witness case there is some really interesting evidence supporting
it one of the witnesses has a lifetime of encounters and some really
interesting interactions and at least one of which is pretty humorous
actually I think you'll find it a fascinating case on the evening of June 14 1986 bet Rodriguez then aged 22 and
her cousin Debra aged 16 had attended a dance club near their home in sa Pao
Brazil something they have done often as they were going home around 11:30 p.m.
they noticed a strange light following the bus they were on it disappeared and
they started walking home After exiting the bus and this is when this light
appeared again and followed them a short distance and then went away and when they arrived home both
went straight to sleep which was quite unusual cuz they usually stayed up in talked about the
night and this was in the days and weeks that followed that they both began to have dreams and flashbacks of meeting
gray ETS and being apparently on board a craft finally 5 years later in
1991 they contacted researcher Mario ronel who placed them both under
hypnosis and took them back to the night of June 14th and this is when both recalled a major onboard UFO
experience under hypnosis they recalled what they already consciously remembered
seeing the UFO from the bus watching it Pace the bus for a short distance then
go away getting off the bus and walking home and again seeing this UFO follow
them for a while but under hypnosis they now recall that as they reached
Deborah's home on mea Street in sa Pao they saw this glowing sphere at a very
low level in the field next to Deborah's home now suddenly in front of them stood
a 4ft tall figure which they described as looking like a big insect with a huge
bald head dark eyes grayish green skin very thin with long arms and four
fingers on each hand he wore a green skintight jumpsuit both described the
same detail details described this being as being very ugly uh and at this point this figure
started pointing upwards and the next thing they knew they were walking into the field towards this hovering object
and as bet says we walked even against our will it was as if something like
that called us no sooner had they reached this craft when a cylinder of
light came down and Deborah was floated up into the craft first
followed by bet and they both found themselves in this strange round room
they were immediately separated and each taken to a different room now bet recall
being taken to this other room and laid down on a short bed or table said it was
so short that her feet actually hung over the end there were three beings with her in the room one place this
weird sort of bracelet like device on her wrist while another began to operate
a strange device which was attached to what looked sort of like a computer screen all of which was connected
somehow to the bracelet which is apparently giving some kind of medical
reading now another being held a small very thin almost wire thin rod with a BB
like object on the end which she stuck up her nose into her s sinus cavity and
looking at the screen be could see a vivid holographic image of her head the
inside of it could actually see this Rod being placed up inside her sinus
cavity she also believes at this point that they were not only implanting her but taking a blood
sample this was not particularly a pleasant experience for her as she says
I wanted to get out of there I wanted to move to get out of there but I couldn't get out of there I was so terrified to
be in that place so this is exam was fairly quick
after it they removed this bracelet likee device told her to get off the table and get dressed bet asked them who
they were why she and Deborah had been taken as far as she know they didn't answer or she doesn't remember them
answering but she did believe that they told her she wouldn't remember now one of the beings did stare
at her very closely and deeply without saying anything and Deborah reports the
same sort of thing and the next thing they knew they were back in the field without
knowing how they were returned UFO was gone they ran home inside their home
they found that they were very thirsty both consumed two glasses of water then two glasses of
juice so that's BET's recall Deborah Deborah's recall matches bets Deborah
recalls being taken up inside this craft via this beam of light she remembers being separated from her cousin and
taken into another room where she was placed on not so much a table but a
chair with her arms sort of strapped to the arms of the chair she saw that the
walls of this room had what looked like buttons and TV screens the ETS examined
Deborah's body with great interest and showed equal interest she said in her
clothes she says she believes they took a blood sample and the screens which she
didn't get a good look at but she believed they were showing the results of her physical
examination she said she could hear the ETS Talking In This Very rapid clipped
language to each other which she couldn't understand she did ask them what they wanted and why she was chosen
but she says the E did not answer at one point this chair sort of reclined into a
table and the exam continued now Deborah doesn't remember undressing
for this exam suddenly she was just without clothes and she also noticed that after
the exam she suddenly found herself dressed without knowing how her clothes were put back on so her recall does not
appear to be fully complete but the next thing she knew she and Deb uh she and
bet were walking home so that also record recalled other
experiences as a young child which began when she was around 9 years old when she
saw this black sort of globe shaped object hovering overhead it wasn't long
after that that she saw another gray being in her home at age 14 she had a
very interesting sighting where she saw lights hovering over a hill in front of her home and she actually waved to the
lights at which point one disappeared and suddenly reappeared right in front of her quite large
she saw a face of a gray appear and this ET asked her what do you want from us
and she replied I don't want anything and the ET sort of scolded her and said
well if you didn't want anything why did you call me and she said well I called
you as a joke she did not think they would respond but they did uh this entire conversation was
telepathic there is a lot more to BET's case
again this was investigated by Mario ronel who published this case in one of
his books but it's certainly a very interesting case I think that's a fairly
typical onboard encounter but certainly interesting I thought it was
particularly fascinating how bet one of the witnesses described how she could
see the inside of her body due to the ETS projecting the image of her head
that something that does turn up in a number of cases medical instruments that sort of show a holog holographic image
in live full color of what's going on inside a person's body I there's some
really interesting facets to that case for sure and it's pretty well verified
as well it's one of so so many cases that are going on on our
planet so those are the five cases I wanted to present to you today once
again they show exactly what it's like to have contact and this is just the tip
of the iceberg these five cases you could times that by a 100,000 easily and
you I still think there would be more cases uh most of course of which have
gone unrecorded unfortunately that's partly our own fault for allowing this government cover
up to go go on for so long thankfully that is changing we're seeing great
strides in moving towards truth and transparency still not convinced our
governments will ever be honest on this subject we have no real signs of it so
ultimately it's up to each of us every individual to do what they can to learn
about what's going on in our planet which is the primary reason why I do
these videos I also because they're just darn interesting this subject is so expansive
there's just so much to learn from it and when you look out and see all those stars at night there's no doubt that we
are not alone and it's awesome to know that we have people watching over us who
are much more advanced than we are and certainly have something to teach us so that's it for today I want to
thank you once again for watching in it's always very much appreciated I love
all of you very much and really am thankful that you join me each week for
this little show so until next time keep searching for the truth keep asking
those important questions most important of all keep having fun I will see you
next week bye now.
