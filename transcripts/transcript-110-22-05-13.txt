BOATERS BEWARE! UFOS ARE TARGETING BOATERS!
May 13, 2022

Summary:
May 13, 2022
UFOs are not only seen in the skies above us. They are also seen in our oceans. Researchers call them, "USOs" or unidentified submersible objects. And there are a lot of them!

USOs are seen all over the world, but one of the most active areas on our planet is off the coast of Southern California, specifically, the Santa Catalina and San Pedro Channel. This body of water has produced more than 150 documented cases of UFOs and USOs. With an average depth of about 3000 feet, and some areas one mile deep, there are plenty of places for USOs to hide.

Objects have been seen diving into the water, and flying out, sometimes both! One of the most interesting types of USO encounters are cases in which these craft have targeted boaters. There are nearly a dozen cases on record in which UFOs hover directly over boaters, or even more incredibly, precisely beneath them. Cases have been occurring for decades and are still happening today.

On July 10, 1955, the Washington family was in their boat thirteen miles off the coast of Newport Beach when a UFO appeared right over their boat and began to follow them. They called the Coast Guard who agreed to send out a plane to investigate. No sooner had they hung up the radio when the UFO darted away.

In July of 1987, a group of people were making a night-crossing from Catalina Island to Rancho Palos Verdes, when a UFO approached and again, stopped over their boat. With a very unusual appearance and making no sound, it was clearly not a conventional aircraft. 

On January 3, 2004, a gentleman by the name of Young Chyren was shocked to see a UFO hovering right over a sailboat only a short distance off the shore of Santa Monica. When the object remained in place, he quickly grabbed his camera and snapped a photograph, which clearly shows a metallic disc-shaped object, providing more evidence that UFOs are targeting boaters.

Even more compelling are those cases in which UFOs (or rather, USOs!) approach boats from underwater. A dramatic case occurred in the late 1980s to an anonymous electronics engineer who was sailing his fully equipped yacht to Santa Cruz Island when a massive, round, glowing, green craft targeted his boat and moved directly underneath it, causing his compasses, depth-sounders and electrical equipment to all fail at once.

Or consider the case of a gentleman who was sailing along the coast of Catalina Island at night when a gigantic square of glowing white light appeared under his boat, illuminating the water for hundreds of feet around him.

Or the case of a gentleman who was in the Channel Islands area when he saw what he first thought might be whales swimming under his boat. Then one approached closely and he saw that it wasn't a whale; instead it was a round, silvery metallic, saucer-shaped object. 

These are just a few of the many cases in which USOs are targeting boaters in the Santa Catalina channel. This video presents a chronology of these very interesting encounters, including one case in which a boat was actually sunk by a USO!

Why are UFOs targeting boaters? Are they curious? Are they trying to announce their presence? Where are these objects coming from? How many are there? What is the motive behind this very unusual aspect of UFO behavior? 

This video presents the best cases of boaters that have been targeted by USOs, and answers many of the questions surrounding these types of accounts.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal  
i call this episode boaters beware ufos are  targeting boaters as you may know I've been  
studying ufos and usos unidentified submersible  objects for many years particularly off the coast  
of southern california in the santa catalina  san pedro channel I've actually got cases from  
all over the world and several of these cases  involve ufos usos that are targeting boaters  
and I don't mean this in a negative way I don't  think they're trying to scare or hurt people  
but it's clear to me that they are curious  perhaps about boaters or perhaps are trying to  
show themselves on purpose it's a very interesting  aspect of ufo uso behavior so that's why I wanted  
to do this episode for you today first a bit of  background about the santa catalina san pedro  
channel which is where I focused a lot of my  research this is quite a large stretch of water  
it starts on the north and around  the santa barbara area the channel  
islands and moves all the way south past  rancho palos verdes to about san clemente  
and it's the stretch of water between catalina  island and the mainland and it's quite deep it's  
about three thousand feet average but parts of it  are up to five thousand feet deep almost a mile  
deep and I've collected about well 150 cases of  ufos and usos it's really more than that now but  
mile per mile it's easily one of the top producers  of uso reports in the world it's a very active  
area cases stretch back all the way to the 1920s  really up to the present day and in fact there's  
been some very interesting documentaries  on this area that have come out recently  
last year expedition x with josh gates did a study  of this area and was actually able to capture  
usos on film on three different occasions and  currently a brand new documentary a tear in  
the sky has just been released by the uapx team  and they've put forth a lot of time and effort  
in technology and have been able to capture some  very interesting evidence of activity in this area  
so this is why I wanted to do this episode today  as I said this is this type of activity of ufos  
usos targeting boaters I think shows a  very interesting aspect of uso behavior  
so let's just get started and the first case I  want to talk about occurred to the washington  
family on july 10 1955. this was at around 2  30 p.m in the afternoon when mr and mrs george  
washington and their 11 year old daughter  were 13 miles off the coast of newport beach  
on their way to canalita island on their yacht  miss washington was the first to notice a strange  
object hovering at about 2500 feet right over  their boat so they stopped their boat so they  
could better observe this object and using  binoculars they saw a quote perfectly round  
gray white craft it appeared to be rotating it was  surrounded by this strange haze or fog and after  
about six minutes of observation the washingtons  restarted their boat and continued their journey  
here's where it gets really interesting to their  amazement this object maintained its position  
directly over their boat and at this point mr  washington decided to radio the coast guard and  
he explained the situation and officials  at the coast guard were very interested  
and told him to keep this object in sight and  that they would launch a plane to investigate  
at that very moment this object rose upward in  a zigzag maneuver and disappeared off into the  
clouds and by the time the coast guard  plane arrived this object was long gone  
so this is a very interesting case it's clear  that this object was hovering over this boat  
intentionally what I find most interesting is that  it decided to take off at the moment mr washington  
alerted the coast guard don't know if that's a  coincidence or not but it's surely interesting  
this is a clear case of a ufo targeting a  boater and it's certainly not the only one  
a very similar case occurred in july of 1987 to  a group of people who were sailing from catalina  
to rancho palace verdes this was in the  wee hours of the morning around 4 00 a.m  
when they saw what they first thought was a plane  coming along the normal flight pattern that planes  
take to lax airport but as it approached several  strange details became apparent as one of the  
witnesses says I noticed no tail no wings and no  lights then it hovered over my sailboat making no  
noise and went towards catalina island and out of  sight so what's interesting here is it actually  
stopped and hovered directly over the boat again  apparently showing itself off perhaps when it did  
that one of the witnesses did notice strange  blue sparks coming off the bottom side of this  
object so clearly not a normal object and another  typical example of a ufo targeting a boater  
a really interesting case with photographic  evidence occurred on january 3rd 2004  
off the coast of santa monica this was during  the afternoon it was a bright sunny day  
and a gentleman by the name of young chiron was on  the beach when he observed this metallic disc-like  
object hovering he estimates a few thousand  feet directly above a yacht and this object was  
stationary in the sky so he quickly grabbed his  camera and snapped a photograph because he could  
estimate the apparent size of this yacht he  guesses that the ufo itself was quite large  
perhaps about 30 feet wide and after just a  few moments this object quickly darted away  
but again it's strange that it's hovering  directly over a boat so these are cases of ufos  
unidentified flying objects targeting boaters  but what's more interesting are cases in which  
these objects are actually under water and  target the boaters and consider what happened  
to the crew of the hattie d on february 5th  1964. they were sailing along making their way  
down the california coast they had  originally set sail from seattle washington  
and had reached the mendocino area um north of  where most of this activity is but certainly part  
of this whole complex of sightings when a very  strange incident happened they struck a metallic  
object which quickly sunk their boat there was 11  people on board and their boat sunk quite quickly  
they quickly got into the their emergency life  raft and notified the coast guard who rescued them  
and uh there was no evidence of this apparent  quote metal object which had struck their  
boat the boat itself sank quite quickly  so they weren't able to examine it  
but crewman carl jansen elaborated on the  incident and said I don't care how deep it was  
what hold us was steel and a long  piece there was no give to it at all  
so this was he doesn't think it was a log  or anything he's absolutely insistent this  
was a metallic object and ufo researchers at the  time seized upon this is the possible uso event  
so what it was uh is still unknown and this event  remains unexplained to this day it's certainly a  
unique event I don't know of any other case in  which a uso has struck a boat and caused it to  
sink but it's a good case of a uso encountering  a boater perhaps my favorite case of this kind  
occurred in the late 1980s to a senior electronics  engineer who wants to remain anonymous it was a  
foggy afternoon and he was setting sail from santa  barbara island and traveling to santa cruz island  
and during this short little trip he observed a  quote fluorescent green colored light ahead of  
him in the mist he first thought it was another  ship using bright lights to navigate the fog  
so as a responsible boater he stopped and waited  for it to pass but it continued to approach him  
and he was still unable to distinguish any detail  because of the fog but it was about a quarter mile  
away and heading directly towards him and this was  when the witness realized that this wasn't a boat  
at all and that this thing was under water as he  says and I quote I finally realized that this dumb  
thing was under water I'm guessing it was I don't  know maybe 300 feet in diameter but I couldn't get  
any vertical dimension on it because it was  under me in the water it literally passed  
directly underneath me this witness was sailing  a fully equipped 38-foot sailboat and as this  
object passed beneath him he was able to take  several brief readings from the death sounder  
and determine that this object was about 100  feet below him and at this point both the  
depth sounders quit functioning and the witness  checked his compasses and as he says all three of  
them were slowly rotating and I wasn't I tried  calling the coast guard and the radio was dead  
so this is a really good case involving  electromagnetic effects this clearly was not  
a submarine they don't travel right beneath  boats certainly at that depth and they don't  
affect compasses and radios and depth sounders  all of which malfunctioned in his case  
this point the object moved away and left  the witness pretty traumatized and frightened  
a later check on his equipment revealed  that the compass mountings were actually  
broken and as the witness says it was weird  I was just too goddamned petrified to move  
and this keeps happening in case after case  when people see these usos particularly in this  
area the santa catalina san pedro channel  it appears off in the distance and comes  
directly underneath their boat here's another case  involving an entire family which occurred on june  
15th 1982. it's quite a dramatic event this  family was sailing from the mainland to catalina  
the stepfather owned a construction company  and often rented a boat for the weekend  
to take his family to catalina where his  mother had a clothing store on the island  
and on this evening of june 15th the family of  three encountered strange lights in the deep water  
as one of the witnesses says around 8 pm my mother  yells to my stepdad to look over the port side  
and asked what is that I looked and I saw  a huge lighted object moving fast under the  
water my mother was very scared and went below  the witnesses were all mystified including the  
step-dad who was trained to identify craft  as the witness says he was in the navy for  
years and sailed all over the world and knows  ships and subs it lasted around five minutes  
just going from one side and then the next  in a criss-cross pattern so that is unusual  
the witnesses did their best to avoid this object  as they said we sailed west moving away from it  
as it moved east I never told anyone about this  nor do we talk about it my step-brother is in the  
navy and worked on an la class sub we talked one  night and he said just forget about it and to not  
go there but according to this witness the subject  was quite large as he says the object was 50 feet  
in a circle and bright more watts than I have  ever seen I am an electrician and work on lighting  
and this thing was bright and gave off heat so  this really quite frightened then the encounter  
left the family somewhat traumatized and the  effects of this encounter were long-lasting  
as the witness says my parents stopped sailing  after that summer I live less than 20 miles  
from the area and I still think about it all  the time a very strange situation to be in  
so many many cases like this what follows  is another typical case which occurred in  
july of 1988 right off the coast of  the catalina on the landward side  
a man an anonymous witness was making a knight  crossing to catalina island he was aiming for two  
harbors but when he reached the island he realized  that he had gone too far east so he turned west  
and was traveling along the catalina coast toward  two harbors when this weird uso targeted his boat  
as this witness says and I quote all of a sudden  the ocean lit up like a built-in pool about 100  
yards on both sides of me now I'm a night scuba  diver and I know how light goes underwater this  
was different the light was in a perfect square  besides the ocean lighting up right under my boat  
the light being in a square seemed odd to me this  was a fairly brief sighting as the witness says  
it lasted only about 15 seconds but when I reached  two harbors it seemed like I lost two hours I was  
very late I never thought much about the time  then so this could very well be more than just  
a sighting as I'm sure you know missing time is a  huge red flag pointing towards a possible on-board  
ufo experience the witness never investigated  that possibility in terms of hypnotic regression  
but it's something he did notice  and I think is an important  
detail in this case the witness says he never  actually saw any object just this white light  
in the shape of a square our rectangle and  at the time he had never even heard of usos  
and it wasn't until he heard of similar reports in  this area that he realized he had seen one himself
another really interesting case and the last  one I want to present to you today I heard from  
a caller in when I was doing the coast to coast  radio show with art bell and one of the gentlemen  
who was listening to the show called in to report  his own incredible encounter he had with multiple  
usos right off the channel islands off the coast  of santa barbara he was in a small boat in waters  
that were only a few hundred feet deep when he saw  large gray shapes flitting around beneath his boat  
and most of these were too deep for him to get  a good look at it and he assumed that these  
were fish you know large fish whales perhaps  dolphins he wasn't sure but occasionally some  
of these would come closer to the surface only to  dart back down again and he started to get very  
curious about it because these shapes were too  large to move that quickly and he was wondering  
you know is this marine life or could this be  something else so he kept looking at it and after  
several minutes of observing this activity he got  a real shock when one of these objects came up  
right under his boat and he was amazed to see that  this was an object artificial he said it was round  
in shape and appeared to be metallic and in  fact it looked like a typical flying saucer  
so this activity went on for the next hour  or so with these objects flitting around  
under his boat occasionally coming close  enough for him to see the saucer shape and  
after they finally departed he was still  left wondering exactly what he had seen  
but he did finally decide that these were usos  and that's why he wanted to call into the coast  
to coast radio show and share his encounter and  I'm glad he did because it's another typical case  
of usos and ufos targeting boaters again I  don't think this is necessarily nefarious  
uh behavior on the top part of the ufos I suspect  they are just showing themselves off on purpose  
but again that's pure speculation I did cover  these cases in my book undersea ufo base  
an in-depth investigation into uso  activity in the santa catalina channel  
and again this is a very active area and  the reason I wanted to do this video as I  
said earlier is because I think it shows a  very interesting aspect to ufo uso behavior  
and they're either showing themselves off or are  curious about these voters I don't know for sure  
but I think it's important that voters are aware  that this sort of thing could happen particularly  
in this area of the santa catalina san pedro  channel it's really fascinating this is a great  
area if you want to see ufos and that was another  reason I wanted to do this episode for you today  
i hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you once  again for watching I truly appreciate it and until  
next time keep searching for answers keep looking  for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
