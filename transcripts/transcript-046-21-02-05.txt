SEE A UFO - LOSE YOUR JOB
Feb 5, 2021

Summary:
Feb 5, 2021
It's unfortunate, but it's true. Many people have lost their job as the result of a UFO encounter. If word gets out that you have seen a UFO, or that you believe you have been taken onboard a craft, or even if you are merely interested in the subject, sorry -- you're fired! You are now unemployed. Pack your personal belongings. Your final check is in the mail.

Discrimination against UFO experiencers and investigators is a real problem in society. Experiencing a UFO encounter can be traumatic. But then witnesses sometimes have to deal with the additional trauma of being disbelieved or ridiculed, or actually losing their livelihood.

This problem is particularly acute among the police, whose job it is to watch out for anything unusual. And yet when they report something very unusual, what happens?...They're fired.

This video presents more than a dozen firsthand cases of people who were terminated from their place of employment for talking about UFOs. Police, doctors, pilots, politicians -- all have had their careers destroyed by getting too close to UFOs. And it's the denial of our own governments to admit the reality of UFOs that has caused this appalling situation.

The time is now for truth and transparency on the subject of UFOs. If you would like to explore more about these cases and others, check out my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three."

hello everyone my name is preston dent and i've got a great show for you today I think today's 
presentation is called see a ufo lose your job I know of many cases where this has happened 
people will see a ufo or they'll tell someone at work that they are an abductee or they'll 
express an interest in ufos or in researching this subject and as a result will lose their job 
this is really unfortunate because people already experience sometimes considerable trauma 
uh when they have a ufo encounter and then they have to go through the additional trauma of being 
disbelieved or ridiculed so that's why I wanted to do this video i've got about a dozen cases I want 
to share with you today and the first case I want to talk about real briefly actually is the travis 
walton case I don't want to get too into it because it's already pretty well known I think but 
for those who don't know on november 5 1975 travis walton and six other woodcutters were out in the 
sit graves uh national forest this is in arizona when they experienced a ufo encounter they all saw 
this object at treetop level travis got out of the truck and walked under this object and was struck 
by a beam of light and was actually pulled on board this craft again the case is very well known 
what's important here is that travis was missing for five days at which point there was a lot of
accusations that the other men had actually murdered him and were covering it up 
thankfully travis was returned and accusations continued that perhaps the men had concocted some 
sort of hoax to get out of their logging contract which is not true what is true is that they lost 
their job over this whole ufo incident their superior was a man by the name of junior 
and junior wilson makes it clear that yeah he had to let them go because the contract was not being 
fulfilled problem wasn't that they were being fired it was because they didn't they refused 
to go to work up in this area as junior wilson says of michael rogers who was the superior of 
you know the boss of travis walton and the others as junior wilson says and I quote he 
meaning michael rogers had no reason to hoax I didn't see that he had anything to gain as far as 
his contract was concerned to conjure up a story of this kind he did lose the contract later on 
because he couldn't get men to go back and work for him in that area  we did re-advertise the contract and resell it to another person so the point is here they lost 
their jobs over this entire ufo sighting and this is not uncommon this is what happened to 
a certified public accountant by the name of leah haley from pensacola florida 
she was a lifelong experiencer and had a had a lot of strange experiences  throughout her life but after two pretty intense missing time experiences she finally sought 
help and she found a hypnotherapist by the name of john carpenter who is a ufo researcher and using 
regressive hypnosis she recalled that she had been taken on board a ufo and physically examined 
it's a pretty long and involved case which I won't get too into here other than to say 
that leah haley's job suffered as a result of people at work finding out about her 
encounters at that time she worked as a certified public accountant 
and mind you leah haley was married had two children and had two masters degrees she had 
one master's in elementary education from alabama state university and she had a 
another master's degree in secondary education from tennessee university so a really good witness 
despite this she received a lot of ridicule from her co-workers and her superiors at her 
place of employment it just got worse and worse until they started to accuse her of being outright 
crazy and she was forced to resign her position so this is very unfortunate and happens in case 
after case um just look at what happened to police officer alan godfrey uh alan godfrey 
was a police officer in west yorkshire at the west yorkshire metropolitan police department 
in england and he was actually twice awarded for his investigative work at the police department 
so he was very well respected in his profession married had two children an upstanding member of 
the community but that all changed on november 29 1980 when he saw a ufo uh he was actually on duty 
in his police cruiser it was raining hard and he came upon a ufo ahead of him on the highway 
he whipped out his police sketch pad and actually drew this thing and reported it to his superiors 
he returned to the scene with other police officers and they saw that the road the highway 
where this object had hovered was completely dry so there was physical evidence of his encounter 
furthermore other calls came in reporting ufos on that night in the surrounding area 
despite this his fellow officers kind of started ribbing and ridiculing him and it 
just got worse and worse and when more calls came in reporting ufos uh the publicity ramped up about 
alan godfrey's sighting and his superiors were not happy and they eventually called alan godfrey into 
their office and said it would be best if alan godfrey would just resign ellen godfrey refused 
and as a result they punished him by taking away his police car and putting him on bicycle duty 
this is really insulting and as a result alan godfrey just couldn't take it anymore the ridicule 
had gotten too bad in this kind of treatment he had lost everything he loved about being a police 
officer so he just resigned so if sometimes people are actually forced into being resigned
into some sometimes people are just forced into resigning
and definitely people's careers do suffer particularly in the police force just look 
at what happened to officer manuel amparano he's a police officer from the city of kerman california 
who on may 13 1978 saw a ufo hovering at very low altitude was a solid object had lights on 
it he shined his flashlight at it at which point it flashed him back with white and blue lights 
he initially kept his sightings a secret didn't tell anybody however when he returned to the 
station his fellow officers wanted to know what was wrong with his face and it looked 
like it had been burned the officer looked in the mirror and saw that his face was bright red 
by the next day blisters were forming so he had to seek medical treatment and as a result 
received a lot of ridicule from other fellow officers and also from his superiors 
and as a result his career suffered as he says and I quote there's no question I was passed 
over for a promotion because of it as an officer I can go out see somebody shoot someone write a 
report and then send them to prison but something like this happens and all of a sudden i'm a nut 
so as you can see he's not happy and I don't blame them uh yeah the police office officers do suffer 
a lot from this another really tragic case is what occurred in port portage county ohio this 
was on april 17 1966 two police officers by the name of dale sparr and wilbur neff 
were driving along u.s highway 224 this is just outside of the town of atwater ohio 
and they saw a ufo it was appeared to be a solid object with a dome on top rise up from behind some 
trees I do have an interview that had a little audio clip that i'd like to play for you in which 
uh officer dale spohr talks about what he saw when this object rose up from behind the trees my name 
is dale f spore I am a deputy sheriff of portage county in vanna ohio day of april 1962 at 507 am
the locality of observation was in state route of 224 
east of state route 44 four miles ahead today four miles yes and west of 183 
i observed this vehicle for approximately 85 minutes weather conditions was clear 
was it done in the morning it was really good visibility was very good uh against 
this time like that we had no no fault pockets no problems with visibility at all
i observed this vehicle come up from a wooded area at a very low altitude it was 
just clearing the treetops at this time I observed it coming up very bright it was a 
very bright object it was larger than anything I had anticipated uh ever seeing in the air 
in this condition or anything it traveled very slowly it was only a faint hum in the 
area there was no noise no traffic on the highway beside us either to the right or
north or south of us there was no disturbances in the neighborhood just this humming noise
i was making a visual observation of the area  after stopping to check a car I thought to be abandoned i
told my partner or my rider at this time uh grover naft 
that I asked him if he would look over his shoulder to see if 
if he could see this thing at this time it was still moving very slowly coming up
he saw very clearly the object or vehicle or whatever you might want to call it craft or 
etc came just up the south side of the highway in an easterly direction it came to 
a pause or momentarily stop it then came directly north 
right over the two vehicles together the abandoned car in my police car it harbored I it was so 
bright I i could say that it was very close to us from 50 to not more than 100 feet above us
my first thoughts I was very scared I i didn't know exactly what was happening 
i didn't know what to expect I had the only feeling was to get something between 
me and whatever this thing was uh the only thing for me to go to or towards was 
the cruiser which when I started barney went the other way we got in the car
i was I sat there for a minute I i don't know exactly how long until I 
didn't seem to want to hurt us I tried the radio it did not malfunction it the carrier trip very 
well I informed the station that this object that had been cited was directly over us I did not 
try to fill them in or what was happening until I could make sure that my imagination hadn't 
exploded I uh at this time after advising them of this object I gave the message to the dispatcher 
the vehicle moved just to the north side of the road it paused or hesitated momentarily 
it then crossed back over the road almost in the identical spot uh it uh moved over to the vehicles 
right and then the uh you could hear this one humming noise it did change at the pitch of it
i don't know how to explain it it  did change tones as though it might have gone into a slight higher pitch if you had one of 
these music things like when I was in school a long time ago right I forgot the name of it
um increased its altitude uh and moved eastward in an easterly direction at about the same time 
it moved around 253 250 300 feet just east of us and hesitated at this time sergeant schoenfeld 
came on the radio wanted to know if we were still observing this object I informed him that we were 
watching him and he wanted to know if we had a camera I told him no he says that we should try to 
observe the vehicle try to pursue it or stay with it as long as possible keep it under surveillance 
report any findings that we found anything that we might identify to prove or disprove 
it to see if it was a balloon until he could get some units in the area 
a photographer or another unit or with photographic equipment  or a hold of one of the police departments that this thing might be traveling towards 
we started out behind the vehicle it made no attempt to leave us immediately or anything 
we went due east on 224 we had to make a south turn on 183 for a distance to pick up 224 again 
when making the south turn the vehicle was directly to our rear window
we went to 224 and 183 again we turned left which would put us in an easterly direction 
the vehicle was to our left it was immediately to our left as though this thing had hesitated again 
i couldn't uh say that it actually stopped and waited to see where we were going 
but I had a handful of car the vehicle or this object or whatever it was at this time 
started at easterly direction again was very clear it seemed to maintain the course 
for approximately three quarters to a mile it then came due south and it moved off the 
east direction and went south came south over top of 224 remained on the south side of 224 
to just about the berlin reservoir at this time it was traveling at 83 miles an hour
so after this object rose up it goes down the highway it goes all the way down highway 224 
and they follow it at points it would move very quickly and they chased it at upwards of 100 
miles per hour and when it started to get too far away it seemed to slow down almost as if to wait 
for them another thing they found very peculiar was the way the ufos seemed to always fly over 
the roads so that they could follow them almost as if as if it was baiting them and edging them on 
so they are not the only police officers who sought police officers actually from six  other stations throughout ohio and pennsylvania saw it as well officer wayne houston heard them 
talking on the radio and was actually able to park along the highway and wait for this 
object and saw it move overhead and he joined the chase another officer gerald buckert was 
able to actually photograph this object so this is very well attested to very well documented 
these two police officers dale spohr and wilbur neff chased this object for 
over an hour for over a distance of some 60 to 80 miles moving from the town of atwater outside 
of atwater ohio down highway 224 down highway 14 across to highway 51 all the way to conway 
pennsylvania so I mean they chased this thing all the way until they ran out of gas so this is 
again a very well attested sighting despite this they received an incredible amount of 
ridicule and ribbing in the press and the pressure on them became just way too much 
particularly for dale's four by after three months had passed his life was 
turned completely upside down as he says my entire life came crashing down around my shoulders 
my wife my home my children all seemed to fade away and in fact by july of 1966 three months 
after this incident spore was separated from his wife he lost his job he resigned and he 
moved to another town he lived in a little hotel room and made a very meager living as a painter 
and was very bitter about what had happened to him as he says and I quote if I could change all 
that I have done in my life I would change just one thing and that would be the night we chased  that damn thing that saucer and he's not the only police officer who suffered because of that 
particular incident patrolman wayne houston who also joined in the chase also regrets 
going public and being involved in this incident as only a few months after the encounter he 
resigned as he says I quit because of that thing there was pressure you couldn't put your finger on 
it but it was there for one thing the city officials did not like the police officers  chasing flying saucers the whole incident was in fact investigated by officers from project 
blue book jay allen heineck found the officers very convincing over the head of project blue book 
hector quintanilla came in already skeptical and called it a mirage talked to the witnesses 
for only a few minutes and labeled the case as a satellite and venus he 
says that the officers were chasing nothing more than a satellite way high up in the sky 
and of course that doesn't account for it so we also included venus it's pretty ridiculous and 
really unfortunate that police officers have to go through this and there are so many cases like it 
another really tragic case involving a police officer is that of police chief jeff greenhaw 
he is from foxville alabama in october 17 1973 he was the chief of police when he received 
a phone call from a resident of falkville saying that a ufo had landed near her home 
and so he went out to investigate he brought his polaroid camera and he didn't see any ufo 
however as he's researching the area and driving around he came upon a metallic suited figure 
it looked essentially humanoid uh but had this metallic suit that was very bright and crinkly 
kind of like tin foil but wasn't tinfoil he said and he quickly grabs his camera and is able to 
snap four photographs of this thing before it starts moving away and he said it moved in very 
large loping strides and it looked like yeah it had a metallic suit on as he says it looked like 
his head and his neck were kind of made together he was real bright something like rubbing mercury 
on nickel but just as smooth as glass different angles gave different lighting I don't believe 
it was aluminum foil he ran in a bizarre way he seemed to have springs in his feet for propulsion 
and could cover about three meters in every step he was running faster than any human I ever saw 
so the encounter was televised as were the photographs and as a result jeff green hall's 
entire life went into a tailspin what first happened is he started receiving phone threats 
following that his car engine mysteriously exploded he believes there may have been 
foul foul play his wife couldn't take the pressure and she divorced him following that his 
house was burned down allegedly by an arsonist and to put the final straw
and the final nail in the coffin the local town council fired him from his position 
as police chief so it basically ruined his life as jeff greenhaw says and i'm quoting 
now i've lost my car my wife my job and my home
so clearly this is a real problem in the ufo field and here's another really tragic case this 
was actually the case that got me involved in ufo research it occurred on november 17 1986 and the 
main witness is captain kenju taroshi captain taroshi was flying over alaska with his crew 
in a commercial airliner when they encountered two very large walnut-shaped ufos appeared on 
their on-board radar that also appeared at the faa's ground radar which they later denied and 
called it split images researchers now know that that's not true it was caught on radar 
they've talked to the people who are actually involved in the incident  in terms of the radar returns so we know it's a great case uh captain kenju toroshi actually 
requested a course change to try to avoid this ufo the course change was granted but 
the ufo still followed them for many miles over a period of about an hour and finally just took off 
so in this case captain taroshi had no choice but to talk about the encounter because he had 
already officially reported it to the faa and captain taroshi granted press interviews and 
talked about it to the public and it became front page news I remember it vividly but as a result 
captain taroshi lost his job he was grounded from flight duty by j.a.l airlines 
and he was put on a government desk job and that's where he remained for many years 
it's my understanding that he was later able to get back to flying  but there's no doubt that his having gone public hurt his career and that he was grounded because 
of it most pilots have learned not to talk about ufos as we'll find out but it's not just being 
a ufo witness that can get you fired just if you express an interest in ufos or ufo research that 
alone can get you fired just look at what happened to dr s scott carter md from ottawa kansas 
dr corder uh began investigating ufos and particularly the case of donna 
butz a contactee from russell kansas they actually together would write a book about her case 
entitled the for at any rate when the kansas board of healing arts found out that one of their own 
doctors was involved in ufo research and believed in ufos they began to pressure him to resign 
he refused they had no way to actually fire him so they requested that he take a psychological 
evaluation dr corter refused and said that they had no legal grounds to force him to do so 
and that was true but they contin continued to request that he take a psychological evaluation 
dr corder continued to refuse and finally on march 13th 1989 the kansas board of 
healing arts revoked dr scott corter's medical license on the grounds that he was mentally ill 
so dr corder now realized that he had to fight back if he wanted to keep his job and that's 
what he did he immediately went public with his case and in 1990 just a few months later 
he filed a civil suit and suing sued for damages in the amount of 669 
thousand dollars to help his case he did agree to undergo a psychological evaluation 
and he was found actual actually to be of sound mind he was not insane he was totally sane 
and of a normal mental competence so as a result of this uh test the kansas board of 
healing arts had no choice but to reverse their position and uh in 199 in 1992 in april of 1992 
the kansas board of healing arts reinstated dr corter's medical license uh dr corder of 
course had sued for damages and as the result of his case he received a judgment in june of 1993 
and the judge was frank thiess and frank thiess ruled that the law exempts state officials from 
any liability but in a very detailed 79 page document judge thief wrote in part and i'm quoting 
if anything is certain clearly and undeniably from the evidence dr corder was damaged from 
his encounter with his licensing body the kansas board of healing arts with little if any fault 
on his part but a profound naivete of the power of government over his person and his profession
so once again we have a very clear warning to be very careful going public with your ufo encounter 
or even an interest in ufos uh just look at what happened to city councilwoman francis barwood in 
march of 1997 francis barwood was was a city councilwoman in phoenix arizona and this is 
when the very famous phoenix lights incident occurred I won't get into it because it's a very 
well-known incident and francis barwood herself didn't even see it but a few months after the 
encounter she was a pro approached by the media who begged for an interview which she granted 
and the media wanted her to investigate the phoenix lights incident 
and she asked what it was and they told her about the sighting and told her that they 
could not get any officials from any level of government within municipal government or federal 
government to talk about it she was the only one who would even talk to them so she agreed 
to investigate and she actually asked her fellow council members to draft resolution to inquire 
federally about this at the office of senator mccain and they refused  barwood found herself in the middle of a firestorm she started receiving floods of calls from people 
reporting ufos she became a magnet for all the ufo reports and literally got hundreds 
of calls and she says there were 37 the first day after that it climbed into the hundreds 
i got calls from doctors lawyers celebrities a little league coach called to say both teams and 
their family had seen this most wanted their names kept out of it but they wanted answers 
heck if I had seen it i'd wanted answers too she eventually did contact the office of the governor 
fife symington who denied any knowledge of the incident uh which we now know is not true he 
was lying he actually saw the phoenix lights himself unfortunately for whatever reason he 
lied to francis barwood she also contacted senator mccain who was unable to get any 
information on the subject so she was basically stonewalled at every angle 
when she tried to investigate this officially and she wondered if this there was perhaps a cover-up 
and she voiced this publicly and that's when her career really began to suffer as she says 
and i'm quoting it was about this time that some very peculiar things regarding the lights and the 
government's reports concerning them became obvious and that I was cast as a total flake 
the reports that bothered me the most and probably solidified my resolve to  get to the bottom of this were the contradictory reports offered by the phoenix police department
so yeah this is very unfortunate that uh she was forced to grab the bull by the horns no one else 
would and as a result her career suffered she was not re-elected backed 
as a city councilwoman she tried to get back into arizona politics and later ran for arizona 
secretary of state unfortunately the media which had ridiculed her in the past continued to sort of 
ridicule her and called her the ufo candidate and as a result of this probably this ufo connection 
she did not win the seat she lost the election so I think politicians have learned long ago that 
ufos are a real hot potato and they stay away from it as best as they can 
but this can definitely hurt your profession just look at what happened to officer chuck zukowski 
chuck zukowski had been interested in ufos and the paranormal and bigfoot and all these things his  whole life and had never made a secret of this and for many years had been employed 
at the el pas paso county police department in colorado however in 2010 things started 
to go south when he investigated an animal mutilation case and chuck zukowski had become a 
pretty well-known investigator and granted a media interview he had done this investigation into this 
animal mutilation as a private citizen which he made very clear however in the media reports they 
also let the people know that chuck was a reserve police officer and this is when the 
trouble began because chuck zukowski's superiors uh dis disagreed with chuck's position on this 
animal mutilation uh chuck believed it was a genuine animal mutilation and they did not 
so for this reason and because he was investigating ufos they terminated his 
position and they made no secret about it they said in his termination termination letter 
and I quote the termination is a result of you conducting paranormal and ufo investigation 
and animal mutilations whatever the case it cost chuck his job thankfully chuck uh was able to 
become a very prominent ufo investigator and actually had his own television series uh it 
was called alien highway uh I had the honor of being on one of the episodes and I met him 
personally and spoke with him and I know him to be a very nice and definitely a competent person 
so it's unfirst unfortunately people's careers are suffering because of even investigating ufos 
one very tragic case just like this is that of john mack md john mack is of course very 
well known for writing the book abduction which came out in 1993. john mack is the first person 
with a pulitzer prize to actually write a book on ufos he's also a tenured professor of psychology 
at harvard medical school or was at the time he's now passed away unfortunately but he studied some 
200 abduction cases over a number of years and wrote about them in his book abduction and it was 
shortly after publication that he started to be investigated by the dean 
of the medical school at harvard uh what happened was the dean of harvard medical school daniel 
c tosteson actually appointed a committee of max piers to quote confidentially review 
john mack's interests and investigations into ufos this was something that had never happened 
before to a harvard professor and john mack himself found out about this investigation 
through the grapevine and called it kafkaesque he actually did not take this sitting down he 
fought back he hired an attorney by the name of daniel sheehan who was actually pretty well 
known in the ufo field and daniel sheehan was actually able to obtain the report on john mack 
which was criticizing john mack and it was really interesting what uh the dean of harvard wrote and 
this about john mack as he's as the dean says or as this committee this report says and i'm quoting 
it is professionally irresponsible for any academic scholar or practicing psychiatrist 
to give any credence whatsoever to any personal report of a direct personal contact 
between a human being and an extraterrestrial being until after the person has been subjected 
to every possible available battery of standard psychological tests which might conceivably 
explain the report as the product of some known form of clinical psychosis to communicate in any 
way whatsoever to a person who has reported a close encounter with an extraterrestrial life  form that this experience might well have been real is professionally irresponsible 
so yeah that's quite a mouthful uh once this thing became public other 
professors within the academic community at harvard really began to question the validity 
of this investigation and it wasn't long after that that it was shut down john mack was 
investigated for about one year and two months and following the investigation john mack was 
censured for quote methodological errors which i'm not sure what that even means you know I guess 
they didn't not like the way he was researching not so much what he was researching so it looks 
like there's they're doing a little bit of back pedaling in this situation important here is that 
john mack was not fired and was able to keep his position as a tenured professor at harvard 
college so this kind of prejudice is nothing new to dr john mack he had come across it many times 
with his own clients and now he had experienced it himself and as john mack writes in a quote 
i found that the higher or the greater the stake that a person has in this society in their 
position or their job the more reluctant they are to admit that they've had abduction experiences 
when abductees went on television with me during the spring of 1994 during my book tours 
and wanted to communicate and educate about it a number of them received threats to their jobs some 
of them lost them we have one man in a management consultation he lost an important contract 
a woman that worked for the federal government who was an abductee she was threatened with loss of 
her jobs in other words this is not something that is regarded as acceptable i've introduced airline 
pilots who have had sightings close-up sightings of ufos they will not report it because they will 
be removed from their work even if they've had abduction experiences they will not talk about it 
and 25 to 30 percent of airline pilots according to a survey that one of the people i've talked 
with did have had close-up sightings but will not discuss it this simply is something that is 
not accepted as okay to talk about but that may be changing I recently saw a harvard divinity student 
and I asked him this question I said do you talk about this among your fellow students and he said 
oh yes and it turned out several of them have also had abduction experiences and even the ones 
that had not were fascinated interested and didn't ridicule them so maybe the climate is changing
another researcher who's looked into this is kevin randle he's pretty well known in the ufo field 
certainly and he was contacted by a professional who had contact had had ufo contact while 
on the job and this had happened on many occasions but he never told his superiors as he told 
uh kevin randle well here's kevin randle and i'm quoting he was sure that if he reported them his 
superiors would deem him unworthy of his position or more to the point that he was crazy because as 
we all know only crazy people or drunks see ufos I suggested that very few people had ever lost a job 
because they had reported ufos well as we know that's perhaps not true as we've seen a number of 
people have lost their jobs because of reporting ufos and in fact kevin randle admits that people's 
careers have in fact suffered as he writes in his article ufo sightings in job security 
and i'm quoting I know stories of air for air force pilots who reported ufos and have been taken 
off flight status I knew of one case where an air force reserve officer had not only reported 
a landed ufo but also had seen a member of the flight crew that is an alien and while 
he didn't lose his reserve position because of it the air force worked very hard to smear him 
so yeah people's careers are suffering as we can see kevin randle reports that his 
personally his own career hasn't suffered and in fact has flourished and he's gotten several 
high-level security clearances despite being a ufo researcher as he says and I quote i've 
always thought that my relatively high profile in the ufo community would make me a target 
for some sort of repercussions but it didn't and I think that's true in a lot of cases I 
mean I myself have never suffered any replication repercussions all my bosses and i've had a number 
of them have been fine with my research into ufos but then again i'm just a lowly bookkeeper 
i don't i'm not a pilot for a major airliner or a professor at harvard so I think perhaps 
that is a factor what kind of job you have at any rate I did do a study of these cases I collected 
a bunch of them for my book not from here volume three and uh yeah I talk about all of these cases 
in that book and this unfortunate consequence of losing your job as the result of a ufo encounter 
and that's really the main reason why I wanted to do this video because this is tragic and we 
need to make sure that this stops happening I do think that people who have a higher level position 
certainly have a lot more to lose as the result of going public and probably are at greater risk 
as well for people questioning their mental competence but this is definitely a problem 
within the ufo field and something people should be aware of before they start telling others about 
their ufo encounter or if they think they're an abductee or if they're even interested in ufos 
and another reason I really wanted to do this video and you know research this particular topic 
was because of what's happening with police officers and pilots and security personnel 
and people's whose job it is to be a trained observer and look out for anything unusual 
it's their job to look for anything like this and yet they're not allowed to report it 
that makes no sense at all and because of that I think any numbers we have of the actual number of 
ufo sightings is probably vastly underestimated I am sure a lot more people are seeing ufos 
than go public because they are afraid of ridicule of disbelief and of losing their jobs 
and as we've seen this does actually happen so that's why I wanted to do this video today I hope 
you've enjoyed it once again thanks for listening and keep having a good time and keep having fun
