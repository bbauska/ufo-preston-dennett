THREE VERY CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

Most UFO encounters are simple sightings. Sometimes, however, UFOs get very close. In these cases, 
what starts out as a sighting transforms into face-to-face contact with the unknown. Accounts like 
these provide far more information than just a sighting.

This video presents three cases of very close encounters with UFOs. When UFOs get this close, there 
is virtually no possibility of misidentification. 

Case One: Three children are walking near their home in Mount Olive, Louisiana when a UFO drops 
down from the sky, hovers twenty feet over their heads, and strikes them with a beam of light.

Case Two: Four teenagers drive up a winding dirt road into the mountains of San Dimas, California 
and are confronted by a gigantic UFO which has landed in a field. Surrounding the craft are several 
strange figures, one of whom approaches them.

Case Three: Two young friends sitting outside a library in Koreatown, California watch as a saucer-
shaped craft drops down from the sky and hovers over the powerlines. The mother of one of the 
girls arrives to drive them home, and the UFO follows them over their car, beginning an ordeal 
that they will remember for the rest of their lives.

These three cases of very close encounters show how quickly a sighting can become something much 
more complicated. Each of these unique and fascinating accounts has something profound to teach 
us about UFOs and these strange extraterrestrial visitors to our planet.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the 
paranormal today's episode is called three very close encounters sightings are very interesting 
but even more interesting to me are cases in which ufos approach very closely and that's 
what i'd like to talk about today I have three cases I think you probably haven't heard before 
and each of them involve very close encounters the first involves a group of young teenagers 
who were approached by a ufo and struck by a beam of light and one of them was very nearly abducted 
the second case involves four young adults who came upon a landed ufo and humanoids 
and the third case involves two teenage girls and one of their mothers who were actually chased by 
a ufo and experienced missing time each of these cases has something unique I think to contribute 
to our understanding of the ufo phenomena and that's why I wanted to do this video so let's just 
get started and the first case I call abducted by aliens almost this case took place in 1989 in the 
small rural town of mount olive louisiana the main witness is charmaine scott and also her sister and 
friend so how this happened was one summer evening in 1989 charmaine her sister and their friend 
roy were walking home along with their little dog sheila they had just approached charmaine's house 
when something very strange happened a ufo came swooping down right over their heads it was a 
bright circular object about 30 feet in diameter it swooped down zigzagged a few times and then 
hovered about 20 feet directly above the three witnesses charmaine was about 11 years old at 
the time and it completely stunned her all three of the witnesses were actually quite frightened 
as charmaine says it was the circular light kind of big maybe about the size of a doughboy pool 
that you stand up in and swim in it was hovering over me and it was making this buzzing noise 
at this point several things happened at once all three witnesses stared upwards in amazement 
at this object their little dog sheila took off running into charmaine's house at the same time 
charmaine's mother appeared at the kitchen window looked up at the object saw it hovering over her 
two daughters and roy and she began banging on the kitchen window for them to come inside 
all three witnesses turned to run and that's when this object sent down a powerful beam of light 
and the other two managed to escape this beam of light but charmaine was struck full on 
and became instantly paralyzed as she says I was looking up that's all I remember looking up 
and I couldn't hear like my mom I could hear in the distance but not loud like she was muted just felt like nothing like everything was gone I don't know it felt like 
everything was okay for that one moment like peace I don't know how to describe it it was just this 
definite feeling that everything was okay and beautiful but I couldn't see anything there was 
just this feeling was like I was stuck looking up like in a trance kind of thing it was pleasant 
it was bright but it was pleasant I didn't want to look down it was a really dreamy like state 
so charmaine feels like she was actually paralyzed but she didn't care all her fear which had been so 
strong before was now completely gone and she felt really good and while she could hear her mother 
screaming and her sister and roy screaming at her she didn't care all that really mattered was that 
one moment and she just stood there completely entranced and the world seemed very far away 
when suddenly charmaine's sister reached into the beam of light grabbed her arm and pulled her out 
and the instant she was out of the beam of light charmaine's fear returned instantly 
and all three children ran quickly into the house screaming at this time the beam of light retracted 
this object moved over the house over the woods in the backyard and then darted upwards really 
quickly straight up into the sky and was gone the three witnesses looked at each other in shock 
i could hardly believe what had happened it was obvious to all of them they had seen a ufo charmaine's mother wanted to talk about it but the kids did not want to discuss it 
they very nearly called the police but in the end decided not to it was just a very shocking 
event and the next day they did find physical evidence looking out in their backyard 
where this ufo had hovered before taking off straight up a tree had been knocked down 
so they think probably this ufo caused this tree to be knocked down none of the children had any 
physical effects from this encounter but the emotional effects were long lasting they talked 
about it for quite some time and none of them ever forgot it charmaine felt like she was very 
nearly abducted and I agree with her I think it came that close and if her sister hadn't pulled 
her out of this beam of light she may have been taken on board this is one of very few cases that 
i've investigated or even read about where someone was able to avert an abduction from happening 
so yeah it's a very interesting case a very close-up of encounter involving 
this beam of light and another interesting detail is how this beam of light caused her fear to evaporate this is something i've heard in a number of other cases 
so these are very powerful beams of light and yeah an interesting case with some unique elements 
second case I want to talk about I call a ufo landing with humanoids this took place in 
1973 in san dimas california there's a golf course in san dimas and this incident took place 
in the mountains just above the san dimas golf course it involves four witnesses young adults 
aged around 17 to 22. there was gary and his three friends tom stan and suzanne 
these are pseudonyms they did not want their real names used uh but what these uh young adults would 
often do is hike up into these mountains above the san dimas golf course where there was this little 
valley which was not visible from below because it sort of dipped into the mountainside there it was 
a secret little place that they enjoyed hanging out there was a long dirt road that switched 
backed up this mountain was a difficult road and not easily accessible but this is where they spent 
many hours just hanging out as gary says we've been up there many times it's a really tough 
road to get up to so we had a really hard time getting there but once you get up there it's a meadow that sits back underneath huge oak trees we'd always go up there and have a good time 
on this particular summer night in 1973 they went up to this particular spot 
and were shocked at what they found as gary says we get up around the turn and we see a bunch of 
lights probably three or four they were huge and they were never there before we pulled up to where 
we normally stopped and this is when they realized that there was something at the far end of the 
field and it was huge it was much bigger than any normal vehicle much bigger than a helicopter 
whatever it was it was very large the brights the lights that were on it were so bright that they 
couldn't really discern a shape but there was what appeared to be a scaffolding around the object 
and they could see the silhouettes of three or four tall figures human looking figures as far 
as they could tell but this was clearly unusual and instantly they could tell that there was 
i mean this just couldn't be explained as any conventional object 
as gary says there was something not right about it there was no way something of that size could 
have ever gotten up there there's no way that thing just dropped in there and there were four 
figures walking along a railing I was actually having a hard time believing what I was seeing
this thing was so bright that yeah they could only see silhouettes they estimate it was about 
250 feet away from them and this object was large enough to extend across the whole field 
and as gary says that was the thing that scared me the most so they jumped out of their car 
and stood right next to it watching this thing trying to figure out what it could possibly be 
and at first whoever was in this object or around this object didn't seem to notice that they had an 
audience and gary and his friends were trying to figure out what these guys were doing as gary says 
it was like they were doing normal maintenance or a routine thing there was no hurrying no 
panic in the whole situation it's kind of weird we stood there for a long time and watched it 
we were checking things out and then all of a sudden a figure started coming toward us 
we could see him just walking right toward us so gary and his friends were a tough bunch 
they didn't frighten easily he said but as this figure started walking towards them they started to get really nervous and they shouted out to this figure who are you 
what are you doing what another one of them said why are you here who are you I started shouting 
out all these questions and this figure did not respond it didn't answer in any way but continued 
to walk at a measured pace toward the boys and whoever this was they could see now that it was a 
very tall very large figure and seemed somewhat threatening and menacing particularly because 
this figure was not responding so gary shouted out something is not right about this 
and his friend stan said let's get the hell out of here at that point gary had walked off a short 
distance and was trying to get a better view but now that this figure was coming close all four of 
them panicked they quickly piled into the car and took off as gary says we got into the car and got 
out of there so fast we went down the same small skinny road that just winds back and forth 
there's no way anything like that could have ever gotten to that place so they drove down this road as fast as they could and went straight to the police station 
they found actually a police officer patrolling the san dimas uh golf course in his cruiser and 
they excitedly told this officer what they had seen and begged him to go check it out 
and the officer could see that they were very emotionally shaken so he agreed to go 
investigate and while he drove off up this road the boys returned to their home and later that 
evening gary called the sheriff's station and asked for this officer and the officer said that 
yes he had grown up driven up to this location and didn't find anything at all so the very next day 
gary and his friends drove up to this same location that next morning and as gary said 
there was nothing it was wild they found no evidence of any landing trace cases 
no evidence at all that anything had been up there but whatever it was it was huge 
all of them are convinced that this was not a military craft of any kind it was far too large 
it was totally silent uh these humanoid figures they don't know if these were 
you know regular humans or ETs or what but there was just too many weird things about this for 
it to be something normal as gary says it was really scary it was such an intense thing it was 
it was really crazy there was nothing fun about it we kept on saying who are you what do you want 
and they never answered us it was amazing you'd think if it was military they would have answered 
that's the part that kind of gets to me so yeah they are convinced they come came upon a landed 
ufo with humanoids and I tend to agree it's a very strange case these two above cases I 
did present in my book wondrous and i've got a third case that i'd like to present to you 
which is also very very strange and I call this third case chased by a ufo
this occurred many years ago in 1958 there are three main witnesses dorothy 
hudson age 16 her friend carol and dorothy's mom dorothy senior and this took place in korea town 
in southern california specifically at the pio pico library in koreatown and what happened is 
uh two teenagers dorothy and her friend carol would often go to the library to hang out and have fun read and that's what they were doing on this evening and their mom 
dropped them off at the library and as they were going into the library carol happened to look up 
and saw this weird glowing object way way high up in the sky and she looked at it and 
although it was very much like a star it was much brighter than a star and uh it scared her a little 
bit because she got the weird feeling that it was looking at her but she didn't uh really know what 
to think she mentioned it to dorothy and dorothy saw it too and they just kind of shrugged and went 
into the library hung out for a couple of hours the library closes at nine o'clock and uh they 
their mom was scheduled to pick them up at precisely nine o'clock when the library closes and uh they wanted to smoke a cigarette secretly before their 
mom arrived so they snuck out of the or not snuck out they left the library about 10 minutes before 
9 to smoke a cigarette before dorothy's mom showed up and this is when this object appeared
and they saw this star-like object and suddenly this star-like object drops down 
out of the sky very quickly and hovers right over the telephone wires across the street 
and i'll just let dorothy describe what happened in her own words as she says 
the library closed at nine o'clock and we came out of the library at about a quarter to nine to wait 
for my mom to pick us up and as we were sitting there we saw this light up in the sky and whatever 
it was kept getting bigger and bigger until all of a sudden it came down and it was hovering above 
the street over the library we sat there and we looked at it and we didn't know what it was 
it had a lot of lights on it and it was still there was no noise coming from it but the lights 
were moving around it either the lights were blinking off and on or it was moving in a circular 
motion the object was very very big it was huge and we just sat there and looked at it it was 
as big as a house but it was round perfectly round the lights were red yellow and white 
and they were either blinking off and on or they were moving around like a lid on a bottle 
the closest thing i've seen to it was in that movie close encounters that was the closest thing 
the mother ship but it was nowhere near that size but that was the closest thing when I saw that 
movie I said that looks almost exactly like what I saw when I was a kid carol of course saw it too 
and gave a vivid description as carol says all I remember is we were at the library and I saw 
it before we went in there and it was really small and shiny it was staying up in the sky 
and we went into the library and when we came out it was still there I don't know what it was really
and uh at this point uh this is when dorothy's mother showed up as dorothy's mother says 
the girls were at the library and I went to pick them up and I saw this thing and they said look 
it's up there and I thought it was like a light but it wasn't a round light like when you look out 
on the horizon it looked like a flat light I mean that's the only way I know how to explain it it 
just kind of stayed in place how can I explain it to you it was like if you had a plate that was all 
lit up it was shining from the top and the bottom but it just stayed in place like it was hovering 
none of them felt any fear at this point as dorothy says neither one of us felt any 
type of fear or anything we were just perplexed as to what it was about five minutes after we 
saw it it didn't move it was just hovering over the street in front of the library my mom's car 
pulls up and so we jumped in the car and I said mom look at that what is that and she said 
i don't know what it is it's probably a helicopter I said no it's not a helicopter look how big it 
is it's round it doesn't have any propellers or anything and she said well I don't know what it is 
so at this point they start to drive home and this is when they realize it is actually following them 
and as dorothy says we live maybe a mile a mile and a half from the library and this object 
followed us all the way home over the car there was no noise no nothing and I remember my mom her 
getting a little nervous carol and I were sitting in the back seat and we kept looking out at it 
we pulled up in front of the house and my mom said just get out of the car and get into the house 
dorothy's mom confirms this and she says I was driving the kids home and I could hear 
them talking in the back seat it's following us it's following us but you know how mothers 
are when they work and they're tired they don't pay too much attention carol of course 
also remembers this object following them home and as she says it followed us home
and when we came out it followed us home and when we got to her house it was there we could still 
see it it was like it followed us home it was weird because it seemed like it followed us home 
at this point the object zipped away and it must have been around this time that they had 
missing time and as dorothy says at this point now we were really wondering what the heck 
it was but I never felt any fear I don't know if my mom or my girlfriend carol did 
so we got out and went into the house carol came into the house with me we came back out a few 
minutes later and it was still out there hovering way above the trees how high I have no idea I was 
a kid at the time so I don't know how high it was but then all of a sudden like a bat out of hell 
it just took off it went whoosh I mean it was gone from a big object to a tiny little object 
in the sky and it just went away at that point I went in and I remember looking at the clock and 
it was exactly 10 o'clock now my mother picked us up an hour before at nine o'clock at the library 
maybe five minutes after nine and it takes only ten maybe fifteen minutes to come home and when 
i went back into the house carol and I stayed in the house about five or ten minutes and then we 
went back outside there's a whole half an hour in there someplace maybe 20 25 minutes where I 
don't know what you know I don't remember anything how did it get to be 10 o'clock so quickly so this 
missing time aspect uh confused her but at the time she didn't think much about it as she says 
as dorothy says my mom was supposed to pick us up at nine o'clock and carol and I went out 
earlier than eight o'clock and uh she was always on time she picked us up probably exactly at nine 
and the next time I remember looking at the clock was after we got into the house which was supposedly 15 minutes later and after I got into the house and went running around and looking 
out the window and everything all of a sudden I looked at the clock and it said 10 o'clock and I said to carol do you know it's 10 o'clock already and she said you're 
kidding I said no it's 10 o'clock already and carol said well i'm supposed to be home at 10. 
i said well you better go home because it's 10 o'clock now we didn't know what happened to the 
time but we never would have thought about it that much it wasn't until some time later when 
i was older and I talked to mom and carol about it and we said yeah that was a strange incident 
it upset upset carol quite a bit and in fact she begged dorothy and uh dorothy's mom to 
watch her carefully as she walked home which was just a few blocks away or a few houses away 
to make sure that she got home safely so this totally freaked her out as as carol says 
i remember that we got home I think I went in her house for a minute and then I came out and I ran on home because I remember it is still up in the sky and I said i'm going home and I ran home 
i was kind of scared followed us home and you know it seems weird that it picked on us
so it's quite obvious to all of them that they experienced a period of missing time 
and this was well before you know the betty and barney hill case had been publicized so they had 
no idea that missing time could possibly mean a closer encounter or being actually taken on board 
and when they learned about missing time they realized that this could have been 
a much more extensive encounter than they consciously remember so that really concerned them 
and as dorothy says I have no recollection of anything like that occurring but I definitely 
believe in ufos because I saw one I saw one it's just really strange I don't know if i'd 
really i'm sure a lot of people say this but I don't know if i'd really want to know or not because if something like that actually happened to me I don't know what kind of 
effect it would have on me if I remembered I mean if it happened it's in my subconscious someplace 
but I don't want my conscious part to see I don't want to be traumatized many years after the fact
dorothy has no idea when this missing time occurred but presumably it was during this 
drive or perhaps when they stepped outside but as dorothy says I never felt dizzy I never felt ill 
or physically strange or mentally strange or anything like that the ufo was low not low enough 
for me to touch it but it hovered maybe the height of two telephone poles one on top of each other 
first time I saw it was way high up in the sky it was moving around and when I say up in the sky like an airplane and we saw it come in and it got close but we 
had no sense of fear at all maybe because we were young or didn't make a lot of noise or anything 
you know sometimes noise can scare you more than the actual visual thing but I honestly 
don't think I do want to know what happened and carol feels pretty much the same way about this 
missing time and the possibility that there was an onboard experience as carol says 
you know it's funny I was thinking one day about that and I thought gee I wonder if I was ever in 
in it you know because we had seen that they had something on television the other day I think 
it was on donahue or oprah and they were talking about this big thing a spaceship and that's when I 
was thinking about it just the other day and when carol when I asked carl if she was interested in 
knowing what happened during the missing time she said hmm I don't think so I don't want to know
one significant sort of end note to all of this is that carol after you know I had interviewed her 
told me that she had actually seen ufos before in fact it was just a few months before this 
incident that she had a sighting as she says before that I saw something in the sky this was 
maybe a month before we went to the library it was really far away and you could just barely see it 
i mean it wasn't looking at me or anything but I could see it going through the sky 
so I think maybe carol dorothy's friend may have been the actual target of this particular ufo 
incident it's impossible to say without you know them going under hypnosis and recalling exactly 
what happened but this is a very clear cut case of missing time involving three witnesses 
all of who confirm and corroborate each other's details there are many cases involving missing 
time and I do suspect they probably had an on-board experience but at this point 
i certainly cannot say for sure but at the very least it's a very interesting incident 
in which this ufo followed them home very close treetop level and they had missing time 
so these are the three cases I wanted to share with you today I hope you've enjoyed this episode I really appreciate you watching and until next time keep having fun
