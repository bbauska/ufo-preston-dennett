Summary:
Feb 14, 2025
Healing is a major part of the extraterrestrial agenda. There are more than 300 cases coming from major researchers across the world including Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, John Mack, Barbara Lamb, Edith Fiore, Timothy Good, Brad Steiger and more. People are being cured of a wide variety of injuries, illnesses, and conditions. Accounts reach back more than 100 years up to the present day. They can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Most cases occur onboard UFOs or in a person’s home, but a small portion of cases occur in a place you would never expect: inside a hospital. It may sound incredible, but almost ten percent of UFO healing cases fit this category. This video presents 17 cases of this kind, which are only a small portion of the actual number of cases. 

MY SIGHT RESTORED. April 1945, Okinawa Island. After being struck by shrapnel in his eye and suffering an eye infection that rendered him blind, Howard Menger is visited in his hospital tent and healed.

EYES FILLED WITH GREAT COMPASSION. June 1946, Camp Lee, VA. Allan Edwards is visited by a beautiful and unusual-looking man who he believes healed a patient of severe assault injuries.

YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO LOSE THAT FINGER. 1960s, NJ. After losing his hearing in a sled accident, Richard Rylka is healed in his hospital room by human-looking ETs. Later, after crushing his finger in an industrial accident, the ETs visit him again in the hospital.

WE’VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. May 1962, Durham, England. After being diagnosed with a hole in his lung, Fred White is visited by a human-looking ET who heals him with a strange instrument.

THE MIRACLE PATIENT. 1967, Lima, Peru. In 1967, Ludwig Pallman is visited in his room in the Maison Hospital by a human-looking female ET who cures him of kidney problems.

“THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.” 1971, Laguna, CA. Burned on his neck and chest, Dr. Fred Bell is healed in his hospital room with the help of an artifact given to him by human-looking ETs.

MY DOCTOR WAS AMAZED. November 1981, Hubbard, OR. After an emergency C-section, Denise Twiggs is visited by an ET who speeds up the healing of her caesarean scar.

A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM. Summer 1982, Willamette, Oregon. Suffering from a strep infection which has spread through his body, “Douglas” is healed by an ET using a strange silver instrument.

TOTALLY RECUPERATED. Summer 1989, Kiev, Ukraine. Lying in his hospital room after a stroke, Sergey K is visited by a human-looking figure who heals him by waving his hand over his body.

GET UP AND GO! April 18, 1989, Krasnoperekopsk, Ukraine. At the end stages of heart disease, Liudmila Petrovna is brought back to full health by a glowing man who appears in her hospital room.

I WAS SAVED. 1990s. Location unknown. When doctors were unable to heal her of pneumonia, Joni Ferris is abducted from her hospital room and cured by ETs. 

MIRACLE LEGS. November 1995, Sacramento, CA. After doctors told Connie Isele that they would have to amputate her leg, she is visited by ETs who cure her!

COMPLETELY HEALED. 2002. Italy. A man suffering from cancer is healed by three humanoid figures in glowing jumpsuits. The event is allegedly caught on video in his hospital room.

THEY CURED ME. 2005, Miami, FL. While being prepared for emergency surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his lungs, Alberto Fernandez is suddenly healed by his ET friends.

THEY LOOKED LIKE PRAYING MANTIS. 2008, Canada. A woman visits her friend (suffering from a head injury) is amazed to see two praying mantis humanoids trying to heal her friend.

A SHINING GOLDEN LIGHT. February 2009, Andorra, Spain. Doctors report that at least four children are visited by ETs in their hospital rooms, curing them of terminal cancer.

TAUGHT BY THE ETS. Professor Bochereshoni, a mental health doctor from Tbilisi, Georgia, says he is visited by ETs in the hospital who assist him in diagnosing and curing patients suffering from mental illness. 

Cases like these may sound incredible, but there are far too many to explain away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. The miraculous recoveries verified by doctors and researchers speak for themselves. The UFO healing cases provide compelling evidence for extraterrestrial intervention. With 300 documented cases, it’s undeniable that ETs are on a healing mission across our planet.

Feb 14, 2025
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the
Paranormal many of you out there have requested that I do another episode about UFO healing cases and by UFO
healing I mean someone who has experienced an improvement in their health as a direct result of a UFO
encounter and there are a lot of cases like these far more than most people know in fact I've written a book about
this subject called the healing power of UFOs and it documents more than 300
cases coming from all over the world reaching back more than a hundred years all the way up to pretty much the
current day I can tell you that most major researchers out there have multiple cases like these it's
definitely a part of the contact experience and what's really interesting
is where these cases take place most of them do take place on board a UFO but
there's a portion of them that take place in people's homes some people are outside perhaps taking a walk or driving
or what have you and they have an encounter which ends up with them being healed but about 5 to 10% of these cases
actually do take place inside a hospital room I know how unusual that sounds but
as any investigator will tell you ETS can visit a person anywhere I have cases
that are taking place in hotel rooms in very crowded areas so yeah just about
anywhere and that includes hospital rooms and if there were one or two cases
I think we could discount it but no there are a lot in fact in this episode
today I'm going to cover 17 cases in which people make this claim that they
were visited in their hospital room by an ET and they were healed as a result
of this encounter these are all different types of s these are all different types of illnesses again these
cases come from all over the world reaching very far back in time and pretty much up to the current day so I'm
going to go through these chronologically and the first case I'd like to cover I call my site restored
this took place in 1945 April of 1945 on the island of
Okinawa the main witness in this case is a gentleman by the name of Howard mener
he would soon have many other en encounters following this one and would become a very well-known UFO contacte
and in fact one of the first people in the United States to come forward and make claims of having contact with UFOs
and extraterrestrials in April of 1945 on the island of Okinawa in the Pacific
Ocean Howard mener then a professional painter was on one of the aircraft that
saturated the Japanese held island with bombs and after dropping hundreds of
bombs and peppering the shoreline with machine gun fire the Americans were able to take control of the Island still the
Japanese did continue to attack some had managed to survive the bombing by hiding in caves on the island and it was these
soldiers who continued to attack in the style of Guerilla Warfare also a nearby
Japanese held Island shelled Okinawa constantly although it caused little real damage it was one of these shells
which proved to be disastrous for Howard mener one day as he was patrolling the
air strip another shell from the nearby Island fell short of its Target and landed on the air strip Howard mener
heard it coming so he fell to the ground and stayed low after the explosion he was relieved to have escaped injury or
so he thought because then he felt something hit his eye as he says as I
got to my feet I felt something stinging in my right eye I put my hand to my eye and managed to
pick something out with my fingers it was a piece of shrapnel so Howard mener was rushed to
the medical tent where he received treatment unfortunately this eye became badly infected and before long he was
totally blind in his right eye of course he was unable to perform his duties and
he remained in the medical tent under the care of the overworked doctors and nurses now despite treatment this eye
infection worsened and soon spread to his other eye and soon Howard mener found himself totally blind he was as
you might expect devastated he kept the news from his family back home but this wasn't the only secret Howard mener was
keeping because ever since he was a little boy he claims to have been repeatedly contacted by humanlike aliens
who claimed to be from various planets in our solar system now Through The
Years Howard had many typical contacte Adventures he said it was taken on board
UFO shown the moon he was given instructions about how to build an energy free motor which is not uncommon
he was told many predictions which he said later came true he was even able to take some of his friends to view the
et's craft and was provided with further demonstrations to prove the existence of
his ET friends he was even allowed to take photographs some of which here in a
book he wrote about his experiences from outer space to you and like many
contactees Howard says he was healed by the ETS as he writes in his book
something happened in that tent that I have often wondered about perhaps I can never be certain so while in the
hospital Howard was visited by an unidentified but he says very kind lady
Howard asked if she was a nurse but the woman did not reply and instead told him that he was the one she had come to see
Howard was struck by the fact that she seemed to know a lot about him in fact he had a sneaking suspicion that she
might be one of his extraterrestrial friends sent to help him as Howard
writes she assured me my sight would be restored and very gradually it was
Howard's sight returned and he was finally able to behold the lady who had helped him who he describes as quote an
attractive woman with wavy brown hair dark eyes and fine white teeth she
looked like a normal human she was wearing the normal Army nurse's uniform
and as Howard said although I suspected she was one of the space people she never made herself known directly near
the time of my release she said that I would meet very soon an interesting
person I assumed it would be another contact so this turned out to be true because 2 weeks later Howard had a very
strong impulse to drive to a remote area on the island he did so and there he met
a human looking ET and this gentleman told him that there would soon be a terrible bomb although the ET didn't
mention Howard's recent healing he alluded as to why it had been done the
ET told Howard quote we have been spending a lot of time conditioning you and preparing you for your work to come
we are contacting people all over the world so he would later go on board and
see this nurse who had apparently healed him and of course this prediction about
a terrible bomb did come true and we now know it to be the atomic bomb a
fascinating case and only one of well over a dozen cases involving people whose Vision was healed as a result of a
UFO encounter got quite a few cases like this and this is just one of them the
Howard mener cas case is somewhat controversial he certainly does have his detractors but I will say that no one's
ever been able to successfully debunk his case it matches up with many many
other cases in terms of details and in fact he presents more evidence than the
vast majority of people who claim these kinds of experiences so yeah I think
it's a case we should definitely take an objective look at and that's why I included it here now let's move to our
next case which I call eyes filled with great compassion this is a really
interesting case which took place on Jun in June of 1946 in Camp Lee Virginia this is
another encounter which took place in a Army hospital and I think you'll find it
a fascinating case this case comes from Timothy good and was published in his
excellent book Above Top Secret I highly recommend it if you know any Skeptics
give them this book you cannot walk away from reading this book not believing in
UFOs it was June of 1946 that a jumction by the name of Alan Edwards was admitted
to an Army hospital at camp Lee Virginia one evening he was wandering
through the hospital seeking company when he spotted a very unusual looking
man he was struck by his odd appearance so Allan walked across the room and sat
down on the VAC bunk next to this man Allan turned out to be an academically
trained Portrait Painter with a very thorough knowledge of anatomy and he instantly noticed several strange
irregularities about this individual this man had an extremely high forehead
perfectly formed features unusually radiant blonde hair a Flawless
complexion and extraordinary blue eyes which as Allan says were quote filled
with with great compassion so he stared at this man in absolute Fascination then
suddenly he was overcome with this feeling of well-being to the point that he felt it was some kind of spiritual
experience just to be in the presence of this young man before he could investigate further alen was called away
for his own medical examination but later that evening he saw a young man
being brought into the hospital for treatment this young man had been beaten badly in a a drunken brawl he had two
black eyes which were swollen shut a badly bruised forehead his nose appeared to be broken and this man was put in the
cot next to Alan Edwards who now had trouble falling asleep because of this
man's loud groans of pain so the next morning came Allan sat down for
breakfast and this is when he saw the strange looking man that he had seen earlier on his right then he saw the boy
who had been injured the night before except now he looked absolutely normal
all signs of his injuries were gone Alan Edwards just could hardly believe what
he was seeing as he says my eyes rested on a young lad seated at the end of the
table this was the same boy who had been brought in the night before the one who had been so badly beaten yet it couldn't
be there wasn't a blemish on his face so who cured this boy Allan never found out
for sure but as he says quote I felt strongly that the man Seated on my right
had been responsible for this miraculous Transfiguration now later Allan would
have contacts with this strange man and other ETS and in fact in Seattle
Washington Allan says he was hospitalized for a respiratory ailment he became very curious about two very
much normal looking human looking Hospital attendants who repeatedly
proved their ability to read his every thought they were telepathic to a degree
that they were reading his mind and while in their presence at this Hospital in Seattle other strange things began to
happen this is so unusual Allan says he felt compelled to get up and attend to
various patients performing a type of handson psychic healing as he says I
found myself administering to them with expert hands which did not somehow seem
to belong to me he was discharged shortly later and always regrets that he
didn't question the two strange Hospital attendants further but this is a good example of someone who's developed
healing abil abilities as a result of UFO contact I like that case the witness
sounds very credible very sincere Timothy good is an excellent and very
well-respected researcher I think it's an allaround very interesting and very early case which
that alone I think makes it important we don't have a whole lot of cases before the Modern Age of UFOs from 1947 onwards
and yeah that one occurred in 1945 so super interesting now let's move to the next
case which I call you were supposed to lose that finger this occurred in
sometime in the 1960s in New Jersey and the main witness in this case is a
gentleman by the name of Richard rilka not a whole lot of information about him
his story comes from Just One Source One researcher who investigated his case but
this is a very interesting event of a healing that took place in a hospital too actually the investigator in this
case is Joseph J Randazzo he was the editor and publisher
of the UFO library magazine and the author of the book The contes
manuscript which this account was published in the witness is Richard
rilka he was born in 1941 in New Jersey and he has received several healings one
occurred very early in the 1950s in New Jersey at that time Richard RKA was just
a young child he was playing outside in the snow with his friends they were sleigh writing down steep hills near
their homes while racing down the hill Richard was unable to steer his sled and
he crashed into a car that was driving up a hill the driver didn't even see Richard who was pushed under the car
thrown off the sled and knocked unconscious and by the time the driver found him Richard had been lying on his
left side in the snow for quite a few minutes his left ear was badly frostbitten he ended up developing an
ear infection which completely destroyed his Hearing in that ear his doctors
considered performing a mastoidectomy but instead they decided to try the new drug penicillin which was gaining in
popularity at this time now Richard RKA had seen UFOs on several occasions on a
few occasions he remembered going outside and being beamed or given
messages telepathically from the ETS as of yet however they had not visited him
physically but as he was recovering in the hospital Richard was surprised when
two human-looking figures introduced themselves as extraterrestrials gave him
the names nepos and Coran and came into his hospital room they said for the sole
purpose of healing him they were only able to affect a partial cure using
quote their own body energies so this is in essence a psychic healing these human
looking ETS were a able to get rid of the pain and the pressure that Richard was feeling in his ear after they left
he was still unable to hear out of that ear but following several doses of penicillin his hearing returned this
turned out to be Richard's first visitation and first healing though it wouldn't be long before more followed it
was sometime in the 1960s that Richard was working for a medical firm and he
was instructed by his supervisor to transport a barrel of chemicals not to
do this Richard had to operate a piece of heavy equipment called a drum lifter you can see it here heavy machinery as
you may know is often dangerous and he was being careless or somehow got in an
accident his index finger became caught in this machinery and was badly crushed
and in fact Richard screams called the attention of co-workers who helped him to free his finger which was was quote
white and terribly distorted it was so badly damaged that Richard had no feeling in the finger at
all he was unable to move it he was rushed to the company's first aid room
and the nurse was horrified and told him to go to the hospital at once this was well beyond her capability to take care
of so he took a cab to Middle sex General Hospital in New Brunswick New
Jersey where doctors immediately applied an ice pack and prepared for x-rays now
Richard was alone in the emergency room when suddenly these two ET friends of
his Coran and NEOS appeared they held their hands over his finger and once
again cured him using psychic healing now although this finger was numb for
many months this cure was apparently entirely effective enough to straighten
the bone and close the broken skin in fact when the doctor returned they found
no signs of injury on his finger whatsoever and sent him back to work now
later Richard was contacted by the company nurse who had read his Hospital file with disbelief and she told Richard
flat out after seeing his finger and then reading this file as she says and I quote you were supposed to lose that
finger she demanded to know what happened but Richard like many people
who experienced these kinds of events remained totally silent about what had happened to him another interesting
healing case injuries of some kind are probably the most common type of healing
in association with a UFO encounter I've got many many very similar to that the
Richard rilka case again not very well known but I think certainly deserves to be some of his healings are really quite
well verified I didn't go into all of them here but he has experienced m multiple healings he would be
categorized I think as your typical contacte none of his experiences have been frightening to him uh perhaps you
know this is simply how we categorize encounters abduct you're afraid and feel
like it's involuntary and contact it was a benevolent experience for you I've
certainly talked to people who had the same identical experience but interpreted it in very different ways
either way way it's a fascinating case now let's move to the next one which I
call we've never seen anything like it this occurred in May of 1962 in Durham
England I like this case because it gave me a clue as to who is being healed and
why and like many cases of involving healings uh they're
medically verified and this one really puzzled the doctors these kinds of cases do leave a
long trail of very confused and puzzled doctors who cannot explain how these
Witnesses are suddenly being healed without any intervention on their part
and Easter weekend in 1962 Fred white an Electronics
specialist decided to go fishing not far from his home near Durham England and
while fishing he had a very closeup sighting of a metallic craft with Port holes and in fact through one of the
port holes Fred said he could see a human looking person looking down at him
after about 5 minutes this craft left and that was the end of it or so he thought but four years later in
September of 1966 he started to experience severe pains in his chest and trouble breathing
uh he was hospitalized they diagnosed him with a collapsed lung Fred had no
idea what was wrong with him but to his dismay x-rays revealed that he had a large hole in his
lung but it was during his stay in the hospital that Fred says he was visited
by a man who he thought at first was just another doctor however this was no
normal doctor he looked very strange he had a peculiar accent when he entered
the room he immediately put his arm over Fred as if examining him and this is
when Fred noticed that the man wore quote some kind of watch which glowed like no time piece I had ever
seen so this man began to discuss Fred's symptoms with him and this man expressed
some interest in Fred's work with electronics and said that it was important he continue working with
electronics and that he would heal him after several minutes the strange doctor
left and as soon as he left Fred immediately felt better he could breathe
without pain the doctors gathered around and demanded more tests of course X-rays
were again taken and to the surprise of the doctors no hole in his lung could be
found and Fred was given a clean bill of health he says this man yeah looked
pretty much normal but did have weird exotic eyes was dressed strangely not in
any way he could completely describe but it was mostly this weird time piece or
instrument on his wrist that impressed Fred and of course the doctors were absolutely astonished as one doctor said
your lung is completely inflated the hole you had in there is healed we've
never seen anything like it so Fred is convinced that the man who visited him in the hospital cured him of his illness
he also suspects that this is probably the same person he saw through the port hole of that UFO while fishing four
years early very interesting case and only one of many cases involving heart healings that
I've documented uh this case of Fred white is important because it gave me a clue as I
said earlier about who is being healed and why I found that over 50% of cases
involving healings do occur to contact e people who have a long history of
encounters but I also found another pattern which you can definitely see in this episode and that is people who are
being healed are people who are doing good work for Humanity in some capacity so we have a lot of doctors and nurses
and teachers and artists and environmentalists and social workers and this kind of thing and it appears that
Fred white was healed because he was an Electronics specialist and the ETS felt
he was doing important work it's certainly an interesting correlation and
detail all right now let's move to the next case which which I call the miracle
patient this one occurred in 1967 in Lima Peru the witness is lwig f palman he
ended up writing an entire book about his experiences which are very very extensive involving contact with
humanlike ETS and yeah I call this one the miracle patient because that is what
the doctors in the hospital called Ludwig after he experienced a remarkable
recovery from an illness which was quite serious in 1967 Ludwig F palman was hospitalized in
the Meson France Hospital of Lima Peru he had been experiencing severe pains
which were quickly diagnosed as kidney problems two years earlier in 1965
Ludwig was traveling through Europe his career as an international health food processor and distributor made him as he
says a Perpetual Globe Trotter it was while he was in India that he met a
normal looking human looking gentleman who introduced himself as satu Rah and
after a few weeks of friendship Satur Rah made an amazing
statement he told Ludwig that he satu was actually an extraterrestrial not
from this planet now Ludwig was initially skeptical of such an outrageous claim but he was soon given
reason to believe because because Satur raah actually invited Ludwig aboard his
craft Ludwig as you might expect accepted the offer and had an amazing
and very extensive series of encounters with these human-looking extraterrestrials like many contactees
he was told many things and like many contactees he later received this
amazing healing he was in the wilderness in Lima Peru when his kidney pain first
appeared he sought treatment and was happy to be in the maon France Hospital which was
well known in the area for its expert doctors and modern equipment the doctors told Ludwig that he would have to
undergo an operation to alleviate his kidney pain and Ludwig agreed as his
fever was getting worse and the pain had him totally incapacitated but it was while he was in
his hospital room Ludwig awoke one evening to find a visitor in his room
and he recognized this person instantly it was ziti who is satu Rod's sister
whom he had met earlier on board this UFO craft this lady wasted no time and
immediately began treating Ludwig for his condition she did so by first passing her hands over his body she then
gave him a small pill to eat then as quickly and as mysteriously as she had
arrived she departed and just within minutes after her administrations
Ludwig's condition made a complete reversal he says he was instantly free of pain his fever broke and as far as he
could tell he was completely healed later the doctors came in to
examine him and they were absolutely stunned they realized that lugg was now
completely healthy but they could not explain why this case per Ludwig is very
well verified by his doctors who knew that he should have been on the operating table as lwid says all of this
may be checked by any of my readers I became the miracle patient of the famous maon France Hospital in Lima Peru and in
fact Ludwig had been scheduled for his operation that morning so when the doctors examined him and found him
perfectly healthy they demanded he undergo a whole new battery of tests and
it was these tests that verified the obvious that Ludwig was perfectly healthy
as one doctor told him you're fit as a flea this is really baffling yesterday
you were a very sick man and today you seem to be a different person Ludwig
never did have any more problems with his kidneys but he did have several more contacts with his alien friends and
ended up writing a book about his UFO experiences I find it a little bit
amusing to see that reaction from all these doctors who are just struggling to
figure out how these patients are being healed and fixed of a condition that they themselves were not able to heal
that is an important detail as well this shows how truly Advanced the ETS are if
they're curing chronic conditions well clearly these conditions aren't chronic
and I think we could learn a lot from how these ETS are healing people the whole medical community really I think
should take pay close attention to these kinds of cases because yeah we could
learn a lot from the ETS about how to treat people of all these different
kinds of conditions which brings us to the next case which I call this is impossible
this took place in 1971 in lagona California to a gentleman by the name of
Dr Fred Bell he was quite prominent in the UFO Community a few decades ago
again a pretty controversial character certainly has his detractors but has a
lot of supporters as well claims to have had contact with human looking ETS and
claims a very interesting healing in a hospital room as well in 1971 Southern
California contact and scientist Dr Fred Bell and two of his friends were victims
of a crude pipe bomb explosion per Fred bell all three of them were injured but he was thrown off
of his feet and onto the side sidewalk where he lost Consciousness he was rushed to lagona Memorial Hospital in
Southern California when he woke up he discovered that his left hand upper left
shoulder and neck were badly burned he also sustained a minor skull fracture
and had painful bruises all over his body however Fred says he was in contact
with human-looking extraterrestrials he said these contacts began as a young child and continued
through throughout his life he says they had given him life sa saving warnings on
several occasions and all kinds of valuable advice he says they also gave
him an innocuous looking necklace called a quote receptor and they told him that
it would protect him from harm while alone in the hospital room Fred Bell says this necklace heated up and sent
quote marvelous energy into his body and within minutes he was completely healed
and in fact his friends who were visiting him at the time watched this with disbelief the next morning Fred
says he very much enjoyed watching the Hospital physicians run a number of tests in an attempt to explain his
miraculous cure one of the doctors told him and I quote this is impossible you
have no trace of the severe burns that damaged your left hand upper left shoulder and your neck there is no
longer evidence of a skull fracture and what's with all the bruises huh you were covered with bruises where did they
disappear to her Fred the doctor was very upset and actually accused him of
Faking his injuries but what Fred did not tell the doctor is about this quote
receptor necklace which he now believes cured him using quote some unknown
energy now Dr Fred Bell was an inventor and actually constructed more of these
necklaces he founded a group called paradine and actually sold these necklace es to people you can still find
some of them online I make no claims about whether or not these work he apparently does have testimonials but
you can make up your own mind about it I was a little bit reluctant to include the case of Dr Fred Bell because it is
quite controversial he does have his detractors but it is another example of someone who claims to have been healed
in his hospital room as a result of ET contact it's the fact that he sold these
necklaces that kind of raises my eyebrows he does have testimonials about it but I don't know you can make up your
own minds about it so let's move to the next case which I call my doctor was
amazed this occurred in November of 1981 in hubard Oregon uh the Witnesses in this case are
the Twigs family specifically Denise Twigs this is a really interesting case
because the entire family claims to have had contact it's a very extensive case
involving multiple encounters and in fact multiple healings but one did take
place in a hospital room one of the most unusual contact stories on record is
that of the Twigs family Bert and Denise twigs and their three children which was written up in their book secret
vows they have had multiple healing events but important here is the one
that occurred to Denise Twigs in November of 1981 she had just given birth to her son
Christopher by cesarian section she had planned to deliver him naturally but
unforeseen complications demanded immediate surgery it turned out that the umbilical cord was wrapped around
Christopher's neck luckily surgery went well there were no other difficulties
Christopher was born a healthy normal baby boy but Denise was very disappointed to have had a C-section as
the recovery process is considerably longer than with natural birth however
Denise did have extraterrestrial friends and they visited her she says in the
hospital room and actually sped up the healing process of her incision as she
says they visited me giving me a helping hand with my recovery my human doctor was amazed at how quickly I was healing
now Denise didn't tell him about her et encounters a pretty interesting case and
yeah I would recommend checking out that book secret vows it's quite an unusual
contact case but does appear to be legitimate it's a fascinating account of
how people can move from being quite scared of their encounters to having truly benevolent
encounters now let's move to the next case which I call a solution to my problem this one occurred sometime in
the summer of 1982 in Willet Valley Oregon in and this is another
fascinating case involving someone who is cured of actually
strep quite a few cases of people who are healed of colds and flu and various lung problems this is one of them and
this case is super fascinating this case comes from Whitley streber unknown
country website it occurred in the summer of 1982 to a 13-year-old boy
given the pseudonym Douglas who lived in will Valley Oregon he was taking swimming lessons at a local public pool
when he contracted an aggressive strain of streptococus bacteria and his
condition deteriorated quite quickly so he was rushed to the local hospital
which at that time was already overflowing with other strep patients there was an outbreak at that time and
poor Douglas his fever Rose to4 De and despite antibiotic treatment
this infection spread to his kidney and doctors were actually worried that he might die and I'll just let Douglas
describe what happened next in his own words as he says one night a creature
that I thought at first was some sort of nurse came to my bedside she wore a
hooded Garb like the monks of old she was round of body and her face was this
plastic like skin her nose was only a v-shaped ridge she said she had a
solution to my problem and told me to relax out from her left sleeve came this thing
that looked like a knobby Rod of brushed aluminum she pushed the rodlike thing
against me like an injection into my left hip I felt no needle only something
like an ice cube being pushed against the skin the strange nurse then quickly left and Douglas fell asleep when he
awoke the next morning his fever had broken and his infection had begun to clear up later his mother would also
receive an even more remarkable healing by the same ETS but that one occurred in
her home interestingly in 2016 a UFO was seen hovering directly over the McKenzie
Willet Hospital in Springfield Oregon how interesting that both the mother and
the son were healed by ETS or make these claims uh that's also not unusual uh
when one person is having contact many many people in the family or people close to this person might experience
contact as well and again healing is a big part of UFO contact according to the
free study by Ry Hernandez healing takes place in some 50% of the cases which is
exactly what Edith fiori PhD found in her study which she wrote about in her
book encounters I'd say it turns up closer to 20 to 30% in my own research muan did a
stud and found about 10% either way that's significant and I think it's
undeniable that healing is a part of the UFO experience because there are so many
people having these kinds of healings here's another one this case I call
Totally recuperated this one occurred in the summer of 1989 in keev Ukraine and it's a
fascinating case which I think you'll find really interesting in the summer of
1989 a gentleman by the name of Sergey K of Kiev Ukraine suffered a devastating
stroke it caused all kinds of symptoms he was having trouble speaking he had
almost near total paralysis in his left hand and while he was in the hospital
recovering sitting by the window he suddenly saw these strange green orbl
likee lights approaching these lights flickered formed a kind of semicircle CC
and came right up to the window Sergey says he suddenly felt mesmerized entranced and was unable to control his
body and when these lights reached him a figure in a tight fitting white suit
appeared per Sergey this was a tall man with long blonde hair this man waved his
hand over Sergey several times causing Sergey to become nauseous and hot and at
this point he lost Consciousness when he awoke the green lights were ascending
from the balcony outside the window and moving away and Sergey himself says he
felt healthy and energetic in fact he immediately rose up and discovered that he could move his left hand freely he
felt almost totally recuperated from this stroke which as you can imagine
amazed his wife and the doctors how interesting is that because Medical
Science really has no super effective treatments to reverse a stroke and yet
somehow the ETS are able to do it I've got quite a few cases in my book about
this there is one case which I didn't cover here but this does involve a boy
who is cured of a stroke by medicine given to the hospital doorman who gave
it to the doctors to apply to the patient in the hospital room uh this you can hear more about in my YouTube
episode the top 20 UFO healing cases uh
so that's why I didn't want to cover it here a few of these cases I've already covered so I didn't want this to be too
repetitive but it's certainly another interesting case of someone healed of a stroke now here's a case which I have
not covered before in my YouTube episodes this one I call get up and go
this occurred on April 18 1989 in Ukraine and this is a really in
case because it does have outside Witnesses this is someone who was basically brought back from a very much
terminal condition and it's such an interesting case in so many different
ways this case comes from respected Russian researcher Sergei
banev the witness is Ludmila petrona she was terminally ill with heart disease
and was actually lying near death in her hospital room Loc ated in kzo per kbsk
this is in Crimea in Ukraine heart surgery had failed to help her she was
largely paralyzed and was declining quickly in fact the nurses had placed her in a separate Ward rarely visited
her and poor Luda was just hoping that the end would come quickly was on the
evening of April 18 1989 that she woke up to a strong wind swirling through her
room this was weird there was the doors were closed uh the wind grew stronger
suddenly a dazzling white light appeared followed by a man dressed all in white
glowing with white light in fact the Man's eyes seemed to radiate light so
Luda shouted out who are you where do you come from the man replied we come
from the 10th Dimension don't be afraid you will be able to walk at this point
the room seemed to become hazy and the man disappeared and Luda lost
Consciousness it was the next day that another patient a lady from the neighboring Ward came to visit her and
was shocked by her appearance and called ludmila's husband so he came and
examining her lifting her arm was amazed and puzzled to see these weird little
unexplained red and white lights moving slowly over the body of the patient her
Luda she says she suddenly felt this extremee surge of energy she felt
something physically push her she sat up in bed and this is when she heard a loud
voice clearly say quote get up and go now or never so Ludmilla Rose from her
bed and she was apparently cured as researcher Sergey banv writes Ludmila
petrona got up took one step then another now she can walk without
difficulty how interesting is that this is another case of someone cured of a heart condition again I got a lot of
cases like this but this one is so interesting because this person was
basically at death's door and made a full recovery don't know quite how these
guys are healing people but it's very effective usually not always there are
some cases where the healing doesn't quite work as we'll see coming up but
man that is just so fascinating to me and it's a good reminder that there's always hope you never know when a
healing might occur now let's move to another case which I call I was saved this occurred
sometime in the 1990s the location is not specified don't have hardly any information about
this case but I do know the person's name she was very vehement that she was
healed in the hospital so I think it's an important case because again this
shows that a person can be visited anywhere at any time and be have a
contact with extraterrestrials this case comes from experiencer Joanie Ferris and I'll just
quote her as she says in my contact experience I was saved I was in a
hospital suffering from pneumonia for 6 weeks and nothing absolutely no
antibiotics were working on me the Specialists were trying penicillin after
penicillin then one day I was taken up through the ceiling and blacked out when
I came back I was in bed and my fever had broke and the pneumonia was gone
Joanie Ferris felt compelled to report her encounter after reading a quote from researcher jacqu valet in which he
described procedures done upon humans by the ETS as quote sadistic she vly
disagreed with this characterization and writes I have heard of cases of people being hurt from abduction so there is
both good and bad we don't know what the ET researchers are trying to accomplish
in other words the work may appear to be sadistic in the way an emergency medical team performing a life-saving operation
if not properly recognized and understood could be considered sadistic again I wish I had more
information on that case this is one of the problems with studying UFO healing cases stud UFOs in general is very
difficult because people are very reluctant to come forward but when it comes to Healing cases that's even more
so uh UFO healings have often been relegated to sort of The Fringe Of The
Fringe and for that reason many of them are not well covered or well
investigated and receive only brief mention in the literature but the fact
that there are 300 well it's closer probably now to twice that number but
the fact that there are so many cases I think provides the best evidence that these kinds of events are taking place
it's also important because this shows a benevolent side to the ETS that doesn't
get nearly the attention it deserves and again it appears to be that fear is what
often causes people to label an encounter as negative which is certainly
understandable but as these cases show many times are visiting people not for
the purposes of experimentation as is often speculated but to actually heal a
person here's another case I like this one this lady had the courage to come
forward speak publically about her encounters allowed her real name to be
used again there's not a whole lot of information about this case she never wrote a book as far as I know her case
has never been fully documented but I call this one Miracle legs this one
occurred in November of 1995 in Sacramento California and it's a fascinating case
another one of someone who claims to have been healed in their hospital room by extraterrestrials in November of
1995 Connie Isel of Sacramento California and her friends were in a
tragic automobile accident which left Connie Gravely injured and in fact at
the hospital doctors told Connie that her leg would have to be
amputated Connie as you can imagine was not happy about this but she had strong
faith that her et friends could heal her as she had already experienced healings from them before so while in her
hospital room and in desperation she prayed to the ETS for help and she is
convinced that they responded as she says it was an extra ordinary feeling to
wake up alive out of the corner of my eye I saw an ET a very tall being with
whom I was familiar when I turned to look at him directly he was no longer there but to everyone's amazement Connie
recovered quickly and her leg was saved the doctors she says were also very much
stunned to the point that they gave her the nickname quote miral legs so many
cases what's really interesting about Connie isel's case is she fits the pattern of people who are being healed
she is a therapist uh and so many cases of people
who are doing good work for Humanity in some capacity who are healed by
extraterrestrials they are helping those who help others this is exactly what they told a couple that I interviewed
personally who asked them why did you heal us because the gentleman was healed
of carpal tunnel syndrome and a bad knee and they said exactly that we're helping
those who help others uh they asked them why don't you just come down and fix everything they said we can't do that
you've created your own problems it's up to you to solve them and they are not
going to step in and just save us so it's real puzzling about who gets healed
and why but there are patterns again people who are helping others are far
more likely to be healed by ETS now let's move to the next case
which which I call completely healed this occurred in 2002 in Italy there's
almost zero information about this case it's just a brief mention but I am
including it because of the researcher he's really quite prolific and I think
within the community of UFO researchers very well respected as reported by
respected researcher Wendell Stevens it was around 2002 or 2003 that a man in
Italy was cured of cancer while in the hospital this healing may have gone
unnoticed except for the fact that it was allegedly recorded on video and observed on the monitor in the nurse's
station the tape reportedly showed three humanoid figures wearing light blue
iridescent suits like quote fish scales these figures glowed with light from
their arms and legs They Carried a strange instrument in their hands this tape had Le L shows them entering the
room passing this instrument up and down the man's body at which point he was quote completely healed that's all the
information I was able to find on this case but it's certainly fascinating oh how I would love to have much more
information on these cases unfortunately I don't so I am just bringing you all
the information that I could find on each of these cases but again it's the huge number of them as I think speaks
most loudly to the veracity of these cases and here's another one which is
definitely one of my favorite because it is very well authenticated it does have
multiple Witnesses not just the patient but his wife who was there when it happened I call this one they cured me
this occurred in 2005 in Miami Florida the witness is very credible and this
case was investigated not only by Ray Hernandez who's quite prominent in the
UFO Community but Dr Joseph Burks MD who is also a UFO researcher and
experiencer it's an important case I think in 2005 retired federal drug
enforcement agent Alberto Fernandez of Miami Florida was diagnosed with lung
cancer earlier he had battled and recovered from prostate cancer but a later follow-up visit revealed a
baseball-sized mass in his lungs in fact it was so severe that his doctors ordered immediate surgery
Alberto had experienced UFO contact throughout his life and had earlier experienced a healing from a torn cornea
he had no reason however to expect a second healing he was admitted to the local hospital accompanied by his wife
he was being readied for more x-rays when something very strange happened as he was laying on the exam table his
entire body started to vibrate with unusual energy and he shouted out to his wife they're
here they're here and it was interesting because his wife now saw that the
curtain surrounding her husband's bed was moving in this strange pattern which she described as similar to a sinewave
she rushed st's husband and observed his whole body shaking violently seconds
later the shaking stopped and Alberto told his wife they cured me the x-ray
technician returned completed the x-rays then gave them to the specialist who was going to treat Alberto and the
specialist reviewed the x-rays and became irate because these X-rays showed
that Alberto Fernandez's lungs were completely healthy there was no sign of any tumor and in fact the specialist
actually accused Alberto and his original doctor of wasting his time now
Alberto's original Doctor Who had diagnosed the cancerous mass reviewed the new x-rays and verif ified The
Disappearance of the mass there are so many cases of people who've been cured of tumors and cancer itself uh which is
super interesting because this is something that is one of the top 10 killers of people in the world and ETS
are their healing so that makes it a very important case and again very well
authenticated now let's move to this next case which is quite poignant and I mentioned earlier that not all healings
are 100% successful and that's true in this case I call this one they looked
like praying mantis this took place in 2008 in Canada and this is purely
anecdotal that it's based on one person's eyewitness testimony but certainly a fascinating case of someone
who was healed by ETS of an apparent head wound the main witness in this case
is Andrea this is a pseudonym this case again took place in Canada and I'll just
let Andrea describe what happened as she says my best friend was viciously
attacked and left to die in 2008 she barely survived the horrible attack
where she was knocked unconscious after being hit on the head over and over with an object when I saw her at the hospital
she was unrecognizable her beautiful face was swollen to the side of a
basketball so Andrea was devastated she had known her friend for 40 years they
had grown up together but now following this attack her friend was laying in
this hospital bed in a drug induced coma part of her skull had actually been
removed to reduce pressure from the inflammation because of the delicacy of
her condition Andrea was not allowed to touch her friend but she did visit her
and would stand by her bed and meditate On Healing now when she performed a healing like
this Andrea sometimes says she felt as though she seemed to be quote another person working with accuracy and
knowledge that I wouldn't have had in real life in fact one evening as she was meditating on healing her friend Andrea
had a very Vivid vision of a huge black spot on her friend's head and out of it
came hundreds of giant spiders this seemed like a good sign but unfortunately her friend's condition did
not appear to improve Andrea was in despair she remained by her friend's
bedside but was unable to help her finally she was reaching a point of panic she felt a sense that quote
something had to be done quickly or her friend would die it was at that moment
she says that two praying mantis type beings appeared and again I'll just let
Andrea describe it in her own words as she says all of a sudden there were two
beings that appeared next to my friend they seemed to push me aside and silently went to work on her like
skilled surgeons they stood to her left standing together and working furiously
on my friend I had no idea who they were or what they were doing I thought they
looked like praying mantis never in a million years could I make this up so
Andrea at that time had no idea that other people reported ETS that looked
like praying mantids at the time of this incident in fact she was so amazed by what was happening she was unable to
observe everything clearly she was an absolute shock and suddenly she realized
that these figures were doing something to her friend and as she says I focused
on my friend and saw her head was split wide open like these aliens sliced it
perfectly open I saw freshly sliced raw flesh and these alien praying mantis
were busily removing pieces of of bone rock or whatever from her brain these
two alien praying mantis worked quickly without speaking one word at this point Andrea says she
seemed to quote black out she is unable to remember anything else about what happened she did tell her friends about
the incident who told her that yes people do see praying mantis type ETS
she did not know that they advised her to search the internet and she was absolutely surprised to find many other
accounts involving these same type of beings so Andrea hoped that following this visit by these mantids her friend
would be completely cured unfortunately it was not to be as Andrea says I'm sad
to say that even with the alien healing my friend survived only another two weeks before she died it's just
remarkable that she survived at all after her injuries I don't know why I experienced this but it's something I
will never forget sincerely and oh yes this is 100% truth the whole story well
as far as I know that case was not professionally investigated the testimony of the
witness is so sincere so emotional that it just has the Ring of truth to me I
don't know you can make up your own minds about it but certainly another
example of ETS visiting someone in their hospital room and at least attempting to
heal them here's another one this is a really interesting case this is the
final one in this collection and again I do have some questions about it cuz it
only comes from One Source but it's quite detailed I call this one a shining
Golden Light this took place fairly recently February 2009 in Andor Spain I
wasn't able to find any further verification about it but I present it here for what it's worth this is the the
last case I'm going to present today this comes from UFO researchers John Von
Allen and Willie dinard who say that in February 2009 a fantastic UFO contact
took place at the Pyrenees Children's Hospital in Andora Spain they say they
interviewed no less than 14 doctors and staff members who told them that
extraterrestrials had appeared in the Cancer Ward of the hospital and performed cure on at least four children
who were terminal and about to die these ETS were seen by all who were present
and were described as about 4 and 1/2 ft tall with large heads large almond-shaped eyes and brownish
skin one of the witnesses was nurse Lupe Montoya she was working in the pediatric
oncology Ward when the first visit occurred as she says I was filling out
reports when I looked up and saw two little creatures as they moved towards me along the corridor at first I thought
that two of the boys were out of their beds so I got up to bring them back to their rooms but when I approached I saw
that they were not human and did not look like something that is on this planet I was scared because it seemed so
strange but at the same time I felt a feeling I was sensing kindness love and
intelligence in those strange eyes so she watched as these two beings walked
into the room of 7-year-old Juan Lopez who you can see here who was at the end
stages of Leukemia and expected to die within the week she called for the security guards and called over Dr Tomas
Ruiz who was treating another patient and Tomas as he says in his own words
when we entered the room of the small Wan it was bathed in a shining Golden
Light the aliens were standing next to his bed there seemed to be a Mystic B between them and the boy one of the
beings touched the front of onean gently with his long finger and he was immediately surrounded in an aura of
light the two beings then immediately exited the room and left the hospital as mysteriously as they arrived per Dr
Tomas Ruiz immediately they performed x-rays and blood tests on seven-year-old
Juan and to their amazement the boy was quote completely free of cancer healed
and this remarkable event turned out to be just the beginning because it was over the next month that these ETS
returned on three separate occasions each time they chose a young child who
was on the verge of dying from cancer and allegedly healed them 9-year-old
Maria munes 8-year-old Anita paa and 9-year-old Hector Gomez each allegedly
received a miraculous cure and as Dr Tomas Ruiz told the investigators and
quote there is a pattern in these visits they always occur at 1:00 a.m. and the
ETS always come in pairs and always heal with a touch to the forehead now according to UFO researcher
Diego Garcia the Pyrenees have been a hot spot for UFO activity for many years
an amazing case and it's interesting to me that there are multiple healings
going on in that case uh so super interesting I mean that's 17 cases and
honestly I suspect there are far far more than this because most people are
not going to report it there is certainly a phenomenon known as spontaneous remission and doctors are
quite puzzled about this many times it's very well documented people will have a
sudden reversal of their condition whatever it might be and I think many of
these cases could very well have been due to the intervention of extraterrestrials
and let's face it it's not just extraterrestrials healing people there are are Angelic healings healing can
come from a wide variety of sources and it's quite possible that some of these cases might be what we would consider to
be angels and vice versa some of the Angelic healings might very well be
ETS but so many cases again 300 plus
cases of healings and there are cases I mean here's one from Helga Morrow
involving a Doctor by the name of Professor vurus shony who is a mental health doctor from taliss Georgia who
said that he was visited by ETS who gave him information on how to heal people
this is also not unusual many people who have an encounter feel that they have
gained some ability to do psychic healing or will develop a sudden interest in medicine in general and will
become doctors it's a really fascinating aspect of UFO encounters that I think
deserves much more attention and much more study it's one of the reasons I wanted to do this episode today I think
it's important because it shows one that there's always hope two ETS can visit a person anywhere three chronic conditions
are clearly not chronic if they can be healed four there's all kinds of things
we can learn from the ETS about medicine it's clear that they are far more
advanced than we are again these cases were covered in my book the healing
power of UFOs Which documents more than 300 cases and again to probably double
that by now I might have to do a sequel or a new addition because I keep getting
new cases and I suspect that some of you out there are going to share some of of your own healings because that usually
is what happens whenever I speak about this and again I'm not saying that every
person has a benevolent encounter uh I know that some people have a real difficult time with UFO
contact but I maintain that they are not here to hurt harm torture or do any
kinds of sadistic things that humans do to each other I think a close objective
look at the onboard experence erience in particular shows a very clearcut pattern people are
taken on board and physically examined this is when they're often healed but then they're usually if they're not in a
complete panic and end up with missing time and just put back in their homes
they usually will be given a tour of the craft shown the engine room told how it works taken to the observation deck
shown the Earth far below or more often a Starfield but sometimes the moon or
other planets or even beyond the solar system they are sometimes taken to the
control room told how the ETS fly the craft even sat down in the Pilot's seat
and given a chance to fly the craft itself not as unusual as you might think
in fact Grant Cameron wrote a whole book called Sky Pilots about people who were taught how to Pilot the craft and of
course my book symmetry is all about Dolly saffron and her experiences with
exactly this so yeah pts will also provide all
kinds of information about a person's personal life the life path they're taken but information in general which
usually falls into the category of warnings of nuclear proliferation warnings against war and
aggression greed and Corruption pollution and the destruction of the environment also there's a very strong
and prominent spiritual aspect to UFO encounters people often describe it as
being very much like a spiritual enlightenment lifting the veil from their eyes and opening them up to a
whole new paradigm and in fact also it awakens their psychic abilities to an
unbelievable degree and it's the rule rather than the exception that people come away from an encounter and
experience such things as precognition astral projection
Clairvoyance telepathy mediumship uh ch
channeling remote viewing physical levitation I did a whole episode just on
that and of course healing the ability to heal others it's really quite
prominent so yeah just underlying underlining that people have many
healing encounters so that's it for today I hope you've learned something I
hope you found it interesting thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next next time
keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun I will
see you next episode bye for now
