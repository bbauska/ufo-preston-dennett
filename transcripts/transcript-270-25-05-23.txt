UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE ELEVEN.
May 23, 2025

Summary:
May 23, 2025
Welcome to Episode Eleven of the ongoing series: UFOs in Your Hometown. This series was born from a challenge: name any town, city or location on this planet, and I will find at least one UFO encounter there. With nearly 100 locations explored from across the planet, every single one shows a long, rich history of UFO encounters of all kinds: sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard cases and more. We now explore four new locations: Vancouver, BC, Canada; Lake Havasu, Arizona; Thomasville, North Carolina and Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. All types of encounters are represented, along with a wide variety of evidence: medical effects, landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, radar-returns, photographs and more. So come along on a journey that is sure to change the way you feel about the UFO phenomenon.

VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA. In 1912, a farm-boy came upon a landed UFO with humanoids. In 1933, after a wave of sightings, witnesses observed an apparent UFO crash and alien bodies. Year after year, Vancouver has sightings of solid metallic craft, in 1939, 1955, 1964, 1968 and more. In 1968, a group of boys came upon a landed UFO and a humanoid on a golf course. In 1970, a man describes his encounter with a fleet of tiny UFOs. In 1977, a mother and daughter saw a flying saucer hover right over a church. That same year, two weather observers at Vancouver Int’l Airport saw a huge craft with portholes. In 1978, neighbors saw a closeup UFO hover over their homes. In 1985, a classroom of students and a teacher saw a strange craft hover over the schoolyard. In 1990, a child saw a gray ET in his hotel room. In 1997, a woman’s sighting of a craft drew the attention of NORAD. That same year, a lady and her grandson had a dramatic encounter with a hamburger-shaped UFO. In 2000, two amateur astronomers were shocked by their sighting of a V-shaped craft. In April and May of 2001, two brothers had three close-up sightings; one of the witnesses had telepathic communication. More dramatic sightings of metallic discs occurred in 2001 and 2003. In 2015, a Vancouver woman reported her encounter with a strange humanoid in her bedroom.

LAKE HAVASU, ARIZONA. In 1968, a daylight disc was seen directly over Lake Havasu. The best-known sighting in this area occurred in 1968 when two Cessna pilots saw dozens of craft performing fantastic maneuvers. In 1994, a woman and her child had an encounter with a massive UFO over their house. They could see humanoids through the portholes. When the humanoids entered their house, they packed up and moved away.  In 1996, a group of witnesses saw a glowing green craft, resulting in missing time. More amazing cases of solid craft encounters occurred in 2000, 2005 and 2006. In 2009, a witness videotaped a solid metallic disc hovering over Lake Havasu in broad daylight. In 2010, an entire family observed a UFO being chased by military jet aircraft. This is just a small sample of UFOs seen over the Lake Havasu area, proving once again that UFOs are seen everywhere.

THOMASVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1965 a man had a very close encounter with a cylindrical craft hovering only 200 feet above the ground. One night in 1969, two independent witnesses pulled off the road to observe a classic flying saucer hover over the nearby trees. When a strange humanoid appeared in one of the windows, they drove off in a panic. Arriving home, one of the witnesses realized he was missing about 45 minutes of time. One night in 1996, a man was driving along the road when he saw a UFO sending down a beam of light in the field next to him. Soon the UFO zoomed towards him, coming directly over his vehicle. In 1998, a father and son fishing on a lake had a very close encounter with a silver spherical craft. So many cases!

ISLE OF WIGHT, UNITED KINGDOM. So many cases here. In 1952, an RAF radarman tracked 8 objects flying over the Isle of Wight. In 1954, a UFO was seen over a wide area. In 1956 two jet fighter pilots chased a UFO along the coast, catching it on radar. In 1959, a group of 8 amateur astronomers observed 5 “mystery satellites.” In 1961, a mother and daughter had a very close encounter with a metallic disc. In 1967, a group of students saw a wobbling UFO behind their school, leaving behind landing traces. In 1970, a man had a series of sightings. Three years later, his daughter and a friend had a bizarre humanoid encounter with the “Sandown Clown,” destined to become the area’s most famous case. Over the next decades, year after year, many other sightings occurred, some which were investigated by the Royal Air Force.

So many cases of all kinds. The ubiquitous nature of UFOs cannot be denied. If every location on this planet has truly been visited by UFOs, the implications of this are profound. UFOs appear to be putting on a publicity campaign announcing their presence. The ETs have done their part to disclose. The rest is up to us.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
It's time for another hometown episode. As you may know, some time ago I put out
a challenge. Name any town, any city, any location on planet Earth, and I will
find a UFO encounter there. Probably more than one. And that's what I've been doing. I've covered 10 episodes so far,
nearly a hundred locations. So, this episode is called UFOs in Your Hometown,
episode 11. I love doing these hometown episodes. They take a little bit more
research than the other episodes, but I always learn so much. Today, I'm
covering four locations. Usually, I cover eight, maybe 10, but I just found
so many encounters that really this is all I can fit in. And the four locations
I'm covering today include Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, Lake Havsu in
Arizona, Thomasville in North Carolina, and finally the Isisle of White in the
UK. These cases go back well over a hundred years. What I love about these
episodes is that they include the entire range of encounters. So, we have
sightings mostly of metallic craft, but also USOS, landings, face-to-face
encounters with humanoids, onboard encounters, a couple of what appear to be UFO crash retrievalss, and just so
many different types of cases. What's also interesting is the huge amount of
evidence in support of these cases, which includes physiological effects,
landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, radar returns,
photographs, I mean, you name it. So, with these four locations, this is going
to be a pretty long episode. But I found so many different types of encounters,
but the first one I am covering today includes Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada. This is by special request from Ian and Oreo. So, thank you guys for
suggesting this location. I know you were very patient waiting for this, but
it was a very difficult location to research simply because there were so many encounters. I investigated probably
or I'm presenting here about 20 cases, which is by no means comprehensive. I
mean, I seriously could write an entire book on just the cases in Vancouver, which is a pretty large area. Let's see.
It's got about 45 square miles. Not super large, but very densely populated
with some 2 to 3 million people in Vancouver proper, but in the outlying
areas, yeah, millions of people. So, it should come as no surprise that there
are a lot of UFO encounters. But again, pretty much the entire range of UFO
phenomena. The earliest case I could find in Vancouver is actually a humanoid
case and it comes from Abram Henner who in 1972 wrote a letter to researcher J.
Allen Heinneck. He wrote that one morning way back in 1912 while on his
father's farm in Vancouver he saw a round craft which he said was quote
something like a helicopter. He said it had a glass cab on top and he said it
landed on the ground and quote spacemen came out. Now, as he says in his own
words, "One man felt my body. They admired my hands. They have different
hands than we do. They have round feet, short legs, no knees, no elbows. They
operate on mind power." I understood what they said. Now, there's no other
information on this case, unfortunately. It's quite brief. Other than Abraham did
tell his father what happened and his father warned him to never tell anyone
and he didn't not for 60 years when he finally wrote this letter to J. Allen heck. Now reportedly researcher John
Brent Musgrave did speak personally with this witness and wrote about this account in his book. Next case March
1933. This is a rare report of an apparent UFO crash. In the days before this
incident, there was a series of sightings seen by some 70 people in a
suburban area of Vancouver. The main witness is an 88-year-old man by the
name of Donald. So, all this information comes from him. Reportedly, people were
seeing a semi-ircular object with what looked like a triangular base about 100
ft wide, 20 ft high. And after this series of sightings, this object came
hurtling down and apparently crash landed in a field causing some kind of an explosion. Witnesses rushed to the
scene and they were there within 5 minutes of this explosion. When they got there, no object was seen, but they
reportedly found three bodies. Now, these were never described. From this
point, the details in this case become pretty sparse. But per Donald, he says
that five people in this area disappeared under mysterious circumstances, including Michael Farlo,
Justin Avery, Cindy Bellworth, Kathy Johnson, and a few days later, her
husband Brandon Johnson. Now, whether this is connected in any way to the
incident is certainly implied, but it's not clear. This was allegedly reported to the police and appeared in the
Tamworth Herald newspaper, but as the witness Donald says, none of them were
ever seen again. So, I don't know. The next case occurred in the summer of
1939, still quite early. And it comes from a firsthand witness who at age 15
says that she had a very close-up sighting of a UFO from the front yard of her home located on West 5 Avenue in the
Vancouver suburb of Kitsilano. She kept this encounter secret for most
of her life, only telling her son Mark about 5 years before she passed away in
February of 1995. But he recorded her encounter, and as she says, quote, "It came from behind
the cloud and came at fast speed. It stopped above the house across the street. It looked like a tube, a
metallic tube. No sound, no wings, nothing. It was a bit bigger than the
house. I ran inside to get my dad and he said he did not know what it was. Then
it left straight up and was gone in a flash. This all happened in about a threeinut time period and my dad told me
not to tell anyone so I didn't. Now, incidentally, her father was an employee
of Boeing and very familiar with aircraft. And as her son Mark says, when
she told me this story, there was a tone in her voice that said it still scared her even though she wouldn't admit it.
The next case that I found, which is pretty interesting, occurred in summer of
1955, and this was told by someone who spoke to the witness, so it's technically a third-hand report, but
it's so compelling. I think it deserves mention. The witnesses were six children
ranging in age from 12 to 14. And as the man who made the report writes, "About
six of my friends were sitting out in their backyard. All of a sudden, they noticed a large cigar-shaped craft
coming slowly up from the south. One of them ran into the house and brought out binoculars as well as his mother. They
stated that the craft had numerous yellow port holes along both sides. Their mother apparently phoned the
airport and was told that there were no planes in the air at that time. They said that while she was on the phone,
she could hear fighter planes being scrambled in the background. But while she was inside, this craft slowly turned
around and headed back south, and they watched it until it was out of sight. So, an interesting report of a solid
craft of some kind. Next one. Some 9 years later, June
1964. This case is interesting because it involves some unusual electromagnetic
effects. Was around 3:00 a.m. again one evening in June when two brothers had a
closeup sighting of a very large craft, writes one of the witnesses. My brother
and I were watching this object fly over our house in East Vancouver at 41st and
Frasier Street. We watched this object for about 2 minutes and then it vanished
off to the south. The object was long, like a mother ship. Now, the most
amazing part is what happened after this. As the witness says, two weeks later, my buddy Mike was driving south
on Cami Street at 12th Avenue. He looked up above city hall and saw five or 10
objects stationary above city hall. He told me that they were like quote a
discs all in formation. Now, just about the same time he saw this, street
lights, cars, truck engines all shut down almost as soon as this happened.
Then the lights went back on, the engines restarted, and the objects were gone. Here is an astonishing close-up
sighting of a massive daylight disc. This occurred one day in August of
1968. A newly engaged couple were driving through Vancouver when an object
began to follow their car and continued to do so for about six blocks all the
way to their house. They got out and this object stopped and hovered overhead. Now, the witnesses described
this object as quote, "a large saucer shape with large triangular-shaped windows on top. The bottom had a smaller
protrusion, a dome, and no window. There were what looked like symbols written
and lights on the outer rim. The windows were lit up brighter than daylight. They
heard a slight droning noise. They said this was not at a distance. This thing was huge, and close up it was a gray
steel color. It appeared to be about three city blocks long. Now, this is
still quoting the witness as they said, "This UFO was not at such a distance that you had to guess what it was. It
was in your face. You could see in the windows. You could see the lights around the outside as well as writing. It was
huge." When we arrived home, it was at the same distance away, which was close
enough to see in the windows. My fiance and my neighbors as well as my dad just
stood there saying nothing for at least two minutes. It took off slowly and so
fast it almost disappeared. I know what I saw and it was not from here. I know
it was following my wife and I. This has bothered me for years. I do not want
people thinking I am nuts. Now it was that same month again, August 1968.
There was an amazing case involving a landing and a humanoid. There was a
group of young friends playing around with their BB guns at the Shaughnessy Golf Course, which you can see here,
when they came upon a silver round craft, which they said was about the size of a VW Beetle just sitting on the
green. One of the witnesses, Kim, walked up to it and began to bang on it as if
he were playing bongo drums. He was trying to impress his friends. But then he walked around it and got a big shock
when he saw a 4-ft tall humanoid standing next to this little craft. And
as he says, he was so pale he was nearly blue and had a white suit on that had a
blue sash around his waist. I said, "My name is Kim." And I put my right hand on
my heart as I said it. and he responded by holding his hands palms up and made a
sound, but he didn't seem to have a tongue. At one point, he put out his right arm and nodded for me to do the
same with my left, and I was allowed to compare my hand with his. And except for
the palar, we were very similar. At this point, I heard a voice in my head that spoke the words, "Would you like to
pray?" and he bowed and put his arms pointing down with his palms towards me.
I was a bit embarrassed and to get a laugh from my friends who were literally stunned, I made a gesture to the BB gun
in my right pocket. He seemed to sense this and now I had to apologize for this
and explain that it was only a BB gun, not real, and he seemed to understand. I
said a few more things, then waved and he waved back and I joined my friends. Now, the witness does not say what
happened next, but he does say that following this, he had an encounter while walking along Vancouver Street,
was actually taken up inside a craft via a beam of light. As he says, I had a
medical exam and was very ill for up to 10 days after I was called by the
Bigalow Group and spoke at length about this to Bill Jones. I have had three
other sightings. Again, the kind of case I wish I had a lot more information on,
but certainly interesting. And here's another one. This is in July of 1970,
uh, around 7:00 p.m. one evening. It's a truly bizarre case who says that this
witness stepped out of his home located at 484 Gordon
Avenue. And it weird things began to immediately happen. As he says, "I
hadn't taken more than a few steps when I started noticing small silver balls
around the size of golf balls coming over the top of the house. That was on the adjacent street that ran the other
way from my street about a half a block away. They passed at all different
heights. One even grazed my ankle. I glanced to my right towards my house and
I noticed that the cat had come out of the house behind me. It was extremely startled. I could hear them, these
little silver balls. I could hear them crashing through the trees and bushes behind me. They almost seemed to move
more like animals than something mechanical. They made a sort of shishing
sound. So, this is a fleet of tiny little orblike UFOs. Very odd. Now, here
is an interesting case which occurred in 1977 to a very young witness. She was
only 5 years old, but says she remembers this vividly. Again, one night in
1977, she and her mother were driving westbound on West 6th Street towards
Mahan. And you can see this intersection here. She was sitting in the front passenger seat and reaching this
intersection, there was St. Edmond's Parish Church, which again you can see
here. and they both saw an object hovering at very low elevation directly
above the church steeple. And as the witness says, I didn't know what it was.
I'd never seen or heard of such things, nor did I know they existed. Mom went
quiet. She stopped the car, stared a moment, then turned the car right
around. I was so confused. She said she didn't know what it was. It was about
the size of 10 or more cars, all silver, and it had white lights all around its
edges. You could see them rotating with the craft very slowly directly above the
church cross. I had no idea what it was. We drove straight home. Mom asked me to
go tell my father what we had seen. I had no clue. So, I went to the kitchen,
grabbed two cereal bowls, and put them rim to rim. and he said it was a UFO. He
also told me it wouldn't hurt me, but I had nightmares for months. Very close
encounter there. Here's another one in 1977, April 20,
1977. This case actually found its way into several newspapers and journals, I
think, because the witnesses were trained observers. Their names were George Throp and Margaret Manor. They
were both weather officers employed at the Vancouver weather office. It was
after midnight. Their shift had just ended and they were driving their car out of the Vancouver International
Airport when they saw a bright blue flash of light towards South Vancouver.
And looking up, they both saw a cigar-shaped object, orange on top and
brilliant blue on the bottom. and it had a row of dark port holes along the side.
They said it appeared to be huge, larger than a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. And they
would know being trained observers, but as George Thrup says, we saw the thing
so plain was traveling as fast as a jet fighter and there was no sound at all.
And Margaret Manor says, I was so stunned. It was so fast I didn't get a
good look at it. It was a hazy blue and it didn't make a noise. Both said it
frightened them so badly that they had trouble sleeping for weeks after the incident. So many cases. Here's an
impressive multiple witness sighting which occurred in 1978. The main witness is Sandy. She was
four years old at the time of her encounter and was sitting on the couch with her two older siblings when all
three of them simultaneously noticed a UFO hovering outside. They don't
describe it in any detail, but they do say they jumped up screaming and ran
outside on the street to watch this thing. And by the time they got out there, there was already a crowd of
their neighbors watching this object. And in fact, their next door neighbor had a camera and was furiously snapping
photographs of this object. After just a few moments, this craft darted away very
quickly, disappearing from view in about two to three seconds. Now, according to
the witness, the next day, their neighbor, who had taken many photos, said that three men showed up at his
house and confiscated his camera and film. So, needless to say, these
photographs have never been seen publicly. All right, moving along. 1985.
I like this case cuz it's a schoolyard UFO encounter. As you may know, I wrote a whole book on schoolyard UFO
encounters. This one's not in there, though. So many schoolyard cases. This
involves a class of eight-year-olds, second graders, who are in a portable detached classroom separate from the
main building, of course, in Vancouver, when during the middle of their lessons,
someone looked out the window and shouted out, "Whoa!" All the students and the
teachers rushed out and saw what appeared to be a sort of plane like object. The problem was it was at very
low altitude over the school field and it also appeared to be hovering in place. It was so large that it stretched
from the field over the top of the school itself. There's not a lot of detail on this whether there was noise
or exactly what this object looked like, but the witness does admit it could have been a military plane, but as he says,
this was a very strange encounter. He's looking for other witnesses who may have seen this thing. Next case, 1990. This
one involves a humanoid. This 7-year-old witness says that he and his family were staying at
the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Vancouver. He was sleeping between his
parents on a large king bed in the hotel room when he woke up in the early morning to see a very small figure
standing at the foot of the bed. And as he says, the figure was very short and
skinny. I remember how tiny and fragile it looked. It had grayish pink smooth
skin. Although it was very dark, it was almost glowing in a way. It had darkish
eyes and I could tell it was staring at me. I remember looking at it startled
but not afraid. I blinked and it sort of just vanished. For my entire life since,
I have never seen anything like it. It's an interesting case. It sounds like a
gray ET and strange that it's seen in a hotel room, but I have to tell you, I
have many other cases of that. And as any UFO researcher will tell you, an encounter can happen anywhere. Here's
another really interesting case. This occurred on January 15, 1997.
It was 6:00 a.m. Now, after seeing a strange white light a few days earlier,
the witness saw it again, but this time it seemed to approach her house.
Suddenly, it was stationary right outside her window. It started flashing a row of multicolored lights. She said
green, orange, and red. And it was close enough that she could hear a whooing
noise coming from it. now panicked, she was on the second floor. She grabbed her
baby, ran downstairs, and called 911. The officer who answered the phone,
asked her a few questions, and transferred her call to the Chiliwack Air Force Base. So, the witness again
explained her encounter to the person who answered the phone, and they transferred her call again, this time
to, get this, NORAD. So the witness told her story for the third time and the
person on the line said that they would call her back later. Now that afternoon she did receive a call from an Air Force
captain who said that they had found quote nothing in your area. And then
kind of gas lit her by saying, "We don't believe in UFOs, so it must have been a
meteor that you saw." Clearly not a meteor if it's flashing colored lights and it's right outside your window. That
same year, a few months later, June 13, 1997, a truly spectacular sighting
occurred that night, when a lady was babysitting her grandson. This is a real poignant encounter. It was about 11 p.m.
She had just gone to bed when she noticed this cluster of white lights at about, she estimates, 2,000 ft over the
city. But it was weird because it did not appear to be moving. She assumed at
first it was a plane and closed her eyes to go to sleep. But opening her eyes shortly later, she now noticed that this
object was larger and closer. And these lights were now flashing different
colors, gold, red, pink, and blue, and was also sending down beams of light. So
she walked up to the window, and she could now see that this was not just lights. It was a solid object. She said
it was shaped much like a hamburger. She was babysitting her grandson. So she
woke him up and he joined her at the window and started to tremble and cry with fear. She immediately reassured him
and told him, quote, "It was not dangerous, and I would protect him from it." She found a pair of binoculars, and
they each took turns looking at this object, which she said was huge. She estimates about the size of two
747s. Now, right below this object, she could see a black mass, which appeared
to be flashing out bolts of electricity. And after several minutes, they saw what
looked like a giant red building-sized object come out from the black mass and
dart across the sky. So fast, it was gone in two seconds. Immediately, this
hamburger-shaped object began to fade, as did this dark mass. But the witness
says that she was more excited than frightened. And as she says, "This experience was so powerful. I felt as
though it gave me a new lease on life. I cannot explain the experience. It was so
wonderfully nourishing. This was the most spectacular sighting that I have ever seen." Case after case after case.
Here's another one. May 15, the year 2000 was 10:50 p.m. as two men, Pete and
Louie, were star watching on the roof of Pete's condo in North Vancouver. One had a pair of powerful
binoculars and the other had a telescope. Suddenly, Louie shouts out, "What the hell is that?"
They both look and immediately see this large black V-shaped object which was
moving very quickly in perfect silence. They could see it in great detail. Both
notice that the bottom of this V had three triangle shapes on each arm and
one at the apex. was only in view for about 10 seconds, but certainly long
enough for them to estimate that it was at about 1,000 feet altitude and about
140 ft long and wide. Louie in particular said that the whole experience left him with an unsettled
feeling and quote the heebie-jebies. I can imagine one year later, sometime April
May of 2001, actually April morning in 2001, there were two brothers, aged seven and
nine, they were in their bedroom getting dressed when movement through the bedroom skylight caught their eyes, and
they saw two objects, which you can see here, with the appearance kind of of
quote brown Idaho potatoes. These two objects zoomed silently past the
skylight. And this setting lasted only a few seconds. But here's where it gets
interesting. Because for 10 minutes afterwards, one of the brothers complained to his mother that he was
hearing a quote mumbling conversation in his head. So this sounds like telepathic
communication. And what's also very interesting is it wasn't the end because
one month later on May 7, 2001, again in the morning, they saw another even
stranger looking UFO. This one was very close about 30 ft from their house. They
estimate they watched it for just 15 seconds. You can see their drawing of it here. They said it looked kind of like a
jellyfish, almost had a jellyike texture. They estimate it was about 25
ft across. And again, that wasn't their only sighting. A couple of years later,
they saw another one of these potato looking objects. Again, so clearly some
kind of contact is going on here. That same year, another interesting case. Again, this is quite brief, but
certainly dramatic because it involves a daylight disc. June 25, 2001, around
10:30 a.m., the witness was walking along Georgia Street in North Vancouver
when they saw a large silver discshaped craft. Sort of your classic flying
saucer. It had a dome on top, was highly reflective, enough so that he could see
the image of the clouds reflecting on its surface. And again, huge. He
estimates that it was about five times the size of a 747. He watched it for about 20 seconds
when it went into a cloud bank and never came out. Here's another really interesting case. October 31st,
2003. Per the witness, it was 300 a.m. when he noticed a strange object which
appeared to be hovering just a few hundred feet over English Bay in the Stanley Park area of Vancouver. This is
a huge part now. He could instantly see this was your classic flying saucer. He
said it had numerous colored lights rotating around the circumference. Red, orange, green, blue, yellow, white. Very
much your classic saucer. Said it made no sound and was moving so slowly in a
kind of wobbling motion. Sometimes it would hover. He guessed it was about one
mile away, but he lost sight of it when it moved behind a building. He also
noted that this thing was so visible, so obvious that anyone who was in this area
had to have seen it. But as far as he knows, he's the only witness. One final
case. I did cover this before, but it is in Vancouver, so I'll repeat it. This
was February 12, 2015. It comes from Canadian researcher and author Nathaniel
Bridlin and is featured in his book Crawlers, a conclusive case book. It's a
humanoid case, that's why I wanted to include it. The witness, Ellie, is anonymous. Was early in the evening. She
was taking a nap while her boyfriend went out to get some food and she woke up to hear the familiar sound of what
she thought was him walking up the stairs. Turned out it wasn't him at all. She was still a bit groggy as she got
out of bed. She knocked over a can on her bed table and went to the glass doors leading to the stairs. And as she
did, she was shocked to see a very tall figure standing in front of her. She said it was so tall she had to crane her
neck upwards to see it. She's estimating eight or 9 ft tall. She said it had a
skinny body, pale white beige skin, incredibly long arms and fingers, didn't
see any mouth, but she did see that it had a large oval bald head and huge dark
eyes and seemed to be glowing with white yellow light bright enough to illuminate the hallway and was holding its arms out
towards her as if asking for a hug. So, this really shocked her, as you can
imagine, and she was really surprised that this wasn't her boyfriend. And now,
seeing its long arms and fingers reaching out, she was afraid it was going to touch her. But very quickly,
her response to it changed, and she was amazed to find that she wasn't scared of it at all. And instead, she felt strong
feelings of calmness, tranquility, even caring and love. and she found herself
returning back to bed very calmly. She says it's almost like it sensed her fear
and was stretching out its arms and saying, "Stay calm. Behave. It's all right." She had the sense that the being
was incredibly powerful and felt almost like a young child while in its
presence, like she had to be respectful to it. She said she almost felt drugged as she crawled back into bed, but
glancing back to her doorway, it was gone. Well, there you go, guys.
Especially Ian and Oreo. Thank you again for suggesting that location. I learned
a lot. So many different types of cases. Once again, proving my point that UFOs
are seen everywhere on this planet. So, now let's move to our next location,
which is Lake Havsu, Arizona. This is actually Lake Havsu City. A lot of very
interesting cases there. some quite high profile. This is by special request from
Leix Leather. So, I really want to thank you for suggesting this location. I've
been there before actually. I've got quite a few friends in Arizona, so it was a fun area for me to explore
personally. But yeah, some amazing encounters there, which I think you'll find pretty interesting. So, Lake Havsu,
Lake Havsu City isn't huge. 47 square miles, some 60,000 people. The lake is
man-made, artificial. It's a very popular tourist destination, and in fact, this area does have a UFO museum.
I found nine cases here. The first was in summer of 1968. This is an impressive
case of a solid craft over Lake Havsu. The witness doesn't recall the exact
date, but certainly the event remains vivid. As he reported to Newark, and I
quote, "It was a hot day and a clear blue sky. I had just shot up a
three-stage model rocket with a lizard payload and was walking through the
desert trying to recover it. I saw a flash of light come from behind me. When
I turned around, there was a chrome cigar-shaped object with no lights or
markings just hanging there right in front of me. It was shaped kind of like a tiny twoman submarine, totally silent.
I stirred it for about 10 seconds, thinking maybe it was a balloon. Then it
dipped to one side and disappeared in an instant. It was too close to be an
illusion. I remember saying to myself that was not of this earth. I didn't
tell anyone or even remember this until the late 1990s. Now I remember it very clearly. I
haven't had anything like that happen again. So this case is interesting for a
number of reasons. It's only one of many on record in which toy rockets, not to
mention actual rockets, have provoked the appearance of a UFO. I did a whole
episode on my channel about this sort of thing. It's also interesting to me that he completely forgot about this
encounter, but then it came back to him. That always is kind of a red flag indicating possible deeper levels of
contact. Certainly a fascinating case. This next one got a lot of publicity.
This occurred on March 17, 1969. This was published in several newspapers
and UFO journals. It was 3:42 on in the afternoon, March 17. Again, two pilots,
Herman Slater and Ben Ripley, you can see them here. They took off from Lake
Havsu in their Cessna 150. And just 12 minutes later, as they were over the
nearby Buckskin Mountains at an elevation of about 5,000 ft, something
strange happened. Then Ripley said he had a very unusual impulse. I'll just
quote him as he says, "I'll never know why. I had the urge to unfasten my seat
belt and lean over to look down to the left." But he did. And to his shock,
there was a formation of about 25 flying saucers. You can see their drawing here.
Now, he didn't say anything to his pilot, Herman Slater, but just pointed at them. And Herman immediately shouted
out, "What the hell are those things?" And as Herman says, "Then I saw them. I
wondered who in the hell could be flying that low, that fast, that far out. There
were about a dozen in a kind of center cluster, and the others were grouped around them
half-hazardly. They weren't jets, sunspots, or not even shadows since
there wasn't a cloud in the sky." So he described these objects as quote white opaque with a large black stripe leading
back on the outer edge from a slight protrusion at the forward section of their oval shape. He estimates that the
objects were about 500 to,500 ft above the mountains. They were undulating and
dipping kind of following the contour of the terrain but all in precise unison.
He estimates that these objects were moving at about 250 to 300
mph. Now, Ben Ripley noted that these objects were moving on a course that
would take them directly over Havasu City Airport. Both were incredibly
shocked by the site. As Herman Slater says, "My hands broke out in a cold
sweat after what we saw in that 15 or 20 seconds." Now, researcher James
Macdonald, an excellent researcher, interviewed both men and submitted a report to NIKAP. Both the pilots agreed
that they would never have seen these objects had not been Ripley received that very strange impulse to unbuckle
his seat belt and look down and to the left. Now later it was discovered that at
about 15 or 20 minutes after their sighting a pilot and a co-pilot of a
commercial aircraft approaching Phoenix said that they saw quote about a dozen
metallic looking objects flying towards the northwest over the White Tank
Mountains. Amazing. Now here's another interesting humanoid case. April 24,
1994. And as the witness says, I'll call her Maryanne. That is a pseudonym. She
says, "What I went through caused me to pack up my entire home, leave overnight,
and move an entire state away." Again, this began on April 24, 1994 around
dusk. Her daughter was the only other witness was 3 years old at the time.
They were outside their home in Lake Havsu when suddenly an eerie vacuum of silence descended over the area.
Researchers call this the Oz effect. They looked up and saw an immense object
moving slowly over their house only a few hundred feet high. They said this object had four large glowing domes
which appeared to be translucent and inside these she could see quote things
milling around inside. The object slowly moved away leaving nothing but a strange electrical
smell. But following the sighting, she learned that the security guard at her place of employment also reported seeing
a UFO on the same night. It was just two weeks later she arrived home to see a
strange quote dark figure running out of her house through the back kitchen and
other paranormal strange events occurred which Maryanne refuses to talk about as
she says they are just too frightening. So after feeling all of this she started
to also feel like she was being watched. She would wake up in the middle of the night in fear. All these odd events were
happening. She shared them only with her family because, as she says, "At first I
tried to talk about it to others, but after much ridicule, I stopped and kept it to myself. Still, she was determined
to share her encounter in hopes of receiving some kind of validation." And as she says, "Now, for some reason, my
senses are begging me to reach out. So, for my own peace of mind, I'll give this one last try. I just want to put this
thing to bed." So she reported this all to Muon. A very profound series of events
certainly for her. All right, moving along. June 30th, 1996, it was 1:10 a.m.
when a group of witnesses were outside their home in Lake Havsu and noticed this weird shimmering effect in the
night sky, which made the stars seemed to sort of jiggle. It was very odd. And
it was shortly later they noticed two what they described as iridescent green
objects which were approaching Lake Havsu from the west. They appeared to be
flying side by side but would occasionally seem to fuse together and then separate. As they got closer, this
glow faded, and they could now see a solid craft with a kind of oval shape
and a flattish rear. There were three rows of lights on the bottom, they said,
flashing and changing colors. Now, the witnesses believe they may have had missing time because this sighting
seemed to last about 10 minutes. But by the time the objects were gone from view, they noticed that the moon had
moved a considerable distance across the sky. So, as the witness says, I
sincerely believe this sighting was something important in all of our lives.
And the answer to who and what that was will come to us shortly. The next case I'd like to cover occurred on December
24, 2000, Christmas Eve. Two witnesses were driving through Lake Havsu City
when they noticed an eggshaped craft about 300 ft overhead. They said it had
a bright light on top, another on the bottom, and two rings of smaller lights around the body of the craft. The bottom
light was so bright it appeared to be sending down a beam of light towards the ground. And this object sort of floated
back and forth and moved also in an upward direction, occasionally stopping.
They went to a friend's house, but by the time they got there, this object had moved to such a distance that it
appeared only like a star-like light in the sky, but still brighter than any other star. and they saw it seem to
shoot out a small light, blink a few times, and disappear off into the distance. All right, next case. This is
the classic daylight disc sighting. It was midafter afternoon on May 15,
2005 when the witness noticed something unusual over Lake Havsu. as he says, "I
observed a bright gleaming silver disc across the lake over a place called
Havsu Landing. It appeared to be about a mile up in the sky and some miles away,"
he said, but he could see that it was moving at right angles and extremely high speeds and then would occasionally
stop and hover. It was close enough that he estimated it was 30 ft wide and 10 ft
tall. He went and got his roommates who also saw it. They were all impressed and
as he says, it was nothing we have ever seen before. It was a classic silver
disc. All right, just a few more cases. September 15, 2006, it was 8:00 p.m.
when a group of people, including a pilot, were all sitting poolside at their home in the center of Havsu City
when all the conversation died. Looking up, I saw a 100 foot wide object moving
in absolute silence, only about 50, maybe 100 feet overhead. It appeared to
be rectangular, but they're not sure because the shape was hard to make out as there was sort of a fuzzy glow around
the perimeter of this object. It wasn't moving that fast. They estimate about 50
mph. Now, the ones who saw it first said that this object was actually at a much
higher altitude, but dropped down quite low as it came over their heads and then
moved off. As the pilot says, I had never seen anything like this before.
This next case is very brief, but important because it's photographic.
This occurred on July 31st, 2009 when a witness was able to actually
videotape a daylight disc over Lake Cavsu. And this drew the attention of
UFO researchers because this is good footage. This video shows a shiny metallic domed discorting over the lake,
glinting in the sun. What you see here is just a clip from this videotape.
Now, the final case in Lake Havsu. This was August 16, 2010 and was published in
the Examiner newspaper. A family in Lake Havsu City was watching television when
the son looked out the window to see a large boomerang-shaped object being
pursued by eight jets. The parents and the son stopped watching television to
observe this show going on outside their home. They next saw quote a bright red
light and this was ahead of the jets.
This light stopped abruptly change direction. All the jets turned and tried to follow it and together they raced off
into the distance. Now it was just 30 seconds later a quote triangle-shaped
object with a deep red light in the center flew overhead followed minutes
again by these jets. Now, to their surprise, the red light was also back.
This time trailing the jets. So, this went on for the next 45 minutes. This
triangle-shaped object and the red light darting back and forth across the sky
while the jets vainly attempted to catch up. The witnesses are absolutely convinced that the maneuvers performed
by the UFOs were quote not possible with currently known
technologies. There you go, Leix Leather. I hope you enjoyed this segment. Lots of cases there. And again,
I just want to underline the fact that this is by no means comprehensive. I
really didn't cover the cases that involved unexplained anomalous lights because they just don't hold a lot of
data and they're just not nearly as interesting to me at least as metallic craft or humanoids, landings, and this
sort of thing. So, yeah, a lot more cases that I didn't cover because I
could spend just hours on any one of these locations. It's amazing to me. All
right, now let's move to the next location, which is the small town of Thomasville, North
Carolina. This is a really interesting location suggested by the Southern
Oracle. Found some very cool cases here, but again, not super large. 17 square
miles, about 27,000 people. So, I didn't find a whole
lot of cases. I found four major ones. Again, I could have covered a bunch of
anomalous light cases, but really decided to stick to just the really more interesting cases that are not so
ambiguous, ones that are genuine UFOs or humanoids. So, I think you'll find this
pretty interesting, the Southern Oracle. Certainly hope so. Let's get started.
While there aren't a lot of cases in Thomasville, some of these cases are really impressive. The first one I found
occurred on August 18, 1965 and was researched by George
Faucet. He says that the witness observed a metallic cigar-shaped object
with purple lights hovering only about 200 ft above the ground. It was, he
estimates, about 75 to 100 ft long, 8 to 12 feet wide, and about 10 ft tall, but
very close. Most strange was that he could hear it making a sound similar to
a sewing machine. He watched it for about 10 minutes, at which point it took off at terrific speed, disappearing from
view in about 10 seconds. This next case is astonishing.
April 14, 1977. It was about 11 p.m. and the
witness was on Old Highway 85 just past Holden Road heading south towards
Thomasville. He was about 19 miles out of town. And this is when he noticed a
bright orb in the sky alongside the highway. And as he says, the light was
mesmerizing. So he watched this thing hovering above the treeine, occasionally disappearing from view as he drove into
Thomasville. So he had just passed the Jacob Street overpass near the Paradise
Hotel. This thing had followed him for quite some distance when he saw that this orblike object had moved much
closer, now revealing itself to be a solid object at treetop level. He was
very impressed by this site. So he immediately pulled over next to an 18-wheeler who had also pulled over. He
got out of his car and stood next to this trucker. And both of them watched this object in absolute fascination. And
as the witness says, it was saucer-shaped with windows around the edge of the saucer and lights below the
windows. He said it was totally silent and had red, blue, and green lights. The
bottom was a smooth bowl shape and glowed a kind of amber color. So after
watching it together, not saying anything, the witness finally spoke and said, "Do you see that too? Do you hear
anything? What is it?" And the truck driver replied, "I see it, but I don't
believe it. It's making me feel crazy. I don't hear anything." Now, at this
point, they both saw something incredibly shocking. As the witness says, we were both calm, but amazed and
stunned by what we were seeing. We were both just staring. Suddenly, the
silhouette of a small, big-headed body walked to a window and seemed to look
down at us. I was shocked. So, now, filled with fear and panic, he asked the
trucker, "What does it want?" and the trucker replied fearfully, "I hope it's
not hungry." So, both witnesses simultaneously panicked, ran to their separate vehicles, and took off. Now,
when the witness arrived home, he was shocked to see that he was 45 minutes late, which was odd because, as he says,
it did not seem like we stood there very long. Lost time, I guess. So, there was
another interesting endote to all this, a kind of creepy aftermath to the whole event. When the witness learned that the
very next night there was a huge multi-vehicle accident at the very same
location on this highway where he saw this craft. As the witness says, I have
told only a few people about this because it sounds crazy. My close
encounter of the third kind changed my life. I have no doubt about what I saw.
I am convinced we are visited continually by extraterrestrials. This
next case is very dramatic. It was investigated by Muon Field investigator Robert Hair. Was 9:15 p.m. March 8,
1996. The witness was driving his pickup truck west on Emmanuel Church Road.
Passing a graveyard in a church on his right, this is when he noticed a strange object hovering over an empty field
right alongside the road, only about 30 ft off the ground. So he drove by it,
very impressed by what he was seeing, and decided to pull a U-turn and drive by it a second time. Still unable to
identify it, he pulled another U-turn, watched a third time, and then pulled
yet another U-turn to get a fourth look at it. He said it was discshaped sending
down a light blue green conical beam of light which got wider as it went down to
he estimates a diameter of about 3 ft. He didn't see anything on the ground where it was shining. But he does say
that the bottom perimeter of the craft was circled with brilliant red light that made it difficult to see the top
section. On the bottom section he could see what looked like four rocketlike
protrusions. They were each glowing with red light, no flames. And as he passed
it for the fourth time, this beam of light became extinguished, and the object immediately began to move
directly towards him. Soon it was about 10 ft high right over his truck. He
could still see these glowing red lights coming from the bottom protrusions.
Couldn't hear any sound. It then moved on overhead and began to gain in altitude. And as it moved off, he could
see a glowing rectangular light on the other side. It moved off slowly and
after about 15 minutes, it was still visible, although much higher in the sky and very distant. And that was the last
he saw it. One final case in Thomasville. It was August 15, 1998,
about 5:15 p.m. as a father and son were on a lake fishing in their boat.
Suddenly they noticed a flock of small birds flying up from behind them as though startled by something. And
looking in that direction they saw a metallic sphere with a kind of matte pettor finish hovering only seven maybe
8 ft above the water and only 20 ft away from them. Very close. It was totally
silent and it was hovering but still moving slowly side to side. And after
less than a minute of time, it moved off very slowly at first. Then quote,
"Disappeared at an unbelievable rate of speed." 7 years later, they decided to
report it to the National UFO Reporting Center. Thank you, The Southern Oracle. Pretty interesting, huh? Especially that
1977 encounter where the two witnesses saw humanoids and apparently had missing
time. It's crazy how many cases there are no matter where you look. So now
let's move to the next location which is the aisle of white. I've always been
intrigued by this location in the UK. This comes by special request from
Terrence Gibbon and this is a very unusual area. This is a pretty small
island about 147 square miles, 22.5
miles long, 13.5 miles wide. It's got a very interesting history. There's a
population of about 140,000 people, but it's a hugely popular tourist
destination, attracting millions of people each year. And you can see why because it's incredibly beautiful. It's
UK's sunniest location. and apparently also the most haunted. It's very rich
history includes a bunch of dinosaur fossils and just all kinds of really
interesting facts that come along with this aisle of white. It's got such a long history. But I really want to thank
you, Terrence, for suggesting this. It contains one of England's most famous and certainly most unusual humanoid
cases. And that alone makes it worth looking into this. The first case I could find in the aisle of white
occurred in January of 1952 and was investigated by UK researcher Jenny
Randles. She reports that she spoke to a man who reported an incredible encounter
some 30 years after he experienced it. As she says, "I received a call from a
man who said he was an RAF radar operator on the aisle of white in
1952. He described a tracking of eight or nine objects traveling at impossible
speeds, although there was no visual backup that he knew of, though this was implied by subsequent developments." He
had come to me 30 years on because the secret act files operate for only 30
years and he felt he could now tell the truth. So that's the beginning of the aisle of white encounters but certainly
not the end. A very widely viewed and well authenticated sighting in this area
occurred in an early winter morning in 1954 when numerous people described what
they call a flaming tadpole. This was bright enough to illuminate the area
around it as it was dodging in and out of the clouds. Reportedly, more than half a dozen people saw it over a wide
area. One of them was Walter Ligins, a milkman in Newport, again, Isle of
White, and he said this object had a brilliant green glowing head and a red
flaming tail. Now, unknown to him, another milkman several streets away,
also in Newport, saw this object, and both said it lit up the streets.
Interestingly, that same year, Coast Guard officials were puzzled by the appearance of what appeared to be giant
footprints. These were found at the edge of a 200 ft cliff. And these prints were
huge, 20 in long, 10 in wide, clearly imprinted in the recent snow, and very
close to the edge of the cliff. So close that it suggested that the creature may have actually fallen off the
precipice. The weather, this is related to the recent UFO sightings. Impossible to say, of course, but certainly
interesting and apparently unexplained. Two years later, August 30, 1956, on this day, Royal Air Force
pilot, flight lieutenant, and his navigator, Mr. Wallington, were flying a
Javelin jet over Solent. This is between the aisle of white and the mainland.
They were practicing intercepts with another Javelin jet. The pilot's name is
Wilbur Wright. And as he says, I saw a discshaped object off my starboard wing
tip. It was ahead of me. My navigator obtained a radar return at 19 miles. So
he estimates that this object was about 600 ft in diameter. That was his first
estimate. He said it maintained its position alongside his right wing. Now the other jet was about a half mile
behind and they could see it both visually and on radar. The pilots all
banked steeply and were able to approach within 10 miles of this object. Now,
Wilbur says, quote, "The object was now clearly seen as a metallic gray in
appearance, and he could see now that it was larger, so he revised his estimate of its size up to about 1,000 ft
across." They approached even closer within 8 miles of this object when it
suddenly zoomed so fast that the radar couldn't track it. but he estimates its speed was somewhere in the neighborhood
of 5 m per second. 3 years later, August 15,
1959, shortly after the British Interplanetary Society announced the appearance of quote, mystery satellites,
there were eight observers at the Isisle of White Moon Watch station setting up equipment when a fleet of five UFOs
appeared. They looked like points of light, but they sped overhead on two
separate tracks, one group and then another heading towards the south. They
were visible for about 2 minutes. None of the witnesses were able to identify the nature of the objects, but
absolutely rejected the possibility that they may have been meteors. Next case was investigated by Leonard G. Cramp.
He's a pretty famous UK researcher. It was 15 minutes after midnight on July
3rd, 1961 when a mother and daughter, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Taylor, were outside
their home in Ride. They were bringing in laundry off the line. This is when
Mrs. Smith saw what she first thought might be the light of a ship, but her daughter looked and told her that no,
this couldn't be a ship, as these lights were clearly in the air, and they were
getting closer. So, as they watched, these lights revealed themselves
actually to be two rows of lights. And it soon came close enough that they could see this was in fact a discshaped
craft with five port holes glowing with orange light. Pretty much your classic
flying saucer. Mrs. Taylor became concerned because, as she says, we
thought it was coming straight for us. It soon approached to a distance of
about a quarter mile. was at treetop level. You can see their drawings here.
And then it darted away at such fast speed that Miss Smith said it actually made her physically dizzy. They watched
it go off into the distance like a shooting star is how they compared it to. And all this was done in perfect
silence. But later looking where the object had hovered, they could see that it had left a glowing ring of light
which persisted for about 5 minutes before finally dissipating. Leonard Cramp did interview the
witnesses and was absolutely satisfied of their honesty and their observational
abilities. And he also writes, quote, "That same evening, several miles away
and a little earlier, a friend of mine saw bright lights in a remote field
which were preceded by a strange and very local whirlwind." Now, this next
case is so astonishing. It's a really well-verified, widely viewed case. And
it's a schoolyard encounter. This was on July 10, 1967, also investigated by Leonard
Cramp. It was 9:00 a.m. and a group of children were lining up on the school playground to enter their school in
Whippingham. Suddenly, one of the boys, who Leonard calls John, he saw a milky
white object shaped like two saucers placed end to end hovering silently
among the trees. He quickly pointed it out to his friends, and they all saw it only briefly before the teacher marched
them into the school. They were very excited about this. They could hardly wait for recess an hour and a half later
in the hopes of seeing it again, and didn't really expect to. But at 10:30, John was the first out. Looked where the
UFO had been, but it was gone. But then his friend Kenneth saw it in another
position in the sky, still at treetop level. So it apparently had been there for the whole hour and a half. At this
point, more than a dozen other kids saw this object moving erratically. They had the impression it was quote out of
control. They said it was getting lower and finally moved out of sight behind some trees and hedges. They said it was
huge, quote, much larger than a double-decker bus. So, questioning the boys carefully, Leonard believes this
object was probably close to 40 ft wide. And here's an interesting aftermath. As
later riding home on the bus, John looked out the window towards where they had seen this craft descending into the
fields and saw that the barley crops had been trampled in a straight line. right
up to the hedge where this object had gone down. So he didn't think or connect
this to the object, but a later investigation of these trampled
crops showed that some very unusual features. These trampled crops measured
anywhere from 3 ft across to 20 ft wide, but they were over 34 of a mile in
length all the way into another cornfield. And you can see the photos of them here. This is very odd. It looks
very much like an object kept touching down, riding, rising up, touching down again. You could possibly call this a
UFO crash or certainly one that seems to be having some difficulties. And an examination of
these plants showed that they were sharply cut off. There were weird vortex patterns. As one farmer in the area
said, "I have never seen anything like it before. This was far too localized to
have been a storm. And as Leonard Cramp says, these marks were quote, entirely
consistent with the description given by the boys regarding the way the object was moving. They found other strange
things. A bird had been killed right where this object apparently landed and its feathers were distributed over a
very wide area. They also found bits of concrete and sticks. Looked like they
had been carried up and deposited. Later, it was learned that there were other witnesses seeing a UFO moving
rapidly across the fields, bobbing up and down. Leonard Cramp calls the marks
in the field, quote, one of the most extensive and upto-date UFO ground
effects on record. They did use a Geiger counter, but found no evidence of
radiation. But as you can see from these photographs, these are very unusual markings. And although they can't say
for sure, they do seem to be connected to this amazing UFO sighting. Moving
along, on October 20, 1970, while driving from Shanklin to Ride to visit a
friend, a gentleman known only as Mr. Y noticed a large aircraft covered with
lights flying over the marshy area along the river Yar. Puzzled by these lights,
he pulled over and saw that this was actually a craft which had a wide ring of at least seven lights, different
colors, cherry red, turquoise, and white, was totally silent. So he
continued driving and saw that this object was now moving parallel to his vehicle as if pacing him. When it moved
about 900 ft behind his car, he stopped, got out of his car, and used his
flashlight to signal the craft. He then continued driving and says that this UFO
followed him and as he says at one time I thought it intended to land. So he
arrived at his destination, his friend's house, and his friend saw it too. He described it as quote playing hide and
seek between the treetops before it finally disappeared. Now following this,
Mr. Y began to see orbs of red light hovering in the sky and occasionally
following him as he drove. This kept happening to him and this came to a very
interesting conclusion some two years later on March 1st 1972 was about 910 p.m. Mr. Y was
sitting on the cliff side of Compton Bay when the tide came in unusually high and
he found himself trapped on the rocks and this is when he saw two yellow lights just 40 feet away just below the
surface of the water. He said they were quote peering up at me like the eyes of
some horrible sea monster. So this is a USO and he thinks the unusual tide that
trapped him may have actually been a result of this craft because after the craft went away, the tide went back out.
Mr. Y was able to hike back to his car and drive home. Now this seemed to be
the end of it. But in fact, it was just the beginning. Because it was one year
later that his 7-year-old daughter, we'll use the name Fay, had an encounter
that was destined to become the Isisle of White's most famous humanoid encounter. It was an encounter that is
so strange it still remains a topic of conversation today. It was one afternoon
in May of 1973 that Mr. wise daughter again, Fay, and her friend, a boy around the same
age, were both near Lake Common in Sandown. This is the marshy area, a golf
course, not far from the unused Sandown airport. You can see it here. And this
is when they both heard a strange siren-like wailing noise. Curious, they
walked towards this noise which disappeared as they got closer and they were crossing over this small foot
bridge over a narrow brook when they saw something very strange. A blue gloved
hand with three fingers emerged from under the bit bridge and of course it
was followed by the entire figure. The figure was holding what appeared to be a book but dropped it in the water. He
immediately splashed about to retrieve this object. grabbed it and the children
were now close enough to see that this figure was very tall. They estimate 7 feet tall and definitely not human. He
had no neck. The head appeared to be placed directly on the shoulders. He wore what looked like a pointed yellow
hat on his head, had a black knob on the tip, and what looked to them like two antenna on the sides. He wore a green
tunic with a red collar, white pants, all of which appeared to be worn out and
kind of ripped up. He had a white featureless face, except that there were
two triangular marks where the eyes would be, flat nostril holes framed by a
brown square and yellow unmoving lips. There were round markings on his white
cheeks, and he had a fringe of red hair, kind of bangs, hanging down over his
forehead. So, he not only looked strange and was dressed strange, he moved strangely.
They said this figure moved in a weird hopping motion, raising its knees abnormally high, and it walked over to
what looked to them like a strange metallic windowless hut just a short distance away and disappeared inside it.
At this point, the children were about 150 feet away when this figure
reappeared, and it was now carrying what looked to them like a black microphone.
It had a wire attached to it leading to a device. And it was at this point that
this whailing siren noise returned, and it was so loud that it was painful. The
boy almost ran away because of it. But the noise very quickly disappeared. And
this is when the being began to speak into the microphone apparently. But the sound echoed all around the two
witnesses as if this being was right next to them. And it spoke in perfect English. And what it said is
interesting. It said, "Hello, are you still there?" And the children felt like
the tone of his voice was very friendly. So they moved cautiously closer. They
could now see this figure very clearly. It had what looked like wooden slats protruding from it his sleeves. Mind
you, these are young children. So, uh we're not sure how reliable their
descriptions are, but they both saw this. And this uh being they said was
barefoot and they saw that each foot contained only three toes. He was
holding what looked to them like a large notebook and had written some letters in large print out of order. But he pointed
to them and basically these words spelled out hello. I am all colors Sam.
So this is when the being began to ask questions verbally though his lips did
not move. And they said the sound seemed kind of muffled as if someone's mouth was closed. And this being began to ask
the children about themselves. They in turn asked him questions about his strange clothes and why were they all
ripped up. This figure replied that he had only one set of clothes to wear. So
seeing a strange appearance, they asked if he was a man. And the being, they said, chuckled and said, "No." They
asked him if he was a ghost. And the being replied, "Well, not really, but I am in an odd sort of way." So they said,
"What are you then?" And he replied, "You know," with no further explanation
other than saying he had no name, that there were others like him, that he was
afraid of approaching people because they might hurt him. And this is when this experience escalated to what is
apparently what we might call an onboard encounter because this figure invited
the two children into this metallic hut. He told them he had just made it and
inside it was strange cuz it was quite spacious. There were two levels with blue green walls which they said had a
pattern of dials that had what looked like an electric heater, simple wooden
furniture. They went to the upper level which they said it had a metal floor. This being said he ate berries that he
drank water from the river but only after he cleaned it. Once inside the hut he took off his hat. The witnesses could
see round white ears, brown hair, and he did this little weird conquering magic
trick by placing a berry in his ear, moved his head forward. It caused the
berry to appear in his eye and then to his mouth. Oh, very strange, and it just
gets weirder. So, they stayed for about a half an hour, then said goodbye. They rushed away and told the first adult
they saw about their encounter. He did not believe them. The kids said that there were two men, two adults nearby
during this whole experience within view, but they did not seem to notice anything strange. So, they kept it
secret for a little while. But 3 weeks later, Fay did tell her father, Mr. Y,
who had previously had some UFO sightings. He was, as you might imagine, utterly astonished. But after
questioning his daughter, believed she was describing something she actually experienced. He questioned the boy and
he confirmed all these details. He does feel that her encounter is in some way related to his own. And
as he says, quote, I get the impression that Fay was somehow taken into a bubble
of alien reality created by this strange personage. I don't expect many people to
believe these strange facts, but my daughter still insists it was a true
occurrence. He says that he is both baffled and somewhat embarrassed by the whole ordeal. But yes, a very famous
encounter that is still talked about today. It's so odd. Here is a very
interesting sighting which occurred on January 14, 1976, just after
midnight. Mr. Rod Riddle went to lock the back door of his home in Ride when
something in the sky caught his eye. was a bright light high up in the western sky. He was puzzled by its strange
appearance. He watched it for about one minute trying to identify it and he noticed it was slowly moving towards him
and he estimates about 30 mph getting closer. So he quickly called out his
wife Jenny and sure enough this object descended, hovered briefly and moved
right over their house. They could now see that this object was a dark rounded object. And as Rod says, the outline was
just like a very large hovercraft, rectangular, but rounded at the ends.
There was no sound whatsoever. And they estimate that it was about 100 ft long,
50 ft wide, and no more than 300 ft over their home. Very low. Was in view for
about four minutes. As it moved overhead, Rod actually walked around the house to keep it in sight and saw it
suddenly accelerate upwards and away at fantastic speed. So, it looked almost as
if it had come down and targeted them and showed itself off to them. The next morning, they reported their sighting to
the Royal Air Force at Thorny Island, and it turned out that a meteorological officer had seen a very similar object
just 10 minutes before the riddles sighting. The officer on the phone told
Rod Riddle that they might get a phone call back from the Ministry of Defense. And sure enough, only 5 minutes elapsed
when the phone rang. An officer told him, quote, "We are extremely interested
and proceeded to question him all about the details of his sighting." This was interesting and kind of ironic because
the Ministry of Defense had long professed that there was nothing to the UFO subject. The riddle's sighting, much
to their chagrin, became publicized, causing them unwanted attention. But they did learn that there
were other witnesses. As a police spokesman said, we understand something
similar was reported in the Benbridge area about a week earlier. We just cannot explain it. But they found out
there was a third witness to the riddle sighting. A married couple were driving into ride at about 8:15 on that same
night when they saw a brilliant orange gold object reflecting the setting
sunlight. And it looked to them like a fuselage. But there were no wings, no tail visible, just this strange whirling
light underneath this object. And they didn't think too much about it until the riddle sighting was published in the
local newspaper. Next case, February 1976, just before 100 a.m., Laura Hill
woke up in her home at 34 Brier Close in Fort Gomer. She had to check on her
daughter who had recently broke her leg. And returning to her bedroom, she looked out the window and saw a large object
move quickly across the sky. She described this as quote oval, large, and
a solid disc of light ringed in a glow. She said it made a terrific whooing
noise and it moved in a straight line across the sky. Clearly not a meteor, she said. And she later learned that
eight people had recently reported seeing UFOs to the Ministry of Defense,
and she wonders if she had seen the same object they did. The next case actually involved a mini wave of sightings which
struck the aisle of white in October of 1978. A lady, Mrs. Gad reported seeing a
quote bright and large double light which could not have been a street light or a star. She said it moved right over
her home on Hinton Road in Carisbrook. And this was not the first time she had seen a UFO, but this was one of the more
dramatic sightings. However, it was just a few days later that her husband, Mr.
Jad was awoken by his cat pawing at the door and looking out his window, he saw
a quote flying saucer descending very slowly. He said it appeared to be
hovering over the Victoria recreation grounds near his home. So he quickly
woke his wife and together they watched this object for a few moments until it moved off. And Mr. Gad described this
sighting as quote frightening and incredible. A third sighting occurred just a few
days later to the wife of Reverend C. Target and their son Lucien. They were
driving near Atherfield Bay when they noticed an extremely bright flashing light descending towards the horizon.
And as she says, it could not have been a plane because it was too large, too
bright, and not accompanied by any noise. Just a few more sightings. The
aisle of white. This sighting was actually from the mainland in Sherbornne. The witness, Rita Griffiths,
says that she and her neighbor Wendy Wilkinson were saying good night when
they noticed a cylinder-shaped object with different colored lights overhead.
And as Rita says, it was a sort of object which had a long undercarriage
underneath revolving and there was a blue light in the middle. It was there for about an hour just hovering and
coming down and going up very slowly. So they watched this object actually release an orange sphere which started
at very high speed directly towards the aisle of white. And although the night was very cold, as Rita says, all of a
sudden we were burning hot and didn't feel the cold at all for 10 or 15
minutes. We are not a couple of nutters. Far from it. I have seen things in the
sky that can't be explained before. I truly believe in this sort of thing and it doesn't worry me. Next case,
September 28, 1980. It was late at night. Derek Fuller was driving to his
home in Ventner. His car was the only one on the road when he noticed a glowing arrowheadshaped object only
about 200 f feet above the ground to his right. And as he says, I was completely
mystified. I had never seen anything like it before. It was difficult to estimate its size, but it was much
bigger than my car, and it could have been as much as 40 feet across. So, we
watched it for about 1 and a half minutes as it moved at about 50 m per hour, grew dim, and then vanished. It's
amazing how many sightings there are. Just three more. January 21st,
1982, Muriel Upton and her friend Althia Richard were at their home on
Wilburforce Road in Bristonestone. And this is when they noticed a gold colored
sphere low in the western sky. And listen carefully to her description. As
she says, it appeared to have poles sticking out of the side of the circular
shape and was stationary at first and then dropped slowly down. Then it turned
very bright red, lighting the sky around it before disappearing as if someone had
turned off a switch. Now, bearing in mind that description, here's what the Coast Guard later said. They said that
the ladies had probably seen Venus and that the poles they described were created by the refraction of light. Now,
the witnesses probably do not feel this way because as they said, this sighting caused them both quote fear and
excitement. I don't know, maybe it was Venus, maybe not. Hard to say for sure.
Here's the next case. May 19, 1985, 900 p.m. Mr. Eric Spanner was enjoying the
view from the Rue down near Ventner. It was an unusually quiet evening, he said,
when he noticed a starlike light about a half mile out to sea, and it was so low over the water that it looked to him
like it had actually come out of the water. You might call this a USO. But after watching it for a few moments, he
saw that it was now moving towards the shore, not far from his location. As it
reached the shore, it rose up and began to follow the contour of the terrain about 60 ft above the ground, then
stopped and hovered over a set of red brick houses along down road just across
the valley from where he stood. And he could now see that it was a glowing discshaped craft, probably about 8 ft in
diameter with two lights on top. Now it then moved, veering in his direction,
close enough that he could now hear a faint whining noise, and his curiosity
turned to alarm when it began to swerve towards him. And he thought to himself,
"My God, it's seen me. It's coming towards me." It soon came to within a
100 ft of him and went by him to his relief right over a nearby 12t high
hedge, and then disappeared behind it. So he ran to keep it in view, but it was
gone. He reported to the police and learned that the Royal Navy was conducting radar tests near this area.
Now, Eric himself is not convinced he necessarily saw an ET craft, but he
knows that it definitely was not a helicopter as this theory was put forth. He did write to the Navy about it, but
received no response. Newspaper reporters also made queries to the Navy
and they were told that the Navy quote has no record of any of these sightings in its files. Here's a final case.
August 1989 was 5 minutes before midnight August 3rd when Dory Smith
looked out the window of her home located on St. Edmund's Walk in Wooten
and she saw a quote brilliant white object in the sky. Looking at it, she
could see that it was quote completely round and a mass of lights and went right over the house. So, it's a brief
sighting, but pretty close up. She phoned authorities, but the island police said that they had received no
other reports of strange objects in the sky. Thank you, Terrence. I hope you found that interesting. I sure learned a
lot. It's amazing to me how many cases there are for, you know, a relatively small area. That sandown clown case.
Yeah, world famous. One of the most unusual I've ever heard. I always wanted to take a deeper look at it. So
interesting. So unusual. So, thanks again for suggesting this location.
Amazing. So, there you go. Four new locations across the planet, each with a
long and rich history of UFO encounters. Should come as no surprise. I keep
telling you UFOs are ubiquitous. These things are seen everywhere. And this
proves three major points to me at least. One is that UFOs are far more
common than people realize. too is yeah they're visiting every location on this
planet which I think goes to show that the ETSs and I do think that's what
we're dealing with here the ETSs are conducting what amounts to a publicity campaign announcing their presence I can
only speculate but I think that they want us to know that we are not alone
and I think this series the hometown series proves that almost unequivocally it's with so many cases
One has to explain why. Why would they visit every single location on this planet? Uh perhaps it is just for
purposes of scientific exploration. But some of these cases look very much like what UFO researchers
call a display. So yeah, I do think they want to be noticed. But amazing how just
in these four locations, the entire UFO phenomenon is represented. you could
learn pretty much all you need to know about UFOs from one location. So, that
is really cool. That's it for today. Thank you guys. I hope you enjoyed this
latest installment of UFOs in your hometown. If you have a location you'd
like me to look up, please feel free to send it my way. But also, please be
patient. My list now of locations is almost at 1,000. And some locations I'm having a
little bit of a hard time with. Some because they are very small, not very
populated locations and it's hard to find a case there. But more commonly, it's because these locations have too
many cases. And when there's a lot of cases, it makes it very difficult to
research. But I'm doing my best. So, thanks again for all of you who suggested a location. I truly appreciate
it. Thanks for watching. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions,
keep searching for the truth, and most important of all, keep having fun, and I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
