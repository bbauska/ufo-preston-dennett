MEETING THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS: TEN TRUE CASES
Nov 8, 2024

Summary:
Nov 8, 2024
Thousands of people have had the experience, if not millions: a face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials. Cases come from all over the world, and they share profound commonalities and differences. It appears that the humanoid form is the universal template. And yet, many cases have rare or unique elements of high strangeness that defy comprehension. This article/video presents ten cases of this kind. These cases have much to teach us about the UFO phenomenon and these strange visitors to our planet.

THEY CAME BACK. One night in September of 1951, Louise McDougall, her husband and three friends sat on the lawn of their homes in Bloomington, California. Sensing somebody looking at her, Louise saw a disc-shaped craft with portholes hover overhead. Through the portholes, she saw four human-looking men in jumpsuits looking down at her. She grabbed her flashlight and shone it at the craft, causing it to dart away. But 15 minutes later, it was back again!

“WE RAN AS FAST AS WE COULD.” One summer day in 1958, 11-year-old Hilary Porter and her friend Janet were walking near their homes in Farnborough, UK when a  silver craft appeared overhead. It promptly descended, a door opened, and a tall humanoid figure appeared in the doorway. After a few moments of shock, the girls fled. Soon, Hilary would learn that she was a UFO contactee.

HUMANOIDS IN GOSHEN. On the night of October 19, 1973, Mrs. Wright reported a UFO over her home in Goshen, Ohio. Researcher Charles Wilhelm arrived to visit her, but instead interviewed her neighbor, “Sam,” who described coming upon a landed UFO and humanoids. He wasn’t the only witness. Two weeks later and a short distance away, Don Brandenburg came upon a landed UFO. Later that night, a Mrs. Gilbert saw a strange humanoid in the exact same spot.

THE GOFFSTOWN VISITATIONS. On the afternoon of November 4, 1973, Rex Snow of Goffstown, New Hampshire (and his neighbors) saw a flying saucer. That night, an odd light filled his backyard. Looking outside, he saw two humanoids in silver jumpsuits collecting samples from his yard. Three days earlier and 6 miles away, Florence Dow was scared by the appearance of a faceless humanoid on her porch. Six hours later, Lyndia Morel had a scary encounter with a UFO and humanoid in Goffstown. Meanwhile, police stations across the state were flooded with UFO calls.

THE MONK-LIKE ALIENS. On the night of November 13, 1973, Ann Dolphijn Vermeulen woke to see three strange humanoid figures outside the window of her home in Uden, Netherlands. She watched them for five minutes as they walked down the street and move away. Returning to her bedroom and looking out the window, she saw a large glowing red sphere.

THE GLOWING MEN. At 6:30 on August 15, 1981, more than twenty people who worked at the La Rochelle estate in Zimbabwe were amazed by the appearance of a glowing sphere and two to four glowing humanoid figures in white jumpsuits. Panic reigned as several witnesses fled into the forests. Others stayed to see the sphere move around the estate. Soon the figures left, leaving behind an enduring mystery.

IT CAME FROM THE SKY. One day in spring 2003, three cement truck drivers arrived at their destination in Reinoso de Cerrato, Spain just in time to see a bizarre-looking humanoid descend from the sky and stand on the ground 30 feet away. The being was 5 feet tall, dressed in a jumpsuit, but its head appeared to be composed only of a hollow transparent ring. After a few moments, the figure flew back upwards and disappeared into the distance.

THE ALIENS BY THE MEGALITHS. One day in February 2008, two women were visiting Ile de Berder, France to see the many mysterious megalithic structures at this location. Instead they saw a strange glowing sphere followed by the appearance of four gray ETs. One of the witnesses was left with the impression that she was being warned about the dangers of nuclear power.

THE ALIEN IN MY BEDROOM. On the night of November 9, 2013, “Melissa,” was in the bedroom of her home in Virginia Beach, VA when a strange feeling overcame her. Looking up, she saw a tall gray-skinned humanoid appear in her room. She was unable to move as it approached. She felt herself being drawn upwards and blacked out. The next morning, her brother complained about the dogs barking furiously and a brilliant light appearing outside the home.

THE WITHLACOOCHEE ET. On the night of April 2, 2015, “Philip” was driving an 18-wheeler truck on State Road 41 in the Withlacoochee Forest in Florida when he noticed a short, uniformed figure holding a strange device standing alongside the road. As he passed by, he saw that it did not appear to be human. This turned out to be one of several encounters occurring in this area.

Ten cases, each providing more evidence of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. The truth can no longer be denied, ignored, or explained away. We are being visited by ETs.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal today I'm going to be talking about humanoids I love these humanoid cases don't get me wrong sightings are
interesting any type of UFO encounter is interesting but I find these humanoid cases most fascinating I call this
episode meeting the extra terrestrials 10 true cases I've tried to pick cases
that I think are a little bit obscure lesser known but ones that have something to contribute to our
understanding of ETS who they are where they come from why they're here the 10
cases I've chosen today date from 1951 all the way up to 2015 some recent cases
they involve all different types of humanoids the vast majority of these
cases today do involve multiple Witnesses so some really credible cases
for sure and coming from a wide variety of locations all over the Earth
including France the Netherlands Spain UK Zimbabwe Africa and five from the
United States including Florida California Ohio New Hampshire and
Virginia so let's just get started because this is going to be a pretty long episode we'll see
I never know exactly but the first case I'd like to talk about today I call they
came back this one occurred in September of 1951 in Bloomington
California and the thing I like about this particular case is the behavior of
the ETS not only did they come very low putting on an obvious display for
multiple Witnesses but they returned so this is very interesting this is
admittedly a very short account but it's super interesting and it comes from the files of Lucius fish he's a
well-respected UFO researcher who is perhaps best known for creating eons
that's the UFO news clipping service this case began around 8:00 p.m. one
summer evening in September of 1951 as Louise McDougall her husband and
three others were sitting on the lawn outside their trailer home located in Bloomington Cali California and suddenly
she had the weird feeling that somebody was watching her and looking up sure
enough somebody was it was a classic Flying Saucer hovering at very low level
per Louise it was no more than 20 ft overhead she said it had a classic saucer shape she estimates it was about
100 ft in diameter had a metallic quote gunmetal silver appearance and there
were several tall kind of rectangular Port holes or Windows located around the
lower half of the craft these were giving off an Amber glow and standing in
these windows Louise could see four men she said each of them had shoulder length hair and each of them were
dressed in a onepiece jumpsuit now Louise just happened to have a spotlight handy which she quickly
turned on and pointed directly at this craft and apparently in response this
craft immediately shot off moving in perfect silence and at incredible speed
she said and that seemed to be the end of it but of course it wasn't about 15
minutes later the craft returned to the exact same spot and the same figures
apparently the same were still visible in the windows and this time the craft remained for a full 6 to 7 minutes
before taking off to the southeast and leaving for good so this really quite
impressed her and in fact it was 10 years later in 1961 she reported the encounter to
naikap that's the national investigative committee for aerial phenomenon and still years after that
she was thinking about it because 14 years later she reported again in
1975 to Lucius ferish I think that's undeniably a fascinating and important
multiple witness case you can see it did affect the witness Pro profoundly in that she never forgot about it and tried
repeatedly to get some attention paid to this case and it's also interesting
because it's a good example of human looking ETS and a what researchers call
a UFO display so many cases of that it's pretty clear the ETS are putting on a
publicity campaign and basically announcing their presence and doing their part to move disclosure forward
all right let's move to the next case which I call we ran as fast as we could
a direct quote from one of the witnesses this occurred in the summer of 1958 in
farboro UK I like this case because it's very
unusual also what I find interesting about it's a daylight case involving humanoids seen at a very
lowlevel craft and also it's not a one-off in fact the main witness in this
case has had multiple encounters and I find that to be more the rule than the
exception this very interesting encounter occurred to Hillary Porter who
was about 11 years old and her best friend they were taking a walk one
summer day in 1958 near their homes in farboro Hampshire England and as Hillary
says in her own words suddenly something took my eye an object glinting high in
the bright sunlight it was a disc-shaped craft which I could see in the distance
hanging over trees up on Holly Park you can see the exact area here Hillary
immediately shouted out to her friend Janet to look so Janet looked up and saw the disc too in fact both girls were
absolutely amazed at what happened next as Hillary says as we looked harder we
both observed a doorway appear in the side of the UFO complete with a figure
standing inside in the blink of an eye the craft zoomed forward till it was
hanging low in the sky was then hovering over near to an old factory called the
drum laundry which was quite close to where we stood by now we could see that
the saucer craft was quite sizable although frightened we dared to continue
watching the UFO and clearly saw a humanoid form standing there a fairly High St
looking at us from the open doorway on the side of this craft so the two girls stood there and
shocked amazement Hillary is not sure how long this observation was but at
some point the object suddenly flew away and as Hillary says the main upshot of
it all was that we were so terrified we ran as fast as we could from the scene
back up to our road and into our homes and we didn't play together again for
quite a while as we we were too scared to go outside so later Hillary did begin to
wonder if perhaps she was taken on board because throughout her life she began to
experience many instances of contact including being taken on board but it
was just a few years after her encounter in 1962 that Hillary had the opportunity to
see a movie she knew nothing about it was called The Day the Earth Stood Still
and when she saw the scene where this UFO this Flying Saucer landed and the ET
clat two came out her own reaction really surprised her as she says this
was like deja vu that sequence terrified me to such a degree that I started
crying I wasn't with Janet that night but another friend who saw my tears and
came over to comfort me yet nothing could calm me down it was no good I had
to go home running out of the hall and all the way home I arrived totally
exhausted so this ended up being a part of Hillary's Awakening to the fact that she was a UFO contacte says Hillary I
don't think for one minute Janet or I ever really forgot the full details of
our mindblowing UFO sighting but the brain or mind has its own way of coping
with such things and would prefer to Simply file certain parts of the memory
away so later Hillary went public with her many many UFO experiences she's done
newspaper interviews appeared on podcasts and even wrote two books about her encounters one is called the Diaries
and Recollections of an alien abductee and another is a fully illustrated book
called quote an alien experiencers art with 85
illustrations I have to give kudos to Hillary Porter for coming forward and sharing her encounters when the vast
majority of people don't probably could have done a whole episode alone on her encounters really glad she wrote a
couple of books she's an amazing amazing artist that always helps to help
visualize what people are seeing now let's move to the next case
this one has gotten quite a bit of attention we call this one humanoids in
Goan this occurred on October 19 197 3 in Goan
Ohio and it's a really interesting case involving actually a number of sightings
now this case actually involves a series of events more than one case actually
the first case comes from husband and wife researchers Charles and Jerry
Wilhelm they are the head of the Ohio UFO investigators League which they
formed and they had received a phone call from a lady by by the name of M Wright she was from the city of Goan
Ohio and she said that around 8:30 p.m. on October 19
1973 she saw a quote bright fall of light moving in an easterly Direction
and went over a hill it looked like it landed in my neighbor's field so this sounded like a good case
to the wilhelms a few days after receiving the report Charles Wilhelm went to the area and contacted did Mrs
Wright fortunately she was not available nevertheless he went to the farm next
door to investigate and was greeted by a gentleman in his 60s who was at first
reluctant to say anything but after Charles assured him that he would not be
identified and gave him actually the pseudonym Sam so that he could remain anonymous Sam agreed to talk about what
he experienced and he revealed that not only had he seen the UFO but that it had
in fact landed as Mrs Wright said and he had seen humanoids Sam explained that each
evening he was in the habit of taking his two hounds for a walk and on
the night in question October 19 1973 it was around 900 p.m. he was out
with his dogs and was returning home when suddenly his dogs began quote tugging and acting funny and they seem
to be drawn towards a hill where there was this small Ravine not far from Sam's
house so going to that area Sam was amazed to see a very large 50ft wide
disc-shaped craft had a little Dome on top it had four pulsating lights two
blue and two white was dimly lit and it was resting on three Landing legs only
about 300 ft away from Sam even more amazing he saw three human figures
standing beneath the craft while one was standing by a small ladder which led up to the craft and he appeared to be about
to climb back into it one was actually kneeling on the ground and the other was standing nearby and it looked to Sam
like they were looking for something he said they appeared to be of normal height but seeing these figures Sam's
dogs began quote raising hell and quote carried on something fierce they
actually refused to move any closer the first figure was now climbing the ladder
and apparently noticed Sam and the dogs because he turned and looked directly at
them he immediately finished climbing this ladder and entered into the craft
meanwhile the other two figures remained for a few minutes and then climbed the ladder and went into the craft as well
this ladder retracted up into the underside the craft rose slowly into the air making a quote train like whistle
then it shot up into the sky and was gone now the investigator Charles Wilhelm went with the man to the side of
the UFO landing but there was no evidence of any Landing traces cuz as it turned out the ground was very spongy
covered with moss and it just sprang back up if you stepped on it now that alone is a pretty interesting event but
perhaps related to it are two other events which occurred around the same time and
area this next one was investigated by Ted bletcher it was about two weeks later in November of 1973 the exact date
is unknown but a gentleman by the name of Don Brandenburg was driving along
Branch Hill Guinea Pike Road near the intersection of Ward's corner you can
see this here and this is only about 6 miles away from Goan where Sam had his
encounter and as Don is driving down this road he saw a star-like object
moving fast and coming closer this was that night he could now see that it was
a fiery object of some kind it approached with a sort of spinning motion approaching at an angle then made
a sharp angular turn and now revealed itself to be a craft complete with squarish Port holes glowing Blue from
inside suddenly it stopped spinning and landed in an open field only about 450
ft away and Don could now see that it wasn't was in fact a 100t wide 30ft High
craft oval-shaped he said it was kind of shaped like a coconut laying on its side
it made no sound as it landed and after just a few seconds it immediately took
off so I don't know why it landed and then just took off but this is what Don
Brandenburg saw and it turns out he's not the only one because the very next
morning or perhaps within a day or two a lady by the name of Miss Gilbert was
driving in the same exact area she had just left a friend's home it was about 3:00 a.m. and she was driving by the
very same field where Don brandenberg had seen the UFO she saw something
moving in the beams of her headlights and to her amazement it was a 3 to 4ft
tall humanoid standing near the road in the field and she was most impressed as
many witnesses are by the being's eyes she said were very large they looked
almost red circular and they were not only staring at her but she said seemed
to be quote shooting lights at her she said the creature walked quote rather
strangely it looked to her almost as if it was floating she said it looked grayish in color kind of reminded her of
Casper the ghost but it had legs and as she's looking at it it just seemed to quote
evaporate so now no surprise this incident did frighten her pretty badly
in fact in fact she was reportedly quote in hysterics when she described this to her friends later at a local store well
by coincidence the other witness Don Brandenburg happened to be in the store at the time she was describing her
encounter and the two witnesses of course met and this prompted their encounters to be investigated by Ted
bletcher both of these incidents did occur during a flurry of humanoid sightings that was sweeping across the
United States which became famously known as the year of the
humanoids 1973 late 1973 was clearly an amazing time for UFO activity it ramped
up quite a bit something was going on there something was going on in this particular location given that multiple
Witnesses saw humanoids in the same exact place so that raises all kinds of
questions and implications and certainly brings a whole new level of credibility
to each of their testimonies it's amazing now let's move to another case
which occurred during this massive 1973 wave this one is also gotten a good deal
of attention as it deserves to because wow it is such a fascinating series of
events this one I call the gos toown visitations lots of people people were
seeing UFOs over this area at this time this occurred on November 4
1973 in Goffstown New Hampshire most of these are multiple witness
cases and several involving humanoids but a lot of UFOs being seen all over
the area at that time so I think you'll find this one truly compelling Raymond
Fowler is the primary investigator for this very interesting case in fact he
wrote about it in his book UFO's interplanetary visitors and it also appeared in some UFO journals was
shortly after midnight on November 4 1973 that Rex snow and his wife Teresa
had gone to bed suddenly they heard a strange sort of unidentified brushing
noise that was coming from the backyard of their home which was located on chip Street in Goffstown New Hampshire you
can see it here it's a tiny little Rural Street in a pretty small town as it turns out about 5 hours
earlier that same evening Rex had noticed a silver saucer-shaped object
hovering overhead he was with his friends his next store neighbors uh the renow family and they
all saw this object actually viewed it through a telescope they said this object had four port holes which glowed
with a red light the object quickly darted away way but now hours later Rex
looks out the window because of this brushing noise and doesn't see anything not at first so he assumed it was just
the wind and went back to bed but it was just a short time later that the snow's
German Shepherd dog named Mo who was in the kitchen began whining and growling
so Rex who was persuaded by his wife got up and was puzzled to see a light
shining in from the backyard walking into the kitchen which overlooked the
backyard he saw that the entire kitchen was illuminated by a strange glow coming from the window shades which again faced
the backyard their dog Mo was crouched on the kitchen floor teeth bared and
hair bristling now Rex's first thought that was that there was a fire outside
so he moved to the kitchen window part of the curtains and looked outside and he was so shocked by what he saw that he
staggered backwards because standing in his backyard were two short humanoids
and they were not human looking they look different he said they had large pointed ears dark egg-shaped holes where
the eyes would be and were covered in glowing silver fullbody
uniforms and this uniform even went over the face area the nose which was large
and protruding he said they also wore gloves and boots the boots curled up at the toes but the uniforms were
completely seamless no buttons no zippers nothing like that these figures
were standing about 60 ft away from the back door one was holding a long glowing
rodlike device and the other had a silvery bag in one hand and was bending
down and appeared to be picking up samples from the ground and putting them in the bag Rex actually looked away and
looked back because he couldn't believe his eyes he shouted for his wife to come see but she thought at first he was
joking and she was also tired and wanted to stay in bed but she realized her
husband was entirely serious when he came frantically rushing into the bedroom grabbed his 38 caliber automatic
handgun and began to load it now meanwhile their dog Mo was frantically
jumping up against the back door so Rex opened the door and ordered Mo who was a
trained attack dog to go after the humanoids and the dog did Miko rushed
towards the being approaching to within about 30 ft then stopped dead in her
tracks the figures also stopped what they were doing and stared at the dog their dog Mo made a few short lunges but
then very abruptly turned around and walked back into the house walked right
past Rex and then lay down on the floor whining and her hair still bristling
still quite upset so Rex was getting increasingly frightened he slammed the
door clo closed and by this point in fact he was so afraid he said his hands
were trembling to the point that he couldn't even hold the gun steady now
his wife Teresa was also afraid much too afraid to even leave the bedroom so Rex
watched as these figures moved he said in almost a slow motion deliberate fashion still picking up things from the
ground he said one of the beings would hold this long flashlight like device
shine it on the ground while the other scooped things up Rex told himself that
if these beings moved any closer he would open fire on them and after a few short moments the beings turned around
and walked deliberately and slowly back into the forest behind their house so
after the figures walked off Rex immediately went to the phone and began calling the police Teresa now Found the
courage to get out of bed she went to the kitchen and looked outside and could see that the woods were lit up with an
eerie glow it slowly faded as these beings moved off so she saw it too
though she didn't specifically see the figures so he called the police and two
police officers showed up Robert C white and Daniel jubinville you can see them
here they arrived interviewed the witnesses went outside could could find
no trace of the beings Raymond Fowler the researcher did later examine the
area and he did find a few broken Twigs but no solid evidence of footprints or
any Landing traces he did talk to both officers who confirmed that Rex snow and
his wife were honest people and that both were absolutely terrified following this encounter in fact both officers
were completely convinced that the Snows had seen something very
unusual and if this were an isolated event that would be one thing but it wasn't because as it turns out 3 days
earlier at 8:30 p.m. on November 1st 1973 6 miles to the west of Chip Street
Florence da was at her home on Parker Station Road when she heard a loud thump
coming from her front yard now thinking there was a dog or a falling tree she
looked out her porch window and saw something else it was a strange figure
standing directly on her front porch only a few feet away and it did not look
normal she said it was wearing what looked to her like an oldfashioned black coat a black wide brimmed hat that was
pulled over the face and it really frightened her because there were no visible facial features whatsoever she
said it looked more like a mummy than anything else she was rooted to the spot in fear as this figure did something
very strange it proceeded to motion for her to come outside now she wasn't going to do that
she wanted to get a better look at it so she shouted at it to come to the front door and then rushed to the front front
door immediately locked it and looked out through the window but the figure now was gone she did call the police
they arrived 4 minutes later but could find no trace of the visitor and it was only 6 hours after
this that there was another amazing case lindia Morel was driving her car when a
UFO started following her at some point it hovered over the road in front of her
and looking out through a port hole she saw a very strange being looking out at
her now this occurred on North Mast Road in GST toown this being was humanoid
looking but definitely not human this craft was very low she said she felt almost paralyzed she rushed to the
nearest house and woke the people up they called the police one of the police
officers arrived in time to see this craft moving off I did already cover
this case in detail in another episode called I saw an alien through the window
of a UFO so I don't want to go over all the details again if you'd like to hear more about it please do check out that
episode all of these are occurring nearly the same time in nearly the same
area and in fact on November 4 1973 this same evening of the humanoid encounter
by Rex and Teresa snow police stations across numerous cities across New
Hampshire including not only gtown but also Durham New Durham do roachester
summersworth and more were reporting all kinds of strange things some people
called to report mysterious explosion ions but many Rec called to report
visual sightings of glowing objects and craft and in fact several of the
eyewitnesses were themselves police officers so these sightings and humanoid
encounters occurred at the very tail end again of this huge wave of humanoid
encounters that have been going on for a few months across the United States and the world was called the year of the
humanoids and this is in fact the title of a book by David Webb and gown
continues to be the location of many other encounters the cases always have layers of mystery to them um they're
like brief Snippets to what is actually going on because clearly these UFOs were
coming from somewhere and going somewhere and we're only getting a tiny little glimpse of to what's going on but
as we add to our huge database of cases I think becomes clearer and clearer that
we are not alone that ich are visiting our planet and that they have all sorts of different goals in mind and certainly
one is to Simply announce their presence here is another really
interesting case which got quite a bit of publicity at the time of its
encounter and I call this one the monk-like aliens this is one of the only
single witness accounts in this little compilation this occurred on November 10
1973 in Udin Netherlands this is at the tail end of this massive wave of
humanoid sightings on that year so this one is a super interesting case because
the description of the ETS is so incredibly unusual here's another case
Again part of this massive wave in fact it occurred one week after the above case
and this case was first reported again in David web's book The Year of the humanoids but a more thorough follow-up
investigation was done by Dutch researcher du J Bosa the main witness is
an dolphin verin age 60 you can see her here she
woke up about 2:15 a.m. to visit the restroom and on her way there she
happened to look out her window and saw some white figures she she didn't pay
too much attention to them at first and just continued to the bathroom but on her way out she looked out the window
again and was astonished by what she saw three short figures and boy did they
look weird they were clothed all in white and moved in a gliding fashion
heading in her Direction on the street itself she said they were quite short 1 M tall 3 ft one appeared to be slightly
taller but they were wearing what looked to her like white robes which had a strange headpiece reminded her a little
bit of monks one of them was holding a sort of vacuum like device kind of like
a metal detector and was sweeping it back and forth over the pavement on the
street this figure was leading and the other two figures were following but
they looked so strange an was very impressed she pressed her nose up against the window and watched them with
absolute astonishment and some fear as it was very obvious to her that this was
not normal this was some kind of Supernatural event now she considered awaken her husband from the other room
but he had recently suffered a heart attack so she didn't want to alarm him and this was quite alarming so she just
continued to watch she did notice that the beings had metallic looking instruments hanging from a belt she said
they had exceptionally large feet very broad rounded unusual looking shoes and
were also shuffling along in a manner that seemed to indicate to her that they had short legs and she couldn't really
see their knees bending it almost looked like they were gliding so she watched them for quite a
while about 5 minutes as they slowly moved closer to her and as they got real
close suddenly one of the beings looked up directly at her and apparently noticed that she was watching them it
seemed to be startled and it appeared to alert the other two because it turned to them and seemed to talk to them
immediately all three of the figures turned around moving quickly but still
in that strange gliding shuffling motion they moved off towards a nearby school
and disappeared from view so Anne looked around briefly to see if there were any other figures or anything strange she
didn't see anything however as she returned to her bedroom she looked out
the window at the back of the house and got another tremendous shock because
only about 35 M away about 100 ft she saw a very large glowing red sphere was
painfully bright was quite large there's some dispute on about how big this was
but 20 ft wide several meters it was large enough to cover the entire side
alley and again was so bright she said it was like looking at the sun at this point her husband did wake up asked her
what time it was and looked at the clock quick Qui ly looked back out the window
only to discover that this strange glowing red object was now gone she told her husband about the experience they
talked about it and then finally went to sleep she was impressed enough the next morning to call the police mostly in the
hope that other people had reported this strange event but apparently she was the only witness and the police never got
back to her she kept quiet about it mostly she did tell a few friends it
turned out it was her friend son who was very interested in the subject who reached out to UFO researchers initially
contacting Jay Allen heck and this led to her case being thoroughly
researched now an said she had no real interest in UFOs prior to this she did
not want any attention but nevertheless her case became very well publicized in
various magazines later all this publicity did bring some Skeptics who tried to explain
away the humanoids in various ways one suggested that they were perhaps
Carnival goers dressed up in costumes because as it turned out there was a very famous Carnival occurring the very
next day another researcher offered that they might be street workers looking for
gas leaks so there were some attempts to explain these away but both these
explanations fail to account for the glowing red sphere that an saw which
seems undoubtedly to be connected to her sighting of the humanoids clearly it's
important to be skeptical or have a skeptical attitude when researching these cases but I find it somewhat
amusing and a little bit alarming to see the length that some people will go through to explain a way an encounter
such as calling these ETS people dressed up in costumes or electrical or gas
workers and completely ignoring the fact that this lady did in fact see a UFO as
well so if you're going to provide an explanation it has to account for all the evidence that's what I find so
fascinating about so many of these cases is that they do have a lot of evidence
and Skeptics often disregard the evidence in an attempt to explain these
cases away something is clearly going on there's far too many cases cuz here is
another one which I call the glowing men this occurred on August 15 1981 in L
Roselle Zimbabwe L relle is an estate and what's amazing about this case is
there are a lot of witnesses this has been called one of Africa's best verified cases and I think you'll find
it not only very unusual but incredibly fascinating researcher Cynthia hind is
the primary investigator for for this case she's the author of UFOs over
Africa and this case was also published in her magazine UFO Afra news issue
number two and in the May 1983 issue of the muan UFO Journal this incident took
place at a large estate which is now a popular tourist destination known as La
Rochelle again located in Zimbabwe Africa now this case involves many
witnesses it's very well do mented the primary witness was Clifford muchina who
at the time worked as the head Gardener at the estate and as Clifford says in his own
words it was around halfast 6 when I saw a ball of light near the t-o from my
house nearby then everyone started seeing it was very big and it rolled towards the
t- room other people who saw it saw it first in the observation tower rolling
around inside the room and they thought the tower was on fire as there were Flames coming out of the window they
were very frightened then I ran to ring the emergency Bell which is at the side of the house and some more men came
running out now Clifford and several other workers at the estate watched this large glowing sphere move over to
another structure which was called the fantasy building this was actually used
to grow orchids for the property this point Clifford stopped ringing the emergency Bell and ran over to the
building only to see that this sphere was now actually inside that structure
and again it was so bright it looked like the building was on fire but clearly this wasn't any normal fire as
Clifford says I was very afraid and I wondered what kind of a fire this was
standing next to the building were three or four men who Clifford first assumed were workers or one of them was perhaps
the game warden he thought his boss a man by the name of Andrew Connelly so
Clifford called out Andrew Connelly's name and very slowly these men turned
around and looked directly at Clifford and this scared The Living Daylights out of Clifford because these figures were
not human certainly not normal ones he was standing only about 10 ft away from
them so this was quite a shock as Clifford says I could see that they had
strange clothes on they were wearing shiny whitish coveralls like overalls
all one color I couldn't see their faces because it was shining so much light
that I had to put my hands up to protect my eyes I couldn't see if they were wearing anything on their heads I didn't
look very closely because of the light it blinded me when I put my hands up to cover my eyes I fell down there was a
power from them too much light shining in my eyes so I fell down by this time
more than 20 people had gathered and were watching these strange glowing men and this glowing sphere having never
heard much about UFOs or ETS the witnesses thought they might be seeing ghosts or spirits of their
ancestors now one of the witnesses was Unice Kiti she's a domestic worker on
the property she first noticed this glowing sphere by a nearby tree and
standing next to it were two of these strange men she said they were holding long and unusual looking flashlight like
vices she saw this glowing sphere change from yellow to a bright red as it
increased in size or appeared to increase in size and began to move towards the te- room which is where
Clifford muchina first saw it she said that the two men standing next to it never moved but that the sphere moved
from the tree to the t- room back to the tree then to the Watchtower floating
right up the sides of the Tower and moving inside it so she watched it for
quite a while in fact many other Witnesses were interviewed by Cynthia Hind and they saw
not only the humanoids but this ball of glowing light and it was clear that
despite the Flaming appearance of this ball it was not a fireball was not ball lightning or anything like this there
was no smell of anything burning there was no smoke there was no signs of anything being burned the appearance of
this glowing sphere and the strange figures did cause some Panic among the people there
some of the Witnesses were so frightened that they ran away and refused to come close or even discuss what they saw so
was after a few moments that this glowing sphere either winked out moved off disappeared and when Clifford looked at
where the glowing men had been they were now nowhere to be seen shortly afterwards an examination of the tower
where this ball had rolled around inside it showed no signs of any damage there was no Footprints nothing unusual
was found so again there was quite a bit of speculation that this could be a
natural event of some kind some tried to blame it on Swamp gas as there was in fact a swamp not far from this area
there's also a gold mine near this area which might be relevant but none of the
explanations could explain these glowing figures dressed in strange
jumpsuits so apparently not ball lightning or swamp gas or anything like
this when you have that many people seeing an object in humanoids it's
almost impossible to explain it away as something prosaic that is an encounter that
clearly impressed the witnesses and I'm glad it was professionally investigated by Cynthia
hind she's a very well-respected researcher and it's the kind of case that deserves a lot more attention
frankly I think all of these do to me this should be front page news it's one
of the reasons I do this research because I think this subject is really important and has the potential to
really affect all humanity and certainly the way we view ourselves in the universe and the way we treat each other
now let's move to the next case which I call it came from the sky this occurred
in Spring of 2003 in Roso de s Spain I
wanted to include this case not only because it's a multiple witness case not not only because the description of the
humanoid is beyond bizarre but because it's another case involving a flying
humanoid there's quite a few of those uh so I think that alone makes this case
worth inclusion the main investigator for this very unusual case is researcher Pablo vuia
Mao it was presented in his Spanish language book expedientes of or the UFO
files and it was about 8 am. one morning in the spring of
2003 as truck driver Gregorio Guerrero was transporting a load of concrete from
the nearby concrete Factory where he worked he was on a convoy of three trucks he was the first they drove along
a gravel road to deliver the material to a ranch located near Roso Del serat this
is in Palencia Spain and Gregorio arrived first he immediately stopped his
truck when he saw what appeared to be the figure of a humanoid a man descending from the sky he first noticed
this figure when it was about 20 ft overhead 6 M and as it descended down
the other two trucks arrived the drivers also saw this strange figure and they
all watched it as it landed on the ground only 10 m away 30 ft and stood
under a row of high tension wires this figure was about 5 ft tall
1.8 m but it had a very unusual and bizarre appearance was brown in color
quite thin the arms and legs were normal but the bizarre part was its head which
was perfectly round and appeared to be composed of a hollow ring in fact it
looked to the witnesses like they could see right through it perhaps this was a reflective visor of some kind but they
felt like it was Hollow this figure did remain in view for about 3 to 4 minutes
during which time one of the truckers made a strange decision he started picking up rocks and throwing them at
this figure now Pablo and the other driver immediately reprimanded him and told him to stop that this wasn't a good
idea which he did then without warning this figure ascended upwards into the
sky in a diagonal trajectory and disappeared off into the distance this
to totally amazed the witnesses as there was no visible means of propulsion no Rockets no wings nothing
now Pablo one of the witnesses did have a very strange impression that this creature was in some way some kind of
message from his quote deceased parents and brother that case is a good example
of how unique and bizarre descriptions of humanoids can be can't say I've heard
of anything quite like that really makes me Wonder it's pretty clear despite what
the witnesses felt like could this be ghostly that probably not given the way
the humanoid was dressed hard to say for sure find it fascinating that one of the
witnesses felt that this encounter was somehow a message from his deceased relatives very hard to say but that does
come up in a number of cases now let's move to another case which is super fascinating I call this
one the alien by the megaliths this occurred in February 2008 near the IL de
Berde Island in France what's interesting about this case is there's
this is a tiny little island but there's some really interesting and unexplained
Stone megaliths on this island and there has been a number of cases which seem to
link UFO encounters to these kind of megalithic sites that's why wanted to
include this case which is a multiple winess case and also has some really interesting elements to it the
investigator for this case is French researcher and Author George Mets was a
sunny afternoon in February 2008 as the witness Patricia that's a pseudonym and
her friend decided to visit the IL de Island this is located in morban in
the very south of France they were going there to look at the strange megalithic Stones which were located on the island
and actually several in the surrounding areas they wanted to see a famous stone circle that was located there so yeah
lots of megalithic monuments in this area dolman burial Chambers Stone circles and more this island is Tiny 23
hectares that's about 8 square miles 23
square kilometers so yeah very tiny most of this island is in fact private property and only a small portion is
open to the public which can only be access by a paved road which is only
exposed during low tide Patricia and her friend arrived on this island they were
very surprised to immediately see a glowing orange sphere slowly seemingly
emerge from the ground it was pretty big it reached about three feet in height
they said and both stared at it in absolute shock neither saying anything
to each other they were literally speechless and moments later it darted off at a dazzling speed they said to the
southwest and was gone so they did not talk about it they just stayed in that
area when exploring strangely did not discuss what they had seen for some time
but after some minutes Patricia couldn't resist talking about it any longer finally asked her friend if she had seen
anything strange range at the eel de be day where these megalithic monuments were to her relief somewhat her friend
said that yes she had seen something and described this same orange sphere and
she really surprised Patricia by saying that she had also smelled a strong sulfuric odor Patricia had not smelled
anything but her friend also said something else that this orange sphere had somehow given her a message about
the dangers of nuclear power Patria herself had not gotten this message
either but talking all about this apparently brought confirmation for Patricia's friend it quite frightened
her so they decided that now is the time to leave and it was just two or three
minutes after this that Patricia who was now alone was shocked to see four
strange humanoids standing just a short distance away from her a few meters
maybe 10 to 20 ft each of them each of these figures looked the same they were
about 1 M tall 3 feet they had very thin frail bodies long arms oversized heads
large eyes very thin mouths holes in the head where the ears would be in other
words very much the typically described Grays according to Patricia they were
wearing a silvery aluminum looking outfit which weirdly appeared to be
translucent as she could see what she perceived to be the ribs or the Torso structure of the ETS through this
jumpsuit even more amazing is these beings were not on the ground they were hovering about 50 cm just under 2 feet
above the ground now although this was quite alarming the witness did not feel any
fear she said the beings did not seem aggressive in any way and instead she said quote they appeared kind so she
remained calm and watched them for a full minute and a half until they suddenly disappeared so unfortunately
her friend did not see them but the question is why were they there on IL de
Berde a very famous megalithic site this remains a mystery hard to say for sure
whether the megaliths that are located at this site have any bearing on the encounter itself but it wouldn't
surprise me given that there are quite a few cases is where this sort of thing does happen maybe there is a correlation
another really fascinating thing about this case is that one of the witnesses felt the sighting was a warning about
nuclear proliferation because that does turn up in a number of cases like I say each case has something
to teach us such as this next one which I call the alien in my bedroom this
occurred on November 9 2013 in Virginia Beach it's primarily a single witness
case but not really because there are other people who are in the house who reported some very unusual events so I'm
going to call it a multiple witness case but what I like about this case is the
fact that this did occur in a person's bedroom and you might not be aware of this but the most common place to see an
extraterrestrial is in fact in your bedroom investigators call these bedroom
visitations and there are an awful a lot of them so that's why I wanted to
include this case also because it's got some interesting and unique elements that I don't know that I've heard before
this next case was reported to mufan by the witness who is anonymous we'll call her Melissa Melissa lived with her
husband and three children and two dogs in a tri level home in Virginia Beach Virginia also staying with them at the
time were her brother his girlfriend and their baby so
it was a pretty full house and on the night of November 9 2013 Melissa was sleeping on the bottom
floor with her three young children at the time Melissa's husband was out of town doing work the others were sleeping
on the top floor and Melissa was laying in bed looking at her cell phone she was
fully awake when suddenly a strange sensation overcame her and as she says
in her own words I had this sudden and very intense feeling of fear of my bedroom door which
was shut I was so fixed on my bedroom door that I was scrolling through my
phone but not looking at it looking Beyond it towards my door all of a sudden I saw this being appear inside my
room in front of the door so Melissa was completely shocked because not only had
this figure appeared without even opening the door but because it was clearly not human says Melissa was very
tall very skinny with long and skinny Limbs and fingers the knuckles and
joints were very apparent due to how skinny this thing was this being had very distinct
features in the face it looked almost skeletal it looked similar to a gray the
eyes were large but very short so it looked sort of like it was squinting so
already shocked by its sudden arrival and its strange appearance Melissa became even more shocked at what
happened next as she said says I could not move nor speak I was unable to do
anything but breathe and think it came closer to my side of the bed it was so
tall that when it bent over my side of the bed it was damn near a 90° angle
from my phone light I could see the pores on this thing the skin looked
shiny but not oily if that makes sense the skin also looked like a mix of pea
green and gray color I was freaking out because it reached over me with its long
arm and fingers so Melissa's heart was racing she was filled with fear she felt like
this being was able to read her mind and her emotions then it looked towards her kids and Melissa had the weird
impression that somehow this being had changed its mind or its intention she felt that there was no danger the F
figure stepped back and then something very weird happened and again I'll just let let Melissa describe this in her own
words as she says I had the oddest sensation I've ever felt in my life I
felt like a vacuum cleaner sucked me up instantly until I looked down and I saw me sitting up phone still in hand kids
still there I saw the carpet my bedding everything I remember trying to stop but
I couldn't I started reaching the ceiling and I was so scared I would hit it but then I blacked out so the next
thing Melissa knew it was morning and she woke up with no memory of the previous night's event but she did have
this overwhelming sense that she needed to remember something was really nagging at her she felt so confused really
disoriented by this urgent feeling that she decided to just sit there in bed and
try to piece things together and that's when she did remember as she says slowly
I started to remember she looked and saw her phone sitting on the other side of the room in
a place where she would never have put it this also confirmed what she was remembering then she got up her brother
was up and boy was she shocked when she heard what he had to say because after
he woke up he immediately said man last night was crazy so Melissa asked what he
meant by that and he explained that the dogs had started barking and growling like crazy that night he opened the door
to his room room and saw that there was this really bright light outside the house this was on the side where
Melissa's room was and he said it was bright enough to illuminate that whole side of the house and at the same time
he's looking at this light he could hear a loud whoosing sound this really
puzzled Melissa she's a very light sleeper she did not hear the dogs or the whooing sound so that was strange to her
later she called her best friend to share what happened and got another shock to her amazement her friend who
lived a full hour away said that on that same evening she also saw a strange
being in her bedroom so needless to say this totally freaked Melissa out as she
says I don't have the slightest clue as to what that means now Melissa
personally would prefer to categorize this as a bizarre dream or an episode of sleep paralysis if not for the other
weird events surround ing this experience so overall the encounter left her more puzzled than anything and she
says I don't know what happened the only question is what really happened all I
know is that I definitely did not fall asleep I was awake my heart goes out to
the witness in this case especially with her attempts to try to explain this away at sleep paralysis when that is so
clearly not the explanation given that other family members saw light coming in
through the windows the dogs were going crazy and other elements her friend
having an encounter on the same night that's amazing and there's a number of cases like that where one person will
have an encounter and someone they love and know dearly as an encounter on the same night I think this is another clue
that ETS do want people to remember they do want to announce their presence but
you can make up your own mind about it now let's move to the last and final case in this compilation this case is
also really interesting I think I call this one the with Luchi ET this occurred
on April 2nd 2015 in the with Luchi State Forest of
Florida I like this case because it's another example of ETS being seen along
a remote Highway at night there's an enormous number of cases like this it's
also a really interesting case because the gentleman the witness got a very good look at the C who seemed to have an
very unusual object in his hand and was doing something with it that is quite
mysterious and also it's not an isolated event because apparently there was quite a bit of activity going on in that area
at that time the final case in this compilation was reported to muon by the
witness and was also reported on by Albert Rosales in his book humanoid
encounters 2010 to 2015 the main witness has requested
anonymity he's a commercial longdistance truck driver we'll call him Phillip
that's a pseudonym was 320 a.m. April 2nd 2015 as Philip was driving an 18wheeler
truck at about 60 M hour north on State Road
471 this is 5.9 miles south of the intersection State Route 50 and
471 again in the with Luchi State Forest this is a nature conservancy area with
lots of forest and Wildlife it was a clear moonlit night this is in Florida
so he was approaching an old dirt Logging Road that intersected the highway you can see it here and looking
to his right at the Eastern entrance to the Logging Road he noticed dim flashes
of light as he's approaching and he immediately saw a figure about 5 to 5
1/2 ft tall standing about 10 fet off the highway right in the center of this
dirt road and this figure was weird looking was wearing some kind of
containment suit is how the witness put it was offwhite in color it had a helmet
and it was holding a small handheld device in front of it just above waist
level now this device was emitting rapid bursts of light in a circular clockwise
Direction pointing downward and spreading out in a cone shape and
something in the air seemed to be reacting to these light pulses causing small but brilliant bursts of white
light and in fact the flashes were bright enough to illuminate the figure and his suit which gave Philip the
ability to see all of this in quite some detail very strange for example he could
see that this figure was wearing dark brown shoes he said that it had a harness extended over the shoulders
ending at the midsection where there was a sort of Pentagon shaped object affixed
to its chest now this object was white but had gold or dark brown kind of geometric
looking symbols on the front he could see this oval-shaped helmet with a face plate that was reflecting not only
Philip's truck headlights but the flashes of light coming from the device in its hand so all of this was quite
strange Philip did not stop his truck and continued to drive up the highway so
the total duration of the encounter was quite short no more than 8 seconds though he was only 15 ft away from the
humanoid which is close enough to see that it was very unusual he did not notice any effect on his truck but his
impression was that the figure was holding some kind of scanning device and as it turns out this area does have a
history of encounters because back in February of 1979 three people were living in a
remote trailer at a swampy area along the with Luchi River this is surrounded
by the forest and one of them Butch Thompson was the first to see a big
bright light approaching in the sky he called out his girlfriend and his father Bill and all three saw this light coming
closer allowing them to see that it was not just a light but actually a craft of some kind kind totally silent except for
a whooing sound as Bill Thompson says I know what I saw and nobody's going to
tell me I didn't see it it was a hell of a feeling I've never seen anything like it before that thing was so bright it
just lit up everything and it turned out that this was just the latest in a recent series of sightings in the
area some years later in the 1990s another witness a lady stepped
outside her home with overlooked the with Luchi forest and she saw quote what
I would call a flying saucer hovering just above the Treetops it was so close
that I could see it very clearly I just stood there in amazement she said this subject was
totally silent it had colored lights all around it but when it moved towards her
it scared her badly she dashed for her house locked all the doors and shut the shades she saw it again the next day
while driving and as she was watching it it seemingly dematerialized right before her eyes
there you go another amazing case a good example of ETS being seen along a remote
Highway late at night sure are a lot of cases like that such a shame the witness
in this case didn't stop his truck and take a closer look at what was going on here but I can't fault him seeing
something like this is always a huge surprise for people or certainly almost
always and I also find this an interesting case because although it is a single witness case quite a bit of
activity going on in that area at that time so there you go 10 new cases of
humanoids each one adding a little bit to our knowledge of what's going on here
each case is a piece of the puzzle that I think helps us to solve the UFO mystery I personally think we're should
move Beyond calm this a mystery I think we know what's going on I think the evidence speaks for itself we have
thousands upon thousands of cases of people seeing these craft Landing humanoids coming out to me it's clear we
are being visited by extraterrestrials but I'm just presenting these cases factually giving
the evidence as we know it and you all can make up your own minds about it I
would like to thank you once again for tuning in I truly appreciate it I've said it many times this subject is
really important and we all deserve to know the truth about what's going on it's time to end this cover up it's time
to stop the lies and the misinformation and the fear that's surrounding all of
this so that's why I do this research thank you once again for watching I
truly appreciate it I hope you have a wonderful evening and a great weekend
and until next time keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the
truth and most important of all keep having fun I know I am I will see you
next Friday bye for now
