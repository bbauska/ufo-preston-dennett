THE TRUTH BEHIND ALIEN ANAL PROBES
Nov 7, 2020

Summary:
Nov 7, 2020
There are many very strange procedures that occur during onboard UFO encounters, but one that 
has been given more than its fair share of attention is the alien anal probe. It has become the 
butt of jokes on the internet. It has saturated nearly every aspect of our culture. The media 
has targeted this one particular procedure to a degree that it has come to define the UFO 
abduction experience in its entirety.

While many people have joked about the alien anal probe, the truth is, it is very serious, 
especially to those on the receiving end. This video presents a deeper look into this bizarre 
phenomenon, and provides an in-depth analysis. It shows how the media has focused on this one 
particular aspect of the UFO experience above all others. It also presents firsthand cases 
from leading UFO researchers and the experiencers themselves.

Why are ETs flying light years to examine the anuses of innocent humans? What is the purpose 
behind this extraordinary extraterrestrial excremental experimentation?

This video answers all these questions and more. For those who would like to learn more about 
these cases and others, please check out my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three."

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  the title of today's show is the truth behind  
alien anal probes an in-depth analysis i know this  is a controversial subject ufos are themselves a  
very touchy subject and this is perhaps among  the most sensitive aspect of ufo contact  
and yet it's very serious especially  for those on the receiving end  
what i find interesting about this  particular aspect of ufo encounters  
is there's not a lot of ufo research into it  there are not a whole lot of reported cases  
many researchers won't touch  the subject with a 10 foot pole  
and despite this the media has really latched  on to it it's all over the internet it's become  
the butt of the joke on the internet it's on tv  it's in movies it's in merchandising advertising  
video games it's all over the place if i had  a dollar for every time someone's asked me  
about uh why are aliens anally probing people  or or tell me no i don't want to be abducted by  
aliens and anally probed i'd have a huge bank  account and i get it it's a charged subject  
but really there's no excuse aliens are visiting  our planet and what do people want to talk about  
alien anal probes finally i just threw up  my hands and said fine let's explore all  
avenues of ufo research and let's get to the  truth of this and that's why i did this video  
what i find very interesting is that  society has really reacted strongly to this  
just look at what happened to george knapp george  knapp became involved in ufo research in the late  
1980s early 1990s when he began investigating  the bob lazar case and area 51 and he soon moved  
into ufo abductions and quickly learned how  cruel the media can be as george knapp writes  
one newspaper reacted to my reports about alleged  alien abductions by anointing me as a high priest  
in the church of cosmic proctology so some  researchers have looked into this and one is jason  
colavito in his article aliens and anal probes  he writes the alien anal probe has become such a  
cliche that it now stands as a cynic dosh a symbol  for the entirety of the alien abduction experience  
why is it that aliens want to probe our butts or  more specifically when exactly did people start  
claiming that aliens gave them an anal probe  anal probes are now such an established part  
of the ufo phenomena that you'd think there  would be a clear answer to when the aliens  
started probing unwary humans but surprisingly  no one has yet created a definitive catalog  
of anal probing events or timeline of when  they supposedly started some people have  
looked into this when was the first alien  probe among them is researcher robert lamb  
in his article why didn't ancient aliens probe  human anuses he writes we're forced to wonder  
why anal probing only became such a key component  of alien human interactions during the second half  
of the 20th century did ancient aliens fail to  recognize the research potential of the human anus  
did 20th century visitations entail a new  alien civilization that had yet to reach the  
limits of what rectal probing could teach them  another researcher who has looked into this is  
david macrae in his article why would a space  alien approve your anus he writes even though they  
are technologically infinitely superior able to  travel at velocities surpassing the speed of light  
able to de-molecularize themselves and use  wormholes as conduits we are asked to believe  
that when they finally get to earth their first  order of business is to probe the human rectum  
using proctology instruments dating back to horse  and buggy days clearly we do have a fascination  
in the media with this particular  aspect of the ufo phenomena and i get it  
i mean i can see why that is it's funny it's  a little bit gross it's disconcerting it's a  
little bit taboo it's the perfect media story  so this is perhaps why they've really latched  
on to it but it's surprising how far it's gone i  mean just look at what's going on with television  
and perhaps one good example is what's happened  to homer simpson who when he was abducted by ets  
guess what this is what they focused on and when  south park decided to explore the ufo phenomena  
karpman was taken on board and  guess what he got probed so this is  
definitely what the media has become fascinated  with and it's all over the place so this is  
definitely saturating all parts of our culture  you can buy all kinds of ufo themed memorabilia
keychains cups and glasses  all kinds of t-shirts handbags  
even a face mask it's even got  into food for example how about  
alien anal probe red hot sauce the label reads  alien anal probe extraterrestrial hot sauce  
anal encounters of the fiery kind complete  with an illustration of a pantsless man  
surrounded by smiling gray ets it's only 8.97  a bottle uh and it's got into video games  
the saints row video game was actually banned from  australia for its use of this theme the internet  
has gone absolutely crazy with it internet  trolls have made all kinds of jokes about it here  
are 15 of the top reasons why the average internet  troll thinks people are being anally probed by et  
so those are the 15 reasons why the average person  thinks people are being anally probed by aliens  
and yeah it's funny i get it i've had a little bit  of fun with the subject please forgive me if i've  
been a little bit cheeky or talked about this  in a ton in cheek manner i don't mean to offend  
anyone i know that this is a serious subject so  now let's move on to that into the actual reports  
and see if we can figure out what's going on with  this extraterrestrial excremental experimentation  
because i do have reports of people firsthand  telling me that this happened to them  
and i know other researchers also have received  reports but when i did a survey for it i didn't  
find a whole lot of cases the earliest case i  could find was actually with betty in barney hill  
this aspect of their case is not written about  most accounts of their case but researcher walter  
webb listened to the actual hypnosis tapes and  found that barney hill did in fact have this  
experience as walter webb writes a cylindrical  object was inserted up the rectum and once  
again the witness believed something was removed  another researcher who has looked into this is  
david jacobs he's definitely a leading abduction  researcher in the united states and has written a  
little bit about this particular aspect of the  ufo contact as jacobs writes and i'm quoting  
after they have examined the vertebrae in back  the aliens roll the abductee onto her left side  
from this position the small beings may once again  examine and feel the vertebrae after this they  
conduct a rectal examination they use a variety  of instruments one of which resembles a wire  
whisk they insert the instrument and withdraw it  when the rectal exam is over the beings roll the  
woman completely on her stomach but like i said  there aren't a lot of first-hand accounts of this  
one first-hand account i did find comes from bill  foster an abductee who wrote about his experiences  
in his book the black triangle abduction it's an  excellent book highly recommended i was able to  
interview bill foster firsthand and he wrote about  this experience very lucidly as bill foster says
now it seems like yes they are turning me over on  my left side the big guy next to me is squatting  
down lower still looking into my eyes one of  the grays on the far side of the table comes  
around to my viewing side and picks up a thing  which is lying on the table it is a rod of some  
sort about 12 to 13 inches long it is silver on  three-fourths of it in black on the rest of it  
a dull flat black color he is going to insert that  into my rear end god no wonder my buttocks are so  
sensitive i can't imagine having that thing  stuck up my ass he inserts it to about what  
looks like a four inch depth and again leaves  it there for about 10 seconds and then pulls  
it out he's looking at something on the side of  that tube i don't really want to look at this  
yeah i don't blame him most experiencers as  well do not talk about this one who is very  
courageous in coming forth was whitley strieber  who received quite a bit of grief about it quite  
a bit of ridicule which is really unfortunate  because he was being honest and forthcoming  
about this procedure which a number of abductees  have experienced as whitley strieber writes  
there were clothes strewn about and two of  the stocky ones drew my legs apart the next  
thing i knew i was being shown an enormous and  extremely ugly object gray and scaly with a sort  
of network of wires on the end it was at least  a foot long narrow and triangular in structure  
they inserted this thing in my rectum it seemed  to swarm into me as if it had a life of its own  
apparently its purpose was to take  samples possibly of fecal matter  
but at the time i had the impression i was  being raped and for the first time i felt  
anger only when the thing was withdrawn did i see  it was a mechanical device the individual holding  
it pointed to a wire cage on the tip and seemed to  warn me about something but what i never found out
researcher raymond fowler has uncovered  cases like this in his book the allagash  
4 one of the witnesses jack weiner reported  this exact experience as jack weiner says
i try and i do it but i don't feel like i'm  doing what they want and they're saying just  
do it don't be afraid and then they're looking  at me they're putting something in me up my ass  
i'm afraid i don't know what it is it burns  it's like an enema it's uncomfortable but no  
it's not so bad they're saying it's not  so bad and so i'm saying it's not so bad  
john mack is another researcher who has looked  into this particular aspect of ufo contact he  
talks about the case of peter writing about  peter's case mack writes the most humiliating part  
followed as their quote groping at my legs and  put a tube in his rectum to take a stool sample  
these guys don't know how to touch people like  get some bedtime manner the tube was passed deeper  
into his rectum and peter felt that they left an  implant or an information chip deep inside of him  
why do you have to do this to me i feel like  a tagged animal i feel like they put something  
big up my anus and spread it and then stuck  something else up through it and then they left it  
it's way up inside me feeling defeated and  humiliated now peter said what pisses me off  
the most is that they told me they were going  to do this they held it up for me and showed me  
another report comes from an anonymous witness  who writes the real anal probe is a cylindrical  
device with myriad tentacles waving about  each about five inches in length as i recall  
i didn't feel anything i wasn't aware of it until  it was removed a warning is issued after removal  
i can't remember what the warning is exactly but  many abductees like myself would sincerely like  
to know another person that i actually interviewed  i'll call her alicia had this experience and she  
asked the et's what they were doing she screamed  at them saying why are you doing this there's  
nothing good up there and uh they seemed confused  and told her that they were measuring the levels  
of pollution in her body and uh another person  that i interviewed who had this experience i  
wrote about it in my book on board ufo encounters  his name is joe gardner he had this experience  
when he was five years old and said no it wasn't  pleasant at all as he says i felt something very  
cold and hard like a rod or a cold pipe just  go up inside me and then i blanked out again
i'm going to say the most detailed encounter of  all comes from an experiencer by the name of jim  
sparks he's written a book about his experiences  what's interesting about his case is he recalls  
most of his experiences consciously without  the use of regressive hypnosis and he had this  
experience and wrote about it in pretty good  detail as he says some of these alien medical  
exams unfortunately include anal probes yuck a  subject i do not enjoy talking about writing about  
or experiencing of course not everything i write  about is comfortable to relive and in this case  
i feel it is necessary i found myself face  down on an examination table in tremendous  
pain they had inserted a deep anal probe into  me and i could feel it turning around in my guts  
i felt so miserable that i cried out what the  hell are you doing to me an examination of your  
system the alien replied the pain is awful you're  hurting me that then i blacked out said sparks  
when i regained consciousness i found myself  face up on the table sore inside but not in pain  
two aliens were present and it appeared  they were just finishing up their procedure  
one of them said it is necessary that you stop  eating animals your system is overloaded with  
trash intelligence dictates that you do not have  to kill to survive sparks was surprised by this  
comment at the time he was a huge meat-eater  and everyone told him it would take an  
act of god to become a vegetarian but it  turned out in this case all it took was an  
act of the aliens because following this he  stopped eating meat precisely 30 days after  
his experience he was taken on board again  and had another alien colonoscopy as he says  
they were poking and prodding me and i hated  it he shouted at them damn it why are you doing  
this again i stopped eating meat the ets replied  we know we had to make sure it was helping you  
and it is sparx was sore afterward but years  later his diet still remains largely vegetarian  
as he says i have met many fellow abductees and  the bulk of them are vegetarians i find that odd  
don't you i know this has been a weird subject to  explore but i felt like it was important because  
people are having this experience i'm  sure they want to know what's going on  
and i did a big study of these cases all the  ones i could find i wrote about it in my book  
not from here volume 3 and uh what i found is  that there are different theories to explain this  
one theory is that people are being implanted  i'm not convinced that's what's going on here  
because the implant procedure seems to be  different another theory that perhaps the ets  
are collecting genetic material again i feel  like that's a completely different procedure  
one theory comes from researcher zen benefiel  in his book alien agendas and anal probes  
he speculates the purpose of the probe is to wake  people up spiritually by igniting their kundalini  
as he writes the simple science regarding the  alien probe is that the sphincter is an endpoint  
as well as the genitals of the perineum nerve  which according to the ancient arts is the path  
of the kundalini serpent fire when it is ignited  so we can ignite this fire with practice and it  
can be accelerated by procedures uh one witness  i think has really hit upon the true purpose as  
this witness writes they're collecting bacterial  samples it's for their genetics and food research  
don't take it personally i think that really  sums it up nicely really it's just a clinical  
medical procedure it's a colonoscopy very  much like what we do in doctor's offices  
well there are many theories i think  the obvious and most simple one is that  
this is a colonoscopy and that ets are simply  examining humans they seem to be very interested  
in examining people interested in all things human  and this appears to be just a simple colonoscopy  
one of many procedures that are performed on board  ufos so that's why i wanted to do this video so  
that people have had this experience know that  there are other people out there and to sort of  
chide the media for not taking this more seriously  because it is in fact a very very serious subject  
so that's it for now thanks once again  for listening and keep having fun
