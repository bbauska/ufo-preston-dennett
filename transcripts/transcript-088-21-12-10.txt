UFOs are seen all across our planet. The same is true for extraterrestrials. In fact, ETs are sometimes seen in locations you'd least expect. It may sound incredible, but the truth is, people are seeing ETs in public, walking among the general population. And it's not just a few cases. There are a lot of them.

Convenience stores, schools, bookshops, restaurants, theaters, churches, buses, subways, casinos, gas-stations, hotel lobbies, train stations and more -- no place is off limits. These reports include a wide variety of grays and strange humanoids. 

How can this happen? Have ETs infiltrated our society? What are they doing? Why are they here? Cases like these raise all kinds of questions!

This video presents nearly 20 different cases of ETs mingling in public places. The cases show some startling similarities and provide some important insights into the UFO phenomenon. You may have seen an ET and not even know it!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode they walk among us ufos of course are seen everywhere all across 
our planet and that's true for ETs as well and in fact ET's are sometimes seen in the most 
unexpected places this includes schools gas stations churches restaurants 
on the bus on a subway I mean you name it casinos people see ET's in public more often than you 
might think and that's what this episode is about I think these cases show some very interesting 
commonalities and have something to say about the whole phenomena itself i've got about 15 20 cases 
i'd like to share with you some are well known some I think you probably haven't heard before 
but I think you'll find it quite interesting I certainly hope so so let's just get started and we'll start with case one aliens in a bookstore this is a fairly 
well-known case it comes from whitley strieber and is written about in his book communion 
this involves actually this senior editor at morro books a gentleman by the name of bruce lee who is 
the editor of communion and apparently in january of 1987 encountered ET's in a bookstore in new 
york city this is at wam wrath's bookstore the book communion had just been published and bruce 
and his wife were at the bookstore to see the display of communion and this is when they had 
a very unusual experience with what appeared to be ET's in a public space and I will just let bruce 
describe his experience in his own words as he says I noticed a couple come into the store and 
head directly for communion I mean it was just you see them come in they didn't know where the book 
was you couldn't see it from the street and they come in and headed back for where that rack was 
most unusual if you see what I mean they were short and they were all wrapped up long scarves 
wool hats that you pull down and they pick up a copy of the book and they started thumbing through it and it was obvious that they were speed reading it too and they would say oh he's 
got it wrong he's got that wrong so because he was personally involved in publishing this book bruce 
approached the couple and asked them what was wrong and as bruce says I think it was the woman 
that looked up she was wearing those big sort of sunglasses that the girls keep in their hair 
and they really sort of hide the face but by god behind those dark glasses there was a goddamn 
big pair of eyes and I mean to say it was a big pair of eyes they were shaped like almonds 
you know how when you meet somebody the first time you can frequently get an immediate reaction 
the hackles on the back of my neck just went up I got the feeling that I was in eyeball contact with 
somebody who did not like me at all in fact I got the impression that I was not wanted around there 
i went over and I got my wife and I got the hell out of there I was almost shaking I said did you 
see that couple and my wife said sure I saw that couple and I said well they don't look 
like goddamn people and she said well you're crazy it was really a very intense shock bruce said that 
these figures were dressed up in so many clothes that there was really no skin visible as he says 
they were short they were wearing boots it was sort of hard with those hats on to tell what was 
there underneath all the clothing and of course you couldn't see the hands because they were in 
gloves but what most impressed bruce was the speed at which the people were reading as he says 
you do know when somebody's reading something and comprehending it and these pages were turning very very fast so as strange as this sounds uh bruce and his wife believe that they 
may have witnessed what appear to be ET's in disguise in womrat's bookstore in new york city 
as whitley strieber says of this encounter mr lee feels that the event has brought him nothing 
but unwelcome exposure this appearance was I believe as close to public and physical 
confirmation of their existence as the visitors have yet come
but as it turns out there are many other cases we now move to case two aliens 
at a convenience store this case comes from whitley strieber's book the communion letters 
he received a lot of letters from people who read his book and wanted to share their story and this story is one of the letters he received we don't know the location 
but it involves an anonymous woman who had a very strange experience it was around 
december of 1984 and she and her two co-workers had just closed the office around 11 pm and were 
walking along the street to a small market and as the woman says just as I reached the corner 
three globes of red light about the size and shape of eggs suddenly appeared in a circle around me 
they floated around me rapidly at knee height I am a large woman and sensitive to pranks so I looked 
around to see if somebody was playing a joke on me I thought maybe tim or harry her co-workers 
was using some sort of red flashlight to confuse and frighten me 
i looked up and saw both of them standing across the street and I called out to them what are you doing both of them stared back at me in amazement the woman was amazed but she decided 
to just keep walking and as she headed home she stopped at a nearby deli which she had been to 
many many times only minutes earlier she had seen these strange lights so as the woman says all the 
counter guys at the deli know me I go there all the time but that night there was a new guy i'd 
never seen before he was very tall at least six feet three or four his appearance was striking 
he looked like he may have been a combination of african oriental and nordic blood his skin 
was very pale with a yellowish cast and his hair was negroid with tight kinky 
curls except that it was the color of wheat he had a broad mouth and very large remarkable eyes 
the color of gold coins almond shaped and slanted he was dressed in the white uniform of a deli man 
i put the milk on the counter and asked for my brand of cigarettes I mentioned that he must be new there because I knew everybody else and he smiled gently and looked into my eyes and with 
the searching gaze when he gave me my change I noticed his hands were very smooth and his 
fingers were very long he seemed to be looking beyond me into the snowy white night when he said 
it doesn't happen very often but when it does it can be very scary
so that was a weird experience for her and it was the next day at work that her co-workers tim and 
harry confronted this woman and demanded to know what were those red lights around you last night 
so clearly it wasn't a joke they were playing on her and she went to the deli the next day 
and asked about this employee that she saw and the workers at the deli denied that there was 
anybody new and they also said that they were there last night and this woman had not shown up 
so that is just beyond bizarre i'm not sure what to make of it 
but she is absolutely convinced that she saw an e.t at the deli 
so let's move on to the next case which is case three aliens at a gas station 
this occurred to a lady by the name of lisa erans in fort myers florida 
and one evening in the mid 1990s lisa was driving through fort myers driving home when she saw a 
metallic disk above her car she had missing time of about one hour and the next thing she knows 
she's pulling up to a local gas station this is when things went really bizarre 
as she says when I walked back to my car a man was standing there leaning on the trunk 
this is embarrassing but he was gorgeous beautiful blue eyes he spoke I stopped and 
stared at him he smiled I stuttered and couldn't believe my eyes when I offered him a ride I have 
never ever done such a crazy thing before but he was different somehow I couldn't stop myself 
i took him to my house so lisa says she's not in the habit of picking up strange men no matter 
how attractive they might be but she just wasn't able to control her impulses and before the next 
next thing she knew they were becoming intimate and this is when something very strange happened 
as lisa says and I quote later that night I felt him get up from the bed the nightlight 
in my bedroom was on and I could see him standing naked next to a full-length mirror 
the next second is frozen in my mind his reflection in the mirror was unreal 
what I saw was the image of a small dark creature with a big head and huge eyes I sat up in bed he 
moved into the bathroom and out of sight when I finally looked in the bathroom he was gone 
and there is no window in the bathroom I know this sounds crazy
so there you go case three uh this e.t apparently was disguised is in a very attractive man but had 
the appearance of your typical gray and there are other cases like this we now move to case four 
aliens at a park and on a bus and a restaurant this is actually a series of events it was first 
presented in bud hopkins book intruders the main witness is debbie jordan cobble she's actually 
written two books herself one which came out quite recently but back in july of 1975 debbie 
and her friends were vacationing at ruff river state park in kentucky and they were talking on 
the cb radio to some gentlemen and this is when the very strange things began to happen as debbie 
says they wanted to come and see us and I told them if they could find us they would be welcome 
and it wasn't long after that that these gentlemen showed up which should have been impossible 
because debbie did not give them her location as daddy says it sort of didn't make any sense 
we could never figure out how they found us in the first place either because when we were talking to them on the cb we never told them how to get where we were there weren't even any names for the roads 
around there so I couldn't have explained it even if I wanted to they just showed up as I remembered 
in a kind of clunky old car with hardly any lights on it as this car drove up debbie noticed that it 
kind of glided over the bumpy road it was a detail which later she realized was quite strange and 
as she as she talked with these gentlemen and associated with them many other strange details 
emerged as debbie says they were all four young men very handsome they all looked very much alike 
like brothers or twins even they were all wearing blue shirts and she says they were quote real cute 
he had a round face and blue eyes real light light brown light blonde hair curly down to his collar 
the other two guys just sort of stood there one stood by the door I don't think they said anything at all debbie said that the main guy who did all the talking 
smiled with his eyes and as bud hopkins says it was a phrase i'd heard before in other ufo cases 
at one point debbie entered the cabin where the four men were staying and she got a real shock 
she says I was sure some of them would have been in bed since it was late but they were all up 
just sitting there and standing and the tv wasn't even on they were just still you know 
not moving like they were hardly awake and not saying anything and my head started to feel funny 
between my eyes and then the blonde guy spoke and everyone kind of came to life and began to move and talk it was really weird like they had been asleep or something 
so it was a weird enough experience that debbie thought it was related to her many many ufo 
encounters and eight years later in 1983 there would be an astonishing sequel to this event 
when she encountered what she believes is a human looking e.t on a bus she had just gone to see bud 
hopkins in new york and was on a bus going back to her home she was somewhere in pennsylvania when 
a strange gentleman got on the bus and actually sat right next to her and as debbie says suddenly 
i felt very strange this prickly sensation washed over me and I got the distinct feeling someone was 
boarding the bus that I needed to see I peeked up over the back of the seat in front of me 
and what I saw nearly took my breath away there stood the most beautiful man I have ever seen 
and he was looking directly at me as he walked up the steps to the bus it was as if he knew I 
was there before he even got on the bus he was about six feet four medium build yet slim he had 
shoulder length wavy medium blonde hair and the most perfectly structured face I have ever seen
so this began what was definitely the most strangest bus ride debbie has ever taken 
in her life this man sat down next to her and began to talk to her and she noticed many strange 
details about this man this was a very long bus ride as he said as she says I noticed that his 
voice was very soft and smooth and he seemed to be speaking with some kind of sing-song 
accent it was very slight so slight in fact that I first thought he was faking it for my benefit 
i asked him where he was from he said he was from near sweden that didn't make much sense 
it didn't sound like a swedish accent to me but I noticed after a while that he never seemed to show 
any signs of beard growth despite the fact that we were together on the bus for more than 17 
hours I also noticed that every time he touched me however lightly on the arm or the face this touch 
was exceptionally warm and I could feel the warmth flow through my whole body relaxing and calming me 
i didn't realize at the time how unusual any of this was so things were about to get much stranger 
after the bus ride the two of them went together to a fast food restaurant and sat down and this 
is when the gentleman started to behave in a very unusual way and asked unusual questions 
as daddy says when we started to order he turned to me and asked me what the difference was 
between bacon and sausage then he asked me what he should eat I told him what the difference was 
between those two foods and told him that they were both good by me he proceeded to order just 
about one of everything on the menu and when he saw how small the orange juice containers were 
he complained loudly and then ordered four of them the girls waiting on us looked at him as 
if he was some kind of green-haired alien I was kind of embarrassed by how he was acting 
and debbie was absolutely baffled by this gentleman and baffled by her own reaction to him 
and she felt like she couldn't live without him and she was terrified she might never 
see him again and at that exact moment he turned to her as if reading her mind and said 
don't worry we'll see each other again so after going to this restaurant they were walking 
back to the bus station and as debbie says we passed a group of people sitting on the benches 
they absolutely stared a hole through us as we walked by I bet we were a sight him so 
tall and me so short but the look we got from them was even stranger than 
just them noticing our different heights they actually looked totally dumbstruck I was talking 
to him when I noticed them it was almost as if I was talking to myself and they thought I was 
some kind of nut so more strange things happened debbie walked to the restroom and this gentleman 
started to follow her in apparently not realizing that men were not allowed in the woman's bathroom 
and she told him he was nauseous he did not understand the concept of nausea or vomiting 
and was totally fascinated when debbie presented him with a pepto-bismol pill 
and he was absolutely delighted and entranced by colorful newspapers and he insisted that debbie 
get him one so these were all very strange details that debbie really wondered about it reminded her 
of the earlier experience she had and she wondered if this guy could have been in e.t and she told 
us to bud hopkins and together they were able able to trace this man back to cincinnati ohio 
and learned that this gentleman would disappear for long periods of time sometimes years and no 
one knew where he was and then he would just show up again so it's a strange story is this an e.t 
hard to say for sure but debbie definitely thought that this was a distinct possibility 
and there are other cases we now move to case five aliens at a school and a convenience store 
this case comes from hans holzer perhaps best known for his ghost research but he also wrote 
a book about ufos and ET's called the euphonauts and this book features the story of shane curse 
a high school student from upstate new york and she had a missing time encounter 
she saw ET's with grayish looking skin but were otherwise human-looking and after having this 
encounter she later recalled an earlier incident in which she saw what may have been an e.t 
in front of the west moorland high school in new york this was before her first abduction in 1968 
and as shane says and I quote one day I decided to go to school early and when I was about 50 yards 
from the school entrance somebody came up behind me it was raining and I was carrying an umbrella 
and I had not seen anyone on the street prior to that but suddenly somebody appeared behind 
me and said hello shane may I share your umbrella I turned around and I saw a man walk up to me he 
struck me as being different by the fact that his appearance just didn't seem to fit in with the way 
everyone looked around my area his dress was a little more modern maybe a year or two ahead 
of ours so I thought he was a stranger he had a corduroy pants and a plaid shirt but his eyes and 
ears were the strangest things I was fascinated by his ears because they seemed to come to a point 
and were very sharp compared to ours also his eyes were gray 
and yet when I looked at them they seemed to go as if I could see completely through them 
they were very magnetic he seemed to talk with some kind of accent but I couldn't quite place 
it it sounded a little on the oriental side his eyes were slightly slanted not up but sort of back 
his hair was light brown he did not wear a hat which was unusual because it was cold 
and raining and he wore no coat either he wore no necktie his shirt was open he was about five foot 
four and came level with my shoulder and when he walked he never took his hands out of his pockets
so she was concerned about how this gentleman knew her name and he asked 
she asked him about it and he evaded the question and began asking some very bizarre questions 
he asked shane what she did during her lunch hour at school and she told him 
that she played volleyball or basketball and he asked what is volleyball what is basketball 
and shane said that everybody knows about these games but this stranger insisted that she explain 
these games to him and then he asked her during your lunch hour would you like to go for a ride 
and when she said that she didn't see any car he pointed to a nearby field and said oh my vehicle is over there it is a white vehicle shane politely declined 
and then came the strangest part of this encounter as shane says I sort of ended the conversation by 
saying it was nice meeting you and I turned around and I think I took three steps he didn't follow 
me I turned out of curiosity to see where he went and he wasn't there no more than three seconds had 
passed from the time I took the steps and turned around and there was no possible way he could have gotten out of my sight that quickly I was stunned so shane quickly scanned the whole area but there 
was no sign of this gentleman and some of the girls in the area walked up to her afterwards 
and she asked them did you see that a stranger that I was just talking to and they said yes 
who was that cute boy you were walking with so this turned out to have a sequel a short 
time later one month later shane was at the local convenience store and had a very strange encounter 
and again i'll just let shane describe what happened in her own words as she says I was 
in the store looking at a magazine when a man with very thin blonde hair hardly any hair on his head 
an extremely white skin kept looking at me he wore a black overcoat which covered him completely 
it seemed almost too long and too big for him I thought perhaps he was an albino because his eyes 
were so clear looking he kept smiling at me and I became somewhat nervous because of his staring 
and hanging around he wasn't buying anything and as I was walking around the store getting things 
he seemed to hang in back and when I stopped the magazine counter and was looking through them 
he just kept looking at me in a sort of shy way he never said a word or anything but I felt his 
presence behind me all along I tried to ignore him then I turned around and he was gone 
so she quickly looked around to see if she could find where this strange man had went but he was nowhere to be seen and it was less than a year later that she was abducted inside 
a ufo inside a craft and inside was this same figure that she had seen at the convenience store 
so she believes she encountered an e.t in a public place
very interesting details in these cases that seem to turn up again and again and here's another case 
this is case six an alien at a gas station so this is our second encounter at a gas station 
and this comes from ufo contactee john hunter gray on march 20th 1988 john hunter gray and his son 
had a missing time encounter outside of richland center wisconsin but it was before this encounter 
that something very strange happened they were at a gas station in la crosse wisconsin 
when they saw a very strange looking gentleman next to them at the gas station i'll just let 
john hunter gray describe what happened in his own words as he says and I quote an odd thing 
occurred at a mobile station at la crosse just as we were climbing into the pickup 
after gassing up a strange looking little man bundled in a coat and a greek fisherman's cap 
rushed in a stumbling fashion from the station to his volvo
john was really impressed because not only was the man strange looking and the way he walked 
was strange and he was very sh little and short he was also wrapped up in all these clothes that 
covered pretty much his entire body even though it was warm daylight outside the hat was overly large 
it had a huge rim it covered most of his face and the man also wore sunglasses so really you 
could see very little skin at all but at one point john looked this figure in the eyes and he could 
feel as he says the piercing gaze of the strange little man so as this man kind of stumbled in a 
weird kind of gate into his car they drove off and the man started to follow them in his car 
as john hunter grace says we left the station on a little intra la cross freeway he followed us 
i slowed down substantially but he declined to pass he remained behind us until we took the 14 
16 turn off in the aftermath of the encounter our minds were drawn repeatedly to this seemingly 
insignificant episode because it was right after this gentleman turned off from the highway that 
john hunter gray and his son encountered a ufo had missing time and were taken on board 
john hunter gray by the way experienced more than 20 physiological improvements healings as a result 
of his ufo encounter which he recalled naturally without the age of hypnosis 
and now they're wondering if this encounter at the gas station was connected to this missing 
time encounter that they had and that perhaps this figure at the gas station was an actual e.t could 
be because this is sort of the pattern we see in these types of cases and here's another case we 
now move to case seven aliens at a hotel this case comes from violinist and ufo researcher author 
timothy good who has written a series of books about ufos often involving human looking ETs 
timothy good became interested in ufos in 1961 began reading and researching about them 
and learned that telepathy plays a strong role in ufo encounters so knowing that there 
are human looking ETs and that they communicate telepathically he wondered if they were walking 
among us and it might be possible for him to contact them so he decided to do an experiment 
he was in new york at the park sheraton hotel and he sat down in the lobby for about an hour and 
started sending out the mental message if there are any space people around let your presence be 
known and to his surprise this experiment appeared to work as timothy good says and I quote 
finally is I was about to give up a very healthy looking man about 5 10 came over 
and sat down beside me and took out a copy of the new york times from his attache case stunned 
timothy good mentally requested if you're a space man touch your finger to your nose the response 
was immediate and positive as timothy good says without once looking directly at me he did exactly 
as I had requested in my silent message timothy good was so amazed that he was unable to react 
as the man quickly stood up and walked away but to this day he is convinced that he made contact 
with a human looking e.t right there at the park sheraton hotel in manhattan new york city 
so there you go I mean case after case like this and now we move on to another case which is 
case eight an alien on the seventh avenue subway this is another case in new york city for whatever 
reason new york seems to have a lot of these cases and this case involves an anonymous witness 
in the summer of 1969 she was writing the seventh avenue subway when she saw a gray alien 
as she says in the middle of the seventh avenue subway rush hour crowd I saw a little man about 
four feet tall he had a huge head but it was the quality of his skin that first caught my attention 
it didn't look like human skin but more like plastic or rubber I knew he wasn't 
human I tried to follow him with my eyes but he quickly got lost in the crowd no one else 
seemed to notice this disturbed me I thought I was seeing things
so many many cases of ETs in public places are what appear to be ET's another new york city case 
follows this is case nine alien at a cafe this involves a lady from the bronx in new york and 
she's had experiences her whole life in 1975 she was abducted from her home in the bronx 
and has had many encounters and one really unusual encounter occurred in 1995 at an outdoor cafe near 
battery park city in new york she was sitting at this outdoor cafe when suddenly she saw the short 
hazy silhouette of a gray alien approaching her table and as soon as it reached the table this 
gray became fully visible and told brenda to come with him and brenda suddenly found herself 
holding onto this being as they flew up over the hudson river and into a dark colored ufo hovering 
very high up in the sky once inside brenda was subjected subjected to a typical sort of physical 
examination and then was returned to this sidewalk cafe in battery park city new york 
so yeah ET's can appear in the most unlikely places and if you don't believe that case there's 
always another one to fill its place we now move to case number 10 an alien at penn station 
it was october 1st 1999 in the afternoon when an anonymous witness saw a very tall non-human 
looking entity in the middle of a crowd at penn station a very crowded train station 
as this anonymous witness writes I was ascending the escalator at penn station when I reached the 
street level about 20 feet away I saw what seemed like a male figure standing about six feet seven 
inches near the mouth of the entrance to the station crowds of commuters flowed around him as 
though he wasn't there he stared at the variety of passerbys as though he was trying to choose one of 
them I caught a glimpse of his face maybe his eyes too I don't remember if he looked at me or not the 
witness says that uh she stared at this figure for only a few seconds and then kept walking because she became afraid and she says the fear instilled in me was so tremendous that to this day 
i can't explain it his face was not human his eyes looked right through you it was something I wanted 
to forget as soon as possible but I couldn't it was as though he had some kind of will that said 
keep walking don't stop don't look this does not concern you his face was a light gray almost 
white thick brown menacing eyes and the thing that stays in my mind the most was his stature 
or the way he was standing his back arched broad shoulders his elbows pointed towards his back 
his head tilted down just a bit looking at the tops of people's heads scoping them out
so there you go an alien at penn station and there are many cases here's another case that I covered 
in my presentation the top 20 cases in nevada also covered in my book ufos over in nevada but 
i thought i'd tell it here because it's such an extraordinary case this is case eleven aliens at a 
casino and it comes from nevada-based researcher misha johnston she's also an experiencer she's 
written a book about her experiences and she interviewed a gentleman who was a security guard 
at a casino and he was in one of the monitoring rooms where there were many screens 
which looked over the gambling tables and he was in this room when everyone's attention was drawn 
to one table where there were around six or seven people gambling including what appeared to be two 
short figures with largish bald heads and they were wearing what looked like white tunics or 
robes and it was very interesting because no one around them seemed to notice these figures or 
notice how strange they were looking and what was even more strange was during this event 
one of these figures actually looked up and straight into the camera this was a hidden camera 
people did not know where it is you shouldn't be able to see it from the table and yet this figure seemed to know exactly where this camera was and looked right into the camera 
so this casino security guard was able to sneak out some of the footage and as you can see from 
this picture it does appear to show very strange looking figures at this casino casino table 
and there as it turns out are a number of cases involving ET's at casinos another case 
was reported by an anonymous gentleman who saw what he believes are ET's at the tropicana casino 
as this gentleman says I went to the restroom around four am and on my way back to the tables 
i stopped and watched a peculiar individual walking up the stairs this person had a hat and 
sunglasses on yet something wasn't right with the way he was walking or climbing the stairs 
it looked like he was stuck in the mud his knees sort of came out to the side as he tried 
raising his feet to take the next step I also noticed that there were about three more that looked just like him at the top of the stairs yet some were taller they were all skinny tall 
and I recall noticing their whitish like hair that seemed to shimmer as if the light was bouncing off of it I have never seen hair like this before my reaction was what a freak 
and it was at this exact moment that the figure that was walking up the stairs stopped turned 
around and stared at the witness as if reading his thoughts the witness quickly returned to his 
table and it wasn't until 15 years later or so that he heard about charles hall 
in a weather observer from nevada who wrote a series of books called millennial hospitality 
charles hall is a contactee who claims that he met tall whites and that these were largely 
human-looking ET's who would sometimes travel to las vegas casinos in disguise wearing wigs and 
makeup and such and that they would mingle among the local population so yeah aliens at casinos 
these are just a few of the cases involving aliens at casinos but I definitely thought it was 
worth mentioning because it shows the same pattern of aliens in public places 
and now we move to the next case which is case 12 aliens in a convenience store this is one 
of my favorite cases of this kind it's quite strange it comes from ufo researcher and author 
john columbo in his book ufos over canada this case occurred on may 24 1958 
in toronto canada and the main witness is a gentleman by the name of david harris he's 
a musician a drummer and a security guard and he was just a teenager at the time of this incident 
he was in his home with his family when they saw a ufo land in an area they call the witch's orchard 
this is a grove of maple trees which is now perhaps better known as maple leaf forever park 
so david and his family watched this ufo land and after it landed these two figures walked 
out of the orchard they were strange looking figures and david's mom turned to david and says 
those people are from that thing we are going to follow them and find out where they're going so 
david his mom and his brother followed these two people into the local town there and they walked 
into the little convenience store not far from their home and david's mom instructed him to walk 
into the convenience store and buy some popsicles and see what these two figures were up to 
and as david says I could see the back of the man he had on a pair of long 
black boots he wore a black belt he had a tanned complexion and sandy blond hair 
david said it was strange because as he stood next to these people he felt this unbelievably 
powerful feeling of goodness coming from them as he says I felt good inside I felt good 
as I was standing beside him so he carefully observed this strange man and woman 
and his as david says what stood out in my mind was the gray color of the uniforms 
the lady and the man were wearing the lady's long black boots her thin body structure 
her black hair and as is typical in these kinds of cases these figures started asking very strange 
questions as david says next the lady looked at me and started asking questions about where they were 
she said they were time travelers or something like that I felt full of love and power she 
then turned to the store owner and asked him about the cigarettes on the shelf behind him 
she kept on asking questions about everything so I knew that they were not from here 
their dress was really different her suit was sort of transparent but not tight-fitting she wore 
earrings like the man she had on a black belt I remember that his belt had keys on it a number of 
silver like skeleton keys fastened to the left side of his belt this lady then walked right up 
to david and asked his name and spoke to him about religion and other subjects telling him 
that he would understand at a later age and as david said she knew that I saw the two of them 
come off the ship she asked me if I would like to go with the two of them into the ship I said yes 
but then her companion interrupted her she turned to him and he began to talk to her in a different 
language it sounded weird but I felt that I would be willing to go anywhere with them 
i felt great trust coming from both of them love the greater knowledge of freedom that they had 
after a few more bizarre questions the strange couple left and david his mother and 
little brother followed this couple down the street and the next thing they know they are 
waking up in the living room of their house so they had missing time and as david says 
both my mom and I had been put to sleep and were back waking up at the same time 
my mom was sitting at the end of the couch beside a window steve was sitting on the floor 
and I was out of it I felt high I looked at my mom her hair was messed up and she was nodding 
we were going in and out of consciousness the first thing she did was look out the window to 
her right and she looked around the apartment and said oh look the popsicles have melted 
so yeah a very strange case in which ETs apparently came into the local convenience 
store and then back into their craft and this was a missing time encounter so it's I think it's 
a definite possibility that david and his mom and brother were also taken on board the craft 
although although they have no memory of this so these are the kinds of cases we're hearing 
of aliens in public places and here's another case this is case 13 aliens at a church this case comes 
from prominent ufo researcher richard dolan and appears in his book ufos for the 20th century 
mind and this case involves a young woman who saw a very strange looking couple 
in a church in pennsylvania she went to the church with her family and her attention was drawn to 
a strange yet attractive looking blond-haired couple sitting up towards the front of the church 
and they were wearing matching blue suits that according to the witness were like perfectly 
put together and uh this couple seemed really unfamiliar with all the church rituals that were 
going on and this is when things became very strange this witness started to telepathically 
hear this couple conversing between each other she could hear what they were saying telepathically to 
each other and at one point the female turned to the her male companion and said telepathically she 
can hear us so it was apparent to the witness that this strange couple knew that they were being 
observed by her and following the church services this couple quickly departed the church service 
and the witness ran after them into a little park area a wooded area beyond the church and as she 
was following them a mysterious figure emerged from the woods and confronted her and she became 
quite frightened because he was very tall wearing a hat he was all dressed in black and had a very 
strange appearance and in fact reminded her of lurch from the adams family and this was 
enough to stop her from following any further and that's where this case ends so yeah apparently 
another case of ET's in a public place and here's another case case 14 aliens at a coffee bar 
this is a very strange case a lot of strange elements it took place in dunadine new zealand 
at a popular coffee bar a coffee shop this was on july 12 1975 when four friends richard pat nancy 
and ross all decided to go to this restaurant at the time they were suffering from a slight case 
of the flu and they had sat down at a table and were beginning to drink and eat when suddenly time 
appeared to stop suddenly all sound stopped and nobody was moving at all so this was very strange 
one of the witnesses richard was really struck by the sight of the steam standing perfectly still 
coming from the coffee machines and a waitress bending over the stove pulling out hotcakes she 
was completely frozen in place as was everybody except for these four people were able to move 
and this is when suddenly a figure appeared at the top of the stairs on the opposite side of 
the room which is the only public entrance into this establishment and this figure was 
a man a young man about six feet tall slender with black wavy hair and olive green skin 
he was well dressed in normal clothes but seemed to have a whitish aura of light glowing around him 
and as they watched this man floated levitated down the stairs across the room 
and to the line where people were waiting to order their food and the moment he got into 
line suddenly everything became normal again time resumed the sounds came back 
and this gentleman just waited in line so they stared at him as he ordered his a glass of juice 
and sat down at a nearby table he turned them and acknowledged them with a smile 
and they decided that they were going to confront this man but instead of going up to his table directly they left the restaurant and awaited at the entrance unfortunately the man never came out 
so they went back inside and he was nowhere to be found very strange even stranger was that all 
four of them who had been suffering from the flu noticed that their flu symptoms had completely 
disappeared so i'm not sure what's going on here but there is an interesting sequel to this event 
it was just six weeks later when this same group of people these four friends were at the same 
restaurant when a very similar I mean this man showed up again and
they were all sitting in the restaurant when this man appeared at the stairs 
and walked down the stairs normally this time uh he again seemed to have an aura of light around 
him no one else seemed to notice him and he sat down at a nearby table again ordered a glass of 
juice and smiled back at them and this time they decided that they were going to walk directly to 
his table and confront him and ask him who he was and the instant they decided to do that they said 
that they couldn't they suddenly became compelled to leave the restaurant they couldn't help 
themselves they all quickly got up and walked out they did not want to they were trying not to 
but they felt as if they were compelled to do so one of them pat says that she tried 
desperately to turn around but was unable to do so and when she finally did she quickly 
returned back to the restaurant but the strange man was gone so apparently he was able to exert 
his willpower over these people I don't know it's a bizarre case I don't know what to make of some 
of these cases except that there are so many of them I think they deserve serious consideration 
and here's another one and this is again is a very bizarre case this is case 15 an alien on the beach 
and in a theater this case comes from dr david jacobs phd very prominent researcher 
who wrote the book the threat or they walk among us and other books on ufos 
uh he interviewed a abductee by the name of donna I believe that's a pseudonym and donna 
says that she had often seen an alien hybrid in public places in full public view as david 
jacobs writes and I quote donna's experiences began when she was a young child and by the 
time she was 20 she was meeting with her hybrid in public one such encounter took place in the summer 
of 1969 while donna and some of her friends were on a jetty enjoying the ocean in maine 
donna became separated from her friends and that was when this hybrid suddenly showed up he was 
wearing blue jeans a jacket and a t-shirt he had shoulder length hair and this hybrid and donna hid 
underneath the jetty there and he told her that he had seen her in a summer stock play the previous 
evening and according to donna this figure this hybrid told her that he had actually been in the 
audience watching her perform and donna had a familiar reaction to his presence as she says 
he's there and that's all I care about I can't get enough of him it's like every poor in my body 
wants to open up and take him and eventually donna was actually seduced by this hybrid and they ended 
up becoming intimate so again is the pattern we've seen in other cases and afterwards this mysterious 
figure disappeared as mysteriously as he arrived and years later she would be visited by him again 
so she has seen this same gentleman several times and often when he appears he seduces her and they 
end up becoming intimate it's definitely a pattern we see in some of these cases 
and I know of another case of a lady I was able to talk to personally this I call case 16. an alien 
at a ufo convention unfortunately I was not able to do a formal interview with this woman so I 
really can't say for sure about this case but uh this lady was a tall dark-haired attractive woman 
who said that she was at a ufo convention and decided to take a break and was sitting in the 
corridor in the hallway when suddenly there was a powerful flash of light right in front of her and 
outstepped a gentleman this sort of weird mist or smoke dissipated and here's this attractive 
looking smartly dressed gentleman who walked up to her and told her that he was an e.t who mingled 
among the local population and occasionally visited for a while and then would leave 
off to wherever he was coming from not quite sure what to make of it but the lady who I spoke with 
the witness uh wanted to share the story and she asked me are there any other cases like this have 
you ever heard of anything like this I had to tell her that yes these these sort of cases do turn up 
unfortunately again I was not able to do a formal interview with her but it just 
goes to show that there are ET's showing up in public places and there are plenty more cases 
and I would repeat them but they start to get repetitive i'll just mention a few real briefly 
there in one case comes from contactee howard menger who wrote a book from outer space to you about his contacts with human looking ETs 
he says he met a human looking e.t while recovering in a army tent hospital in okinawa 
during the world war and he says later while in new jersey he was having contacts with 
human looking ET's who would sometimes travel into town to buy fruits and vegetables and other items 
and were absolutely human looking at could mingle among the local population 
another similar case comes from controversial contactee george adamski 
who says that he met human looking ETs in a hotel lobby and later at a public restaurant his case 
is controversial there are some researchers who feel that his case at least in part is genuine 
then of course there's billy meyer whose case is also controversial billy meyer is a farmer 
from switzerland who's had repeated contacts and with a female e.t by the name of semyazi 
and according to billy meyer samyazi often would mingle among the local population 
another case involving a contactee is that a frank stranges a california-based contactee 
who is probably most famous for telling the story of valiant thor a human looking e.t again 
a very controversial case the reason I bring these up is because there are so many of them 
another case comes from ludwig palmin who wrote a book about his encounters with wendell c stevens 
according to ludwig he met a human looking e.t by the name of satu ra while traveling by train 
through india and uh also later had a visit with this human-looking e.t while recovering from uh 
kidney stones in peru he says he was actually healed by uh a human-looking e.t 
while in this hospital so make of it what you will there are a lot of these cases just one final one 
comes from ingo swann the famous psychic who wrote a book about some of his experiences 
uh as a psychic spy and also with about ufos and his contacts this book is called penetration 
and according to ingo swan he met what he believes was a female e.t in a grocery store 
in los angeles california he described her as being extraordinarily beautiful 
which is a description we hear from a lot of these witnesses so there you go that's 15 20 cases of 
human looking ETs in public places are not always human-looking sometimes grays or strange humanoids 
so make of it what you will but these cases do have a lot of commonalities 
david jacobs is believed that these types of encounters will probably increase in number 
as time goes on because he believes ETs have a plan to sort of mingle among the human population 
as david jacobs says and I quote independent hybrid activity is a logical outcome of the 
abduction phenomena and the breeding program and it has profound implications for the future 
of human alien interaction it involves hybrids who can for short periods of time pass 
unnoticed in human society acting independently and free from the presence and control 
of the grays late-stage hybrids strive to pass for human but within limits 
in public they dress like humans blend into the general population and go unnoticed they usually 
wear average casual clothes the males wear jeans or cockies t-shirts or long-sleeve shirts late 
stage hybrids may dress in military-like clothes such as one-piece jumpsuits that resemble flight 
suits because they look so humid it is easy to mistake them for american military personnel and 
many abductees have linked military personnel to their abductions but definitely they are among us 
i wrote about some of these cases and others in my book not from here volume one I think there 
are enough of these cases to say that they do occur and there's very interesting commonalities 
to these cases in case after case these ETs are described as having a very strange appearance 
they're they look exotic often the witnesses will mention their hypnotic eyes the hypnotic quality 
of their eyes so I think that's a definite clue also they're often described as dressed 
strangely either in weird clothes or perhaps are bundled up completely wearing hats 
sunglasses and gloves so that no skin shows at all they are described as walking strangely 
shuffling or as the gentleman in the casino case said walking as if in mud 
so that's strange not only do they look strange dress strange they move strangely 
and beyond that their behavior is strange they ask all these bizarre questions about society 
and about common things that every person here on earth knows another weird aspect 
to these cases is that some of them end up with people having intimate relations with the ET's 
i know of a few other cases I didn't mention and wish that happened so that is definitely a pattern 
as well and a final pattern that turns up in a number of these cases is that the people will be 
talking to these figures and suddenly they will disappear i'll turn around for a second and boom 
this figure is gone so all these strange details begin to add up and the fact that they appear over 
and over again in separate cases I think really lends a level of corroboration and credibility 
to them I don't know i'm really not sure what to make of some of these cases but I wanted to 
present them because there are so many and I think they have these very interesting commonalities 
i think they have something to say about this phenomena which is that not only can 
ufos appear anywhere but ET's themselves can't appear anywhere apparently grays do have the 
ability to disguise themselves as humans and et's can be seen in the most unlikely places 
so next time you're out in public I think it might be a good idea to watch out for people who are 
walking strangely who look a little different or off who are dressed strangely and show all these 
different attributes that might mark them as ets walking among us so that's the show for today 
i hope you've enjoyed this strange and bizarre episode I want to thank you very much for watching 
i really appreciate it and until next time keep searching for the truth and keep having fun
