Summary:
Aug 15, 2025 (1:00:59)
A face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature is one of the most shocking and mindboggling experiences a person can have. And it happens more often than you might think. There are many thousands of documented cases. Most people who have these kinds of encounters rarely report it to UFO groups, so the actual number is likely much higher. These cases have been occurring for at least a hundred years and probably much longer. They occur all over the world to all kinds of people. This episode presents six particularly unusual cases. In each of these cases, the witnesses not only held conversations with the ETs, but they were given information that impacted them for the rest of their lives.
 
THE ALIEN PLAN. One evening in April 1962, five-year-old Worthington White woke up in his grandmother’s home in Quantico, Virginia to see light flooding into his bedroom through the attic door. He noticed three short child-like figures standing in the room. One of them approached and began to communicate telepathically, downloading information into his brain. The next morning, he knew his life would never be the same. In fact, he had incredibly ambitious goals and a whole new plan for his life. Growing up, he faced many challenges, but the advice given to him by the ETs appeared in his mind and helped chart the course of his life, eventually putting him in an incredibly influential career at the very top of the US government.

A GRAY SAT NEXT TO ME. One night in June 1963, seventeen-year-old Victor was driving along a remote road in Deptford, New Jersey. Without warning, his headlights failed, his car engine quit, and he rolled to a stop. A sudden inexplicable and overwhelming fear swept through him and he realized someone was sitting next to him in his car. Looking over, he was shocked to see a short gray alien. It looked at him with such peace that he became instantly calm. In then communicating him with telepathically, filling his mind with volumes of information. It then disappeared, but from that point on, Victor slowly discovered that the gray had taught him many things.

THE RAINBOW MAN. One afternoon in summer 1974, two brothers, Thomas (age 5) and Kevin (age 4) from Needmore, Pennsylvania, noticed a hippy-looking man sit down in their backyard. The man began to communicate to them telepathically. Both boys noticed the man had a visible aura filled with rainbow colors. The man shared knowledge with them about themselves and the universe, taking them on an interactive journey into some of Earth’s natural wonders, and teaching them both about their past, present and future life. Both were deeply impacted by the encounter and found that the knowledge the man shared with them helped to guide them throughout their adult life.

I WAS SO SCARED, I STARTED TO CRY. One night in summer 1988, a young boy, Jose de Diego Vazquez, was walking through the Yunque Rain Forest in Puerto Rico as part of a survival training course. Strange lights flew overhead and landed behind a large rock. Jose was petrified with fear when a male humanoid stepped out and began to speak with him, telling him not to be afraid. The figure then used strange symbols to share astounding information with the young boy. The man disappeared, and Jose ran back to camp only to be faced with a strange mystery. No time had passed during the entire encounter!

THE BLOOD OF THE KINGS. On the night of January 10, 2010, a man heard a strange knocking sound on his back door in Toledo Ohio. Going to investigate, he was met by a short gray alien. The man invited the gray inside, at which point, a long conversation followed. The gray saud they had observed the man since childhood, that they were very interested in his genetics, and then proceeded to answer all the witness’s questions, even allowing the witness to touch the ET. The ET had some questions of his own. It was an encounter that would change the witness’s life.

THE HARVESTERS OF MEMORIES. Ever since he was a young boy, Christopher, a boy from South Dakota, had been visited by gray ETs. Usually they stood by his bed and seemed to study him. The visits occurred at least twice a year, but doubled when Christopher (who was being treated for Aspergers and depression) decided to stop taking prescription medicine. Christopher suddenly excelled physically, mentally and creatively. Then, on the night of February 26, 2015, he was visited by an 8-foot-tall elder gray who spoke to him telepathically, sharing incredible volumes of information about the ETs and their mission on Earth, and explained exactly why they found him to be of particular interest to them.

These six cases are important because they show that often an encounter with a humanoid appears to be an intentional event designed to impart wisdom to an individual to help guide them through their lives. They show that extraterrestrial contact can play a very powerful role in a person’s life-path.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. If you've watched my channel for any length of time, you know how much I love to cover humanoid cases. And of course, that's what I'm going to be talking about tonight. I have six really amazing cases to share with you today.
The title of today's episode is called Mind-boggling Humanoid Encounters.
Six shocking cases. I tell you, these cases are absolutely shocking, really
mind-boggling. They contain details I have never heard before. All of them are
very extensive. Some of them, the witnesses had very long interactive
conversations with the ETSs. Pretty much all of them got all kinds of information
from the ETSs, downloads in some cases, but direct conversations in others.
These cases come from a wide variety of locations including New Jersey, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, and one in Puerto Rico. They covered
quite a long period of time from 1962 to 2015. I know a bunch of you out there
have asked me to cover more recent cases, so there's definitely some recent cases in this one. These do involve
exclusively grays and humanlooking ETSs. Most of these are just single witness
cases. There is one involving two witnesses, but all of them, I'm telling
you, are very unusual. Really, the theme of today's episode is how deeply and
profoundly an encounter can impact a person for the rest of their lives.
really chart the course of their lives, guide them in making decisions for years
afterwards. So that's the theme of this episode and we see it in all of these
cases. So let's just get started. First case I'd like to talk about today I call
the alien plan. This occurred one evening in April of 1962 to a 5-year-old
boy in Quantico, Virginia. Yes, he's very young when he had his encounter,
but this gentleman ended up being very influential in society. As you'll see,
he's an incredibly credible witness. I'm almost 100% sure you haven't heard this
case before, but it deserves to be widely known because man oh man, this
case is just amazing. The witness in this case is a gentleman by the name of
Worthington White and he had a remarkable encounter at age five which would chart the course of his life
forever. At the time of his encounter, this was one evening in 1962.
He was staying with his two older brothers and his mother at his grandmother's home in Quantico,
Virginia. On that evening, he was sleeping in the center room with his two brothers. His two brothers were sharing
a large bed while he slept alone in a smaller bed. There was an opening to the
attic in the room with a ladder leading down to the floor. This detail is important given what happens next. And
I'll just let Worthington describe his encounter in his own words. As he says,
"I awoke to a constant light coming down the attic opening. I noticed no
movement, but there were three small childlike beings standing at the bottom of the ladder. I did not see them use
the ladder. Two went to the large bed my brothers were in and seemed to hold their hands out. My brothers just slept
quietly. One came over to me and I realized I was trying to scream and
scream and nothing came out. I tried to wake my brother and nothing came out. I
then realized that the one was communicating with me and I with him, but we were not talking. I was five.
What did I know? It seemed to go on for a while, but I had no real track of time. But it did not feel like I knew
what I had done the entire time, like missing time, but not really. So, these
little figures had communicated something to him, but at the time, he really wasn't sure what. When he woke up
the next morning, he was very well-rested. But he says his entire outlook on life changed. At first, he
didn't actually remember the encounter, but he did have the sense that he had a brand new plan for his life. As he says,
"I went from a dumb kid to a dumb kid with a plan, and that the plan would work, and I knew it." As Worthington
says in his own words, "I began telling my mother I was going to do great things in sports and that she gave me a name no
one else had and that one day I would be a butler at the White House." The
president would say, "Worththing, get me a drink." I told her and she would laugh
and laugh. So, as time passed and Worthington faced the various challenges in his life, he did begin to remember
this childhood encounter. As Worthington says, later in life when I had difficult
choices to make, the memories came to me then, strong, but it was not new information. It was like I already knew
it and just remembered it when I needed it. It's hard to explain. In school, I
had trouble as I am dyslexic and it went unknown until the 1990s.
I got into sports and I learned that I could talk my way out of anything and seem to change the minds or control
adults. I knew I was going to be a champion and I worked my ass off because
I was driven to see what I could do. I knew it was going to be something. It's hard to describe. I was just a kid. I
achieved well above my ability. I was all American in Woodbridge Senior High
School. I wrestled and pinned Hall of Fame professional wrestler Tony Atlas
twice and I am in the Hall of Fame at Woodbridge Senior High School. I went to
Virginia Tech on a football ride but got physically abused by a coach so I quit.
I had a8 GPA and being dyslexic, there was no way I was ever going to make it
there. So Worthington ended up joining the Army as a 91B medic assigned to the
Blackhawk program. He later had a short stint at the United States Post Office, but ended up crashing three male trucks.
So that didn't work out. But then his brother-in-law got him a job interview.
And to his shock, it was a job at the White House and he got the job. His
official title was White House Executive Residence Administrator, or in a word,
Butler. As Worthington says, I began service under Ronald Reagan in 1980 and
retired in 2011 with Barack Obama hosting my retirement ceremony in the
diplomatic reception room. Now, Worthington, of course, has many stories about his time in the White House. As he
told author Kate Anderson Broer, she wrote the book First Woman: The Grace
and Power of America's First Ladies. He told her, "I was an independent Republic. I would say I voted for the
president, no matter who it was." Worthington said that while working for the Clintons during the Lewinsky
scandal, Hillary approached him with an unusual request and said, "Worththing, I
want you to go to the pool, but I don't want to see anybody except you." And he replied, "Yes, ma'am. I understand." He
knew that she did not want to see the Secret Service detail or anyone on a tour of the West Wing. She just wanted a
few hours of peace. So, he told her that he would need five minutes to fulfill her request. And as he says, it was a
20-se secondond conversation, but I knew what she meant. If anybody sees her or she sees anybody, I'm going to get
fired. I know it. This is what he told the Secret Service agent and told him,
"And you probably will, too. She's not going to turn around and look for you. She just doesn't want to see your face,
and she doesn't want you looking at her face. So instead of walking ahead and
behind her, the agents just trailed her." Worthington met her at the elevator as she carried some reading
glasses and a couple of books. Worthington actually said she looked heartbroken and he asked her, "Ma'am, do
you need any butler service?" And she said, "No." He asked her, "Do you need anything at all?" And she said, "No,
it's just a beautiful day and I want to just sit here and I'll call you when I get back." The problem was it was noon
and Worthington's shift ended at 1:00. He told her so, and she looked at him intently and said, "I'll call you when
I'm done." Which Worthington knew meant that he had to stay on after his shift.
And sure enough, she called him at 3:30 and he guided her back to the second floor. But as they stepped off the
elevator, she let Worthington know how much his efforts meant to her. As Worthington says, she grabbed me by my
hands and gave them a little squeeze and looked me directly in my eyes and just said, "Thank you." It touched my heart.
It meant the world to me. So, this is important given Worthington's early encounter with the Grays. He also
remembered an amusing event when the Obamas moved in. This was right after their first inaugural ball. And as
Worthington says, all of a sudden, I heard President Obama say, "I got this.
I got this. I got the insight on this now." And suddenly the music picked up and it was Mary J. Blige. Turned out the
song was Real Love. And then President Obama turned to Worthington and said, "I bet you haven't seen anything like this
in the House, have you?" Now, Worthington does attribute his unusual life path, at least in part to his
encounter with the Grays, apparently the Grays, at age five, where they looks
like, instilled him with what he calls a quote plan. And he is actually now able
to remember much more of what these little figures told him. And this is what he believes this plan was. As
Worthington says, the plan as you go through life, different chances will
present themselves to you. These chances or doors will be open to you to choose,
and your life is determined by which doors you choose. And if you go through them without looking back once you make
a decision on going through a door, go with all your might and do not look back. Things will work out. And as he
said, this advice would enter his mind each time he had to pass through one of these so-called doors or make a
difficult decision. And his predictions, or perhaps the predictions from these little figures who visited him that he
would excel in sports and would one day work at the White House, of course, all came true. As Worthington says, I knew I
would work at the White House. I said it from age five and that I would do great things in sports. I know what happened
and so do you. How cool is that? Can you imagine your 5-year-old child coming up
to you and saying, "Mom, one day I'm going to work in the White House." You'd
probably laugh like his mother did. But guess what? It turned out to be true. And it's clear that his encounter played
a powerful role in how he made choices in his life. It's really interesting how
he finally recalled this sort of download that the grays gave to him. So
glad this gentleman came forward. It's really amazing and it makes me wonder how many people are out there in high
stations in society in very influential jobs and have had encounters as a child
which perhaps affected them in some way. So amazing. And that's true, I think, in
this next case, which I call a gray sat next to me. This one occurred one
evening in June of 1963 in Deford Township in New Jersey. The witness in
this case is a teenage boy of driving age. I think he's 17 years old, but such
an unusual case. The details in this case, at least one, I have never heard
before. really profound and once again fits the theme of how an encounter can
affect you for a very long time afterwards, decades. Technically, this
case is uninvestigated, but I think it's an important firsthand testimony of a
really poignant encounter with a gray. The witness is an anonymous teenage boy.
I'll call him Victor. He was just 17 years old at the time of his encounter and again lived in Deepford Township in
New Jersey. This is just across the border from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was around 7:15 p.m. one evening in
June of 1963 that Victor set off from his home to pick up a girl he was
dating. Unfortunately, when he arrived, she canled the date because some relatives had just arrived to visit her.
So, Victor decided to go to the local hangout in his neck of the woods, a little diner, and he drove along a long,
straight road that was pretty remote. There were no houses and almost no traffic. And as Victor says, I'm
cruising along in my 1956 Chevy convertible when it started to miss. It
quickly shut off completely. The radio, parking lights, and dash all went off. I
put my trannney in neutral and coasted to a stop. I just stayed in my lane because there was no traffic at all.
Never were any cars in that road. So, thinking at first he must have run out of gas, he checked his gas gauge. But
that wasn't the problem. He did remember that he had just put $3 in the gas tank
the day before in preparation for his date. So, he knew it wasn't a problem with running out of gas. And as he sat
there trying to figure things out, something really incredible happened. And I'll just quote Victor as he says,
"That's when I experienced the worst case of fear that I ever had to this day. I was looking straight ahead with
both hands on the steering wheel and I felt that someone was sitting next to me in the front seat. I was frozen with
fear. All I could do was slowly turn my head to look. I was shaking so bad but
could not move. With my head turned to face the little entity sitting next to me, I saw a small little what looked to
be a child looking right at me. At that moment, the fear was replaced with a calmness that was unlike any I had ever
known. Now, in hindsight, Victor now knows that this entity sitting next to him was a gray alien. As Victor says, it
was an off-white, almost gaseous looking little thing. Its head was barely as high as the back of the seat, and its
legs stuck straight out just over the end of the seat. It was very small. By
this time, I am completely calm. It then spoke to me without saying a word. It
communicated telepathically with me. In my mind, I heard, "Don't be afraid." At
that time, I noticed an expression on its face like a mother looking at her
child. We stared at each other for a few minutes, and my mind was on fire with
information on many different levels, too fast for me to separate and focus on any one thing. Then it started to fade.
the more transparent it got. The fear started to settle in on me again. Suddenly, I was able to move just as it
was completely gone. My dash came back on. I looked again and it was gone.
Scared again, I hit the starter and the car came to life. I put it in gear and
peeled the tires off of it and flew out to the diner. It took about 15 minutes for Victor to reach the diner. A couple
of his friends were already there, but he did not tell them what happened. And in fact, he told almost nobody. He did
get married two years later and told his wife, though even she was skeptical, and
he didn't report the experience until 52 years after it happened. But he did say
that there was one other after effect of the encounter. During the moments he and the gray were staring at each other, the
information that the gray apparently downloaded into his mind began to manifest throughout his life. Z says,
"Since then, I seem to have an understanding of things that I shouldn't." I think that last sentence
from the witness is really important that he seems to know things that he
shouldn't. This is really a direct indication that there was more communication going on than he initially
realized. I think that's true with a lot of encounters because we're seeing this theme over and over again of how an
encounter not only affects a person emotionally and spiritually and psychically but really guides the path
of their life to some extent. We absolutely see that in this next case. This is the only multiple witness in
this compilation. This one does involve two young brothers, and I'm glad they
had each other to lean on and confirm the details because this case is off the
charts different from any I've ever heard. It's really profound and I think
an important case. I call this one the Rainbow Man. This occurred one afternoon
in the summer of 1974 in the very small town of Needmmore, Pennsylvania, and
absolutely fits this theme of how deeply an encounter can impact a person and
guide them for the rest of their lives. The two witnesses, in this case, again, brothers, do want to be anonymous. I
call them Thomas and his brother Kevin. At the time of their encounter, Thomas
was age five and his brother Kevin was one year younger, four years old. Was
late afternoon one day in the summer of 1974. The brother's family had just enjoyed a
family gathering, and afterwards, Thomas and Kevin were playing in the backyard.
This is when they both suddenly noticed a man come into the backyard. He walked over to their very large tree and sat
down in a lotus position under this tree. First, he did appear to be a
normallooking man. He had kind of a hippie-like appearance. He had long dark
brown hair. He had a headband around his head, what looked like a guitar strap on
his chest. He wore a fringe vest, patched jeans, and sandals. Now, Thomas,
the older brother, was shy and leerary of strangers. But Kevin, one year younger, was very gregarious. So when
the man waved and said hello to the boys, the younger brother Kevin waved back and started to approach. Thomas
immediately cautioned his brother not to walk up to this man. But then he noticed something strange. He could actually
hear the man's thoughts in his head, in his mind. And not only this man's thoughts, but his little brother's
thoughts as well. In fact, there was this instant raort of telepathic communication between all three of them.
As Thomas says, I became aware of the first of several unusual occurrences I
could not and cannot explain. I heard my brother's thoughts and the man's as well
without any actually speaking, and they could hear mine. Whatever this hippie
man said, thought, or did next put me not only at ease, but I became drawn to
him, just like my brother. So this telepathic connection was astounding enough, but now the brothers were even
more amazed to see that this man had a visible aura, kind of like a colorful
rainbow emanating around him. As Thomas says, all about him in sporadic parts
and places. It looked like a rainbow, but not static. a rainbow that moved and
undulated. The rainbow aura around him was alive. This was the second unusual
thing I cannot explain. Now, due to this single detail lies the proof in my mind
that this event actually occurred because independently we both observed
and knew this to be a fact. It is why my brother named him the rainbow man. So
now completely amazed, the two brothers sat down next to this man. And Kevin,
the younger one, was always curious, began to ask the man questions. And the
man responded in a way that really astounded them both. He not only communicated telepathically, he started
showing them live images. As Thomas says, "Many thoughts, ideas, queries,
and answers were exchanged during our encounter. Most I have vague to little
or zero recollection of. I could not articulate as a child the phenomenon of
telepathic communication, but I understand now how we participated in a three-way conversation and how the
rainbow man spoke to us individually simultaneously in conjunction with bowing his head
low." and then raising it up very slowly, mechanically I describe it, to a
position suitable for viewing our little statures. It was then that his head opened up like a very large book, but
instead of words, pictures, or photographs, it was live. Back then, I
associated it with watching television, except the visual wasn't just that, but
nearly an immersive interaction, like a gateway. He took us to places in an
active and interactive way. We experienced situations existing in a
molecular level. All of this engagement, exchanging of massive amounts of
information and digestible knowledge began and ended seemingly
instantaneously. So both Kevin and Thomas say that it was almost as if the man took them physically on an adventure
to other places. They weren't just seeing things, they felt like they were actually there. As Thomas says, first he
took us into the tree we sat under from its steepest roots up on through its
entirety to the edge of the highest leaf. In the process, we learned all
that there was to know about this tree. I suspect he took us to other places
based on our curiosities, but I recall only one other in particular. He took us
into the sea underwater where we saw dolphins, a turtle, and a hammerhead
shark. While Kevin and I shared these encounters, the Rainbow Man gave us
individual engagements separate from each other. So, in other words, while
the younger brother Kevin was asking questions and getting answers, so was Thomas. The Rainbow Man was able to
converse with both of them individually at the same time. And the things the man told Thomas showed him just how truly
advanced this strange man was. As Thomas says, I asked him questions about my
life to come. He began by showing me the events that had occurred earlier that day with my family at our baby brother's
baptism at St. Bernard of Clairvo Catholic Church. He educated me on the
questions I had while observing this service in the round baptismal room with its narrow tall vertical stained glass
windows as the morning light beamed colors all about the space. He took me back to where my mind had wandered. Then
addressing all the morning's events, seeing and knowing how the choices my parents made and would make regarding
our religious upbringing would shape my future. I asked him why I had to learn
and experience all this religious dogma and lifestyle if in the end it had no
bearing on our life force and the potential guarantee for our consciousness after this life in the way
religion promised. What was the point of the teachings sacrificing and the agony
it would cause me if it was not the path or the truth? He told me it was necessary for my personal eventual
evolution that I needed these experiences to understand and appreciate
what I was to learn later to move forward towards my complete self. All
this led me to ask about my future. But before showing me what was ahead in this
life, he showed me that I had lived past lives. Now, as you can imagine, this was a lot
for 5-year-old Thomas to take in. But when the Rainbow Man began to talk about the events still to come in Thomas's
future, Thomas became even more overwhelmed. As Thomas says, he
eventually revealed to me that this lifetime was not going to turn out the way I wanted or expected it to. But in
the end, it would be okay. I would be okay. I am still struggling at the age
of 55 what he meant by that. I suppose I was pretty relentless in my queries
because his vast knowledge was allencompassing. I soon realized I did not want this
encounter to end. He seemed to have all the knowledge of the universe and was willing to share it so long as I
stumbled upon the right questions. My only effort was to ponder the understanding and knowledge he would
reveal. Eventually, he disclosed a shocking future event regarding my
brother and myself for which I was in no way prepared for. At this point, the man
told Thomas, quote, "One of you will have to live without the other." This
particular statement was almost too much for Thomas to handle. And as he says, I
had no concept of human death at that age. I do not know what he showed me, but it was so disturbing that I
disengaged from him. And in that instant, I ran into the house, leaving my brother out there with him. I was so
upset, I hid under our kitchen table and just cried, wishing the event never happened. I compartmentalized it all in
those moments, alone, in hiding. So Thomas has no idea how long he was with the Rainbow Man. It could have been
minutes or hours. He doesn't know. But he does remember vividly that the next morning his brother was very excited and
wanted to talk all about their encounter. But by this time Thomas had already distanced himself from the
event. He was in full denial and he refused to talk about it and he told Kevin that it all must have been a dream
they shared together. Naturally, this made Kevin very angry and frustrated.
And as they grew up and became teenagers, Kevin continued to broach this subject many times. And on each and
every occasion, Thomas would tell him it was just a dream and refused to talk about it. And of course, Kevin would
react with anger and frustration. And this led to considerable tension between the brothers. So that finally Kevin just
gave up speaking about it with his brother. They grew up into adults and this subject was not discussed. Despite
this, repercussions from this encounter became a regular feature in Thomas's
life. As he says, "As I lived my life on countless occasions, either during
events unfolding or after events unfolded, I either knew directly or
immediately recalled having prior knowledge, knowing it because the Rainbow Man told me or showed me." So,
so then in 2008 at age 39, this subject came up again through a sheer
synchronicity, Devon told his brother Thomas that he was very excited about the new XFiles movie coming out. But
Thomas told his brother that he didn't watch this show. He had never even seen a single episode. And Kevin asked him,
"Why is that?" Thomas replied, "Well, it's about aliens, right?" And Kevin
said, "Well, at times it is." So Thomas replied, "I don't care for science
fiction. I don't believe in any of it, especially aliens." At this point, his
little brother Kevin looked at him suspiciously, as only a brother can do, as if Thomas was lying, and he knew it.
And he said, "So what about the Rainbow Man?" So at that point, their conversation was interrupted.
But Thomas, having had his life so profoundly impacted by this encounter, decided that it was time to have a
conversation and learn what Kevin remembered about it. And in fact, he was very eager to find out what his brother
knew. They promised to talk about it at the next opportunity. But very sadly,
this did not happen because as Thomas says, we intended to get back to our
discussion. But before we had the opportunity, my brother Kevin died very
unexpectedly, leaving me to be the only one with this memory. So, as you can imagine, Thomas was devastated. His
brother and his only other witness was gone. And the many questions he had about the Rainbow Man swirled in his
mind. Was this man an extraterrestrial? Was he even real? If not, then what
happened? If it was real, then why did it happen? And why to them? Have other people had similar experiences? Did his
brother ever have further unexplained events? He had many questions, particularly, would he ever see the
Rainbow Man again? 50 years after this encounter, Kevin did report his encounter in the hopes that there are
other people out there who might be able to shed some light on it. As he says,
"By documenting my account, I am hoping it can aid in research when combined
with other persons with similar occurrences. Perhaps some questions and answers will be gleamed from it all."
Such an unusual case. I really wonder who this rainbow man was. The witnesses
do seriously consider the possibility that this was an extraterrestrial.
I kind of lean towards that explanation. Yes, he was humanl looking. No, they
didn't see a UFO, but they did call him a humanoid. This guy was clearly different. I suppose he might have been
what you'd call an enlightened master or a spirit guide of some kind. But it's so
unusual because here's this man, this guy explaining all these very deep
philosophical issues to two very young children, all about past lives, their
current lives, and their future. How amazing is that? They I can totally
understand why these witnesses are still questioning what happened to them after all these years. Just so profound.
Now, let's move to the next case, which I call I was so scared I started to cry.
This occurred to a young boy in the summer of 1988 in the Yank forest of Puerto Rico. This
is a rainforest, a very rural area, lots of nature. This witness was alone when
he had his encounter, but as we shall see, it really affected him profoundly.
Wanted to include it because it's also got a very interesting time aspect to it. This case comes from respected and
prolific researcher Jorge Martin and was originally published in the magazine
Evidencia Avi number 16 issue number 1997 and also in the spring 2003 issue
of Flying Saucer Review under the title Lond Aliens in the Yonke. The witness is
a young boy by the name of Jose de Diego Vasquez. He's from Rio Pedros, Puerto
Rico. But in the summer of 1988, he was taking a camping and survival course
with other boys in the Yunk rainforest. It was one evening at around 300 a.m. He
was walking alone on a path in the forest when he had a remarkable encounter. He did carry a watch with him
at that night. He was well aware of the time because he had to go on guard duty
for the camp shortly later. And as Jose says, I spotted a cluster of small
lights about 60 ft from where I was. They were moving about in a group at low
altitude and forming a ball or mass of light and seemed to be coming nearer. I
was scared and I started to cry. So great was my shock. And suddenly the ball of little lights changed course and
went behind a rock. And I swear to you, what I saw next was unbelievable.
There seemed to be a sort of glow coming up from behind the rock, and then outstepped a tall man, about 6'2 in or
so in height, very tall, with long, very white hair, fair skin, with a rosy pink
complexion, and dressed in a white sort of robe. I don't know how, but this man
made it impossible for me to move from where I was. He came right up to me
about 20 ft from me and something that was coming out of him lit up everything
around ever so brightly and I was so scared I started to cry. At this point
the man spoke to Jose in a voice that he described as quote clear and gentle. And
this man said don't cry. I'm not going to hurt you. I come in peace. The man
then bent down and began to sketch some symbols in the soil. And as he did this,
he told Jose, "You are never going to forget this." So Jose watched him as he
scratched these symbols in the soil. The first symbol was a simple circle. Jose
had a distinct impression that it represented planet Earth. The men then sketched a second symbol, a triangle
with the figure of a man inside it. and Jose had the impression that this triangle might signify their craft, that
the being inside it was one of the humanoids, meaning that they were extraterrestrial. The man then wrote a
third symbol which combined the first two, the circle with the triangle and the man inside it, which as Jose says,
gave me to understand that the Earth was going to encounter other intelligent beings from outer space and that they
are already here. And as Jose says, I stopped crying and controlled myself a
bit. And then I asked him what his name was, and he gazed at me fixedly and simply gestured to me with the open
hand. And I saw that on his hand he had another sort of symbol that I can't describe very well. The being then
promptly performed a half turn, moved behind the rock, and disappeared. The
lights that were still there vanished, and it became dark again. This conversation had lasted several minutes,
and Jose feared that he now might be late for camp guard duty. But when he looked at his watch, he got an
incredible shock. The watch still read 3:00 a.m., the exact time when he had arrived at this spot, and encountered
this being. His watch seemed to be working just fine, but it was as though no time had elapsed at all. As Jose
says, it was astounding. I couldn't believe it and I took my heels and fled,
leaving all my stuff on the ground there. And when I reached the road and asked one of the young K forest guards
who came by in a jeep making his rounds, he gave me the time and it was the same
as I had 300 a.m. Really can't blame that witness for having a very strong
fear reaction. I think when someone is confronted with the unknown like that,
the instant reaction is fear. certainly confusion and a a very strong emotional
response. That's not at all unusual. What's interesting to me is it was a wholly benevolent encounter. And this
figure presumably an ET, that's certainly what the impression of the witness was. It was a wholly benevolent
encounter. He just wanted to share information. To me, the most interesting aspect of that particular case is how
the witness said that no time passed. He knew exactly what time this encounter
started. He had a five 10-minute conversation and no time passed
whatsoever. We do see this in a number of UFO contact cases. It's as if people
are pulled right out of the Earth time stream, the three-dimensional time stream. I don't know, very hard to
explain, but it is again a detail that turns up fairly consistently.
Now, let's move to the next case. This one is an important one. I think it illustrates some very interesting
aspects of extraterrestrial contact. I call this one the blood of kings. This
occurred on January 10, 2010 in Toledo, Ohio. It is a single witness case, but
this gentleman held a very long interactive conversation with the ETs.
One ET actually, a gray. But what's so interesting to me is people will often
say, you know, if ETSs want to contact people, why don't they just come up and knock on the front door? Well, that's
pretty much exactly what happened in this case. It wasn't the front door, it was the back door. But so interesting
the details in this case. This witness learned a lot about why he was
contacted, who these ETs are, where they come from, why they're here, and so forth. The witness in this case is
anonymous. He decided to report the details of his encounter about 3 months after it occurred. I've given him the
pseudonym Bruce. His encounter is interesting because he was able to hold a very long conversation with a gray
extraterrestrial. It was about 2:15 a.m. on January 10, 2010. Bruce was lying on
the couch of his home in Toledo, Ohio, and suddenly he heard a metallic tapping noise on the back sliding glass door,
what he described as a soft tink tink tink. Now, the sound caught his
attention, and when he heard it again, he reached for his pistol and started to stand up. But before he could, he heard
a mental message telling him, "You won't need the weapon, and do not be
frightened at what you see." Though intrigued, he set down his pistol. His sliding glass door was covered by a
curtain, so he could not see what was causing the noise or who was sending this mental message, but he got up to
investigate and was shocked by what he encountered. As Bruce says, I go to the
curtain that is over the door and peaked out a little. What I saw was so scary to me, and I'm a big dude and don't scare
easily. It looked like a small human being with eyes that shone like the eyes
of an alligator when you shine a light on them. Now, it was dark out. There was no light out there at all. So, he could
not see this figure completely, but he could see that it was not human. At this point, something told him to open the
door, which he did. He then stepped back and allowed this little being to enter into his home. And it was a gray. As he
says, "Here comes in this almost humanlike being. I was in complete
frozen shock at what I was seeing. It was like a hairless human with not ears
but little holes on the side of his head and a very small nose like a newborn baby nose, a slit for a mouth, no lips,
no teeth, no tongue. And all I kept hearing in my head was, "Don't be afraid. Don't try to hurt me." And it
held out as its hand. So Bruce now saw that it was holding what looked almost like an electronic tablet or organizer.
So Bruce took the object and held it and immediately he started hearing this
being speaking in English and this being told him this is how we are going to
communicate. It told him that mind talk might kill his brain cells. At this
point, a lengthy conversation followed, beginning with Bruce asking the question, "What do you want with me?"
The being replied, "Scientific research." So, Bruce asked, "What kind
of research, and why me?" The being replied, "We have been monitoring you since you were born." Now, Bruce was
skeptical, and he said so in no uncertain terms. And the ET's response really surprised him. As Bruce said,
images popped into my mind of when I had sleep paralysis when I was like five or six. And I swore it was a dream. It
wasn't. And the time I thought I fell out of a tree, but it was them putting
me back on the ground a little rough. So he was now convinced that the ET was telling the truth and asked it, "Why are
you monitoring me?" And the ET replied, "You have the blood of kings in you."
That puzzled Bruce and he asked the gray, "What does that mean?" And the ET told him that the ETSs have played a
role in our creation, that humans are actually ET hybrids containing their DNA
along with primitive humans from long ago. It said that Bruce's DNA has a
purity to it and is from their elders and actually transmit a kind of signal
to them. Now, at this point, Bruce wondered if perhaps he was having some sort of schizophrenic psychotic
breakdown and was imagining this whole event. But the E told him, "You're
fine." But Bruce just went with it, he said, and he started to ask as many questions as he could. And the ET
replied that it will answer all the questions it can. So Bruce asked him, "Where are you from?" The ET replied,
"Not your solar system or your galaxy, but a galaxy a million lighty years away." It said it was quote, "From a
planet that resembled Earth with less gravity and more sun." Bruce asked, "How
do you get here from that far away?" And the gray replied that their vehicles are able to quote bend spacetime. But it
would not say how they did this and told him it was because Bruce was not intelligent enough to grasp their
technology. It told him not to be ashamed of this because his people were 1 billion years ahead of humans
technologically speaking. So Bruce asked him, "Okay, then why can't you talk?"
The being replied that they can talk, but that their voice box can't produce words like ours. and then demonstrated
by making quote sounds that resembled very squeaky brakes on a car. Now, as
Bruce says, it said his people communicate through the mind, which is accomplished through a chemical and
electrical reaction that we don't produce. It then said it had questions for me. The being asked Bruce if it
could touch his body, and Bruce asked, "Where do you want to touch me?" And it replied, "All over." As Bruce says, I
was hesitant, but agreed only if I could touch it. It also agreed. So, it started
to rub my leg, feeling the hair. It almost felt like massaging the muscles. It felt weird. Its hands and fingers
resembled that of a lizard, kind of. It felt my body all over. And then I got my
turn to touch it. Its skin was like rubber, almost shiny and smooth and
smooshy. Then we went back to Q&A and I said, "How old are you?" It said, "500
Earth years and his people live as long as 5,000 sometimes." And I asked, "Are
you a boy or a girl?" It said it was a male of its species. And I said, "Where
are your private parts?" It said that they were not like ours, but in a similar area as mine and has come out
only when it is going to mate with a female of his species. So Bruce then
asked, "Why do you resemble humans?" And the ET replied that all life evolves to
an upright creature where there is less exposure to the sun and have symmetrical bodies with two arms and legs and
sensory organs in case of the loss or failure of one of them. So this conversation continued, but this is all
that Bruce is willing to share at this time. He says that there is much more to what happened and that perhaps one day
he might write a book about it. Amazing. I do hope that this witness does choose
to write a book because as he said in his report, there's more information than he shared in his report. So, this
is so fascinating to me because a lot of people are having these kinds of
encounters and you can see that this one had a huge impact on his life. I can
only imagine. But how fascinating is it to learn that you've been followed for
your whole life by ETSs and they actually proved it to him by providing
information from his childhood. So, they were there watching over him. Really
astonishing. Now, let's move to the next case. This one is probably my favorite in this
compilation. I have to say I really did find the case called the Rainbow Man
super profound and really interesting. But this case, yeah, this one is my
favorite because it's so unusual and there's just so much information that
this witness learned. I call this one the harvester of memories. This occurred
on February 26, 2015 somewhere in South Dakota. His main encounter did actually.
He's had a lifetime of encounters as we'll see with Grays, but his one
encounter was so astonishing. I've never heard anything quite like it. The
gentleman in this case is anonymous. I call him Christopher. He reports having contact as early as age four with a gray
type ET. He reports that from this age onward, he was visited at least once or
twice a year, basically from as far back as he can remember. He says the visits
always occur in the same way, starting with sensing a presence in his room. And here he provides his firsthand
testimony. Now, the first experience he recalled, there were three little grays
and one was touching his body. But ever since then, there was only one and they never touched him. But as Christopher
says, I wake up in the middle of the night in a panic for no apparent reason.
Instantly fully awake, terrified, panicking, unable to move, unable to
speak, unable to breathe. At least at first, the only thing I can control are
my eyes and my breathing. And near me, maybe two or three feet away, is a small
gray. small, smooth, gray skin, big almond shaped jet black eyes, tiny
nostrils, a thin lipped mouth, usually hairless. They scare the daylights out
of me. So yeah, the first time was the only time he saw more than one, and after that it was always just one
figure, a small gray, which he called the gentleman. And at first, Christopher
passed off these visits as some kind of weird waking nightmare. But then he began to see images of grays on TV and
some of them looked exactly like the gray he was seeing and as he says it quote awakens a nameless dread in my
heart. So he then began to realize that these were real experiences especially when they continued and the older he got
the more he began to overcome his fear. These visits continued and it was always
with the same figure. As Christopher says, he doesn't do much. He observes
me. Passes a hand over me now and then, but he never touches me. He doesn't poke
or probe or anything. He simply observes. Occasionally, he will wave a
hand about in the air, almost as though touching a computer screen. My waking
state goes from petrification to irritation. There is no threat except for the fact that I am restricted. I
cannot speak, but at times when I think at him, he usually stops and stares,
his head to the side, and then makes another note. I'm not sure if he can understand my thoughts, but
something does indicate that he can read my moods and emotional level. I can
understand snippets of his thoughts and emotions. They aren't so much words as occasional images. So Christopher feels
that they are examining him out of curiosity, not for plans of world domination or anything like that. And he
believes part of the reason might be that he lives with several medical oddities. He was born with Asperger
syndrome. He was put on very heavy doses of prescription drugs at a very young age that ended up stunting his growth.
He also suffered from depression. At age 16, he was under five feet tall and he
decided to go cold turkey and take himself off of all of his prescription drugs. And the results of this were very
positive because over the next year, Christopher grew to a height of 6'2 in.
He put on 120 lbs of muscle. His asberers became not only manageable, but
as he says, quote, hardly noticeable. He also became very creative and artistic.
His intelligence quotient skyrocketed. As he says, "I was suddenly able to
draw, paint, work with ceramic. I could look at patterns and discern things that
nobody else could see was there. My intelligence level leapt from near genius to well above genius status. I
hardly ever get sick." And that is when the visits went from one or two a year
to three to five times a year. I'm convinced there is a connection between
the increase in visits and my unusual physiology that for some reason or
another they took an interest in keeping me alive for observation. So Christopher
says again that he never gets sick, heals at twice the rate of most people, has miraculously survived some serious
accidents, and speculates that perhaps his autism and unusual physiology is the
reason they're observing him. But as he says, quote, "I just wish they'd talk to
me instead of restraining me." On the other hand, he understands that as a large muscular individual, he might
represent a real physical danger to them. Still, as he says, quote, "I hope
one day that my curiosity to converse with them will overpower the fear I have
while they are in my presence, and maybe, just maybe, they'll let their guard down." And that is where the
matter stood. He continued to have encounters. He grew up, fell in love, had children. Then on the night of
February 26, 2015, Christopher had a visitation which changed everything. On that night, the
ETSs arrived and granted Christopher his wish. He had gone to bed and was dozing
when he suddenly felt the familiar presence of the ETSs. As usual, he became filled with fear. But to his
shock, he found that this time he was not paralyzed. He was able to move. So he pulled himself up in bed, huddled
against the wall, and he watched as his bedroom door slowly open. And in walked
a creature much different than the little gray gentleman he normally saw.
As Christopher says, he was tall, above 8 ft. He had to stoop to avoid hitting
my ceiling with his head. His body was thin, very thin. I couldn't see much of
him. He turned his body so he was shrouded in darkness. His face was comparable to the beings I've seen
before, but it was ancient beyond anything I can describe, withered and
hard, but with an emotion I can only describe as softness in the corner of his massive black eyes. He spoke to me,
although no words left his mouth, and I don't think any left mine either throughout the entire conversation. I'm
not even sure words encompass what I experienced. So using telepathy,
the being introduced himself as Pru and actually spelled it out. P R O U. The
words appeared in his mind and Pru said, I am pleased to finally meet you. And
I'll just quote Christopher directly. As Christopher says, I in a moment of
incredul extended my hand and he shook it with his. It felt strange, wooden in texture,
but warm and soft. It enveloped my entire hand, and he held it for a moment
before telling me that it brought him joy to experience friendship with someone he had studied closely for so
many years. He apologized for the many years of fright and assured me that
there was no reason to be afraid. He told me that there was a purpose behind their visits and the visits millions of
people have but are completely unaware of. He told me that they were not aware
I could remember. Not until they came across the memory of my last post about their visitation and told me it made me
an oddity in their eyes and unique in their experience that I could accurately remember a real visit. I asked what he
meant. In that moment, the ET instantly downloaded volumes of information directly into Christopher's mind. And in
mere moments, he understood the purpose of so-called quote alien abductions.
As Christopher says, they harvest memories. They observe our world, our
culture, and our society through our eyes. He also told me that for some reason, when confronted with a
visitation, the human mind will create memories that are not quite real. abduction stories to adjust for the
amount of fear they feel. The vast majority of people who are visited will never be aware of their visits. The
human mind will simply repress it. The ETSs themselves have no hand in making us forget. Our mind does not want to
remember, so it does not. My accurate memories of visits and contemplation of
them makes me very unique in their books. So, as the ET spoke to him,
Christopher said it felt as if his room and the environment around him disappeared. He saw strange fantastical
images filling his mind. As he says, flashes of color, scenes from distant
worlds I can't describe, skyscrapers, flashes of movement, bizarre creatures,
glass domes, and red and gold skies over green oceans. Fu told him that the human race is unique and that humanity is very
young but that in the past 2,000 years have technologically advanced very rapidly which has drawn the interest of
many other ETs in the galaxy who said that humanity and his race may actually be related that they had some hand in
our evolution and for that reason quote they feel a need to watch over us. They
do not directly intervene but are constantly watching us in silence. Brew
told Christopher that their visits are purely scientific. Told him that they implanted Christopher
and others with a kind of implant which is used to store information. that they
have a great interest in humans because quote humans as individuals are vastly
more creative than they are and that we think out of the box which they find very useful to advance their own
technology. They said our main problem is human aggression. They told him that
they inspire people telepathically planting ideas in their heads and that they had watched Christopher. They said
since he was a child as Christopher says, "He told me to tell of our meeting. He told me I'm a prized subject
and that they have influenced my life, my mind, and body in ways I cannot comprehend, and that they watch over me
and many others like me since we were little children. We are star children, and we are their friends in their eyes.
We have no need to fear them. He told me we would meet again soon and we would
have much to discuss. At the end of this conversation, Ru offered Christopher the
opportunity to come with him and said that they had the ability to extend his lifespan to almost a thousand years,
that he would see many other worlds. But Christopher declined. He thought of his family and decided that no, he did not
want to go with them, but that maybe when he was an old man, he would be ready. Bru told him that he understood
and very quickly he was just suddenly gone. But it was this encounter which prompted Christopher to report his
experiences. He made two posts on social media and also reported this to a UFO
organization. And as Christopher says, they are not so different from us. That's my story. I had a very long
discussion with a friend and maybe it's finally time to bring it forward. I have never been taken aboard a spaceship.
I've never been probed. I've never been poked and prodded or the top of my head taken off. And I've certainly never been
seduced by an alien queen to save their dying race. That's my story. I feel
compelled to share this story, no matter how insane it may seem, with everyone I
can. I think you'll agree that encounter is mind-boggling, shocking. He got so
much information from this ET who called himself Prow. How amazing is that? I
mean, just astonishing. Uh it's super interesting to me how he
feels that perhaps his condition of Asberers played a role in he being
contacted. We do seem to see a higher incidence of people who are what we
would call on the spectrum. Don't really like that term. Not a huge fan of labels, but we do see a this turning up
in quite a few contact cases. So maybe that's an important detail. Super
interesting to me how following his encounters, he really accelerated in
intelligence and creativity. It's interesting to me that the ET invited him to go live with them. We see that in
a number of cases. Of course, he did decline, but who knows? Maybe in the future he will, as an older man, go with
them. How amazing is that? And it's quite clear that his report contains
just the tip of the iceberg of what's happened to this gentleman. But such an
amazing case on so many levels. Can only imagine what having an encounter like that must be like. And I really have to
give huge thanks to him for coming forward because I've said it before, most people don't. The vast majority of
people who have an encounter don't come forward, especially if it involves a
humanoid and all this high strangess aspects. So there you go. Six amazing humanoid
encounters. Each of these people were profoundly affected by their encounter given all kinds of information. Really
all the answers to the many questions surrounding ET contact can be found in
cases like these. People are still arguing over you know who are these guys? What is it all mean? Well, I think
if you closely examine these cases, all the answers are there. So, thanks guys.
I really appreciate you guys watching. I hope you've learned something, found this entertaining as well. I think these
cases are so important. All humanity deserves to know the truth about what's going on. The truth cannot be covered up
forever. Sooner or later, this stupid cover up is going to collapse under the
weight of its own lies. And I personally cannot wait for that day to happen. It's
one of the reasons I do this research. another because I know a lot of you out there are having encounters just like
this. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. I truly appreciate it. And until
next time, keep asking those hard questions, keep searching for the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun.
And I will see you for the next episode. Bye for now.
