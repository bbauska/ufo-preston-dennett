THREE TRUE CASES OF DEMONIC POSSESSION

There are many types hauntings, and they can manifest in a myriad of ways. Some involve spirit visitation from deceased loved ones. Some involve earthbound spirits who haunt specific locations or people. There are also residual hauntings, more of a psychic echo than an actual entity. And then there are poltergeists and demonic spirits. These remain poorly understood and there are many theories to explain them. Some say these hauntings are caused by disturbed individuals who externalize psychokinetic activity. Some explain it as uncontrolled physical mediumship. Others believe they are evil human spirits. Others believe that they are non-human spirits whose goal is to cause fear and harm. Whatever the explanation, poltergeist/demonic hauntings follow a prominent pattern of manifestation. The first phase is “infestation.” Somehow a door is opened, and minor unexplained events begin to occur. The second phase is “oppression.” Paranormal events increase and often one individual is targeted. The third phase is “possession.” In this phase, the spirit launches an all-out attack on the individual and attempts to take them over mentally. This video presents three extensive cases of poltergeist/demonic hauntings that moved to the final stage of possession. Each of these cases involves multiple witnesses. Each displays a wide variety of manifestations and follows the familiar pattern of these kinds of hauntings. And each of them are harrowing and bone-chillingly scary.

WHEN POLTERGEISTS KNOCK. In 1977, thirteen-year-old Mitchell Sorensen (pseudonym) broke his leg and was diagnosed with a disease that made his bones fragile. He remained bedridden for the entire summer. It was then that strange knockings began in his mom’s home in Lake Balboa, California. The knockings slowly became stronger and more frequent. Unknown to Mitchell, his sister, Nancy was also hearing the strange knocks. Nancy realized that it was feeding off her fear, so she ignored them, but Mitchell became intrigued and curious. This is when the knockings became even stronger, and he also began to hear footsteps and sense a presence. Then, one evening the knockings came fast and furious and Mitchell heard footsteps in his room. He sensed a presence and suddenly, a dark force climbed onto his bed and pressed down on his body. Mitchell prayed for his life and after a while, the spirit lifted off him. Mitchell learned his lesson the hard way and from that point on, refused to interact with the dark spirit.

THE HAUNTED APARTMENTS. In 1989, girlfriends and co-workers Trudy and Kim (pseudonyms) moved together into an apartment in Van Nuys, California. It was surprisingly inexpensive for its location and condition. Almost immediately, they began to hear strange knocking noises on the walls. The haunting quickly escalated to feeling cold spots, smelling strange odors, seeing apparitions, objects moving by themselves and more. The witnesses learned that many other people in the building were also experiencing strange activity, and some had moved out because of it. Almost everyone who visited their apartment would experience the ghosts. Events reached a climax when the apparitions began to cause arguments and cause their bed to shake on a nearly nightly basis. Then, one night, the ghosts attacked. Trudy was praying for the ghosts to go away and suddenly found herself pinned to the bed as the dark spirit entered inside of her. She gasped for breath and after several moments of fighting, managed to break free. They decided to move out the next day, but little did they know, the spirit would follow them.

THE WILDWOOD DEMON. Whitney Wright grew up in an old house on Wildwood Avenue in San Carlos, California. From an early age, he noticed strange activity. He used to play with his imaginary friend but found that sometimes his “friend” was able to cause objects to move or events to happen. It wasn’t until he got older that he realized that his house was badly haunted. Doors were constantly opening and closing. Objects would move or disappear. Strange sounds occurred regularly, and a presence seemed to lurk the house at night. Foul odors appeared at random. When Whitney was a teenager, his friend Paul Delgado moved into the loft and he also experienced activity. It seemed to enjoy taunting the boys and causing arguments. Friends would come to visit and would soon become believers. Paul and Whitney soon learned they could track the ghost by the cold spot it created. They used a Ouija board to try to communicate, but this only made the haunting worse. Then Paul decided to experiment with stepping into the cold spots and calling the ghost to him. The ghost then moved to the final stage of possession, and Paul learned the hard way, you don’t mess around with dark spirits.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit  and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in  
the Paranormal. You can probably tell tonight's  episode is going to be a little bit different.  
I'm not going to be talking about UFOs or ETs, but  instead I'm going to be talking about ghosts. The  
evidence for ghosts is outstanding. These cases  of ghosts come from all over the world. They've  
been occurring for centuries. the there is no  doubt that ghosts exist. There are many different  
types of ghosts. There are such things as active  hauntings involving usually earthbound spirits who  
for some reason or another are still here visiting  the third dimension. Could be because they don't  
know they're dead or they've got some reason  holding them back. That's an active haunting  
of human goats. There are animal ghosts as well.  There's another type of haunting that is probably  
best known as a residual haunting and this is  not involving so much active ghosts but more  
like echoes or psychic impressions. There are also  spirit visitations which are technically ghosts  
but these are people who are not earthbound. So  you might be visited by a dear loved one who just  
comes to say hi. And then there's another category  of ghosts which is poltergeists or demonic  
hauntings. There's a lot of controversy about what  exactly causes these types of hauntings. Some say  
that they are inhuman spirits. Others say that  they are human spirits that have just followed  
a very dark demonic path. And some believe that  in fact what they really are is the person itself  
causing the haunting. that it's sort of a form  of uncontrolled mediumship. So today's episode is  
called three true cases of demonic possession.  I've investigated dozens of ghost cases and  
hauntings of all kinds. I have to tell you these  three cases are the most terrifying, harrowing,  
scary cases I've ever personally investigated. All  of these are multiple witness cases. They're very  
wellverified. I in fact I know uh the witnesses  for two of these cases quite well and have visited  
the actual locations. So these cases I think  will really provide a window into understanding  
what is going on with these type of hauntings.  One more thing I'd like to say is that these  
hauntings seem to follow a certain pattern of  manifestation. What will start out is infestation,  
little events such as footsteps or doors opening  and closing or objects moving. And then it ramps  
up to another stage which we call oppression. And  this is when it usually picks on one witness and  
really sort of attacks them. And it moves us to  the final stage of possession in which it really  
launches out a fullout attack on the witness.  So these three cases involve the end stage.  
These are all very active, extensive cases of  hauntings. So let's just get started. And the  
first case I'd like to talk about I call when  poltergeists a knock. So this case involves a  
whole family actually but mainly a brother and  sister who were the targets of this poltergeist  
or this demonic spirit. In particular it was the  son Mitchell I call him. That is a pseudonym.  
This took place over a period of years in Lake  Balboa California. I know this family quite well.  
They really did not want to be interviewed, but I  finally convinced them and they have quite a story  
to tell. As you'll see, the witnesses in this  case, I call them the Sorenson family of Lake  
Balboa, California. That is a pseudonym. They do  not want their identities removed. On the outside,  
they appeared to be the traditional American  family with a husband, wife, and three children.   
The husband worked full-time. The wife stayed home  and cared for the children, two boys and one girl.  
They lived in their house in the suburbs  and everything seemed perfect. However,   
on the inside, it was not perfect. Turns out the  husband was abusive and suffered from alcoholism.  
Miss Sorenson finally made a decision to divorce  him for the sake of her children. And at the same  
time, her oldest son got into drugs and following  numerous attempts to rehabilitate him, she was  
forced to kick him out of the house. So, this left  just Mrs. Sorenson and her two children, Mitchell  
and Nancy. So, this is how the haunting began.  One day in 1977, her youngest child, Mitchell,  
then 13 years old, broke his leg. It was to mark  the very beginning of a long and involved haunting  
that ended in the near possession of Mitchell.  And it all began with strange knocking sounds.  
Mitchell was ordered by his doctors to spend the  entire summer in bed because he was diagnosed with  
a condition that left his bones weak and delicate.  And needless to say, this was very frustrating  
for Mitchell. It was during this time that the  strange knocking noises began. As Mitchell says,  
the first incident that I remember was back  when I was 13 when I was recovering from  
having a broken leg. I was lying in my bed in the  middle of the night and I kept hearing. At first,  
it wasn't really a knocking. It sounded like  footsteps in the attic above the ceiling. And  
then all of a sudden, there was no noise. Then it  sounded like there were footsteps in the hallway.  
Then that noise went away. And then that was when  I heard the knocking for the first time. Didn't  
really sound like someone knocking on the door. It  sounded like someone was knocking on the ceiling.  
I don't know how to describe the noise. It wasn't  like pounding. It wasn't like someone was pounding  
on the door. It was more like someone was doing  a normal knock, like someone knocking their   
knuckles on the table. And there were only three  or four knocks and it went away. So Mitchell was  
not scared by the knocking sounds at this point,  just curious. He wondered what was causing it and  
why it was happening. But after several minutes,  it went away and he fell back asleep. In the days  
that followed, he continued to hear these knocking  noises. It was almost as if some kind of door had  
been opened. As Mitchell says, what was strange  about it was that most of the time the knocking  
occurred, it was during that summer and definitely  at night, usually from 9:00 onwards. It was never  
in the early evening. So Mitchell thankfully  recovered from his injuries and returned to  
normal life. However, every summer after that, the  strange knocking noises returned to his bedroom.  
As he says, "It happened almost every summer,  and as far as I know, no one else heard it.  
When I was asleep, it never woke me up. But when  I was awake, just lying there at night, I would  
hear a knocking. And sometimes I would hear the  knocking above my bedroom. Sometimes I heard it  
out in the living room or in the hallway. And one  summer in particular, I don't know if it was loud,  
but it just seemed like it went on. It seemed like  the knocking just kept going all night long. So,  
as the knocking became louder and more frequent,  Mitchell did start to get frightened. The knocking  
suddenly became more brazen, as if whoever  or whatever was doing it was trying to cause  
Mitchell to become afraid. So, he kept searching  for an explanation. as he says. It's funny because  
there were times that I thought maybe my sister or  Randy, his mother's boyfriend, or somebody was in  
the hallway. I'd open the doorway and no one else  would be up. There would be no one in the doorway  
and the sound would be gone. And I was sitting  there and I would feel like, "What? Am I going  
crazy? It must be the wind, right?" And I'd go  back to bed and sit there and it would start up  
again. And I'd be thinking, well, how can the  wind make knocking noises in the attic? Now,  
Mitchell didn't want anyone to think he was  insane, so he told nobody about what he was   
experiencing. Unknown to him, however, his  older sister, Nancy, had also begun having  
strange experiences. One evening, Nancy was in  her bedroom working on her college homework.  
Suddenly, the strange knocking noise which had  plagued Mitchell for years started with her.  
As she says, one of the first times I noticed it  was really subtle. There would be this creaking on  
the roof. Now, in my room, there was no attic.  It was just tongue and groove paneling and the  
roof was right on top of it. So, when there was  something creaking on the roof, of course, you   
always thought, "Okay, there's a cat on the roof.  The squirrels are playing. The wind's blowing."  
It didn't really mean much because in that room  there was no insulation. There was no attic. So,   
at first I didn't pay any attention. I'd hear  creaking on the roof and then after a while it  
would get heavier. A period of time goes by and  the creaking becomes more and more obvious and  
more pronounced. As time went by, this creaking  became very obvious and it was less and less  
like creaking and more intentional, like creek  creek creek bang bang bang bang. So, Nancy became  
increasingly puzzled by this noise, but did her  best to ignore it. She had begun to realize that  
it was probably something strange and unexplained,  and she didn't want to give it any attention. So,  
to keep herself from getting afraid, she simply  ignored it. And yet, the knocking continued to  
get worse. As she says, it was almost always late  at night when there was nobody awake in the house,  
and I'd be sitting in my room studying, and here  would come this knocking on the roof. And for a  
long time, I just kept saying, "Okay." I just  kept putting it off. I didn't want to accept  
the fact that there was something hanging around  bugging me. And then it must have realized that   
I wasn't accepting it. So, it started moving down  into the walls so that there could be no question  
that there was something there. I couldn't pass it  off as, "Oh, there's a squirrel running in my wall  
between my kitchen and the bedroom." So, Nancy  became convinced that their house was haunted. And  
yet, like her brother Mitchell, she told nobody.  She was sure that this ghost was trying to scare  
her, and she was determined not to give into its  games. She would stay up late at night doing her  
her homework and studying when this knocking would  return. And the more she ignored it, the louder,  
bolder, and more frequent it became. It became a  strange game of cat and mouse with her trying to  
ignore the ghost and it doing its best to get  her attention and frighten her. As Nancy says,  
sometimes it would knock right up at the wall  next to me. I decided that whatever it was was  
fine. It could be there and do whatever as long  as it didn't come in my room and actually bother  
me. I was being the typical human. I was afraid of  what I didn't know and couldn't actually see. So,  
I wasn't really that interested in finding out  what it was. I used to hear it every night for a  
while, but it occurred to me that it was feeding  off my fear. So I started ignoring it because  
as I became more scared, it became stronger and  louder and more disturbing. So at some point it  
wasn't wise for me to be afraid because the more  afraid I became, the louder and more rambunctious  
it became. So at one point I actually told it  that it should go and find what it was looking  
for somewhere else. I didn't want to feed its  negativity. I didn't want to feed it with fear.  
But it never went away. It just kept hanging  out. and I'd ignore it and it would hang out   
and I'd ignore it. So Nancy didn't know what else  to do. She was hoping that like a bully on the  
school playground by ignoring the ghost it would  eventually go away. And after she confronted it,  
the activity did seem to slow down slightly.  The knocking would still occur periodically,  
but it was less and less. And finally, she  decided to approach Mitchell and ask him,  
"Do you ever hear noises on the roof?" And he  said, "What? Like squirrels?" She said, "No,  
not squirrels." "Well, it might be the spirit of  a dead Indian or something." Mitchell replied,  
"Well, I don't know." Mitchell didn't know what  to say. As he later said, "She was scaring the  
hell out of me, to tell you the truth." So then,  one evening, Nancy was up late at night studying  
in her bedroom when the now familiar sound of  knocking began again in earnest. She was ignoring  
it, but Mitchell walked in and heard it too. And  he looked at her and said, "Do you hear that?" She  
said, "Yes." "Well, what is it?" Mitchell asked.  And Nancy said, "I don't know. It's been hanging  
out in here for almost a year now, and I don't  know what it is." So Mitchell told her, "Well,  
why don't you find out?" Nancy just laughed and  said, "Because I've never had enough gall. I  
don't have the courage to find out what it is  to tell you the truth." But Mitchell, however,  
was becoming intrigued. He was surprised and  kind of glad that his sister had also heard  
the knockings. At least he wasn't crazy. He didn't  tell her that he had been hearing this sound for  
years because he thought it was only him. But now  it was bothering his sister, too. And he really  
wondered what did it want. So Mitchell's reaction  was kind of the opposite of his sisters. He began  
to give the ghost more and more attention. And it  was around this time that he noticed the knocking  
sounds coming more and more from locations around  the house. And at times he felt like this ghost  
was purposefully trying to scare him or drive  him crazy. As Mitchell says, sometimes I heard  
it in the bathroom. That is when it was weird.  It was never someone knocking on the doors or  
walls. Was always the floor or the ceiling. And I  never caught anyone when all this was happening.  
I never caught anyone awake or anything. I was the  only one. That's why I thought I was maybe going a  
little bananas or imagining it. But it happened  so much that I thought, well, there's got to be  
something to it. I never really pursued it as  far as going into the attic or anything. Now,  
Mitchell's recent interest in the source of the  activity did seem to ignite the power of this  
poltergeist or whatever it was to a new level.  As Nancy says, "It used to happen only in my  
room until he became curious about it and started  saying,"Well, what is it? What could it be?" So,  
a couple of days later, he was taking a shower  and it started knocking on the shower wall. It  
scared him. So, by now, the activity was beginning  to build up to a frenzy. However, it still stayed  
discreet, appearing only to Mitchell and Nancy  and never to their mother or her boyfriend,  
both of whom knew nothing about the ghost. Around  this time, Nancy had a vivid and powerful dream  
about the rape and murder of a fellow classmate.  And two days later, she found out that this dream  
actually came true. Meanwhile, the knocking was  coming more and more often, and Mitchell became  
torn between terror and fascination. And he also  began to sense a presence outside his bedroom door  
late at night. As he says, "There have been  times when I felt someone was in the hallway,  
but when I opened the doorway, there never was."  And that was always in the middle of the night,  
too. So, the haunting was now reaching its peak.  Apparently, because Mitchell had given the ghost  
attention was now manifesting more strongly. And  it was a few weeks following the shower incident  
when Mitchell was physically attacked by the  ghost, which then actually tried to possess him.  
Mitchell reports that this incident remains the  single most terrifying event of his entire life.  
It was late at night and everyone else was asleep  in the house. Mitchell closed the door and crawled  
into bed. In the middle of the night, he was woken  up by the familiar knocking noises. This time,  
however, there was something else. He heard  footsteps. As Mitchell says, "Well, it was kind  
of weird. I heard footsteps up in the attic, like  someone was walking around up in the attic. It  
sounded like footsteps walked from the living room  to above my bedroom, and then they disappeared.  
There was no more walking. But someone was tapping  every 10 or 20 seconds. Then there would be one or  
two knocks." This is the part that I really don't  tell people about because it's kind of weird.  
People say you might have a vivid imagination.  It like progressed. Usually after that point it  
would die off for the night, but it didn't this  time. That's when it was really weird cuz all of  
the sudden I heard the tapping go from my bedroom  ceiling to the ceiling over the hallway. And then  
it stopped. And then I swear I heard someone  walking in my hallway. And I got up as fast as  
I could and I opened the door. There was no one  there. I was trying to rationalize it, right? So,  
I shut the door and that's when I swear I heard  someone knocking on the floor right in front of  
the door, like tapping on the carpet. And that's  when I just said, "I'm not going to answer the  
door this time. I'm going to stay in my bed." And  that's when I felt like someone was in the room.  
And at that point, I turned on the flashlight  that I had, a little mag light, and there was  
no one there. and I turned it off and laid back  down and I still felt like there was someone in  
the room. Then at that point, it felt like someone  literally stepped on my bed. I just closed my eyes  
and didn't move. And the pressure being felt on my  bed was pretty real. Not at first, but after that,  
I did feel like someone had not really stepped  on my legs. They had like laid themselves down  
across my legs and never reached up to my face  or anything, just on my legs. Now, by now,  
Mitchell was absolutely terrified. He waited to  see what would happen next, but it was clear to  
him this ghost was trying to move inside of him.  As he says, "I could move. It was easy to breathe  
and everything. It wasn't like they were pushing  on my chest or arms. It just felt like someone was  
standing on my bed. And then it felt like someone  lay down on my legs. I mean, I don't know if it  
was a person. When I had the feeling of someone  stepping on my bed, I raised up my head only and  
I could literally see the bed bending. Now, when  they laid down on my legs, I didn't lift my head  
up. I didn't move. I just closed my eyes and  listened. But before I did, I could plainly see  
that there was no one in front of me. And the  door was closed the whole time. no one opened  
and closed the door, I would have been able to  hear it." So Mitchell lay there and although  
he wasn't particularly religious, he began to  pray fervently and slowly the pressure lifted  
as Mitchell says. At that point, I heard one or  two knocks again above my bedroom in the attic,  
and I still had this feeling of weight on my legs.  Then slowly, the weight lifted off my legs again,  
and I could just feel it on the bed. And then that  feeling went away completely. And that was it for  
the night. And that was really the strongest  incident that I ever remember. Everything else  
was like walking or knocking. So after the ghost  finally left, Mitchell lay in his bed literally  
shaking with fear because he had no idea what had  just happened to him. As he says, "To tell you  
the truth, I was sweating. I was slightly sweating  and I didn't know what to think. I figured, well,  
I could say automatically it's a ghost. it's a  poltergeist or whatever, but I don't know. But I  
could swear that there was something in that room  that night and I would swear that it was real.  
And I never told anybody about it cuz nowadays you  could get easily branded as a crackpot, a crazy or  
whatever. So I basically kept it to myself. I only  told a few people. One of the few people Mitchell  
told was his sister. Nancy clearly remembers  the day he came and told her that she was right  
to ignore the ghost and that he should have left  it alone. Following this apparent nearpossession  
incident, the activity came to a near complete  halt. There were still a few scattered knockings  
here and there, but nothing near the intensity of  the weeks before. I can't say there was one other  
witness. My brother visited the house and he was  there when there was these weird knocking noises  
on the roof. I asked him about this. It's funny  because he's very skeptical of ghosts, but he  
said, "Yeah, there was something to it." And at  one point, Mitchell did tell me that he thought  
he saw a black apparition, but when I did a formal  interview with them, he had no memory of this. So,  
that's kind of odd as well. But that is when the  haunting stopped and it never came back again. I  
think you'll agree that's pretty darn scary. It's  interesting that this haunting started out so  
slowly and then ramped up over a period of years  and finally culminated in this absolute attack on  
the witness. What is going on here? It's very hard  to say because there is quite a bit of evidence  
that poltergeists poltergeist attacks might be  the witness themselves. A disturbed teenager  
is present in a number of these cases and that's  absolutely true in this case. The main witness,  
Mitchell, suffering from a bone disease, broke  his leg, was bedridden. Clearly, that is a lot of  
emotional stress for a person to go through. So,  it's entirely possible that he is responsible for  
this and he has perhaps some mediamistic talent  and this is uncontrolled physical mediumship.  
This is one of the theories. Or this could just be  an allout dark demonic spirit of some kind. This  
family did go through some abuse initially and  the older son did suffer from some drug addiction.  
This does turn up in some of these cases. Another  interesting aspect is that the sister had that  
really dark awful dream of a murder. That is very  interesting to me because this does turn up in a  
number of cases. So, there's some real interesting  patterns going on here. What's also very  
interesting is that the haunting ended immediately  after this possession attempt. So, that I think  
speaks volumes. Now, let's move to the next  case, which I call the haunted apartments. Again,  
these are witnesses I interviewed personally.  It involves two young ladies, co-workers, and  
friends who decided to move into a pretty cheap,  they thought, apartment building. Seemed perfect.  
Turned out this apartment was haunted and the  haunting began almost immediately and it was just  
small events at first as we'll see but soon ramped  up from the first stage infestation to oppression  
really kind of driving the witnesses crazy making  them think they were crazy and finally launched  
out an all-out attack on one of the witnesses.  These are not the only witnesses too. This was  
witnessed by many people that they invited over.  And as we'll see, there's quite a bit of evidence  
for this. I think you'll find an absolutely  interesting and harrowing series of events. In  
this case, two girlfriends in their early 20s  decided to rent an apartment together. Little  
did they know that they were about to experience  the most frightening four months of their lives.  
The ordeal began when Trudy Sheay, not her real  name, decided to move out of her parents' house  
and live on her own. She searched for an apartment  and found one in a good neighborhood of Vanise,  
California for only $600. This was a very  low price and just within her price range.  
To her delight, it was perfect. The building  was newly painted in bright, cheery colors,  
was located at 4760 Kester Avenue in Van Ny. The  grounds were well-maintained with flowers and nice  
green lawns. It was a cozy two-story building  contained only 25 units. The apartments were  
spacious and Trudy was delighted to find that  there was also a pool. It was exactly what she  
was looking for. The manager was very nice and  showed her the vacant unit. It was apartment  
15 and Trudy fell in love with it right away.  She had her own protected parking space. There  
was a locked gate. was very close to the theater  where she was rehearsing a play and the residents  
of the building were mostly older people, so she  figured that there wouldn't be too much noise. The  
apartment fulfilled every qualification she  was looking for. It seemed almost destined,  
too good to be true, so she didn't hesitate. She  paid the manager the first and last rent and a  
security deposit and moved in. She felt great to  be living on her own, working towards her career  
as an actor. About six months after she moved in,  Trudy had her first problems with the apartment.  
One of the tenants in the unit directly below  her was making too much noise, and it sounded  
to her like he was throwing a tennis ball  against the ceiling in the middle of the night,  
sometimes for hours, and Trudy was about to  complain to the manager. But then, to her delight,  
the man below her moved out, and finally she  thought she'd have a peaceful night's sleep.  
But she was wrong. Even though the apartment below  her was empty, the strange sounds continued. And  
when Trudy complained to the manager, she found  out that the man below her had moved out because   
he thought that she was the one who was making all  the noise. As Trudy says, things were happening,  
but I didn't connect it. Now I look back, I think,  oh my god, that's what it was. The guy had moved  
out below because he thought I was making a lot  of noise. There was a constant noise now that  
I connect it back to Ben. And I thought he was  throwing a tennis ball against the wall. Was going  
d constantly hitting the wall, the floor, and  something else. And it kept doing it a constant  
beat with a ball. But I never noticed it then.  It didn't connect because I didn't believe in  
ghosts. Around that time, Trudy started to notice  other strange things going on in the building.  
There was an unusual amount of arguing going  on. Somebody was always screaming and fighting.  
In fact, people were actually evicted from their  apartment because of these continuing tirades. She  
also noticed there was a lot of sick people and  there was a constant parade of ambulances going  
to and from the building. She learned that an old  lady had died in the apartment next to the one  
that was directly below hers and also that a young  infant had actually died in her apartment. And  
she was shocked to hear that so many deaths had  occurred in this building. And there were other   
strange things. Everybody in the building seemed  shy and reserved, almost scared. Everybody's door  
was always closed and locked, and nobody seemed  to want to make friends with their neighbors.  
Soon, Trudy found her bills adding up. And this is  when she decided to invite her friend Karen Tyler,  
that's a pseudonym, to share the apartment  with her. This was just before Christmas.  
And almost immediately after Karen moved in,  strange events began to occur. For example,  
they invited their friend Ivan to help set up  Karen's stereo. and he was fiddling with the  
wires when he suddenly stood up, looked over  towards the hallway, obviously frightened,  
Karen and Trudy asked him what was wrong, and  he explained that he was seeing a lemur in the  
hallway. These were little creatures that he said  he saw only when there were ghosts around. So  
now Karen and Trudy looked at each other, afraid,  but Ivan said simply, "Oh, don't worry about it."  
and he bent down and began fixing the stereo. But  both Trudy and Karen could tell that he was trying  
to set it up as fast as he could without looking  like he was rushing. And the minute he was done,  
I excused himself and left the apartment. Karen  was freaked out by this. She hadn't told anybody,  
but she had started to see strange things out  of the corner of her eye, dark shadows that   
would flit across the hallway, exactly where  Ivan said he saw these lemurike creatures. And  
Karen suspected that the apartment was haunted. As  she says, "The first time I really noticed it, we  
were talking in the bedroom and I thought I saw it  looked like a woman was looking around the corner,  
but neither of us said anything to each other. I  was kind of freaked out and I looked at her and  
she said, "What?" And we both saw it and then we  acknowledged it. It was just a little old lady.  
Both were frightened but decided to do their best  to ignore it. Shortly following this incident,  
Karen began to see more dark apparitions  flitting down the hallway. And now she   
wasn't seeing them out of the corner of her eye.  She could looked directly at them. As she says,  
I'd always see figures running by the bathroom.  The bathroom was here. Here's the corner. And  
the bedroom was here. And I'd always see the black  figures running past the bathroom, a black thing.  
I'd be watching TV and see them back over in the  hallway. It looked like stick figures running by,  
black stick figures. And Trudy, of course, also  began to see them. As she says, they were dark  
figures. You could actually see the shape of the  head. And the main part we saw of them was from  
the shoulders to the head because they'd always be  peeking. And if you saw them run, you'd see like  
a dark zoom. the bottom. You couldn't really see  it much when it would run, but every single night,  
the heads. The heads and the shoulders mainly  every night darting across. I mean, every time.  
I never saw the whole body so much. All you saw  was the darkest area, the head. It was dark,  
but it was fast. Really fast. It was never slow.  The only time it was slow was when it was peaking.  
So, by now, Trudy and Karen had admitted to  each other that their apartment was haunted,  
and they had developed a kind of routine following  each incident. Each time there was an apparition,  
they would look at each other and cry out, "Did  you see that?" The apparitions appeared so often  
that Trudy and Karen began to notice patterns.  If ever they started arguing, the figures would  
appear and dash bravely right up next to them,  or float up in the corner and stare down at them.  
Now, one day they spoke with the building manager  and asked about the history of the building. They  
learned from the manager that several strange  things had been discovered. For example,  
construction workers were working on the building  and had found several closets on the basement  
floor that had been permanently sealed. They  actually had to be torn out for remodeling. And  
when they were opened, the workers found several  old scrolls of parchment with writing on them and  
recognized them as Jewish muzas. On them were  prayers that were supposed to offer protection  
from evil spirits. Despite this, the haunting  continued to escalate, and the events became so  
absurd and unbelievable that the two young women  felt like they were walking around in shock half  
the time. reality was no longer following its  natural laws. It seemed like anything could  
happen. They began to feel like the haunting was  actually moving inside them, trying to possess   
them. As Trudy says, we felt really different.  We felt really, really different. Like everything  
was unreal, like we were in a higher state  of consciousness. Everything you looked at   
was just really, really weird. For example, Trudy  once went to pet a neighbor's dog who loved her.  
But when she did, the dog barked at her as  if she was a complete stranger. Another time,   
Karen went to visit a good friend, and her friend  wouldn't open the door for her at first because  
she didn't recognize Karen. They spoke to the lady  in the neighboring apartment who told them that  
she thought her unit was haunted because something  or someone was constantly tugging on her hair. And  
she said she also saw an apparition of an old man  in the mirror, but when she turned around, nobody  
was there. Karen and Trudy's unit itself was  becoming increasingly uncomfortable. They started  
to notice a strange musty odor filling the area.  There were also cold spots. One day they turned  
on the water faucet and instead of the water  streaming down, it sprayed out sideways as if  
someone was holding their hand against it. Another  time they invited Trudy's sister to stay with  
them. And in the middle of the night, her sister  woke up screaming, saying she saw an apparition.  
Another time, Trudy was taking an afternoon  nap alone in the bedroom. Her bed was a giant  
king-sized old-fashioned wooden bed. In fact, both  she and Karen shared the bed. It weighed well over  
100 pounds, and it took three of them to move it  in. Suddenly, Trudy woke up to the bed shaking.  
This had happened several times already, but she  assumed that it was the building shaking or a   
small earthquake, but this time it was obviously  only the bed because everything else in the room  
was still. One day she was washing her hair when  someone tapped her on her shoulder. She whirled  
around and no one was there. Then soon this bed  shaking started happening every night. As Trudy  
says, the bed was shaking. It wasn't even back and  forth. was like a really hard shake the minute we  
tried to go to sleep. Now, this is why we barely  got any sleep because of that. Anytime we try to  
go to sleep, the bed would go thud thud thud thud.  We were told to tell it to stop. Our friend said,  
"Tell it to stop." So, we'd say, "Get the f out  of here." We'd look because they would always be  
peeking. And then it would start. They'd peek and  start. Peek and start. And we'd say, "Get the f  
out of here." They'd stop and then they would  go again. Sometimes they would be in the room,  
but they would always be there when it happened.  So, not surprisingly, they both became exhausted.  
Tempers often flared, and they started to get  in violent arguing matches. And every time they  
argued, these apparitions would appear as if they  were enjoying it, feeding off of it. But this bed  
continued to shake. As Karen says, it shook like  an earthquake. The bed started shaking more often.  
Then the bed started shaking every night. Every  night. Big time. Sometimes they the ghosts would  
be in the room. Sometimes they wouldn't. I'd say,  "This is my space. This is my space. You can't be  
here. This is my space right now. Leave us  alone." But the ghosts continued to bother  
them. So the two girls finally decided that they  had to seek outside help. Their friend's advice  
of shouting at the ghosts only seemed to make it  worse. They tried reasoning with them, pleading,  
ordering, cursing, praying. Nothing seemed to  get rid of the ghosts. The bed continued to  
shake and the apparitions kept flitting around  the apartment. Objects would move by themselves.  
There were strange explosive sounds coming from  the kitchen area. So, they tried everything.  
One time they tried sprinkling salt and lighting  white candles and using sacred objects and these  
kinds of things, but nothing worked. Around this  time, Karen woke up one night from a horrifying  
but very realistic dream. She was in a room with  three other people when a man pulled out a gun  
and threatened to kill all of them. He waved the  gun around as if he was possessed and then began  
shooting. And in fact, he shot and killed everyone  in the room and then killed himself. In the dream,  
Karen ran out of the room screaming. She woke  up in a cold sweat, thankful that it was only  
a nightmare. However, that day on the news, Karen  saw her dream come to life. Turned out that just a  
few blocks away from their apartment, a man shot  and killed his family and then himself, exactly  
like she saw in her dream. So Karen and Trudy were  now at the end of their rope. Thankfully, their  
lease was about to run out. They began scanning  the newspapers for a different apartment. Was  
only two weeks before the lease ran out and things  were worse than ever. It looked like the haunting  
was reaching its peak. It was late at night. Both  Karen and Trudy were getting ready for bed. They  
crept into bed and turned out the lights. And then  Trudy suddenly started praying with an intensity  
she had never felt before. She prayed to God and  started saying the Lord's Prayer over and over  
because she had felt this haunting coming to a  peak and she was more afraid than she had ever   
been. Little did she know the ghost was about  to attempt to possess her. As Trudy says, I'm  
saying the Lord's Prayer over and over again. Our  Father who art in heaven over and over and over  
and I was just clenching and just lying there. I  was so afraid that night. I kept saying to Karen,  
I don't want it to happen tonight. I don't want  it to. I can't anymore. I can't deal with it  
anymore. I was so afraid. All of a sudden, the bed  started going really hard. But what happened? Oh,  
I'm getting scared now. The bed started shaking.  And Karen felt this also. The bed was shaking.  
And I felt a pressure. I could not breathe right  here in my chest. It's like I broke away. Karen  
said it looked like I had been pushed back, but  I couldn't breathe. I could not breathe. I opened  
my mouth and I can't even repeat the noise. And  it was hard and fast that it came out of me. The  
only way I can explain it is that a vacuum was  stuck in my mouth and sucked the air out of me  
so fast. Everything went. I mean, I couldn't  even get up. I was just crying. I said, "Oh my  
god." Crying and crying. Karen was looking at me  like she didn't even want to touch me. And I was  
trying to breathe. So Karen was lying right next  to Trudy on the night of this incident. She was  
becoming annoyed by Trudy's constant praying. Then  the bed started shaking violently. The apparitions  
appeared and Karen saw Trudy get pinned down by  this invisible force. As Karen says, "That night  
was really, really weird. We were looking for a  place and we were ready. There was a musty smell.  
It was yucky. You'd walk in there and you felt  like dark, cold. This is what happened. We go  
into the room. We turn out the light. The candle  is lit. Anyway, Trudy's really getting into it.  
And I'm thinking, "Oh, come on, Trudy. I'm kind  of irritated. I'm starting to go to sleep and  
she's praying big time. I could feel it." And  I'm next to her at this point. I remember she  
was lying like this, pressed down on the bed. She  was kind of stiff, kind of like it was holding her  
down. It was like she couldn't get up. She looked  like she was trying to get up, but she couldn't.  
Then she sat up really fast. She couldn't go  back to sleep. Now, Trudy says that not only  
was something holding her down and choking her,  it had actually moved inside her. As Trudy says,  
it went through me. The pressure here on my solar  plexus. I could not breathe. And the minute my  
mouth went opened, she the ghost was out. I was  hoping she was out. When it went through me, that  
hurt so bad. Not just breathing hurt, pain like  crushing. I couldn't go back to sleep. Anytime I  
closed my eyes, I could see a lady. She was very  little, very fragile. The outfit was like a vest  
from the 60s and colorful. This was a colored  thing I saw, not black and white. She was old,  
though. Her hair was greasy, stringy, with gray  and black in it. All I remember was the mouth.  
The mouth wasn't like a big grin, but it was nice  and sweet, and her head was tilted, very sweet,  
not threatening at all. It was almost to me  like an introduction because I was afraid and so  
curious of who these people are and why are they  bothering us. I don't want them to do it anymore.  
It was hurting us. That's the night I closed my  eyes and it went through me and I saw her and I  
told Karen, "I can't sleep. I'm seeing this lady.  And I explained what she looked like and I said,  
"She's not hurting me, but she's there. She  was there and she wouldn't go away." Finally,  
I did go to sleep and I never saw her again. That  was the last time. But now I know exactly what she  
looks like. Exactly. So that night was the last  straw. When morning came, they discussed moving  
out into a hotel for the remainder of their  lease. The decision wasn't difficult. They   
decided to move out that day and not spend one  more night in this cursed apartment. They packed  
up in a frenzy of activity, throwing everything  they owned half-hazardly into boxes and bags. By  
the end of the afternoon, they were finished.  All the hard work had left them famished. So,   
they chose to treat themselves to a dinner at the  nearby Cafe 50s. This is a quaint little fast food  
joint on Vanise Boulevard, just a few miles from  their apartment. And as they sat down in the cafe,  
they felt the thrill of finally being free of this  ghost. They sat together in a little booth. And it  
was during the dinner rush. The restaurant was  crowded. They were waiting for their food when   
they both felt the table give a sudden lurch. At  first, neither of them thought anything of it,  
but seconds later, it started to really shake.  They argued about it, and then it started shaking   
violently. So together they jumped up and went  to the cashier to pay their bill because they  
knew the ghost had followed them. And this is  when the ghost struck again. And this time the  
waiter became a witness as Trudy says. So I'm  paying the bill and Karen's standing back by  
the gumball machine. The gumball machine's just  sitting there next to a jukebox and I'm paying the  
bill and Karen screams, "Trudy." I turn around and  look and this gumball machine is going ch really  
fast right next to her shaking. And we grabbed  the waiter who did not believe us really. And  
he looked and he turned whiter than white. The  gumball machine was just going. It was shaking  
like the table was and he freaked out. He freaked  out. The three of us saw that shaking. It was  
right next to her. I was crying. So, the two young  ladies paid their bill and exited the restaurant  
in a hurry. They drove away and went straight to  a hotel. And to their intense relief, they spent  
their first peaceful night in a long time. They  returned to the apartment early the next morning,  
got all their boxes and stuff, and moved out.  They found another apartment nearby. It was a  
little more expensive, but hopefully it wouldn't  be haunted. As they set up their new place,   
it was understood that there would be no talk of  ghosts. This subject was taboo. They had decided  
that everything would be normal no matter what.  And in the first few weeks, both Trudy and Karen  
did notice small unexplained events, an object  moving, a strange noise once a light turned on by  
itself. But these were few and far between, and  they just completely ignored them. And to their  
delight, the haunting seemed to be over. Just in  case, they decided to move again. They found a  
better apartment and completed the move. And after  the second move, the paranormal events came to a  
complete stop. The ghosts had finally left them  alone. Now, I spoke with the apartment manager,  
and she confirmed the haunting, particularly in  unit 15. As the apartment manager says, the woman  
who lives there now still experiences it. We've  had a lot here. One we had was in a different  
apartment than the two girls rented. It was across  the building actually, but on the second floor and  
the girl there said that there was a moth. There  was weird things that it was doing. Another one,  
the girl who moved in there now, she said she felt  somebody was watching her from the bedroom door,  
but she hasn't really said that much because  everyone's probably going to think she's crazy if   
she keeps talking about it. And I personally had  one where I walked into my living room. I walked  
in there and I felt somebody watching me and I ran  back into my bedroom because it frightened me so  
much. But I've never had that feeling since.  That's the only time I've ever had that. What  
happened with apartment 15 was an older man and an  older woman were living there and the man died and  
the woman became friendly with the man downstairs  who was a young man. They were friends, I guess,  
just friends, but they became very friendly. But  the old man never rested. And that's who they say  
the ghost is because sometimes he feels angry. The  girl who's in there now says it's like he's angry.  
Now, one weird event happened later. This was  about one evening around 9:00 p.m. in midocctober  
1989 that Trudy and Karen were in their new  apartment and they both heard this very loud  
buzzing noise which got so loud that they both  became convinced a plane was about to crash into  
their building. As Trudy says, it was like a buzz.  A really loud energy level. Kept getting louder,  
louder, and louder. Hurting the ears loud. As  Karen says, we heard this noise. It felt like it  
was right over our apartment, like it was coming  down. I remember looking at her and thinking,  
"This is it." So, they both thought perhaps  this poltergeist was back. And when this sound  
persisted, they ran outside to see what it was  and were absolutely shocked at what they saw.  
As Trudy says, we saw weird lights. The lights  were low and they kind of curved up like a U.  
It was big, really big. It was long. It was huge.  It stayed in one spot. Trudy cried out, "Look how  
big it is. It's a UFO." Very quickly, this craft  started to dart away, but as Karen says, it seemed  
like it was staying there forever. There were a  lot of lights, but then it moved really quickly.  
It went up. It says, "Trudy, we saw it hover. It  acknowledged that we saw it. Then it darted like  
a dart. It went zoom zoom and it was gone." Now,  several months later, after all of this went down,  
I checked in on Trudy and Karen. They were no  longer living together. It seemed that the ghost  
had come back, but it was now centering around  Karen. She said she heard footsteps and felt  
strange cold spots. Then one day she was alone  in her new apartment when she says a large black  
apparition appeared, attacked her, and pinned her  to the ground for a period of about an hour. She  
refused to give a formal interview, didn't want  to talk about it at all, and wouldn't give any   
other details. Trudy thankfully has experienced  no further activity. So those are the haunted  
apartments. How interesting is that? This is a  classic case I think of a demonic haunting. The  
fact that these witnesses describe a very dark  apparition. That's the sort of pattern we see  
with these demonic hauntings and other events.  I mean, one really interesting manifestation  
I found fascinating was the witness describing  how the water came out of the faucet sideways.  
I've interviewed people who describe that same  exact ghostly manifestation, which is so rare. I  
don't even know that I've even read about it. So,  there's these weird patterns. There was another  
remarkable pattern with one of the witnesses  describing a dream of murder taking place  
just two blocks away from where they lived. It's  almost as if these demonic spirits are implanting  
or invading their dreams. and they certainly felt  like they were being invaded. So, this shows all  
the classic signs of a full on full-blown demonic  haunting case. I've been there again many times.  
You can go there now. It looks like a shiny new  building. And in fact, it's quite expensive to   
live there. I'm guessing the haunting is over  by now. One final really interesting aspect was  
how the witnesses described having a UFO sighting  following them moving out and basically overcoming  
this spiritual battle. I've always wondered about  this connection here. I suspect that the ETSs were  
coming down and sort of celebrating or remarking  upon their successful spiritual battle and  
overcoming evil. I don't know. I'm speculating.  But it's an interesting pattern that I have seen  
in a few cases. So now let's move to the last and  final one. And this one I think is the scariest of  
all. This involves at least three witnesses that  I interviewed, but really dozens of witnesses. I  
call this one the Wildwood demon. This is another  case that took place over a period of years. And  
this took place in San Carlos, California.  I do think the main witness, Whitney Wright,  
probably does have some mediamistic talent. Uh,  it certainly sounds like it given his description  
of the events, but this is a classic case of a  demonic haunting as we'll see because it starts  
with that same pattern of manifestations. many  different types of phenomena occurring with cold  
spots and bowel odors and apparitions and so  forth and it just really I think has a lot to  
say about what exactly is going on with these  types of hauntings. One of the most extreme  
haunting cases I've ever investigated occurred  in a small house in the suburb of San Carlos,  
California. The haunting began in 1975 when the  Wright family moved into their home on Wildwood  
Avenue. Although the house was about 70 years old,  it was in remarkably good condition. At the time,  
the Wright family consisted only of two members,  Mrs. Wright and her infant son, Whitney. When they  
first moved into the house, everything appeared  to be normal. However, as Whitney grew up, things  
began to change. and he reports from a very early  age that he experienced many strange events. So  
he doesn't remember exactly when they started. The  earliest events that he can remember seemed always  
to be connected to his imaginary friend. Like  many young children, Whitney says he had a pretend  
playmate. And he reports that he spent many hours  with his pretend friend. And he always knew that  
he was just pretending. Yet things happened that  sometimes made him wonder about this because  
doors would open and close by themselves, lights  would turn on and off, objects would move, and  
as he grew up, he had long stopped pretending to  have an imaginary friend. And yet, these strange  
things continued to happen. Around age 11, Whitney  finally decided that yes, his house was haunted.  
As his mom was a single parent and Whitney was an  only child, he was often left alone in the house,  
particularly after school. And it was then that  these things mostly occurred. As Whitney says,  
"Ever since I was a little kid, things would  happen. Like I'd go around the house and shut   
all the doors and my mom would come home from work  and the doors would be open. Little things like  
that." When I was a little kid, I would get weird  vibes. I'd feel like somebody was watching me. So,  
I'd grab a knife out of the cabinet, run through  the whole house looking in all the closets and   
stuff because I'd think someone like the boogeyman  was there. And every time there would be nothing  
there. I would always hear sounds and stuff. I  don't really remember. It was a long time ago,  
but I'd hear whispers, like wisps, not  really saying anything in particular,   
but I'd hear things. So, I always had the  thought in my head that there must be a ghost  
or something in here. So, Whitney had no dramatic  face-toface encounters when he was a child, but  
these little events constantly pestered him. And  he searched for an explanation. And thinking back,  
the first events did seem to involve his imaginary  friend. And there were a few occasions he recalls  
that he would ask his imaginary friend to do  something and it would happen. As Whitney says,  
it was weird. My mom would come and yell at me and  I would wish, damn, I just wish she would slip and  
fall. And she would slip and fall. One time I was  pissed because she had grounded me, done all this  
stuff to me. I had some crayons I was drawing  and she broke my crayons. Well, she was putting  
up this thing on our back porch. We have this  overhang. It had like fiberglass material on it.  
And I'm thinking, damn, I just wish it would slice  her head off or something. And sure enough, she  
sliced her hand really bad. It was weird. Stuff  that I would think that I would want to happen in  
my mind would happen. And that's how I started to  realize something was up. So, as Whitney grew up,  
these little paranormal events occurred on a  regular basis and left him convinced that he  
had a ghost in the house. Now, when Whitney grew  up to be a teenager, his friend Paul Delgado  
moved into a room in the garage. And was shortly  after Paul moved in that the ghost really began to  
haunt the house in earnest. Where before the ghost  appeared infrequently, now things began to happen  
much more often and different types of phenomenon  began to manifest. The first manifestation was  
objects moving by themselves or disappearing.  And in fact, this became the new preferred  
manifestation. The ghost would constantly take  Whitney's or Paul's possessions. And as usual,  
the two boys would blame each other and a vicious  argument would ensue. It was only later that they  
realized the ghost was the one who was causing the  problem. As Whitney says, it started getting bad  
when my friend Paul moved in. He was living in the  loft and it would play little things against us,  
try to get us in fights, would do little things  like I'd be missing something out of my room.  
It had this tendency. I would lose stuff like my  guitar tuner. One day I was tuning my guitar and  
the phone rang. So I went and I was on the phone  for 10 20 minutes, came back and my guitar tuner  
was gone. I was really pissed yelling at Paul and  I couldn't find it. Now later he found this guitar  
tuner in the weirdest place inside the loft inside  boxes that were filled with china dishes that had  
actually been taped up for years. So this is  almost impossible. So, this ghost had finally  
hit upon a method to really get their attention,  to really get under their skin. And after this  
incident, numerous valuable personal objects began  to disappear or be mysteriously misplaced. As  
Whitney says, I've had money disappear constantly.  Things are moving in my room, even to this day.  
But it's weird. If you let it get to you, that's  when it gets stronger. If you don't pay any  
attention to it and don't give it energy, nothing  really happens. One of Whitney and Paul's favorite  
pastimes was to get together and play guitar.  Actually formed a small band and played every   
chance they could get. And interestingly, the  ghosts seemed to hate this. During these jamming  
sessions, strong bursts of paranormal activity  would manifest in various ways. As Whitney says,  
it hated when Paul and I had a band. When we  practiced here and played music, it would throw a   
temper tantrum. The house would be totally clean.  My mom kept the house clean. And then we'd play,  
we'd come out and the toaster and can opener  have these covers. They'd be pulled off. And  
the cupboards in the kitchen would be open. Stuff  would be on the floor. Not necessarily every time  
where the cupboards opened, but one time I can  remember that it would throw a temper tantrum when  
we played. Now, Paul confirms this. As Paul says,  there were definitely unexplained presences that  
we were experiencing there. I really didn't know  how to explain it. I was very doubtful of things,  
but there were just some things that happened that  were very unexplainable. So many different things  
went on for a period of time. I can definitely  say I have a belief in lost objects. things that  
you know you've set somewhere, you come back  and they're not there and you just know they   
were there. That kind of thing. It definitely  seemed to mess with our heads. It seemed like  
sometimes the thing in certain rooms will get us  very angry and we'd end up being very agitated and  
other times we would just be scared. Other times  it definitely messed with your head. But you are  
just mainly in a state of denial saying this isn't  happening. I'm just tripping out. Another way the  
ghost manifested was through unexplained sounds.  Most old houses produce odd creaking sounds as  
they settle. But the right households seemed  unusually creaky. As Whitney says, you know,  
old houses when they settle, they crack. We had  just had an earthquake up here and my house was  
creaking pretty bad from it. But you would hear it  tweak the house. It sounded like, you know how you  
ring out a cloth? It would ring out the house. The  whole house would just go creek. You would hear it  
and it would go through the whole house. It sort  of shuddered. It sounded like it was tweaked,   
like it was creaking through the whole house. So  now that Paul knew about the ghost, he understood  
all the previous unexplained events. But now he  had another problem. The ghost was still here.  
And Paul didn't like the idea of living with  the ghost. The whole idea really scared him.  
And he experienced many frightening incidents. As  he says, I used to sleep up in the attic there.  
There's this little step ladder that goes up into  the attic where I would sleep. It was above the   
garage and all the doors were closed. And I  remember I once experienced what sounded like  
somebody. I thought Whitney was messing with me  and that he was walking up the stairs because I  
could distinctly hear the creaking boards. It was  someone walking up the stairs. By the time it got  
up to where I thought it was, I jumped up and  looked around and there was nobody there. That  
was quite bizarre. They were all pretty weird.  But probably the scariest one was when the thing  
sounded like it was coming up into my room. So  that incident left Paul shaking with fear cuz  
there was no more denying that this house was  haunted. He told Whitney what happened. Paul  
suggested that they get a Ouija board and try to  contact the ghost. At this point, he didn't quite  
realize that giving the ghost attention only made  it more powerful, and he just wanted to get more  
information that would help them understand why  this ghost was bothering them so much. He was also  
very curious as to who the ghost was. Now, Whitney  said that a child by the name of Joey drowned in  
the pool next door, and he speculated that perhaps  that's who the ghost was. So, they nicknamed the  
ghost Joey. But Whitney, of course, later became  convinced that this ghost was not Joey at all,  
but something much darker. So, they began to  use this Ouija board. And as Whitney says,  
I said, "Wow, maybe we can communicate with  it." We got this Ouija board with a pendulum.  
It had a wire going down to a weight. You swing  it and it swings over whatever it wants to say.  
The pendulum on the Ouija board. We would swing  it back and forth and it would stop in an area.  
It was fighting gravity to stop there. It stopped,  paused a couple of seconds, then it started  
swinging again. We asked another question, would  pause and stop swinging for a couple of seconds,  
then it would start swinging again. My girlfriend  and Paul's girlfriend were all playing around with  
it, asking all these stupid questions. Actually,  I think it was telling them what they wanted to  
hear. They were having a good time doing it. And I  said, "F that [ __ ] take it away. Don't even mess  
with that anymore. She had her elbow on the table  holding the pendulum and I got pissed. I yelled at  
her. I said, "Don't even f with that stuff anymore  or I'm going to throw you out." And sure enough,  
right in the middle of the wire, it broke. It  didn't jerk her hand around. It just went tink  
and the weight hit the table. We were all,  "Whoa!" We looked at it and it just broke  
right in the middle. So, this Ouija board incident  convinced Whitney that this ghost was definitely  
not the little boy Joey who had died next door,  that this ghost was probably lying and probably  
evil. He said it was active enough that many  of his friends also witnessed the activity,  
says Whitney. All my friends come over and they  don't believe it and then it totally makes itself  
apparent to them. That happened a hundred times  to all different friends of mine. They'd get  
doubt in their mind and then it would happen. One  of Whitney's friends, Dan Diaz, confirms this. As  
Dan says, "I've known Whitney since we were in the  fourth grade, and he told me there was a ghost in  
his house. I didn't really believe him at first.  He told me that it was a friend of his, and as  
he got older, the ghost always kind of stayed  its age. And I guess when they were friends,   
they were the same age. Materialized one time,  and it was a kid." But I guess the thing would  
mess with him, play tricks on him, do things to  him, and he always knew. And his mother knew,  
too. He never told me anyone died there, but I  think they knew who he was, and he could follow  
it from the coldness. They usually knew where it  was. I guess it materialized one time at the foot  
of the bed when he was younger. He said it was a  little boy, and he said it was in ragged clothes.  
He would always talk about it and I never knew if  I should believe him or not, but as we got older,   
he was always talking about it. And one time we  were in the attic part of his house. It's this  
garage loft area. And we were hanging out up there  and we heard it. It came and it hit the roof right  
where we were. It knew right where we were. Just  bam, really loud. It wasn't a rock. And there were  
footsteps, too, but there was no one there. Was  damn loud. It scared us all. Whitney also noticed  
again that the ghost always seem to manifest in  ways that would cause a fight. As Whitney says,  
the little games he plays are evil. Like when  I had my friend that you interviewed, Paul,  
we will get into a minor little fight and then  it would be a bloody brawl. Would really agitate  
your feelings like hiding little things, playing  little games like that, which I think Paul did it,  
or whatever. The cat would be chased around the  house. He'd get in one corner and then all of a  
sudden he would freak out and run to another side  or part of the house. Another thing they both   
noticed was foul odors and cold spots, says Paul.  There was a time when certain rooms in Whitney's  
house, it definitely wasn't the smell of garbage.  It was like a dead smell. We smelled that before.  
I remember that there were definitely horrible  odors sometimes. And they weren't just normal   
odors like dirty socks or food or something.  and we would get cold flashes and you would know  
it was there. There was no denying it. We both  experienced the same thing. We were standing near  
the bottom of the stairs there once, Whitney and  I. We were just standing there and we felt this   
coldness, this being or whatever just nudge us  and walk right past us. It was really strange. So,  
the two of them became kind of fascinated by their  ability to perceive the location of the ghost by  
its cold spots. They decided to try an experiment.  Once they found out where the cold spot was,  
they would step into the cold spot and try  to feel the energy. And to their surprise,  
it almost felt like the presence would move inside  them. It was then that the haunting began to reach  
its final stage of possession. As Whitney says, we  had been going on for a couple of weeks where you  
would get these rushes like a head rush. Vertigo  would start in your back and tingle and then it  
would go up to your head and you would just feel  all your hair stand up. It's like when you're in   
a warm room and you get a breeze of cool air.  You just feel tingly for a second. You're like,  
"Whoa." Like when you're in a hot house  and you run outside and it's cold and you   
get that feeling kind of like that. We had been  playing with these rushes from time to time and  
this one night we had gone in one room and then  we would wait there and you would feel it. You  
could honestly feel a presence fill up the room.  It was really weird. You would get the rush and  
instantly the room would feel cold. And we were  going from room to room in the whole house doing   
this because we were playing with it. The one  time we ran into the kitchen and Paul said, "Wait,  
check this out." Because it was following us from  room to room. We could totally feel it. I mean,  
two of us were there. It was real. We just played  with it like that time to time. And it seemed like  
my room the most. I guess you could say possessed  or whatever because that's where the extreme  
things happened. Now, Whitney already knew that  they shouldn't be playing around with the ghost,  
but it was a lesson apparently he had to learn  the hard way. As Whitney says, "I've always  
believed in God and been towards trying to be a  good person, so I really didn't want to pay too  
much attention to it because it kind of scared  me and it was definitely evil to say the least.  
I didn't want to play with it. It's like something  taboo. You don't really want to mess around with   
it, which you shouldn't actually. So, on this  one evening where they had allowed the ghost to  
actually move inside them, the activity came to a  complete climax. Both of them had just gotten into  
bed when a piercingly loud, screeching, grinding  sound reverberated through the house. Both of  
them heard it. As Whitney says, we're just getting  ready to go to sleep when all of a sudden we heard  
this weird sound. You know how an old-fashioned  skateboard or skates have those steel wheels? It  
sounded like that going down the street, but it  was actually so loud and heavy it sounded like a  
car. This was really weird. It sounded like a car  driving down the street with no tires. So weird.  
We were just getting ready to go to sleep and this  sound came into our house. Now, Paul confirms this  
as Paul says, "The most bizarre sound we heard was  what sounded like an old metal skateboard with old  
metal wheels screeching down the road. Sounded  like it was going over the roof. We went out,  
we both heard it. He was clear on the other end  of the house and I was in the attic and we both  
heard it and couldn't figure it out. We looked  in the sky, we looked around, we couldn't see it  
anywhere, but we heard this sound going down the  street. It was weird. was bizarre. So after that,  
Paul insisted on sleeping in Whitney's room. So  they set up a bed roll on the floor and prepared  
to go to sleep. However, as Whitney lay down in  his bed and Paul lay down on the floor, they both  
felt the presence of the ghost very strongly.  And little did they know, the ghost was about  
to launch a fullout attack on the unsuspecting  witnesses. It all began when Paul again started  
playing with this ghost. Whitney tried to stop  him, but it was too late. This occurred in 1983,  
but both of them remember it vividly. As Whitney  says, "I set up a bed so we could sleep on the  
ground. We were talking about it freaked out.  Nothing really happened. It was totally mellow.  
Then we decided to go to sleep." So he's laying  there thinking, "Man, that was trippy." I mean,  
you get that small little bit of tinkling, like  a rush when it comes into the room. And he said,  
"Did you feel that? Did you feel that?" I said,  'Yeah, that was trippy. And then it would go  
away. We kept on getting them in series of three  or four at a time. Then it would be quiet for a  
couple of minutes. Then they would start getting  really big. I mean, heavy duty. And Paul was all,  
"Wow, that's intense. Wow." And it started  getting really bad. And he started saying, "Wow,  
this isn't bad. Maybe it doesn't want to hurt  me." And I said, "Shut up, Paul. Just go to sleep.  
Forget about all that stuff." And he started  to say, "No, no, I like it. It feels good." He  
kept on saying that. And I said, "No, come on." I  was laying on my bed. He was laying on the floor.  
This incident is probably the heaviest thing that  ever happened. I'll never forget it. He was all,  
"No, no. I like it. I like it. This feels good.  Come on. Come on. I want more. I want more."  
He kept saying that. It was weird. He kept on  saying, "Wow, did you feel that?" And I was  
saying, "Paul, come on." And he was right in the  middle of this big rush. And to say the least, my  
hair stuck straight out. I heard him. He was all,  "Wow, this is great." And then all of a sudden,  
it sounded like something grabbed his throat. Like  it made him start talking really squeaky. It was  
really weird. It was like someone was squeezing  his throat. and he kept on talking. He didn't go,  
"Ah!" He didn't start screaming like someone  was grabbing him. If something grabbed his neck,  
he'd be freaking out, especially if he couldn't  see it. He didn't. It sounded like something  
grabbed his vocal cords and stretched them. So,  he talked really squeaky. You really couldn't  
make out what he was saying. It was really weird.  He wasn't stressed or anything, but he just kept  
on mumbling. My personal opinion, it sounded  like some other crazy language or something.  
He kept on mumbling and I'm laying there stupid  thinking, "What? I don't understand this." I  
didn't really believe it at first. I was all,  "What the f is up? What is happening?" At this  
point, Whitney realized what was happening.  Paul had become possessed by this ghost. So,  
he tried to jump up and get to him. And this is  when the ghost attacked him, too. As Whitney says,  
"It was weird. I tried to sit up in my bed and it  felt like gravity was pulling me down. It slammed  
me back in my bed. I sat up for one second and it  slammed me back in my bed. It was like I had five  
600 lb sitting on my chest, but it wasn't really  holding me at one point. When something holds you  
down, you can feel it on your shoulders or your  arms or whatever. It was like through my whole   
body. I couldn't even lift a toe. I was pinned  there. I could not effing move. I was struggling,  
screaming because I heard Paul. He was starting to  get squeakier and squeakier. It was really weird.  
It took what seemed like hours, but it was only a  matter of minutes. I rolled off the bed. I hit the  
ground and I crawled. Was still playing with me,  but it was like it lost its grip or something. I  
went right over to Paul and I touched him. I still  have scars, but I touched him. I had a crucifix on  
my neck. My neighbors used to be Jehovah Witnesses  and they gave it to me a long time ago. So, I put  
it to his chest. At the same time, he grabbed  my back. I still have scars from it. I mean,  
it was a sharp pain. He grabbed me. I mean, it  grabbed me. It just kept on mumbling, mumbling in  
that squeaky voice. And as I held it there, I was  thinking in my head, "God, please help me." And  
his squeakiness went back to crying. and he was  just sitting there crying from him grabbing me. He  
started hugging me, crying, just totally shaking.  He was really tripped out to say the least. I was  
quite freaked out. I told him straight out I  was going to kick him out of the house if he   
ever plays like that again. And he honestly didn't  realize what he was doing. My personal experiences  
from what I've talked to people with ghosts was  trying to possess him in a way, get inside his  
body. To say the least, it almost did. It was  quite scary. I still remember it vividly. That  
was probably the heaviest thing that happened. I  mean, you would have have to have been there to   
experience it. It scared the crap out of me. Now,  Paul himself has only sketchy memories of this  
incident. Although he does remember sensing the  ghost and feeling it enter his body, his memory  
ends there. As Paul says, I remember we felt the  presence in the room and we felt this energy and  
I let it come into me. And as I was doing so,  I seemed to be overwhelmed by it. I remember  
being pinned to the floor, but I wasn't thinking  or anything. I just remember I couldn't get up,  
and it was very strange. Hall's next memory was  of Whitney pulling him back into consciousness and  
being very upset and afraid. Needless to say, both  of them vowed to never play with the ghost again.  
And it was a few months following this possession  incident when he experienced another event that   
was equally terrifying because for the first  time the ghost manifested in full color. It  
happened at the worst possible time. Whitney  had just broken up with his girlfriend. He was   
confused and upset. He was lying in bed thinking  dark thoughts. And evidently the ghost could not  
resist this opportunity. As Whitney says,  "This is really weird. I had just broken up.  
I had this girlfriend I was really in love with  and she totally screwed me over. This was when   
Paul was living at my house. Got to a point he was  scared to even come home for a while. He says to  
this day he won't live in the house. But to say  the least, I was really upset. We hadn't had any  
disturbances in the last couple of months and  then all of a sudden I felt really weak. I was  
hurt. I felt bad. And I came home. We have this  light in the front room that's always lit up. It  
lights up the front room and you can see through  the drapes, but it was like the drapes were pulled   
back with a face looking at me. It's like you  could see it, but when you really start focusing  
on it and really looking at it, you can't see it  anymore. It was weird. So, I got in my bed. I laid  
down and I started trying to go to sleep. It was  like I dozed off for a while and then I got cold  
chills. I was kind of dozing off and I got a cold  chill. I woke up and it stunk. My roomre. I almost  
puked. I mean, I gagged when I woke up. You get a  bunch of meat and you throw it in the garbage can  
for about a half of a year. It smelled gross. It  smelled like rotten flesh. That's what I think. It  
was crude. My room stunk. Was cold. It was weird.  I sat up in my bed. I had this chair my grandma  
gave me a long time ago. It was in the corner  of my room and I saw the silhouette of a person,  
a small young person sitting there. You could tell  the head moved. It looked at me and it was weird.  
I woke up because it was stinking. It stunk.  I looked and I saw that shortly following the  
appearance of this apparition, the activity began  to slow down and taper off. Every now and then,  
a few odd events still occurred, but nowhere near  the intensity of before. There were just a few odd  
creeks, a few missing objects, but that's about  it. Now, Whitney was at first very reluctant to  
even give an interview about his experiences  because he felt that this would be giving the   
ghost attention. And it turns out he was right  because immediately after I interviewed him, the  
ghost came back. In a follow-up interview, he told  me what happened. As Whitney says, "Last time you  
interviewed me, I guess the presence in my house  wasn't too happy because he took a checkbook. I  
was just getting ready to go downtown and do some  shopping. He took my checkbook for about a week  
and decided to give it back to me about a week  later after we had searched the entire house,  
every inch of the house. He gave it back to me. He  left it right in the middle of the kitchen, right  
underneath the kitchen table, and we had checked  everywhere in every part of the house. So, that  
was pretty scary. I mean, I can't imagine what it  must be like to see your friend just be pressed  
to the ground, speaking a foreign language, jump  up and try to help them, and you get slammed back  
onto the mattress. That has got to be terrifying.  There's that pattern again. If you pay attention  
to this ghost, if you give it energy, it will  feed off your fear and just become stronger. So,  
for those folks who are having this kind of  activity, there's a lesson there. Don't give  
attention to the ghost. Don't be afraid. It feeds  off your fear. This is well known among paranormal  
researchers. So, a truly fascinating case. In  fact, if you want to learn more about these cases,  
I did write about them in my book, California  Ghosts: True Cases of Haunting in the Golden  
State. It's one of many, many cases of hauntings  that I've investigated. But yeah, these three  
are the most extreme. And I think they reveal  that there are some dark things out there. Uh,  
demonic spirits. Hard to say for sure. Again,  there's different theories as to what causes  
these kinds of events, but there you go. I'm  just relaying the facts as we know them. I hope  
you found this interesting and perhaps learned a  few things about ghosts and spirits. Again, happy  
Halloween. I hope you've enjoyed this episode.  Until next time, keep asking those hard questions.  
Keep searching for the truth. Most important  of all, keep having fun. And don't worry,  
I will be talking about UFOs and humanoids on the  next episode. Had to talk about ghosts every once  
in a while. After all, this show is called UFOs  and the Paranormal. Happy Halloween. Be well.
