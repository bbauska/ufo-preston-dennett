ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME: TEN HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Aug 2, 2024

Summary:
Aug 2, 2024
Humanoid encounters are far more numerous than you might think. Cases come from across the world 
and have been occurring for a very long time. It can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime! These 
cases make it clear that we still have much to learn about the Universe we live in. This video 
presents ten cases of people who have had face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials of many 
different kinds.

THE LITTLE MAN IN THE UFO. One night in December 1951, the Coley family of Red Springs, NC were 
amazed to see a UFO hovering near their home. More amazing, they could see a humanoid figure 
inside. This was just the beginning. On August 6, 1952, James J. Allen saw a craft land next to 
his home in nearby Lumberton. A short humanoid figure emerged, quickly returned into the craft 
which took off. In 1975 a huge wave of sightings occurred, and was observed by dozens of police 
officers. Along with it came several more humanoid encounters.

THE LITTLE BLACK ALIENS. On the afternoon of October 9, 1957, Marie Yeager sat in her home in 
Mariaville, NY when a UFO landed in the forest near her home. Moments later, it departed. But the 
next day it was back, and this time she saw little black humanoids come out of it. She fled her 
home in fear. But soon she discovered that other people in her area had also seen UFOs.

FIVE SAUCERS AND SIX ALIENS. On the morning of November 18, 1957, tobacco farmers Pedro Zilli and 
Joao Ermani of Maracaja, Brazil were amazed to see two silver craft landed in the fields next to 
their farm. As they approached, they saw six tall humanoids dressed in skintight jumpsuits running 
inside the craft, which promptly took off. Unknown to them, many other people in the area were also 
seeing UFOs.

SOMETHING WEIRD OVER DENMARK. On November 21, 1957, grocer Hans Haugaard Hansen was driving near 
Gesten, Denmark when he noticed a strange craft hovering over a nearby turnip field. He stopped his 
car and was amazed to see two human-looking figures inside a transparent cockpit. The craft quickly 
took off. He called the police who investigated and learned that other people in the area were also 
seeing UFOs and humanoids. In fact, these events took place during a huge wave across the entire 
country which caused concern at the highest levels of government.

I CAN STILL FEAL THE FEAR. One afternoon in June of 1963, an anonymous woman and her 7-year-old son 
were vacationing on the small island of Storholmen in Sweden. As they stood by the shore, a strange 
feeling overcame her, and looking out, she saw a silver craft approach. Inside and on top of it, 
she saw two perfect-looking muscular men dressed in tight jumpsuits. The craft approached so close 
that she and her son hid in fear. Then it sped away so fast it disappeared from view in seconds. 

ALIEN STREET SWEEPER. On the evening of November 18, 1973, four ladies were driving outside Montreal, 
Canada, when a UFO began to pace their car. After several miles of being followed, they drove through 
a weird “pink cloud.” Moments later, they saw a short humanoid figure standing in the middle of the 
road. Unknown to them, many people in the area were seeing UFOs on the same night.

“DON’T YOU WANT TO COME ONBOARD?” It was a Summer morning in 1974 as “Mrs. N.” took a walk near her 
home in Oslo, Norway. Suddenly beautiful music began to play, a glowing craft approached and began 
to follow her. Inside she saw three figures in dark jumpsuits. One of them stood up, smiled, and 
gestured to her. She had the impression it was inviting her to come onboard. Filled with fear, Mrs. 
N ran, and the craft followed.

LANDING AT A FRENCH FARM. At 6:30 pm on December 9, 1977, Chanta L of Fonforet, France was amazed 
to see a glowing craft land outside her farmhouse. Moments later, a 7-foot-tall being floated out 
of the craft and explored around before returning inside it. Later the craft took off and landed 
again, leaving strange traces on the ground. At this time, many people in the area were reporting 
UFOs.

I HEARD A PIERCING SCREAM. One night in March 1978, rancher Monte Brinsmead saw a classic flying 
saucer with colored lights outside his farm near Lake Sorell, Tasmania. He grabbed his rifle to 
shoot at it when it took off. He learned that many of his neighbors had been seeing UFOs. Soon 
numerous events of high strangeness occurred, including an encounter with an apparent humanoid.

THE ALIEN AT THE BEACH. At 9am on February 3, 1994, six witnesses at the beach in Ancona, Passetto, 
Italy saw a weird humanoid figure wandering among the rock formation known as “Pope’s Chair” along 
the beach. Suddenly it flew up into the air and off into the distance.

These ten cases show that a UFO and humanoid encounter can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. 
While there are those who remain skeptical, there are too many cases to deny, dismiss or debunk. 
The accounts speak for themselves. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal I 
call today's episode anyone anywhere anytime 10 humanoid encounters you can probably guess why I 
gave this episode that name it's because a UFO encounter can occur to anyone anywhere at any time 
when you least expect it these cases are occurring to all kinds of people from all over the world 
and in fact today I've chosen cases from a wide variety of locations including Canada a couple from 
the United States one from Brazil one from Tasmania but also Denmark, France, Italy, Sweden, and 
Norway. So, yeah, many different locations and of course these cases occur way back into history. 
The earliest ones I'm covering today are in the 1950's. But all the way up through the 2000's these 
do involve a wide variety of humanoids. As we often see, a lot of evidence people who don't believe in
UFOs or human encounters have simply not done their homework. Because these cases, in just this 
episode, today, include not only multiple eyewitness testimony but of course all the kinds of 
evidence we normally see; radar returns, photographic evidence, landing traces, electromagnetic 
disturbances, physiological effects, animal reactions, and more. But it's really I think the huge 
number of cases that provides the best
evidence that something really profound is going on here. And I've said it before but it's worth saying again each case
adds to our knowledge of what's going on here. It's why I do this research so let's just get started a lot of cases to
cover and some are really compelling for first one I want to talk about I call
the little man in the UFO this case occurred in December of 1951 in Red
Springs but it turns out it's not just one event I set out to investigate one
event but I found another that was definitely connected to it then another that was connected to that it ended up
being a whole series of events in North Carolina Red Springs and Lumberton North
Carolina so wow I think you'll find this one really amazing I know I did it was
around dusk one evening in December of 1951 when Sam Coy's 12-year-old son
James called out to his father and 17-year-old sister Mabel to alert them of a flying saer hovering right outside
their home in Red Springs North Carolina James actually saw it come
diving down and then it suddenly stopped right above the ground everyone came out and could see
that this object was shaped like two saucers placed rim to rim with a cabin-like bulge in the center and
glowing Port holes around the Dome the outer rim seemed to be rotating and this
object hovered about 900 ft away and only 6 feet off the ground was very
quiet emitting only a soft purring noise but most amazing was that inside the
craft the KY family could see a humanoid figure they watched it for almost 10
minutes when suddenly the took off quote like a bolt of lightning and faster than
the naked eye could follow now the father Sam was a 49-year-old mechanic he did not want to make an official report
of this but his daughter convinced him to call the police which he did so the
Red Springs police chief contacted civil defense director Eldred Zed
Jones and they came to the CO's residence and interviewed all three
Witnesses separately the police chief had been skeptical but following this interview
reportedly he said that he was convinced that something very unusual had happened
because all of the eyewitness testimonies matched but that's not the whole story what wasn't in most of the
reports in this case but was later revealed by Jane wear the daughter of the state civil defense director Eldred
Zed Jones she reported in a presentation from muan that she herself accompanied
her father and the police chief to the K's home and per Jane they arrived
shortly after this encounter occurred and where this saucer had hovered about
6 ft above the ground they did find a burn mark in the soil and ve
vegetation but it was more than this because to the shock of everyone present
the UFO actually returned and was observed by everyone there Eldred Jones
Jane herself Sam Coley his wife Viola and their two children and of course the
police chief and another officer now the object was described by Jane to be about
30 ft in diameter glowing a red orange color which became dull and bright as it
moved close to the farmhouse in fact at its closest approach the witnesses could
all smell an ozone like odor similar to burned electric wiring they also heard a
droning sound which get this made their heads and internal organs seem to
vibrate and this went on for quite some time about 5 or 10 minutes before this
craft left now there was more to this Jane's presentation for muon was called ce2
Close Encounters of the second kind psychological and physiological
aftermath because they suffered some physical symptoms from this Jane said
that in addition to the smells and vibrating feelings following this encounter she suffered from some
prominent physiological effects that included burns on her skin scars
headaches nausea and eye irritation now I thought that this was
the end of that case but it really wasn't cuz perhaps related to this incident was another which occurred not
too far far away about 20 mil away in Lumberton North Carolina and 8 months
later on August 6th 1952 James J Allen age 51 reported his
encounter with a UFO and humanoid he said it was around 900 p.m. and James
was standing outside his home in West Lumberton when this roundish oval-shaped
object dropped from the sky very nearly hit the high tension wires struck his
chimney he said then landed roughly on the ground according to James and I
quote it was 6t high and 8 ft long and was lighted on the inside was orange in
color like it was in the air the lights went out when I walked toward it and got within 10 ft of it so as he approached
this object James was amazed to see a little humanoid less than three feet
tall standing next to it as James says there appeared to be a small man about
30 in high standing beside the object when I asked if it was hurt it went away
with a whiff then it made a loud noise like air whistling and was
gone now according to one of the reports on this case this was basically a human
looking figure not so sure about that I couldn't verify it at any rate James was
so shocked by this encounter he went to his back door he says and sat down for 2
hours just waiting to see if this object would return which it didn't but he
later reported it to local newspapers who wrote up an article and confirmed that there was in fact some Landing
traces the grass where James said this object had landed was depressed as if
some heavy object had landed there now there was some skepticism about his
report but in corroboration of it not only is the ky's case but many cases
that happened afterwards in Lumberton apparently there's something about Lumberton North Carolina that is very
attractive to UFOs because over the years UFOs and occupants continued to be
regularly cited there was only 21 days after James Allen's citing that five
independent Witnesses reported seeing a UFO one of them was Gabriel dur Ro who
was walking home home when he saw a glowing blue white object which he said
was about 30 ft wide and 10 ft thick was hovering above a field about 30 ft away
he could see blue yellow and red Sparks coming up from beneath it as this object
start started to spin and Rise vertically upwards and eventually
disappeared into the sky now later an inspection of the spot did reveal a
depression in the soil on October 31st 1957 four men contacted
the local newspaper to report their sighting of a strange quote big ball of fire frightened they fled the scene the
report was not taken seriously not sure why these were four black men this was 1957 but the report
was discounted until shortly later when another report came in Barbara Jean
Stokes was driving near her home home again in Lumberton when she saw what appeared to be the body of a man lying
beside the road about a block from the Elizabeth Town Highway naturally this
shocked her she turned her car around raced back home and got her husband Paul
and their neighbors the Sinclair this was around 8:00 p.m. when they returned
to the scene and saw that this body was now gone but looking up they all saw a
huge red red glowing object hovering right above the road was described as
being about 200 ft long hovering 200 ft in the air and was stationary at first
but suddenly Rose straight up very quickly out of sight flaring up at which
point the car stalled so there appears to be a connection here once this object
was gone the car could be restarted and they quickly fled the scene but strange events in Lumberton
suddenly escalated some years later beginning with another strange humanoid
report was on December 29 1974 when multiple reports came in
around 10 p.m. that evening of a UFO with bright colored lights then one
family of four called the police saying that they had actually seen a strange
humanoid figure wearing a quote silver and black suit with a sort of helmet
this was the Forest Acres area near Forest Road and Barker 10mile Road
family said that this figure jumped into the bushes and
disappeared four police were sent to investigate but they didn't find
anything now around this time multiple residents living on mlead Street said
that they were hearing strange wailing noises others said that they heard strange voices in fact one resident said
and and I quote the voices were loud and distinct but I could not understand
their vocabulary it certainly wasn't in the English language I can tell you that
so very strange one lady said that she was in the den of her home on mlead street when she saw a figure dash out of
their yard and into the woods frightened she made her husband go out to investigate with a flashlight now he
didn't see the figure but he did find something he was really shocked and surprised to see a set of fence posts
pulled right out of the ground apparently by Brute Force they did not know who did that or why and this was
just the beginning of what would become an incredibly intense wave of sightings in this area it was just a few months
later really from April 3rd to April 9th 1975 that more than 60 60 Witnesses
mostly police officers reported seeing silent v-shaped objects the these
objects would hover swoop over their Cruisers move at sharp angles with quick
accelerations right over Lumberton and the surrounding areas and in fact there
were at least 57 reported events including some apparent Landings
needless to say this activity did generate National headlines really electrified
researchers researchers like E Lee Spiegel Jenny
zedman Ted Phillips and others including Jay Allen heinik investigated these many
reports eventually compiling them in a 59-page booklet called the Lumberton
report which was published by the center for UFO studies and according to the
main investigator E Lee Spiegel and I quote the consistent thing we find in
UFO reports includes Lumberton is that none of these objects make any kind of
sound we're talking about reliable law enforcement officials who say that these
things have gone directly over their cars 50 to 100 ft away when you don't
hear something that does incredible new Maneuvers makes 90° turns starts and
stops and accelerates at hundreds of miles per hour then you have to start considering that maybe we are dealing
with something that is not made on earth now Spiegel did his investigations he contacted the Air Force and the
FAA privately some of these officers told him that they couldn't explain the activity but publicly he says they
refused to comment for the most part and again these Witnesses include sheriffs
deputies Town police and state troopers in a six count area with most of the
sightings being very close up the only thing unusual that they could find about
the Lumberton area was the presence of a huge number of swamps and lakes and water towers and of course high tension
lines but those are everywhere there was one report involving an apparent Landing
this was during April of 1975 this comes from Ray Strickland and
his family who were driving along Philadelphia Road when they saw a formation of pink red lights which came
down into a potato field and seemed to vanish they did drawings of it they went
to the police who returned with them to the site and they found something very
unusual six circular patches of Ash on the ground that apparently wasn't there
before now le spegel says that this was just one of many similar reports in fact
as he was in Lumberton investigating these sightings he himself saw a strange
glowing object about 500 ft away he watched it for about two or 3 minutes
and he said and I quote would stop and start up again just hanging over the trees and then it began to pulsate and
at one particular moment it just stopped dead in its tracks he says at one point it flared up
so bright it was impossible to look at then suddenly turned blood red pulsated
and moved slowly away nearby several deputies and a police cruiser watched it
from a different location and this was just one of four sightings
he had total with so many sightings from so many reliable Witnesses the FAA was
finally forced to issue a statement and they said that they thought the objects were a delta-shaped plane with its
Landing lights on it said that there were training flights going on in the area and named the aircraft needless to
say the many officers who were witnesses to this vehemently disagreed in fact
officer John Hayes said he saw an object only 200 ft from the ground he said it
was 40 to 50 ft long it had two rows of 12 red lights along each side and a
spotlight in front he provided a drawing of what he saw which is clearly not a
plane the only reason he became a witness was because he was alerted by another policeman Deputy Marshall
Gilbert who saw this object heading towards where Hayes was police chief Gary Moore joined the
dozens of other officers who became Witnesses when he said one of these objects hovered over his patrol car and
Shone a beam of light down on it that was quote so bright I could hardly look at it now he actually got out of his
Cruiser and shown his flashlight at this object he blinked it and this object
blinked back he then looked at it through binoculars as it started to move away got back into his Cruiser and
chased it for 2 miles reaching speeds of almost 90 mph he does not believe the FAA or Air
Force explanations and says quote a jet can't park in the air he also provided a
drawing of what he saw there were quite a few officers who were willing to go on record with their names including RT
Higgins John mccassen Phil Stanton Neil McCormick pH Atkinson Jim driver I mean
many of them officer Bullock officer mcferson a lot of them one lady she was
driving at the junction of the 211 and I 95 highways when she says a craft chased
her down the 211 Highway she called the newspapers hysterical with fear another
witness a good witness was night security guard James E Floyd he said
that four out of seven nights this was again through April 3rd through 9th he saw these boomerang-shaped objects with
red and orange lights pass over the alamac mill that he was guarding
producing quote a light of such intensity that the automatic nightlights
went off of course as you might expect during this period the police station phones were ringing off the hook with
people in the area reporting encounters now the researchers to these
many incidents did get some cooperation from the Air Force finally when Bill
kleene an intelligence officer from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base arrived on the scene and admitted that these
reports were unusual when asked flat out if he thought the reports were of an
object M manufactured on this planet he replied no I do
not now there is a 15 minute long audio clip which includes Police Chief William
holstead patrolman John Hayes Bill Stanton and others talking about their
encounters it's a bit long and hard to hear too long to play here so I'm just
going to play a few minute segment of it but you can hear the whole unedited
version at the end of this episode as well as the Lumberton report written by
Jenny zedman and others detailing this series of events well when I first got a
glimpse of it was all from the distance I tried to get up closer to it when I first stopped the car and got out it
stood there before I get anywhere 5 to 10 second it didn't stay there long when
I that or just didn't move away it I seen it move away but it go in a
horizontal position what do you think it was I mean
was it could it have been an aircraft I don't like right I think is off the quiet H yeah how uh how big do you think
the thing was could you estimate well it was I don't believe it was quite as big as uh small
a now Phil Stanton said that he didn't think it was much bigger than his
car it looked a little bigger than it was a bright white an Amber
white this was appeared to be a Treet top level I observe it through the
nor D look well I would describe it I was traveling south and I was looking more like a
northeastly easterly direction and this bright white the amber light was illuminate hole it was Illuminating the
perimeter if there it was so brilliant if there was any running lights along the perimeter of it it was drowning them
out or they would blow the tree level this was seen about a minute and a half before I saw it and rolling by a rolling
city policeman which is 15 to 20 mi south of us and a minute half after I
saw it by an officer St Paul's 10 m North and he they were describing
exactly the same thing I saw I was headed south on 1166 which is near my
home in fact I was on my way to have lunch or supper when we spotted the craft to the
east Northeast I immediately gave Pursuit and soon over took the craft it
hovered along beside the roadway approximately 100 yd away as it was dark
I stepped outside of the vehicle and with my right arm took the right switch and switch the lights on and off and
sure enough I got a response from the front headlight or Spotlight from the
vehicle the vehicle having two spotlights on it one on the front one on the back it then proceeded to move in a
southwesterly direction and I turned around to give Pursuit again was soon lost sight of The Craft as it
disappeared behind I must say this that I did get within
100 yd of The Craft and was able to get it to Signal back to me with its front
headlight being 100 yd away there's no possibility that it could have been
mistaken for a Delta aircraft or any other man-made aircraft for that matter I have never seen anything like it
before well we were on Philadelphia Road headed north and just driving along at
an ordinary speed and I was driving the car and I was the first one to see it I
observed on what I thought to be five big lights I would say or guess to be
about 100 ft in the air and the moment I focused my eyes on them it appeared that
they were maybe going at a speed of about 50 m hour and then they speed it up like 100 m hour and I went to telling
my wife and two daughters to look see those lights and they did and
momentarily I take my eyes back off of them to make a turn a rightand turn and
my wife and daughter they kept their eyes focused on it and they observed it uh going it was in a downward position
like headed towards the ground and we followed it and it went down behind a
house and I would say a 16 to 24 in streak behind them behind each one of
them uh I couldn't determine if they're was smoke but it didn't appear to be
smoke behind each one of them it didn't even look like a flame it was just a beautiful streak behind each one of them
and we had church at 6:30 and it was 5:15 at that time and I thought the time we could get home and get dressed U it
would be time for church but obviously we run into something we ant didn't anticipate running into uh these people
they don't tell you if uh come up with any kind of little story got to be
something that excit you whenever you see something like this I really don't think
they at any time the trees even bothered them I think they were high up enough
and I think that they were in a position to totally missed the trees in the house that we talked about got a big light in
the center of it and that light is as bright as
anything that I have ever seen bright as uh I don't I've never seen a light body
I've seen search lights for on airports but I've never seen a lightbody that thing that light shine it was shining
right down towards the ground okay and what what color were all these lights different color lights it was blue
lights it was red lights there all different color lights on it didn't have no sound whatsoever now how did you
determine that like did you go outside at all no I was sitting here I was sitting into the building you Haven seen
anything thing come up there did but did you go out at all just to see if you can get like a supposed to look at it oh
yeah I went outside there and uh I couldn't hear a thing on we got a a system right there if there's any noise
at all I here'll pick it up really it'll pick it up automobile cross
that bridge down anybody walks by down back of that plant down that'll pick it up well youan you've got microphones set
up down there that that pick this up and then transfer the sound back here right I just walk right out here on this
driveway yeah and I saw the thing where was it coming from he came from back in here towards the see this 95 Highway
back in here and someone told me they travel that 95 or something uhhuh they come across here raise a canal right
down here the back of this plant down here yeah and that's saw where he was at he just was above the Treet top I
thought he was touching the Treet top yeah no sound so whatsoever no he came
right up down here and just looked like it just come up there and stopped there for a little bit over over what over the building over here well right corner by
the corner this building where you see in front that front office he was just beond hit over there he looked like he
just came up there and stopped and set up for a little bit and then he started moveing up and over and I never seen
nothing a move like that move a airplane can't come up there and do that or helicopter NE one without me hearing it
now tell me what happened when uh when the lights went out when was that it happened two nights that thing came back
close two different nights on Tuesday night and Wednesday night at both times it came from the same direction and it
went back CL the same direction that it came from all of these lights you on the front of the plant there that's the
lights that went out we have 1 2 3 4 five five lights and now where are these
lights powered from like are they powered by the same source that these lights over here same lights as those are down here were these they still
burning they were still on they were still on those was out and yet they're all powered by the same that's right the
light see down as long as that thing was hovered down there and when it left it
the lights came back home I see at least 5 minutes they were out
but it was just as plain as this object you got in your hand here yeah sitting right out there just it hadn't been
touching the tree drops it didn't miss much cuz it was right down on them yeah if it was in a plane I would have heard
it a helicopter uh it comes out there and stops it it's going to make a noise it's going that motor got to run to hold
it up down there and that thing did not have no noise whatsoever and it wasn't over Lumberton
still continued to have activity cuz it was just 6 years later another report of
a humanoid surface this was a strange silver suited humanoid was early January
of 1981 that a couple was returning home around 10 p.m. they turned off Barker
10mile Road this is the same location the other humanoid was seen and they saw a round flashing light at the turnoff of
B and mlead roads and as they turned onto mle they saw a figure wearing a
quote bright shining metallic space likee suit covered from head to toe with
what appeared to be some sort of space helmet antennas and all now this figure
came out of the bushes waving its arms as though signaling the drivers to stop
meanwhile the strange glowing object behind it continued to flash lights the
couple was too frightened to stop they continued driving but again this was very much the same
area where a strange humanoid was seen years earlier encounters continued on
April 20 1992 residents along Harper's fery Road between Pembroke and Maxon saw a classic
Flying Saucer with rotating white lights around the edge was making a humming noise was hovering in the sky the
witnesses include Ian Dial Delila laier Cricut laer
and a friend said Ian Dial One of the witnesses it was shaped like a discus or
Flying Saucer was pretty far off but it was pretty big too now one more final Lumberton case
probably not the last occurred on March 6 2008 when four Witnesses described a
classic Flying Saucer covered with lights around the edge one of them said
and I quote the size of the object was bigger than anything I had ever seen it was the size of four to five airplanes
very low almost like it was scoping everything out I will never look at the
sky the same way again so I don't know what's going on in Lumberton but clearly
something is of interest to the UFO occupants so how about that I mean
that's the kind of UFO case that is absolutely undeniable you just cannot be skeptical
you have 50 police officers over several counties all seeing things at the same
time all these different humanoid cases Landing traces I mean so much going on
and that's just one location over a short period of time most of this stuff
again does not get documented really in any way most people keep quiet especially if it's an amazing encounter
extensive involving humanoids or being taken on board or having missing time or
something like that so here's another case cuz there's always another one and this next case
I'd like to talk about I call the little black aliens this is a really
interesting and profound case which occurred on October 9
1957 in maraville New York I like this case cuz it's a multiple witness case
with Landing traces and just really interesting it was 2:30 on the afternoon
of October 9 1957 as Marie joer sat in her trailer on dwaybox
day and Marie saw movement out in the yard which she thought for a split second was clothes being blown off of
her neighbor's clothesline but taking a second and closer look she saw that the movement
was actually coming from a roundish silver object which was reflecting the
light she said it was shaped like quote an oldfashioned washtub and was not much
larger than that she watched it descend and apparently land behind the hill a
short distance away 2 or 3 minutes later it reappeared and ascended upwards and
was gone she didn't think too much about it but she sure did the next day when
something even stranger and more bizarre happened it was around the same time
October 10 Marie was out in the yard to the left of her trailer feeding her ducks and chickens when she heard a
strange whizzing sound which she said was kind of like a fast spinning pin wheel but much like louder her ducks and
chickens began quacking and squawking loudly including her Drake which she said was normally afraid of nothing but
now appeared to be greatly frightened so looking up she saw this same object that
she had seen the previous day but this time it came down very nearby stopping
only about 6 feet above the ground immediately two black figures emerged
from the object and hopped Into the Woods she didn't get a good view of them she says she was really too frightened
and they were also moving so fast as to be almost a blur the object remained for just about
2 minutes then suddenly made a loud woring noise again and took off vertically so quickly she said that it
sucked up the leaves grass and dirt around it which came crashing back to the ground now she did not see the black
figures after they had disappeared into the woods but this whole experience erience frightened her pretty badly
badly enough that she returned to her trailer grabbed her baby got into her vehicle and drove over to a friend's
house she immediately told them what happened and they didn't want to believe her at first but they could see that she
was incredibly frightened so they did believe her shortly later the school bus did arrive Marie told the bus driver
what she had seen and he was amazed and told her that he had seen something very
similar to what she described red two craft but they were side by side sitting in a field just moments earlier she he
urged her to call the police which she did she called the police who were also
skeptical until she asked them to send over officers to protect her so they did
take her report seriously they sent over two Troopers and a deputy sheriff who
searched the area but found nothing but later a scientist and researcher heard
about the sighting shortly after it occurred went to investigate and found a whitish material in the area where Marie
said that this craft had hovered he said this material stuck to the grass and
looked kind of like lime he took a sample of it and said he would let Marie know what it was though this apparently
did not happen if it did it wasn't in the many reports on this case I think
there's some important takeaways from that case one is that if you've seen something likely there is another
witness another important aspect was the emotional reaction of the witness how
very scared she was we see this quite often and I'm very curious about it it's
very clear that people in general fear the unknown it's another reason why I do
this research so we can make the Unknown Known and move past fear now let's move move to the next
case which is also really compelling I call this one five saucers and six
aliens this case very nearly did not get any publicity whatsoever went unrecorded
but thankfully through pure coincidence we do know about it this one occurred on
November 18 1957 near maraha Brazil and this case I
like for a number of reasons mainly is that there are so many witnesses it was
about 10:30 a.m. when Pedro zilly a 43-year-old owner of a tobacco farm in
maraja Santa Katarina Brazil and his employee Xiao
ermani they were building a hot house to dry tobacco leaves when they both heard
this weird low buzzing noise they didn't pay much attention to it they just kind
of passed it off as the noise of the Wind but then they noticed that the cattle nearby which had been grazing had
stopped grazing and were now looking in a frightened manner towards a Grove of nearby trees looking in that direction
Pedro and Xiao were amazed to see about 500 ft away from them two metallic craft
sitting on the ground quite large they wondered at first if this might be
wreckage from a plane that had fallen from the sky and curious they began to approach but both men stopped in their
tracks when they saw six tall thin looking men dressed in a sort of Strang
looking dark clothes which emerged from this Grove of trees and began to walk
towards the craft now per the farmers the men were quote middle-sized wearing
gray suits glued on their bodies apparently seeing that they were being
observed these weird figures quickly ran into the craft climbing small laders and
entering inside now Pedro and Xiao were now close enough to see that these were not
conventional craft they were round about 10 ft across of course had no wings or
protrusions of any kinds except for a small ladder leading to an opening and
they weren't actually landed on the ground but were hovering about 3 ft above it so these six men quickly
approached the craft divided into two groups of three figures each and entered
into them moments later these two craft made a loud whistling sound and took off
with such speed that the coconut palm trees next to them were almost flat
flattened bent over double To The Ground by the force of the wind and seconds
later Pedro and Xiao were amazed to see three other identical looking
craft emerge from behind the trees Ascend upwards and join the other two in
the sky at this point all five craft darted off to the West at high speed a
short time later Xiao noticed a Jeep driving by and he stopped the driver to ask if they had seen any flying
saucers this Jeep was being driven by a man who was transporting a patient to the hospital and the driver said no he
had not seen any flying saucers nothing unusual and he drove off but it was later that day he was amazed to hear
local residents in a neighboring Village talk about seeing strange objects in the
sky some described hearing strange noises so the driver became very curious
he returned back to the tobacco farm to get more information and got the story and it was this man who informed
researchers of the incident and led to this case being investigated and later
publicized in local newspapers so there you go another amazing encounter with a UFO and
humanoids it's amazing because that yeah that case very nearly did not get
documented in any way was pure coincidence that that guy was driving by
happened to talk to the witnesses and then found out that there were more witnesses not for that guy we probably
would not be hearing about this case whatsoever which just goes to show again
that the vast majority of cases go unreported and he estimates on how common UFO encounters like this are
probably a lot more than we think and here is another really
important series of UFO events that deserve to be well known and I call this
one something weird over Denmark this main event occurred on
November 21st 1957 near South jutand Denmark and again
involves landed UFO and humanoids but like I'm seeing with a lot of these
cases it's not an isolated event there were other Witnesses and in fact this
event took place during a massive wave over Denmark that was really causing
waves at very high levels of government as we shall see it was the afternoon of November 21st 1957 as grosser Hans
hagard Hansen left his grocery store in gueston Denmark to pick up supplies in
the nearby town of eggh Hol and as he drove near the gueston forest he noticed
a strange object about 600 ft away over a nearby turnip field he first thought
that it was a tractor with a glass encased cabin but as he got closer he
saw it was actually a strange vehicle of some kind not normal it was about 9 to 10 ft tall it looked almost pyramidal or
triangular in shape was emitting a soft red orange glow and it looked unusual
enough that he decided to stop his car he left the engine idle and took a
closer look at this weird craft he could hear no sound coming from it and looking
at this object he was amazed cuz he could now see that there were actually two human-looking figures sitting inside
it one right behind the other these were totally human looking he said the craft
had a solid bottom portion but the top was semi-transparent
he watched it for just a few moments when the object flew at about 35 to 40 mph towards a nearby Hill where it
landed or hovered perhaps about 3 ft above the ground and after that it flew
off towards a nearby bog and disappeared from view but as Hans
says they were sitting Motionless in the glass Dome I will not hide the fact that
I was seriously surprised when I saw the object come flying so after it left Hans
did search the field where this object had been for any kind of physical evidence but didn't find anything he did
call the police to report his sighting and as it turns out he was not the only witness in fact there were many the
police did an investigation and found two other people who were in the same area at the same time and one of them
did report hearing a strange sound but also on the same day two residents of
the nearby town of Jord drup exited their barn and saw a similarly
described object hovering over the ground about 300 ft away they told reporters that this
object moved in a very strange way was moving gently just above the ground it
lifted up as it passed over a fence and then lowered itself as it moved over a depression in the ground this it was
almost as if it had some sort of sensor to detect the terrain they said it did
make a slight humming noise and emitted a brilliant searing light from its
bottom that wasn't the only sighting on that day was around 400 p.m. that Neils
poter his wife and their friend Amal neelsen of voras saw an object which
they said was shaped kind of like a tea or a cross was glowing flying at very
low altitude they watched it for about 10 minutes and they also reported seeing
two humanoid figures inside it now as it turns out Denmark was
having a lot of activity at this time Lieutenant Colonel Hans Christian
Peterson of the Danish Air Force later co-founder of the Scandinavia UFO
information group said that two reports from the island of bornholm were reported to the Danish defense
Intelligence on November 20 1957 this is the day before the above
two sightings now many people reported this object which was silent and hovering and
this was just the beginning of a huge wave of activity in fact the Danish
newspaper fam blad said that they had received hundreds of reports as they
wrote not a single day passes without some report appearing in Daily papers all over the country of true
observations having been made by truthful people and strangely enough the
observations are made in different parts of the country all at the same time therefore the possibility of optical
illusions or imagination is out of the question strange things are happening
between the sky and Denmark another newspaper wrote accounts
of witnesses seeing weird objects including one group of witnesses who saw a very large object releasing smaller
ones and one newspaper wrote quote so many reports of a similar nature have
been sent to the Air Force Station of screed strup that they have been unable to cope with all of them and more are
expected in the near future interestingly all of this occurred right on the heels of a huge
wave in early November that swept across the United States and the world another
interesting fact on November 21st 1957 the same date is the humanoid
sightings radar officers at Huma AFS in
Louisiana Air Force Station observed a radar Target get this 15 M long and 10
Mi wide at an estimated altitude of 31,000 ft this was observed on multiple
Scopes so this was an incredibly busy month and the above cases are just a
tiny portion of the actual number of cases going on at this time November
1957 is a month that will always go down in UFO history as being
unprecedented particularly the beginning of the month in the United States was
absolutely incredible I did a whole episode called one week in November on
just the cases that were in the US and here we have another amazing series of events in the latter part of the month
going on over Denmark makes me you wonder if these are intentional displays ETS conducting what
amounts to a publicity campaign to me that is the takeaway from this
particular case because that's what it sounds like is going on ETS do want us to know about them and now we move to
another case I call this one I can still feel the fear this one occurred in June
of 1963 it's a technically a multiple witness case but really only one witness
as the other one was quite a young child this occurred in stor Holman Sweden this
is a tiny little island this is quite an unusual case which involves what we
would call a Uso an unidentified submersible object though technically it
wasn't submerged this was a UFO that was touching the water it's a really
fascinating case and yeah I gave it that title because the witness had such a
strong emotional reaction to what was going on this very unusual case was
apparently not officially investigated but comes from the number four 1989
issue of the Swedish publication UFO directly from the witness
her it occurred on the very small island of stor homeman this is located
Northeast of Stockholm in Sweden the witnesses was there with her 7-year-old
son and they were enjoying the warm summer w weather they liked going there regularly to explore the beaches and
watch the birds collect rocks and Driftwood this particular day was a
beautiful sunny day they were at the southernmost tip of the island and I'll just let the witness describe in her own
words as she says everything was so peaceful but suddenly for no reason at
all I began to feel a strong anxiety something menacing was a foot I looked
out at the wall water which was perfectly mirror likee and it was at this point that she saw a reflection of
something shiny on the water clearly an object of some kind but whatever it was
it was coming right for her at very high speed and again I will let her describe
in her own words as she says it seemed to go really fast I took my son and ran
into the thicket where we huddled together so as not to be seen there was a faint wine and the shiny craft was
within sight it had a two-man crew one stood up while the other sat or lay down
in the cockpit under a round transparent Dome the boat was oval and flat as a
pancake all silver it glided so easily over the water at high speed everything
happened so fast but I could make out the standing man's profile and clothing
he was very masculine well Tred muscular and robust he was dressed in close
fitting Frogman gear in thin silver lame on his hands were motorcycle gloves and
a wide kidney belt around his waist all in silver the man sitting was partially
obscured but both gave a bright impression for they were very pale it was a beautiful crew but I felt a great
fear now for a moment as this object approached swiftly the witness thought that perhaps they were coming straight
for her to their location but before it did the object suddenly flew up like
lightning and disappeared in a Flash she says that the moment it was gone she and
her son ran up to Higher Ground which gave them a full view of the lake on all
sides and nothing was there there was no boat nothing nobody else was in the area
so as far as she knows nobody else saw this but she was so impressed by the
weird appearance of the object and the crew that she reported her sighting to
UFO magazine and as she wrote I have often thought about the incident and
wondered who it was that visited us this happened many years ago I can still feel
the fear inside me at that time there you have it another case with high
strangeness I find it fascinating that the witness started to feel a sense of
forboding even before the encounter occurred this is something that a number of witnesses report that they can feel
something coming this might be related to the Oz effect that we hear so often about this unnatural silence at any rate
it's this weird Pro precognition that occurs with encounters it's a really amazing case
and now we move to another one which I call alien street sweeper this is a really weird case it is a multiple
witness case there are UFOs involved a carving chased down the road
it's a pretty complicated case actually November 18 1973 is when it occurred and
it occurred near Montreal Canada and it's a very unusual case as we shall see
this very unusual case comes from Canadian researcher John Brent Musgrave author of UFO occupants and critters and
other books the Witnesses are four young women age 24 to 14 and they were driving
South west from the city of Sorel Tracy Quebec to Montreal you're traveling
along the a30 highway bordering the St Lawrence River now shortly after leaving
the city on the evening of November 18 1973 they all noticed a glowing sphere
in front of them kind of alongside the highway they drove up to it and passed it by at which point this sphere began
to move pacing their car on the right side right over the St Lawrence River
they said this object sparkled with yellow white light and seemed to pulsate
becoming alternately large and Brilliant then small and dim it didn't look
terribly large they estimate about the size of a watermelon but they couldn't be
sure now the witnesses did notice that whenever they reached a less populated
area the object would come closer to them but whenever they reached an area
where there was lots of structures in building this object would rise up and recede into the
distance they watched it go up and down in altitude but mostly it stayed at the
height of the telephone poles or about Treetop level and the longer it followed
them the more scared they became at one point this car passed by
them traveling at very high speed and when this happened the sphere rose up in altitude after the car was gone it came
down again now as they reached the Contra cor area the traffic suddenly slowed down at
which point this object also slowed down and hovered over this field still pacing
them now ahead of them they saw this weird quote pink Cloud this was lying
across the road they couldn't tell what it was if it was dust smoke or fog but
it looked so strange that all the witnesses forgot about the UFO that was following them and diverted their
attention to this strange pink Cloud there were other cars on the highway and
all of them had no choice but to drive through this weird Cloud now inside this
pink Cloud they reported what we would probably call the well-known Oz effect as they said quote everything was very
quiet and Silent now coming up the other side they sped up but had to immediately put on
the brakes cuz the car that had raced by them at high speed had apparently had an
accident and was now lying wrecked in a ditch off to the side of the road passing by this car they sped up
again but had to slam on the brakes almost immediately and swerve to avoid this strange quote little man who was
standing in the road the figure they said was about 5T tall or less was
wearing dark clothing with a cap that could quote hide his face he was holding
this broom likee tool in his hand now it was weird cuz he was wearing dark clothing he was standing directly on the
white dividing line on the highway also was seemingly unaware of the traffic not
responding to it and appeared to be using this instrument to sweep the road
perhaps they weren't sure further up the road just a short distance were two or three persons also dressed in black
standing next to the road not far from the car in the ditch now the investigators to this case
uh felt that this might have been a city worker or workers who were clearing the road from this accident but they also
considered the possibility that this figure was perhaps connected to the UFO which had followed the witness's car up
to this point and as John musra says I've elected to put this into the limbo
category pending more information but it's weird because if this was a human cleaning up this
accident why is he dressed in dark clothes why is he in the middle of the road why didn't they stop traffic to
clear the road I there are some weird details here which don't quite add up
turns out there's still more information to this case because later the Witnesses were driving back and that weird pinkish
Cloud was still there also in support of the UFO explanation is that this
sighting was the first of no less than 11 reports of unidentified glowing
objects in orbs in that area on that evening I don't know about that one
you'll have to make up your own minds about it I mean it's clear that this car was being pursued or paced by this UFO
and given that so many other people saw UFOs on that same night in that area
absolutely lends corroboration and Credence to the witness's testimony but
as far as the humanoid a little on the fence about it could have been just
normal human sweeping the streets but even that's unusual and the way that it
was dressed the fact that it's standing there in the middle of the road with no fear of being hit ignoring the traffic I
don't know it's strange but now we move to another case and this is probably my favorite of the
bunch it's so poignant really touching I call this one don't you want to come on
board this occurred in the summer of 1974 in Oslo Norway and wow what a case this
is it really made me think this case comes from researcher n ashim and it was
published in the Norwegian magazine UFO was around noon a bright sunny day
in summer of 1974 as the witness known only by her initials Miss NN she was 73 years old
and she was taking a walk in the Suburban area of Western Oslo near her
home nobody was around strangely there was no traffic either and she was going
up a shallow Hill with many older homes and large Gardens and she was coming up
to a cross street when she heard the sound of beautiful music she looked
around to locate the source of the music and as this sound came closer and louder
she looked up and saw the source was actually a strange object hovering above
the pine trees to the North she said it quote moved slowly like it was on a
scouting trip she had the impression that whoever was in the object had
noticed her because immediately as soon as she saw this object it quickly came
down lower and closer to her the music stopped and this object now silent
revealed itself to be a sort of squarish oblong with rounded
corners and it was about the size of a small cottage AG through a very large
window or transparent section of the front of this craft she could see three
human-looking figures this frightened her she turned around and began walking home and became even more frightened
when this object began to follow her she did notice that it was leaving a trail of condensation behind it and she had
the sense that whoever was in this object was aware of her and was watching
her this object then Rose upward she believed to avoid the trees lining the
Avenue and also to get a better view of her as she was now obscured from view by
the trees but as she moved out into the open the object descended again coming
even lower than the Treetops and still following her Miss NN kept turning
around to keep an eye on the object and she could now get a very good
view of these three figures she said the interior of the object was illuminated
by a yellow white light these three Figures were wearing dark beige uniforms
which she described as being like quote work clothes they covered the entire body except for the head she said that
they had medium blonde hair two were sitting at sort of a table facing her
she didn't see any legs to the table it was just a flat surface but a third sat to the side he appeared to be taller he
was dressed in darker clothes that she said looked quote sleek and stately she said that she had the
distinct impression that he was the leader or manager now she stared at him in
surprise when he suddenly stood up reached out one of his arms in a welcoming gesture bowed gently and
smiled as if to say go ahead don't you want to come on board she had the
distinct impression that this was what he was trying to say and although this action was clearly friendly this is how
she perceived it she became even more frightened and decided that no she did not want to go on board and this is when
she began to run away towards her home while at the same time trying to keep an
eye on this object at one point she hid herself behind some
bushes but this object followed and to her surprise every time she looked this
same figure again would stand up and again gesture for her to come on board
he repeated this same gesture several times but the witness continued to run
by the time she reached the Gate of her home she was pretty much out of breath she looked up again and the object was
gone she did notice an unnatural Stillness in the air she says the entire
episode lasted she estimates about 20 minutes but she had no doubt in her mind
that she had just had an encounter with a UFO and it occupants she said that after this event she had a series of
nightmarish dreams about the incident and she told nobody what happened for a very long time though she did finally
tell her son who had become interested in parapsychology and open to this kind of
subject so this apparently led to this case being investigated and the investigators to the case thought it was
very significant that the witness herself was a trained violinist and came
from a very musical family and they wondered if perhaps the UFO had played
music intentionally to attract her attention I'm not sure why but I found
that case really touching maybe it's because that it occurred to an elderly
lady maybe it was her strong fear reaction maybe it was the fact that the
UFO is playing music for her something she was very familiar with don't have a
lot of cases like that but it does turn up also the fact that they were very
friendly and invited her on board and sadly she had a very strong fear
reaction I would have loved to have spoken with her directly CU I suspect
that this wasn't a oneoff that she probably had other encounters I can't say for sure but it
is a pattern we see so often that I really wonder about that an amazing case
all around and now we move to the next case this one again is not that well
known but certainly deserves to be and I call this one landing at a French farm
this is a very closeup case involving a landing and humanoid quite a strange
humanoid I might add it occurred on December 9 1977 in Fon Fay
France and it's a really compelling case because this witness got a very close-up
view of this UFO and this humanoid it was a pretty long encounter with some
apparent Landing traces as well and some really interesting collaboration from
other Witnesses in the area the main witness in this case is known only as
Shanta L she's a 12-year-old girl it was about 6:30 on December 9
1977 that shantaa had just finished her kitchen chores and was looking out the window to the field west of her house
this is when she saw a very bright glowing red kind of flattened oval-shaped object floating right above
the trees it's pretty big about 22 ft long 8 to 10 ft high and moving slowly
about 15 mph she could hear a whining motor sound coming from it and suddenly it came in
for a landing just about 150 ft away was just moments later that she saw a seven
or 8T tall figure emerge from the center upper edge of the object it floated to
the right floated down to the ground then moved over to the other side floated up to the top again and
apparently re-entered the object as it was no longer visible but Shantal never
did see any doors open or Clos this figure just emerged came down skirted
around the object floated back up and went back inside and she said this figure was very strange looking its head
was kind of squarish it had a dark face plate it had short gray white neck
roughl looking dull textured scuba diving suit all medium gray said its
legs were very long had a very thin body she was close enough to see that it had
five fingers on each hand and it seemed to float rather than walk and not once
did it move its arms or legs they just stayed stiffly by the side of its body
now after this entity entered the craft the craft rose upwards going no higher
than 40 or 50 ft making the same whining noise and promply landed again this was
about 30 ft from the road 150 ft from the house and as it landed a second time
the whining engine noise stopped the winess left the window to move to another nearby window for a better View
and watched this object for about 2 minutes until it suddenly Rose upwards and moved off the total duration of the
encounter was about 15 minutes sadly around this time her mother was working in the barn uh did not see or hear
anything returned into the house and heard the story from her daughter turned
out the dog in the house did not react either but something very interesting
happened the next day because when they let the cows out the cows began jumping around in all directions almost as if
they were receiving electric shocks this was exactly in the area where this craft
had landed also going to the site where this craft had landed they found that
the grass was all wilted as if subjected to extreme heat and they also found nine
Footprints pressed about a half inch into the soil and there was some corroboration of this 2 days later on
the evening of December 11 1977 shantel's two younger brothers
reported seeing an object of the same shape and size moving around in the sky
investigators learned that there was another gentleman from bont located Northeast of fonf he said he saw a
bright red round object at low altitude heading directly towards the location of
this first encounter F Fay he doesn't remember the exact date but does say it was early December of
1977 so it could have been the same day but that's not verified another testimony comes from a
man who said that on December 1st he also saw a bright red object moving
slowly at low altitude in this same area now none of these other Witnesses saw
the object land or did they see any humanoids but these descriptions
definitely fit shantel's observation and provide an extra level of
Confirmation and another unusual thing about this area is that there is a large
cave pretty fascinating case I think you'll agree I'm always curious as to what draws UFOs and ETS to a particular
location there are a lot of Landings at farms so perhaps that's what was going
on here I also found it fascinating that there's some very large caves in this
area because there are other cases where UFOs seem to be hovered in over cave
systems perhaps this is a loose Association because there are so many cases occurring all over the world that
I think we really are looking for patterns and connections that might not necessarily be there hard to say for
sure but we do need to check out all the evidence and try to figure out what's going on here and now we move to the
next case which I call I heard a piercing scream this occurred in March
of 1978 and a very rural area of Tasmania called Lake
sorell this is a super interesting case because it does have a lot of witnesses some really unusual High strangeness
details to it Landing traces as well I love that when there's more evidence it
really brings another level of validity and corroboration to these cases they
make it hard to deny that something unusual is happening it was early March of 1978 that binm said he saw a strange
flying object hovering above a hill near Lake cell this is in the rural Central
Highland of Tasmania he said the object had flashing lights around the perimeter glowing
lights underneath it which illuminated the ground it frightened him enough that he dashed into his house and retrieved
his rifle rushing outside and loading his gun as he went this object quickly
darted away he had the impression that it was sens ing his intention to shoot at it so after this sighting he checked
with his neighbors and got a shock he learned that dozens of them had recently seen similar objects so this concerned
him and he decided to take action he organized a system of communication where anyone in this area who saw
strange aerial activity would agree to blow their horns and signal each other whenever these objects appeared was one
night a short time later Monty says he was woken up from asleep by a brilliant
glowing light outside his home he rushed outside with his loaded rifle in hand
instantly this glowing light disappeared but Monty got another shock this is so
strange the doors of his car which had been locked were all now standing wide
open later on another occasion Monty was walking to his house from his barn when
he heard loud quote squishing footsteps these were following him and it sounded
to him like a heavy man was walking through the mud he rushed inside grabbed
his rifle and emerged just in time to hear these footsteps near his garden he
quickly fired his rifle in the direction of the footsteps and as he told reporters I heard a piercing scream but
saw nothing that was all there was no blood it must have been invisible now he
never heard the footsteps again but doing more investigation with his neighbors he learned that most of the
sightings were occurring in the same area right over nearby Table Mountain
this made him curious so he organized a group of his neighbors and together they
climbed up to the summit which was not easily accessible this is really only
accessible by foot or by aircraft but getting to the top they were amazed to find strange tracks on the ground and
there right on the top in the soft soil they also found small rectangular sections where it looked like the Moss
had been carefully removed they ruled out helicopters causing all of this as some of these Landing tracks measured
more than 50 ft in length no actual humanoids seen in that case but
apparently heard when you hear footsteps and you find all these Landing traces and so many people are seeing UFOs and
he heard this scream uh it's clear there was someone or something there it's a
really unusual case and again not well known at all so now we do know about it
and it's another piece of the puzzle to what's going on here and now we get to
our final case of this episode which is quite brief but certainly interesting
and I call this one the alien at the beach this one is not super well
investigated though researchers certainly did look into it and interviewed one of the witnesses and
there were several witnesses it is a multiple witness case this occurred on February 3rd
1994 at petto Italy and it's an unusual
case involving a very weird-looking humanoid this next case was investigated
by Italian researchers Renzo kabasi Paulo fiorino and Marcelo pupil they all
followed up on a newspaper report describing what was apparently a multiple witness account of a strange
humanoid they wrote this case up in the Italian publication UFO it was around 900 a.m. on the
morning of February 3rd 1994 is a group of about six Witnesses unfortunately are
mostly Anonymous were all at the beach near some caves this is near anona in
petto Italy one of the witnesses who did agree to a formal interview is known only as
Julio he's 75 years old he and the other Witnesses he said all saw this strange
looking figure which they said was about 5T tall and did not appear to be human
he had a very elongated face with very sharp features two huge round eyes with
round black pupes had a large broad chest and narrow waist huge feet and he
was wearing a fullbody black suit and what appeared to be headphones with kind
of protrusions or antenna sticking out and this figure was wandering among a
rocky formation known as Pope's chair and he was moving strangely very slowly
seeming to sway and stagger so this went on for about 10 minutes when suddenly this strange
figure surprised all the witnesses by quickly Rising vertically and moving off
to the Northeast in the sky and disappearing into the distance now the witness Julio later
wondered if this might be some kind of inflated balloon figure this event was reported to some
of the witnesses to the local newspapers and TV stations who unfortunately kind of ridiculed the case and this caused
the witnesses to clam up was because of this that they refused to cooperate with any investigators all except for the one
gentleman who did agree to an interview so unfortunately there's no further information on this brief and very
strange case but there you go this was either a balloon or an alien so that's
another case that you're going to have to make up your own minds about I found it interesting but I also find it
somewhat amusing that the witnesses themselves wonder if this was an actual humanoid from elsewhere or a balloon
these are such widely diverging explanations that that it's a little
hard to make sense of but such an interesting case because this certainly doesn't sound like a balloon I don't
know again if there was a more thorough investigation I think I'd be less on the
fence about it but I found it compelling enough to include in this episode and I
hope you found it interesting as well so that's our episode for today can't
believe how many humanoid cases I've covered in these various episodes it's well over a couple of thousand now
people can say all they want about how skeptical they are of reports of
humanoids but the fact is there are so many coming from so many people from all
over the world many of which are backed up by a wide variety of evidence that I
think it's undeniable that something really profound is going on here I think
the evidence is fairly conclusive we are not alone we are being visited extraterrestrials are real and if our
own governments would simply just disclose release the craft and the bodies that I think they have it would
be a different ball game all bets would be off we would know for sure that we
are not alone not sure that's ever going to happen and so it's up to all of us to
figure it out ourselves and again that's why I do this research so thank you all for watching I truly appreciate it and
like I like to always say keep searching for the truth it's out there keep asking those hard questions
because if you don't who will and most important keep having fun because if
you're not having fun what are you doing all right guys thanks again I'll see you
next Friday you have a good
weekend in the morning big thunderstorm at night it was right before the Big Thunder of course it would rain at the
time it had a row of lights on each side one was green and was Rish you had a big
Spotlight Beacon some kind P up under what light something of that nature yeah
shining down did you see any sort of structure of the object itself yeah it was triangular so the thing we saw in
the newspaper the other day was the thing you described right I didn't see I think was in the obser
I believe Ron has a a picture Newton Grove Police Officer Drew and it's exact
exct same thing that you saw how far away is Newton Grove from spot where you were where Newton Grove new Grove is
about what 80 M from 80 M
were out how far away from you would it have been do you recogniz
200 Y 2 300 y something that what over the roadway or off off the right did you
stop the car yeah it off and all right now did you hear any sound hear no sound and did that uh make
you a little bit more curious about what you were looking at what made me so curious and was it moving in that
St now when it when it did move did it move fast or did it just slowly move
it was gone really fast how long would it have been hovering when they were looking at couple minutes well when I first got a glimpse of it was all from
the distance I tried to get up closer to it when I first stopped the car and got out it stood there before I gu anywhere
from 5 to 10 it didn't stay there long when IO like that or just didn't move away I
seen it move away but it was go in a horizontal
position what do you think it was I mean was it it could have been an aircraft I
what what color was this white on the top that was a bright light that's the yeah and he just just come up just turn
like were you in the car did you stop the car all to get out oh yeah
IO make any noise you uhhuh no motor stay at
all and did this thing have any kind of light or beam of light coming down from
it at all as you can see not shining down on the right out in front of just like an
airplane yeah was it pulsating at all or was it a constant light it burning they
want to Blink in own they want a light on it uhhuh thing is awfully quiet huh
yeah how uh how big do you think the thing was could you estimate well it was I don't believe it was quite as big as
uh small L now Phil Stanton said that he didn't
think it was much bigger than his car it looked a little bigger
than I said I on 1727 and it was coming right di scra down this
R and he got near about the 31 he AC cross5 he just turned went back turned
went back toward your p and and that's probably when fil
thought as it was passing that way it turned there it was coming right I sitting right in stop sign on 301 he
come right up with was with telep pole they got right about the there telep
Pole right here on 301 in the next and down in had just come right street toward that way and it just turned like
that could you see what it was made out of no you couldn't tell nothing about made you could see the shape of it yeah
you could tell it was in a beach shape how many color lights all together well I never counted lights but
how many colors was there a white two and a red light uh red and red and green and then the bright light there three
different of course just bright light in front of it was the one right in front
was just just like a headlight on automobile it shining right straight down in front of it now somebody said
they seen one shining down but I never seen how long did this old take from the time you saw it to the time uh
well now from the time I seen it and getting out to the highway nor was about 8 minutes whenever H turn it started
back towards ped but that's when we got an aob bile we started off and we picked
up c m I was outside then he started picking up speed and I got up to 100
L at the Army I show me where they got something like that and show me how to take it up and sound that it made and I
say that's what it was but I don't say it is you need no airplan now it had
these little lights yeah these little lights around it okay and these little lights around him okay and what color
were they all the same or they alternate well they was red and green they were red and green they different color now
when you were watching it did did they seem to uh go on and off or were they Prett they didn't blink them that's what
I say they just stayed on they they blink it up I just wish it land let me go to it and see what it is it didn't
Bank near B if it the bank I could have seen under but it just turned it was a
bright light to an amber light this was appeared to be a Tre toop level I
observed it through the North D looking I would describe it I was traveling south and I was looking
more like a northeastly easterly direction and this bright white amber
light was illuminate hole it was Illuminating the perimeter if there it was so brilliant if there was any
running lights along the perimeter of it it was drowning them out or they would blow the tree L this was seen about a
minute and a half before I saw it and rolling by a rolling city policeman
which is 15 to 20 mi south of us and a minute and a half after I saw it by an
officer St Paul's 10 Mi North and he they were describing exactly the same
thing I big liit here 55 mph where I'm running
at you I was running about I was running about 50 just 55 one it came
down the whole this this are right here was dark
and the whole CL Side Road lit up and
just like it was Daylight and St where we are right here where I'm at right now
and I travel on there a tril Park cover above us about 300 y I travel on the h
and I pulled over and I stopped sto my C
car got out and looked up the there and L was
APR I had to look back and uh I reach back in the car and I got
my knockers I had in the car and I looked up at it and then I take my I got
a airplane uh Landing light I I car myol
car and I shine up at it and I blink the light at it and it it BL back I take
another look at it good look at was KN then it moved at of
West and my way to the West for lton and
uh as it moved away for me I followed it about 2
miles went out of about how fast when you say now I got up 85 or 90 and they
walked until that left about how high was it at this time it time do went up
in there back up about whole way about I'd say Well when
it left me to start with after I F the light I pass light on it window St up in
there and then went out moved out about I there a good 200 mph because he just
walked right right from me Chief when you first observed do did it did it come from any particular direction or did it
rise from the Tre down they come right down over right down on top of it like it supp get the car start pull over how
close would you say it got to you about 200 ft you did get a good look at it I got a good look at it kind of describe
the the craft for me it was a be be shape had lights all all way around it
with the big light look to be about the side of a double side of a steing wheel
of a car that was shining down the beam of the light it would light up it was about I'd say at
least 500 ft on both sides of Road just lit up in a circle that big did it make
any sound at all not a bit I he anything did it at any time just stop and hover
in midair just this one time that it stopped right I was stop it stay sto
about 5 minutes so you don't think it could have been a jet or any kind of aircraft right J came parking
there we J parking there actually J came 200t he can't find 200 ft to start with
trees off so you are positive wanting any kind of conventional aircraft in it
was not no it was not no uh aircraft no no no uh not that we have I saw a lot of
but I've never done a thing like that and it was not a helicopter it been a I just he
Sal propell on out what caused you to Blink your light at it I de I'd blink
see if if it was someone if there was someone in it if they blink it back
at I was headed south on 1166 which is near my home in fact I was on my way to
have lunch or supper when we spotted the craft to the east Northeast uh immediately gave
Pursuit and soon overt took the craft it hovered along beside the roadway
approximately 100 yards away as it was dark I stepped outside of the vehicle and with my right arm took the light
switch and switched the lights on and off and sure enough I got a response from the front headlight or Spotlight
from the vehicle the vehicle having two spotlights on it one on the front one on the back it then proceeded to move in
the southwesterly direction and I turned around to give Pursuit again was soon lost sight of The Craft as it
disappeared behind trees I must say this that I did get within 100 yd of The
Craft and was able to get it to Signal back to me with its front
headlight being 100 yd away there's no possibility that it could have been
mistaken for a Delta aircraft or any other man-made aircraft for that matter I had never seen anything like it
before well we were on Philadelphia Road headed north and just driving along at
an ordinary speed and I was driving the car and I was the first one to see it I
observed uh what I thought to be five big lights I would say or guess to be
about 100 ft in the air and the moment I focus my eyes on them it appeared that
they were maybe going at a speet of about 50 mph and then they speed it up like 100 m hour and I went to telling my
wife and two daughters to look and let see those lights and they did and
momentarily I take my eyes back off of them to make a turn a right-and turn and
my wife and daughter they kept their eyes focused on it and they observed it uh going it was in a downward position
like headed towards the ground and uh we followed it and it went down behind a
house and I would say a 16 to 24 in streak behind them behind each one of
them uh I couldn't determine if there was smoke but it didn't appear to be
smoke behind each one of them it didn't even look like a flame it was just a beautiful streak behind each one of them
and we had church at 6:30 and it was 5:15 at that time and I thought the time we could get home and get dressed U it
would be time for church but obviously we run into something we didn't anticipate running into uh these people
they don't tell you if uh come up with any kind of little story it's got to be
something that uh excit you whenever you see something like this I really don't
think they at any time the trees even bothered them I think they were high up
enough and I think that they were in a position to totally miss the trees in
the house that we talked about got a big light of of
it and that light is as bright as anything that I have ever seen yeah bright as the I don't I've never seen a
lightbody I've seen search lights for on airports but I've never seen a lightbody that thing that light shine it was
shining right down towards the ground okay and what what color were all these lights different color light it was blue
lights it were red lights it's all different color lights on it didn't have no sound whatsoever now how did you
deter now did you go outside no I was sitting here I was sitting in the building here when the
thing come up there but did you go out at all just to see if you can get like a Clos look at it oh yeah I went outside
there and uh I couldn't hear a thing on we got a a system right there if there's
any noise all on here'll pick it up really it'll pick it up automobile cross
that bridge down anybody walks by down back of that plant down that'll pick it up well you mean you've got microphone
set up down there that that pick this up and then transfer the sound back here right I just went right out here on this
driveway yeah and I saw the thing where was it coming from it came from back in here towards the see this 95 Highway
back in here and someone told me they travel that 95 or something uhhuh they come across here raise a canal right
down here the back of this plant down here yeah and I saw where he was at he just was above the tree Toops I thought
he was touching the Treet tops yeah no sound so what so well no he came
right up down here and just looked like it just come up there and stopped there for a little bit over over what over the building over here well right cor by the
corner this building where you see light in front that front office he was just beond H over there he looked like he
just came up there and stopped and I set up for a little bit then he started to move it up and over and I never seen
nothing a move like the move a airplane can't come up there and do that or a helicopter and need one without me
hearing it now tell me what happened when uh when the Lights Went Out when was that it happened two nights that
thing came that close two different nights on Tuesday night and Wednesday night those sign it came from the same
direction and it went back AC the same direction that it came from all of these lights you on the front of the plant
there that's the lights that went out we have 1 2 3 four five five lights here
now where are these lights powered from like are they powered by the same source that these lights over here same lights
of those are down here were these they still burning they were still on they were still on those was out and yet
they're all powered by the same that's right the light St down as long as that thing was hovered down there and when it
left it the lights came back home I see at least 5 minutes were out
there but it was just as plain as this object you got your hand here yeah
sitting right out there just it had been touching the tree drops it didn't miss much CU it were right down on them yeah
it was in a plane I would heard it a helicopter uh hit up there and stop it's
going to make a noise it's going that motor got to run to hold it up there in air and that thing did not have no noise
whatsoever
