record, coming from across the world. Half of the cases occur at elementary schools. Thirty 
percent of the cases involve landings or humanoids. They are coming for our children. This

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett today I'd like to talk to you a little bit about my 
new book schoolyard UFO encounters this is all about schools which have been visited by UFOs 
these are not normal sightings these are very low-level sightings they occur during the day 
usually schools are directly targeted and these objects are viewed usually by large groups of 
people not just students often teachers as well sometimes there's a governmental response often 
these accounts appear in newspapers something really profound is happening here and yeah I've 
collected some 100 cases more really about half involved elementary schools and about 
let's see one third of them involve landings and or humanoids so these are very close encounters 
and very important I think and I can't cover all 100 in 20 cases or so in the book so I'd like to 
talk about the top 16 or so most widely viewed starting with the least amount of 
witnesses going to the most the one case that will start with the occurred on May 21st 1968 
at Union High School in Roosevelt Utah were some 21 students and their teacher an English teacher 
observed this metallic object hovering next to the school for a period about 10 minutes and at 
one point it looked like it was going to land the next case occurred on March 15th 1950 and 
there was 35 students and their teacher who observed two visitations of multiple 
objects which came down and directly targeted to the school coming very low and scaring many 
of those students pretty bad next case after that occurred on March 9 1967 at Sacred Heart 
elementary school in Moline Illinois some 40 students and three nuns observed this metallic 
object hovering over the school glowing it was also seen by a police officer who was able to 
film this object this case did generate a lot of interest from Air Force and government officials 
next case after that that was really widely viewed occurred on October 1970 at the Foxcroft boarding 
school in Middleburg Virginia when a group of about 50 female students who were outside 
next to the school saw this saucer-shaped object approached very low it sent on a beam of light 
and moved just across the field right over the students who jumped up and went chasing after it
next case after that would be at the aerial elementary school in ruins in Bob way on September 
16 1994 at least 62 students observed multiple UFOs one of which landed next to the school 
humanoids were seen some of which communicated with a few of the students it's probably the 
most famous schoolyard encounters but there are many very similar or pretty much just like it on 
October 22nd 1954 at least 60 students and one teacher observed this object hovering over the 
drôme elementary school in Marysville Ohio was a metallic object very bright it darted 
away after sending down this huge shower what we now call angel hair this cotton candy-like 
substance some of which was actually collected and sent to the local Air Force who declined to 
respond another very widely viewed case occurred on November 8 1973 when about 70 students and 
their teachers saw this object kind of shaped like the Apollo capsule with landing legs come 
hover over the school and come very low as if for a landing and then suddenly disappear in 
a flash of light after that another case would be on March 21st 1966 at Hillsdale College in 
Hillsdale Michigan when more than 87 students and teachers and school officials observed an 
object hover next to the school for a period of one to two hours this object actually landed in 
front of the school at one point hovered very close and maneuvered around for quite a while 
and was observed by two police officers as well it's a very well known case after that would be 
an incident which occurred at Whitsett elementary school and would set North Carolina on October 
27th 1955 when about 120 students and at least two teachers observed multiple spherical shaped 
objects metallic darting around in the sky and just like the Durham elementary school case they 
dropped a whole bunch of angel hair some of which was collected and sent to a chemical lab and a 
biologist neither of who were able to identify it after that would be a case which occurred 
on August 2nd 1957 in Riften new zealand when some 130 students and three teachers observed 
a bright silver cigar shaped object performing incredible maneuvers over the school on june 
1st 1950 in minneapolis minnesota 150 students and five teachers observed an object hovering over the 
Pine Point School in July 1962 a school in via to nuyen Argentina was visited 180 students and their 
school teachers were able to see three glowing blue disc shaped objects dark over the school
the next case after that would be on May in May 1970 at the public elementary school number 54 in 
Bronx in New York City where Lee you know some 200 students observe an object hovering about 100 feet 
in the air silver-colored shaped like a pyramid and spinning in place about the size of a small 
School Bus next case after that was on April 7th 1967 some 200 students at Crestview Elementary 
School in opa-locka Florida observed multiple UFOs one of which landed apparently next to the 
school now we get to the top three cases on April 6 1966 about 300 students at West Hall High School 
in Melbourne Australia observed multiple objects one of which landed next to the school there was a 
cover-up of the event following the sighting after that on may 17 1970 some four hundred students and 
two teachers at the Richmond school in maraenui New Zealand observed an object hovering very low 
over the school it hovered in place for about 10 minutes moved a little bit to the east and 
then took off straight up probably number one most widely viewed case occurred on December 
15th 1954 and San Lorenzo Venice Venezuela in the town San Lorenzo experienced a huge display 
it was seen by about a thousand residents and at least 400 students or more than 400 students 
and their teachers from the san lorenzo college who observe these objects whirling around the 
sky for a quite some period of time very low two of students fainted from the excitement so these 
are just some of the cases that appear in my book schoolyard you have phone counters I think 
the reason why these UFOs are targeting schools is really to convince students of the presence 
of UFOs in the of UFOs this is why they're targeting elementary schools first but really 
all schools so I think these are important cases and yeah that's it for now thanks for listening
