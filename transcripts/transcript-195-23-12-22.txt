REALLY STRANGE UFO ENCOUNTERS: TWELVE TRUE CASES
Dec 22, 2023

Summary:
Dec 22, 2023
Each UFO case, whether a simple sighting or an onboard UFO encounter, adds to our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon and provides another piece to solving the UFO mystery. One of the most fascinating aspects of UFOs is that they behave in weird ways. This video presents 12 very strange encounters that show the high strangeness of ET contact. The cases come from all over the world and provide strong evidence of UFO reality.

“IT SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTED TO DO.” Aug 20, 1955 was a windy day as two men stood on the dock of Kenora Bay in Ontario, Canada. Suddenly, a saucer zoomed over the water, seeming to study the men. But then it moved to the nearby hospital, and seemed to inspect that, before suddenly darting away.

THE UFO THAT LISTENED. On Sep 3, 1955, Frank Flaig and his wife Ruth drove along Boomer Rd in Cincinnati, OH, when a small silver sphere descended to the ground. Frank stopped the car and went over to investigate. But his wife Ruth became concerned for his safety and called out to him. Amazingly, the UFO seemed to react to her voice and darted off.

THE THIRSTY UFO. In Jul 1965, John Hambling was working with another man in the wilderness north of Hazelton, Canada when they saw a UFO swoop down over a small alpine lake. The craft sent a cylinder down to the surface and began to suck up the water. They were able to take several photos before the craft darted off. Was it there for the water? Or was there another reason?

“WE WANT TO WATCH FLYING SAUCERS.” One night in Aug 1967, 12-year-old, Leif told his parents that he and his friends were camping in the front yard of their home in Duncan, Canada, to watch for flying saucers. His parents were amused. But later, Leif rushed to the window to announce that the UFOs had arrived. His parents rushed outside and saw the UFOs themselves.

UFO INSPECTS FARMHOUSE. On Feb 19, 1968, Martha Heggs was alone with her two children in her farmhouse in Bengough, Canada when she heard a piercing noise. Looking outside, she saw a flying saucer hovering over the power-pole. As her dog cowered in fear and the cows ran for safety, the saucer closely inspected each area of the farm. It was the strangest 20 minutes of Martha’s life.

UFO LANDS AT WASHINGTON DC. At 6am on Oct 24, 1968, a paperboy was making his rounds in Bethesda, Maryland when he saw a landed UFO in Fort Bayard Park, along the border of Washington DC. He watched it for about three minutes when it suddenly flew away, leaving a burnt circle of grass. The case would soon generate interest at high levels of govt.

PANIC AT THE POOL. In Oct of 1968, tourists were enjoying themselves in the pool at Sulphur Mountain Resort in Banff, Canada. Suddenly, a UFO appeared over nearby Mt Rundle and everyone stopped to watch. Then the UFO swooped down at high speed beside the pool, causing complete panic. Some people were injured and a few went into clinical shock.

SPEEDWAY DRIVER’S ORDEAL BY UFO. Early on Apr 13, 1971, racecar driver, Geoff Richards and his wife drove along a remote highway outside of Brunswick, West Australia when a UFO swooped down and buzzed their car. But then it returned and zoomed towards their car, playing a game of chicken, not once or twice but several times.

THE 15-TON CRAFT. One night in May 1971, Angela Rajh saw an odd glow near her home in Stara Cerkev, Yugoslavia. Going to investigate, she saw that the glow was a landed flying saucer. She raced home, only to learn that her mother saw the UFO. Also, her neighbors saw the craft on the ground and walked up to it. Later they found some very odd landing traces.

UFO BLOCKADE ON MPUSHINI BRIDGE. On the evening of July 22, 1972, two gentlemen were driving through Ashburton, South Africa when they came upon a UFO sitting in the middle of the road on the Mpushini Bridge. Unable to pass, they had no choice but to stop. The UFO took off a short time later and they called the police, who saw it too.

UFO TAKES OVER TRUCK. On Jul 18, 1976, the sheriff’s office near Gravel Switch, Kentucky was flooded with calls from people reporting UFOs. The UFO flew around for hours. One lady said it chased her car. But the strangest call came from two witnesses who said the UFO came down over their truck and took control of the vehicle.

MISSING TIME ON THE TOILET. On the night of Mar 13, 1979, Mr. WP went to visit the pub near his home in Alverthorpe, England. Strangely, however, he found himself taking the wrong route. Unexpectedly he came upon a UFO which chased him across the field. Suddenly he found himself standing in the public restroom next to the pub with no idea how he got there.

These twelve cases show how any encounter can provide profound insights into UFO behavior. Only by examining all the cases will we discover the alien agenda and the reasons for the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. And there is no shortage of cases! The truth is coming out. We are being visited.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal today's episode is called
really strange UFO encounters 12 true cases as I'm sure you know I love
exploring cases involving humanoids especially cases involving onboard
experiences but sightings are equally interesting and let's face it the vast majority of encounters involve sightings
and they do have a lot of things to say about the ET agenda UFO behavior and can
answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon and what I've done today is
taken 12 really interesting cases which are quite bizarre sort of the theme
today is exploring cases where UFOs behave in unusual ways unique ways
behavior that raises all kinds of questions as to why UFOs do the things they do I've got 12 really interesting
cases coming from all over the world Australia Africa Europe Canada the
United States cases that span many decades cases that provide really
compelling and a wide variety of physical evidence by that I mean of
course Landing traces physiological evidence electromagnetic effects animal
reactions and more so these are cases I think you probably haven't heard before
and are super interesting because they are unique and they do raise a lot of
questions as to why UFOs do the things they do so this is going to be a long
episode these cases are really quite interesting so let's just get started
and the first case I'd like to talk about today I call it seemed to know
exactly what it wanted to do this is a quite unusual case which occurred on
August 20 1955 in canora Ontario Canada it
involves two witnesses who had a very close encounter but couldn't quite figure out what the UFO was doing and
why it was there UFOs do seem to have a purpose when they come down but but
again it's not always apparent what it is for example consider this case which
involves two witnesses a n Watchman by the name of Adolf angstrom and his
employer who was a bush pilot by the name of HJ Bud Parsons it was around 10:45 p.m. on the
evening of August 20 1955 and a Gusty night so Bud drove down
to the Second Street dock pictured here in canora to make sure that his sea
planes were tied down it was Adolf who noticed it first a 6 foot wide very thin
metallic disc coming down from a low cloud ceiling and then moving towards
them from across this water from only 40 ft above the water
itself as Adolf says I saw it coming and I thought my goodness that thing maybe
is going to land in the dark and I was scared the object was bright but with no
glare and we could easily watch it in the darkness the surface seemed to Sparkle and it was silvery white in
color so Adolf immediately pointed it out to Bud who described it as quote two
saucers with their open ends touching one above the other the thing appeared
to me to be only four or five ft feet across the top and bottom surfaces were
rounded and around the center where the two saucers would touch was a Halo 1 and
1/2 in thick and 4 and 1/2 in wide the entire object was a beautiful silvery
white color and appeared to send out Rays from its surface it seemed to Sparkle as if some electric force or
very hot air was flowing from all the surfaces including the Halo as the two men watched this object
came towards them then stopped about 200 ft away and remained there for 2 minutes
then took off towards the north moving below the front of the roof line of the hospital across the lake which you can
see here and that was about A4 mile away from them now bud really wasn't sure
what this saucer was up to he wondered was it interested in the hospital had it
come to survey what he and Adolf were doing with the planes he's just not sure
but as he says in his own words it seemed to know exactly what it wanted to
do it came up on our side of the dock there's a canopy above the dock and it
looked as though it slid over to have a clear view of the other craft it maybe
didn't have anything to do with that but it appeared to be looking at the planes both men do agree that the object
left as quickly as it arrived and Adolf said it just kept getting quote smaller
and smaller until it disappeared from View and as Bud says you could see it
Accelerate from the standing start it was fast but it wasn't so fast that it
suddenly disappeared it was just super smooth so that would qualify as a close
encounter of the first kind a simple sighting and yet why was the UFO
behaving in the way it did was it there to inspect the sea planes was it there
to inspect the hospital perhaps it was picking up someone at the hospital I
think that's a possibility because there are many cases where UFOs have hovered over hospitals and cases in which
humanoids have been seen in hospitals I'm just speculating here trying to figure out why UFOs do what they do and
that's definitely a case that raises some interesting questions and so does this next one which I call the UFO that
listened this occurred on September 3rd 1955 in Cincinnati Ohio it involves two
witnesses who had a very close up sighting of a UFO that behaved in quite
an unusual way this very unusual case was investigated by well resected
researcher Leonard Stringfield it was around 9:15 p.m. on
the evening of September 3rd 1955 as Frank flag and his wife Ruth
drove along Boomer Road in Cincinnati about 3 miles from their home on Lakewood Drive now back in
1955 Boomer Drive had much fewer homes than it does today in fact it was a dark
street with few street lights so Frank drove pretty slowly and suddenly both he
and his wife were a aw struck to see a smooth gray metallic sphere descend
slowly towards the ground in front of them for a second they thought it might
be a balloon but they quickly discarded this Theory when they saw that this object was Flawless smooth with no
markings on it and it appeared to be moving in a very controlled manner not swerving at all they could see it had a
very smooth metallic surface which glinted in the Moonlight so Frank tried
to follow it but it quickly dropped out of sight behind a unlit house which was
only about 125 ft away so Frank drove up
stopped the car and leaving his wife behind he went over to the side of the
house to go investigate and see if he could find this thing and to his surprise he did this object was just
there by the side of the house suspended only one foot off the ground
so he's standing up right next to it and could see that this thing was about 4 feet in diameter a perfect metallic
sphere and he was standing there trying to figure out what this darn thing was
meanwhile back in the car his wife Ruth became frightened concerned about her
husband and she called out loudly to him and Frank says that at that exact
instant as if in response to Ruth's voice this object promptly Rose upward
in perfect silence and at a 45 degree angle and disappeared into the night sky
but he had the distinct impression that it had moved away in response to his
wife's call so that is admittedly quite a brief case again another simple
sighting but what was this UFO doing there and even more
interestingly did it actually respond to the wife's screaming out to her husband
it appears that it was listening to the conversation or certainly paying very close attention to the environment
around it which would make perfect sense I think they're probably watching very
closely over all of us and all things going on on our planet but still it's
another case that raises some questions why are UFOs behaving in these very odd
ways and here's another important case which I wanted to include because it
displays a kind of behavior in UFOs that we often see but it's certainly got a
lot of questions as to why and I call this one the Thirsty UFO this took place
on July 1965 in Hazelton this is in British
Columbia Canada it's a very remote area it involves two witnesses and
photographic evidence as well although we never did get to see the photos it's
quite a lengthy case in which a UFOs seem to show a great interest in
collecting water it was a sunny morning in July 1965 as John hembling who was a
geologist for a mining company was dropped off with his fellow employee
from a helicopter and Into the Wilderness about 70 M north of Hazelton
again this was a very remote mountainous area there were no roads or signs of
civilization around them and John and his cooworker were there to study the
feasibility of the of mining the mineral Rich area it was particularly rich in
magnetite and I'll just quote John directly about what happened next as he
says it was about 10:00 and we had just set up our equipment after the after the
helicopter left us when we saw a silvery object shining in the sun appear over a
small Ridge below us it had a flattened Outlook and our first reaction was that
it was some kind of delta wing aircraft we soon realized it was not it
was about 50 ft in diameter on top of its Dome there was a little knob and
around the base of the Dome there were circular markings below these on the face of the disc
itself there were larger rectangular markings which could have been glass or
metallic our impression was that they were Windows as far as we we could see
there were three of them as they watched the object moved slowly across the Ridge
and then over a tiny glacial Lake no more than 50 ft above the surface of the
water then out from beneath it what looked like a metallic pipe descended
smoothly down into the water now at this point they could hear a humming noise
and they said the disc remained there for about 8 minutes during which time
actually John's compion snapped several photographs they definitely thought it
was taking water but then without warning the disc took off and as John
says we had a distinct feeling it knew we were there it climbed slowly then all
of a sudden it was off it shot over the ridge made a sharp turn without skidding
and was out of sight in about 20 seconds it was very fast in fact the men
estimate that this craft moved at about a few thousand miles hour at least they
were astonished by the sighting they discussed it for the rest of the day and they were very eager to develop the
pictures and see if they came out but unfortunately John never got to see the
photographs as it turned out his coworker returned to the United States
and despite Jon's repeated inquiries about the photos he never got an answer
hopefully one day these photos will surface but with 70 years nearly having
elapsed it does not appear likely that these photos will ever be
seen whatever the case John speculates that the UFO may have been in the area
not only for the water which seemed apparent judging from Its Behavior but also because the area was so rich in
magnetite so that case would definitely be categorized as a close encounter of the second kind meaning that it did
affect the environment but the question is why did it want the water was it actually
collecting it as the witnesses seem to believe that it was I think it's a
distinct possibility because there are many many cases like that where UFOs are
seen sucking up water out of lakes so perhaps that's what's going on there or
perhaps like the witness speculated it was there because this is an area that's
very rich in magnetite and other minerals and in fact the witness was
working for a mining company and if you've ever watched some of my previous episodes including one
about UF uos over mines you know that UFOs are attracted to mining areas areas
that are rich and minerals of all kinds so perhaps that's what's going on there
I hate to speculate but it's almost unavoidable when dealing with these very unusual cases and here's another one
which I found quite poignant I call this one we want to watch flying
saucers I think this is probably best categorized as a close encounter of the fifth kind
but it's quite an unusual one which occurred in August of 1967 in the very small town of Duncan
this is located in British Columbia Canada and it's a really remarkable case
which I think you'll find quite interesting it was a warm night as clouse munter and his wife Peggy sat in
the living room of their home in Duncan listening to a Mozart Violin
concerto earlier that evening their 12-year-old son Leaf had announced that
he and his two friends were going to set up a tent and camp out in the front yard why because he told his parents we
want to watch flying saucers now Claus and Peggy had listened
to their son's announcement with Amusement but didn't really take it seriously and it was around 11:00 p.m.
as Clauson sat there listening to Mozart that klous turned to his wife and said
wouldn't it be something if the boys would see a flying saucer and it was shortly later that Leaf's excited
12-year-old face appeared at the window which faced the lawn and he shouted out
come quick a flying saucer he remained there only a few seconds before disappearing into the
darkness and of course both clouse and Peggy jumped up in Surprise
and I'll just let klous describe what happened next as clous says as fast as
we could we hurried outside and saw three small Silhouettes with heads bent
back and hands pointing Skyward they repeated the magic words over and over
again in seconds Peggy and I were briefed and quickly our eyes spotted the
object High amongst the eternal spheres no sound of an engine at a terrific
speed the pulsating light moved from north to south in a few seconds it
reached a point directly above us without stopping or reducing its speed
the pulsating light suddenly altered its course made a right angle turn and shot
away towards the east soon it disappeared so clous and Peggy could
scarcely believe their eyes the UFOs had showed up just as the boys had hoped and
both were absolutely amazed and as clous said rest came late that
night so that evening the boys lay in front of the tent watching the sky until they fell asleep K clouse was so amazed
that the next evening he pulled out a lawn chair grabbed a pair of binoculars
and sat in the front yard looking up at the sky in hopes that the UFOs would
return and to his amazement they did he was watching very planes move slowly
across the sky when it happened the UFO returned and put on an equally amazing
display in fact it was a little closer this time as Claus says as I turned my
head there it was again this time the pulsating light too fast to be focused
in the binoculars shot from the West seemed to fly lower than in the
previous night it followed a straight line and seconds later it it had zoomed into space and into the Maze of stars
the magic of unidentified flying objects had invaded our lives in a matter of
seconds in my mind I related other sightings in the Duncan area during the
past several years to our observation and my longtime conviction as to The
credibility of unexplained objects in the sky had received tangible proof
latest official findings on the UFO phenomenon cannot erase my conviction
that our planet is not the only spec in a universe too great for our minds to
grasp so yeah by all appearances that does appear to be a close encounter of
the fifth kind by that I mean a human initiated encounter perhaps
unintentional but it's certainly a remarkable coincidence that the witnesses went outside for the purpose
of seeing flying saucers and did see one and it's even more significant I think
that the UFOs showed up on the second night when the parents wanted to see UFOs it's a really interesting and
somewhat amusing case and here's another one which is just super compelling and
very strange indeed I call this one UFO inspects
Farmhouse UFOs do exhibit a behavior that is often very curious they show a
strong curiosity in humans in the environment and this case definitely
shows that off the charts it's a really unusual and extensive case which
occurred on February 19 1968 in Beno this is a small town in
Saskatchewan Canada and it's quite an extensive case with quite a bit of
unusual evidence as well and I think you'll find it very it was a cold morning about 11:45 a.m. on February 19
1968 there was snow on the ground as Martha hegs worked alone in the kitchen
of her modest Farmhouse her preschool AG son and two-month-old baby were in the house but
that's it her third older child was at school and her husband Lawrence hegs was
away from the farm and it was barely noticeable at first a
soft but high-pitched whining noise but very quickly this strange high-pitch
noise quickly increased in volume and intensity until Martha could feel a
quote tingling sensation throughout my body she said it was very similar to a
mild electric shock and wondering about the cause she looked at the south facing
kitchen window and saw a strange quote thing which was slowly circling over the
80t high Transformer pole and of course it was a saucer it was the color of dull
aluminum she estimates it was about 8 ft wide maybe 5 to six feet high and she
said it looked like quote two shallow plates placed lip to lip with an
inverted bowl or Dome the Dome itself she was about 4 ft wide on top of the
saucer of course and on top of this Dome was another tiny little bubble of a dome
with what looked like an aerial sticking up now the Dome on this craft had six to
seven fairly large Arch shaped Port holes round on top flat on the bottom
and they were spaced evenly around the perimeter of the Dome they were composed
she said of what looked like frosted glass they were not transparent the lower part of the craft
she said seemed to be composed of plates or had what look like seams that may
have almost been riveted together she's not sure about this but the craft she
says was large enough to easily hold two to four occupants
comfortably now as soon as this craft appeared Martha saw that their dog
immediately lay down in the snow and and covered its ears with its front paws so
it could clearly hear this loud whining noise and at the same time their 16 head
of cattle ran as one group to the cattle sheds on the southwest side of their
property this was very unusual the cattle never entered the sheds during
the day and in fact one calf which was well known to be very lazy moved faster
than Martha had ever seen it move before so as she watched this craft
hovered about 1 foot above the 80t high Transformer pole and get this proceeded
to circle around it in a counterclockwise Direction completing
four full rotations now the craft itself didn't rotate but it did tilt downward a few
inches in the direction of the turn so after circling this Transformer
pole four times the object then moved at a slow walking pace about 300 ft to the
South but still in the farmyard and then descended to about 3 ft above the ground
and proceeded to hover directly in front of three wrecked cars as if it was
inspecting them again there was snow on the ground and Peggy noticed that the snow directly
beneath the object remained unaffected at this point the object rose up
straight up about 20 feet and moved over to four grain storage bins and it
circled around them again in a counterclockwise Direction at this point Martha's
freaking out and she considered retrieving her husband's shotgun and actually firing at this object but
quickly decided that this probably wasn't a good idea as it might be considered a hostile act and could have
Danger consequences besides she felt at this point that the occupants of the object
did not appear to be hostile and instead looked like they were only investigating the
area so it was very clear however that the object was being intelligently
controlled she felt they were just snooping around the object then moved to
the Northeast where there were three more storage vins and two tractors
and the object did this strange circling motion again circled over the tractors
just at the height of the bins again in a counterclockwise Direction so after
apparently inspecting the bins and the tractors the object moved a little bit to the north and west to where there
were two parked trucks and two elevated fuel storage tanks standing on steals as
you can see here Martha quickly ran to an east facing wind window and watched
as the saucer circled over the fuel tanks moments later it moved over to
where there was an electric motor operated water well pump and about 8
feet of altitude it circled the pump so at this point she's standing next to the
only door of the house and she reached down and locked the door to the house as
if this is going to keep the ETS out but I don't blame her this was quite
unnerving for her so after watching this craft Circle the pump this craft moved
to the east where there was a wind break of trees and it began to follow the wind break rising to a height of about 12 ft
and once it reached the edge of the farm it turned left and followed the Hedge it
then made a right turn and finally exited the farmyard and proceeded slowly
North over the field moving off into the distance and was gone now the whole time the craft was
there it made this loud whining sound but now the saucer was gone and the
whining sound had stopped their dog immediately ran to the door and started begging to be let
in was 10 minutes later Martha's husband Lawrence arrived home and was puzzled to
see that the door was locked Martha of course let him in and he immediately saw
that she looked quote white as a sheet and he exclaimed woman what has happened
to you so Martha was still quite unnerved at this point she described the
encounter to her husband and she later told investigators that the whole Oreal
had left her pretty badly shaken particularly because she was alone in the house with her young
children it was about a half hour after the UFO left that the cows finally
exited the shed Martha called the police but they did not take her report seriously she tried
calling the radio station with similar results they showed no interest in her
sighting finally she found the Saskatchewan unidentified phenomenon
research group who agreed to investigate which they did and they found that this
sighting was unexplained they even asked the Neighbors about the hegs and learned
that they were both considered to be honest and sincere people the only other
effect of the encounter was that night Martha hegs said she had some trouble
sleeping and every little sound bothered her so a 20 minute long close-up
observation of a UFO is not easily dismissed this is a very typical animal
reaction case but boy why was that UFO so darn interested in everything on this
Farm circling around every little piece of this Farm it's very unusual but again
UFOs do seem to show a very strong interest in all things human and all
things Earth and here is another Super interesting case because people often
say why don't UFOs just land on the White House lawn well in this case it
came awfully close I call this one one UFO lands at Washington DC technically
this occurred in Bethesda Maryland but it's actually right on the border of
Washington DC and actually in Washington DC it occurred on October 24 1968 it's a
single witness case involving a paper boy who had one of the most unusual experiences of his life it was around 6:
a.m. on October 24 196 68 as a 16-year-old paper boy whose parents
insisted upon anonymity he was delivering the Washington Post on his paper
route and as he passed by Fort Bayard Park as you can see here located at the
intersection of River Road and Western Avenue right along the border of
Washington DC he saw a large metallic craft sitting
on the ground in the park he said it was only about 150 ft away when he first saw
it and he knew instantly it was a flying saucer he said it was quote disc shaped
with a cone shaped protrusion which rested on the ground it was quite large
about 17 yards across at the disc portion so the witness said that this
craft had a silver metallic surface the street lights were still on and he could
see that these lights were reflecting on the saucer surface it also had lights on
it dim red white and yellow lights which alternated around the perimeter of the
craft so this paper boy could hardly believe his eyes and as he said I just
stood and watched it for two or 3 minutes I wasn't really scared because
if there was anybody in that sophisticated craft they knew that I was was out there and they didn't hurt me I
did feel kind of numb all over just sort of stunned and I thought there's
somebody else here that's for sure but our astronauts wouldn't be scared if they saw life on other planets maybe if
they come here they want to see what or how we're doing so after studying this craft for a
few minutes the witness didn't want to but he left the area he vowed to return
as soon as as he could but as he says I had to deliver the rest of my papers and
when I came back in about 20 minutes the thing was gone he immediately walked over to the
spot where this craft had rested on the ground and he saw an unusual hole in the
soil 2 feet wide a foot and a half long and it was surrounded by a circular area
of scorched Earth 2T wide around the hole so the boy told told his parents
and together they contacted naikap the national investigative Committee of aerial phenomenon and they
reported the sighting and it was only six days later that a team of eight men
headed by Gordon lore began an investigation they first interviewed the
witness and then went to examine the site now interestingly the team did
include a gentleman from NASA and another man from the Library of
Congress they took samples of the soil from the hole for analysis and also
tested the area for radiation with a guer counter which came up negative
there was no radiation but this was 6 days after the incident however as
Gordon lore says we can't tell you too much about it right now as we haven't
put any label on it yet now the investigators did did ask
other people in the area and they found a bird watcher who said that the hole in the park had been there
previously so the investigative team approached the main witness about this and he denied it and told the
researchers and I quote my friends and I have played baseball and football in
that field for about 10 years and have never seen the whole
before so after interviewing this witness the investigators found him to be credible they called him quote a
stable young man they asked those who knew the witness and all of them said
that he was a reliable source unfortunately the results of the soil analysis have never been
released but interestingly there was a very high-profile case which occurred
only 2 and a half hours earlier when numerous Witnesses at Mano Air Force
Base in South Dakota which contained nuclear missiles they
observed a close up UFO including a landing this object was also caught on
radar was viewed by different groups of witnesses and again two and a half hours
earlier so that raises the question could there be a connection between these two incidents of course it's
impossible to say but it's certainly a remarkable coincidence and also
significant is the fact I think that officials from NASA and the Library of Congress took this report very seriously
even though is only a single witness case involving a young boy perhaps this
is because the UFO did land less than six miles away from the White House now
not the White House lawn but darn close I think that case has some very
interesting takeaways what the heck was it doing in in such an urban
area was it trying to be seen is it a coincidence that this encounter occurred
literally 2 and a half hours after the very famous encounter at the South
Dakota nuclear missile site uh it's also interesting that this case was taken so
seriously by highlevel government officials so definitely makes me wonder
but so close to Washington DC perhaps the ETS were trying to send a message I
don't know again I don't like to speculate but it's cases like these
which really make me wonder and here is another one which is
so interesting to me I call this one panic at the pool this occurred one day
in October of 1968 at the Resort town of ban this is
in Alberta Canada and this is a very interesting example of a UFO display and
although this is a simple Close Encounter of the first kind a sighting I think it's got some really
interesting things to say about how we humans react to a very close encounter
and it does have a slight minor appearance of humanoids it was one
evening in late October of 1968 that Jean Watts was working at the
cashier office at the upper Hot Springs pool at the S sulfur mountain resort in
B where she was employed suddenly the night Watchman came in and said he saw
something funny in the sky and that he thought it might be a flying saucer but
as Jean says we just laughed and didn't pay much attention but it it was three nights
later that Jean would pay attention and learned that UFOs were in fact a serious
matter and I'll just let Jean describe in her own words what
happened as she says I was sitting in the cash office thinking how quiet it
was all of a sudden and I said to the shift boss that's funny nobody's been
through here for about 20 minutes I went to the window and I couldn't see
anything but there was a strange silence all over you could feel
it just about then Lewis one of the attendants came upstairs from the pool
and said you'd better get down to the pool they're in a panic down there a big
light came shooting down from Mount Rundle it's a flying saucer or something
and the woman are screaming and hollering and some of them act Frozen they can't even
move now Jean had been trained in first aid and the attendant whose name was LS
Deo was hoping she could help with the situation as Jean says when I got down
to the pool people were running and splashing around and there were a woman crying some of them were in a State of
Shock a couple of girls about 17 or 18 were so frightened they had tried to get
out of the pool by climbing the brick wall that goes along one side one of the
girl's hands were bleeding quite badly now Jean didn't see the UF
her now Jean didn't see the UFO herself but after questioning some of the
witnesses and the attendant Lewis she got the whole strange story around the
time that the strange silence had settled over the area 20 minutes earlier
a weird glowing yellow object with red and green glowing lights on one end
appeared over the top of Mount Rundle which towered over the resort about one
mile away this light or this object whatever it was remained over Mount
Rundle for several minutes during which time everyone in the pool watched it
Spellbound and entranced some said it had other colored lights on it as well but suddenly the
object zoomed down in a curving motion into the valley and right up alongside
the pool before quickly veering away at this point some of the onlookers heard a
strange whining sound coming from the object but it was this dramatic maneuver
which caused a complete Panic among the people in the pool unfortunately as I said Jean didn't
get to see the UFO that time but it was only 2 years later on August 31st 1970
she was in town in B with her son and daughter when they all saw a green and
orange object she said it was larger than the full moon it appeared halfway
down the mountain and then zoomed down she almost thought it was going to crash and she's not the only witness to
UFOs in this area it was 1 month later at 8:20 p.m. on September 2 5 that
13-year-old Don mcra was at bamp and he saw what he described as a structured
object about the sze of a small house green in color with a dome on top he
said it made a high-pitched whining sound as it hovered nearby in the air
and it was close enough that he could see this object had four windows and
through one of the windows he saw two humanlike beings beings looking down
this object remained in view for a long time a full 5 minutes before finally
departing so there is a really good example of how frightening a UFO encounter can be it might be easy to say
oh I wouldn't be scared but when something comes zooming down so quickly from a mile away and comes right over
your head it might be a different story and it certainly was in that case it's such an interesting case because it was
Pro widely viewed it's not a singular event there's been a number of sightings
before just a few days before in fact in that case and sightings afterward
apparently there is something going on in the ban area it's quite a UFO hotspot
but that particular case is an outlier for sure I don't know of any quite like
it this could probably be categorized as a typical UFO display but I I doubt the
ETS were expecting that kind of reaction of total panic of all these people who
were swimming at a pool and just enjoying this time off it's amazing case
and here is another one which really raises some interesting questions and I
call this one Speedway drivers or deal by UFO this occurred on April 13
1971 in Brunswick this is in South Australia the in the country of
Australia of course and it involves a witness who is a professional Speedway
driver a racer and he had a harrowing encounter with his wife and young son on
a lonely Highway in Australia and it definitely makes me
wonder did this UFO the UFO occupants know that this gentleman was a
professional speed driver and is this why they behaved the way they did again
UFOs are well known for chasing cars down remote highways at night and in
fact there are hundreds of such documented cases this next one is one of
the most harrowing accounts of this kind the witnesses include Jeff Richards who
is a professional Speedway driver in Perth his wife Tony and their 5-year-old
son Mark was in the very early morning hours 4:45 a.m. of April 13
1971 and they were driving along Southwestern Highway there's this long
straightway just outside of Brunswick this is located about 90 to 100 miles
from Perth and this is when their ordeal began I'll just let Jeff describe it in
his own words as he says and I quote we had not seen another car for about 60
miles when we passed through Brunswick it was deserted shortly afterwards I
noticed a light in the rear Vision mirror I thought that any car which just
appeared like that would have to have been going really fast suddenly The
Light Came racing up to the car it appeared to be going about 500 M an hour
my wife screamed that it was going to hit us but it just stopped the light
stayed behind about 20 yards away for a few seconds then shot back onto the
Horizon behind us it began to glow red like a fire but then turned white again
and came at us a second time I thought it was going to go right through us this
happened about 4 four times then I looked in front and there was another
light right there it shot forward at us about head height at at the same time as
the one from the back was coming forward again the one in front came at us three
times and each time pulled up just short and darted back sometimes
disappearing so I don't know what kind of cat and mouse game this UFO is pulling but it absolutely scared them to
the extreme Richard's wife Tony confirmed all these details and as she
says what was so frightening was that when the one at the back turned from red
to White on the horizon we knew it was coming again it was not the kind of
light a car beam gives and I could look right at it without hurting my eyes now both Jeff and Tony were
immensely relieved when this object fin finally Departed the whole encounter took about 15 or 20 minutes Jeff
admitted that he had never been so frightened in his entire life what an
amazing case of a UFO car chase and again there are so many like it in the
literature but this one is definitely a notch above most of them with this UFO
coming over and over and over again straight at this car playing a game of
chicken why are they doing this is this a practical joke are they just showing
off does it have again anything to do with the fact that this guy is a professional driver I think these are
questions that we'll probably never know the answer to but it sure is
interesting here's another case which I find quite compelling it's probably the
least strange of all the cases in this collection which makes me laugh because
a UFO encounter What could be Stranger than that than seeing an extraterrestrial craft close up but
that's certainly what happened in this case which I call the 15 ton craft this
occurred one day or an evening actually in May of 1971 in Yugoslavia what we now call
Slovenia more specifically in the very small town of stara
surv what I like about this case it as it is it involves many witnesses and
some very compelling Landing trace evidence This truly amazing and very
strange encounter was investigated by muon researcher MOS crel muon of course
being the mutual UFO Network and this case involves a landed UFO which was
viewed very close up by several witnesses was about 8:00 p.m. one
evening in early May of 1971 as the primary witness Angela Raj aged 17 was
riding her bike along the road by the village of stara surv when as she says
and I quote I suddenly heard a strange noise something like a buzz so I stopped
and looked and to her amazement she saw a brilliant red illumination coming from
behind a nearby small hill so she got off of her bike and approached more
closely and she could see that it was a craft and getting even closer she saw
that this craft was sitting on the ground supported by three Landing legs
with little round pads on the bottom of each Landing leg this object was sort of egg-shaped
she says about 20 to 30 feet wide 9 ft high and it had a bright yellow
illuminated band circling around the circumference this craft was so bright
that it was Illuminating the entire area around it in this Eerie bright red
light and Angela she got close enough that she could actually feel the heat
radiating off the craft and she watched it for just a few minutes but it quickly
dawned on her that this was not anything normal and she became frightened and
immediately went home now as she went home she did keep looking back at this
object and was amazed to see it rise slowly up into the air and it was really
interesting how it left she said the landing legs retracted and they slipped inside the
craft so that you could not even see where they had come out and the craft itself began circling upwards in this
very strange upwards spiraling motion very slowly before suddenly darting away
at high speed needless to say she rushed home and told her mother and this is when she
got a surprise her mother had actually seen this craft earlier and she said it
looked like a red ball of light coming in for a landing just in the area where
her daughter had come from so they asked around and they found out that their neighbor a gentleman by
the name of elage Cris he and his brother saw the same craft a half hour
before Angela around 7:30 p.m. when it was already on the ground and in fact Al
approached very closely to it he said about 60 ft away from it and at this
point he saw that this was an extraterrestrial craft and he said he
became more frightened than he has ever been in his entire life and he's a combat
veteran so he immediately reported it to the police and in fact so did Angela and her mother
but the police refused to take any of their reports seriously and actually made fun of them laughed at them the
next day Angela and her parents they decided to go inspect the landing site
they were amazed at what they found these strange holes in the ground which were quite deep and about 6 to 7 in wide
now researcher Milos cre went and investigated and he says the
soil of that pasture is hard to dig out such holes there had to be a force from
10 to 15 tons of weight only such an object could have left behind such
traces I have to admit that is a pretty typical case of a UFO landing we would
call this a close encounter of the second kind because it did leave these really impressive land Landing Trace
cases but again what I like about it is it is a multiple witness case with
people who weren't aware that the other Witnesses were observing it at the same
time which of course gives it a lot more credibility and it was professionally
investigated by a very experienced muon UFO
researcher so I think it's a good case and definitely deserves its spot in this
little collection and here is another really remarkable simple sighting yes but wow I
call this case UFO blockade on empini
bridge this occurred on July 22nd in 1972 in the very small town of ash
Burton in South Africa this involves two witnesses well
actually four two are of who are police officers and it's a typical sort of UFO
landing but has some really unusual elements to it and I think raises some important questions as to why this UFO
was doing what it did as all these cases show UFOs sometimes behave in very
strange ways that is very hard to understand and a good example is what happened to two men driving along the
103 Road in ash Burton South Africa cup it was on the evening of July 22nd
1972 that Mr R Barker who was driving and his passenger Mr C mcdulin who is in
the front passenger seat they were just about to cross over the empini bridge
which goes over the empini river seen right here when they were confronted by
a very dazzling white light which had landed in the middle of the road on the center of the bridge blockading the
entire road now Mr Barker first thought this
might be another vehicle and as he approached closer he flicked his car
headlights onto high beams but he got no response so he drove right up to the
edge of the bridge and saw that he was unable to pass so he stopped his car and
turned off the headlights because it was clear to both of them at this point that whatever this object was it couldn't be
another car it was about the same size but it was blindingly brilliant as the
witnesses said quote like a huge neon light so the two men just sat there in
their car only feet away from this thing trying to figure out what the darn thing
could be and why it was blocking the road suddenly it shot straight up into
the sky at very high speed and vanished so that really shot shocked them really puzzled them and they
immediately reported their sighting to the police two constables by the name of
Chris clawen and Nico fory were sent to investigate and they arrived at the
scene within 30 minutes but by then of course the object was gone so they
turned around and were just over a mile away from the location when they noticed
a bright light hovering among some trees down in the nearby Valley they
immediately turned their patrol vehicle around and drove up this dirt road that led to the area so they could get a
closer look but as they approached the light quote went
out so they decided to go there anyway they explored the exact area where they
had seen this light disappear but they found no trace of it and they returned the next day and did another search but
still found nothing so what the UFO was doing in this area and why it had
blockaded the bridge remains a mystery and the only thing unusual about this
area is the presence of abundant wildlife and several nature reserves so perhaps this was the reason
the UFO came to visit there are quite a few cases of UFOs landing on the road
and blocking the way and this is a typical example which has a lot of
credibility to it because of the police officers that saw apparently the the same UFO shortly after the main
Witnesses but this still raises the question why would a UFO land in the middle of the road and block the way did
it need to land there for some reason could it be because this area does have
a significant Nature Reserve nearby UFOs do seem to show an interest
in animals as well so perhaps that's why it was there here I go spec culating
again very hard to say but it's an unusual behavior from a UFO to land on
the road where they have to know people are going to be driving by at some
point and here's another case involving this very unusual interaction between a
UFO and a vehicle I call this one UFO takes over truck this occurred on July
18 1976 in the very small town of gravel switch
Kentucky what's super interesting about this case is it involves well over a
dozen Witnesses um some who had very close interactions with this UFO and one
couple who had an interaction that involved this UFO apparently taking control of their vehicle I mean there
are a lot of cases again of UFOs chasing cars down roads and this sort of thing
but not nearly as many cases where the UFO basically takes control of the
vehicle and the witnesses who are inside the vehicle can't control it so in that
regard it's a very unusual case and definitely more than just a simple sighting the night of July 18
1976 would put the Tiny Town of gravel switch Kentucky on the map when at least
17 people reported seeing a UFO some however more than just saw it
they had a close encounter of a very strange kind and this includes Doris and
Charlie Gilpin who were driving through gravel switch around 1 p.m. when their
Journey was interrupted by an unexpected visitor who apparently took control of
their truck and I'll just let Doris describe it in her own words as she says
we were heading down the road and we looked up above and saw something hovering over the road and I said I want
to see what this is so we went on down and we got scared and stopped the truck
and about the time we stopped this thing started towards us this object I don't
know what it was and I tried to back up and the thing took control of the truck
the truck commenced swaying all over the road and I finally got it turned around
it seemed like something had a hold of the truck where we couldn't take off and we went up the road about A4 Mile and it
just headed over the truck right up through there and it seemed like something was holding us up all the time
I looked down and the spedometer said 70 or 80 but yet we weren't getting nowhere
fast and this morning I went back to the same place and it took 2 minutes or it
took 15 or 20 minutes to get there before when this object was over us it
seemed like this object was holding us back all the time so as this object was over them
frightened Doris finally turned off under the first driveway she saw it was at this point that the UFO apparently
released control of the truck but Doris and Charlie weren't taking any chances
as Doris says when I got out of the truck and ran toward the house to get up on the porch of the house the object had
gone up over the top of the house then and it was so close to the ground that I
could hear the humming sound of it and I could feel the breeze the air coming off of it but she was not about to leave at
this point and meanwhile Judy Taylor arrived at the house to drop off her
nephew Jackie Judy's sister lived at this house and they all saw this object
and as Judy says people ain't going to believe us but we saw it but it was just
round looking like a hornet's nest with red and blue and green lights on
it now Jackie the nephew he said he saw what looked like a door slide open
underneath this object as if someone inside wanted to appear outside as he
said it seemed to be kind of watching for something now Judy decided to wait until
this object was gone before leaving the house finally V ing outside she didn't
see the UFO so she started driving and to her dismay this object appeared again
and paced her car for quite some time and by this point people across Maran
County were flooding the Maran County Sheriff's Department with calls reporting this object and in fact the
reports continued until about 1:15 a.m. for hours before finally going
away and this object continued to appear over the next few days before finally
leaving for good now why the UFO took over this truck is anyone's guess why it was so
interested in the Tiny Town of gravel switch has yet to be explained but it
was certainly an event that would leave a strong impression on the residents there for years to come yeah that had to
be a really frightening and harrowing experience to have this UFO hovering
over your pickup truck and you're racing down the road and you can't control the speed of the
vehicle really bizarre and so interesting because this UFO remained
over that town for hours what the heck is it doing I don't know that's why I'm doing this research
because there are still lots of questions that need to be answered and here we go to the final
case of this collection and this is definitely an unusual case I called this
one missing time on the toilet yeah you heard me right this
occurred on March 13 1979 in Elver Thorp England and it
involves a gentleman who had a very unusual evening from the beginning to
the end and it raises some very interesting aspects to UFO encounters
that I think it's important people need to be aware of this very unusual case com from English researchers Nigel
Mortimer Martin Douglas and S Hart and the sole witness is a 28-year-old
electric engineer known only by his initials WP he requested anonymity and
it was around 8:00 p.m. on March 13 1979 that he set off to visit some
friends at a local pub but to his confusion he strangely found himself
taking taking an alternate and frankly illogical route through the wet and
muddy fields of Elver Thorp this was not the most direct way there so he has no
idea why he's doing this and he was halfway through the fields when he noticed a bright but unfamiliar Light
low in the sky he wasn't paying much attention to it he dismissed it at first
but very quickly it increased in size and came zooming towards him and it
quite frightened him he ran out of the field and onto the street where this Pub was and he could now see that this light
was overhead it was about 40 ft up and 100 ft away and surrounded by this
strange swirling greenish Mist he could see this object clearly enough that it
had gun metal gray and it appeared to be oval in shape he said it was about 25t
wide and 8 ft High low enough that it was nearly touching the buildings but he
noticed something else the whole area was strangely quiet and the street
itself seemed to be unusually deserted and here's where it just goes
from very strange to bizarre because seconds later and with no sense of any
transition Mr WP found himself in another place and looking around in
confusion he now saw that he was standing inside the public toilets next
to the pub staring in a trance at the outer wall with no idea how he got there
it was at this exact moment right when he woke up and realized where he was that somebody walked in so feeling
embarrassed and Confused WP went to one of the Stalls and relieved himself and
as he exited the bathroom the strangeness continued he went into the bar and he completely and promptly
forgot about this UFO sighting he had no memory of it whatsoever he does remember what
happened next the bartender said he was quote a lucky man as there adjustment of
power failure moments before he arrived but now the power was back
on so it was 3 days later that Mr WP
suddenly and spontaneously remembered this missing time UFO encounter
and he gives a very interesting description of how he remembered it as he says and I quote if you can imagine
that you have got a thought right at the back of your mind and you are very aware of the fact that something is there but
you don't bother to think about it rather like a lazy feeling and as if you
don't really need to remember what it is but he did remember and it was quite a
significant experience he was so confused by the whole ordeal that he
kept it entirely secret even from his wife who he finally did tell quite some
time later and it was after that that he did contact researchers and he actually
agreed to go under hypnosis in the hopes of recalling what happened during this missing time but he wasn't able to the
only other detail that he could recall was that this craft which had first appeared oval now looked much more like
a a classic Flying Saucer and the only other effect of the encounter was that Mr WP developed a
deep interest in UFOs and would often go outside at night with a camera in hand
with the hopes of getting some evidence cuz he was quite embarrassed that he had no evidence to back up his very strange
story now he did see a few strange lights over the years and once he says he became kind of hypnotized or
entranced by what he thought was a strange light hovering outside his bedroom window but ultimately he told
researchers that it could have been Venus he doesn't know he reports no other unusual encounters but the
investigative team was very impressed by his account and they called him quote an
honest and reliable man well that is clearly more than just a sighting given
that the gentleman did experience missing time and although he went under hypnosis and wasn't able to remember it
there are a lot of details that really Point towards this being more than just a sighting he talked about the Oz Factor
the Eerie silence that sweeps over an area when someone is very close to a UFO
all the traffic disappearing the power failure that occurred during the time he
was having his encounter so some very interesting elements and perhaps the
most interesting being how this encounter was was completely erased from his mind for 4 days and then he
spontaneously remembered and I love this case because he describes very vividly
how this memory came back to him that alone I think makes this case worthy of
Interest so there you go 12 very strange UFO encounters each exhibiting a
different aspect of UFO behavior and each raising
kinds of questions that we still don't have complete answers to there's a lot
to learn from each and every UFO case even if it's just a simple
sighting so all of these cases I think fall under quite a wide range of Cate
categories simple settings of the first kind the second kind and probably the Third Kind and at least one involving a
close encounter of the fifth kind I think that we could learn a lot
from cases like these and it's again a reminder that every single UFO case is
important so that's it for today I really want to thank you once again for watching you have no idea how much I
appreciate it I really do and until next time keep asking those difficult
questions keep searching hard for the truth and most important of all have fun
until next time thank you
that
