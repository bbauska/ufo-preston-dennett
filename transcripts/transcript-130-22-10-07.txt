50 EYEWITNESS DRAWINGS OF UFOS
Oct 7, 2022

Summary:
Oct 7, 2022
UFOs come in a dazzling array of shapes and sizes. Saucer-shaped craft, egg-shaped, spherical-shaped, teardrops, triangles, cigars...you name it! The true number of cases is far larger than most people realize. UFOs are seen all over the world by all kinds of people.

This video presents a decade of sightings, stretching from 1947 to 1957, all involving firsthand witnesses who provide sketches of what they saw. It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. And this is especially true when it comes to UFOs. Sometimes the UFO craft are so strange, unusual and unique, that people are unable to find the words to describe them. A simple sketch is not only helpful in describing a UFO, it is often essential. A drawing is able to convey information in a way that words simply cannot do.

Fifty cases with eyewitness drawings, each providing another piece of the puzzle, and each offering new insights into the nature and origin of UFOs. These cases show that the UFO phenomenon is global and ongoing. They also show how our own governments have attempted to cover-up UFO information, offering debunking explanations to encounters that they know are absolutely genuine. They show how the Air Force's Project Blue Book was not a true investigative body, but was instead an attempt to deny the truth about the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today's episode is called 50 eyewitness drawings of UFOs what I've done is taken a decade of 
sightings these are mostly from military Witnesses not all but a lot and most of these cases are a 
good portion of them were reported to Project Blue Book I wanted to do this episode because I 
think it provides some very interesting insights into the nature and origin of the UFO phenomena 
these cases all have first-hand eyewitnesses drawings to them this show how truly different 
many UFO sightings are with a wide variety of craft with different shapes and sizes behaving in 
many different ways I think these cases also show how truly common and widespread UFO encounters are 
and they also show how our government particularly our U.S government and Military has badly bungled 
their handling of the UFO phenomena and have done their best to lie and cover it up 
these are just a small portion of the actual number of cases I chose these ones which are dated 
from 1947 to 1957 because each of them do have first-hand drawings by the witnesses themselves 
and I think that's very interesting and it's just fascinating to see the different types of 
craft that people see and it's often been said a picture is worth a thousand words I think that's 
especially true when it comes to UFOs which are often very difficult if not impossible to describe 
any of these show your typical Flying Saucer some shows cigar shaped craft or egg shaped craft many 
different types of craft it's really amazing how many different types there are but some 
are also strikingly similar although they occurred very different times and places 
so that's why I wanted to do this episode for you today and let's just get started 
the first case I'd like to talk to you about today occurred on July 2nd 1947 in Lewiston Idaho 
this is at the very beginning of the Modern Age of UFOs really just days before the Roswell UFO 
crash and this particular sighting was investigated by Dr James McDonald a very 
prominent and pioneering UFO investigator and the main witness is a lady by the name of Mrs Berg 
she was outside her home in Lewiston Idaho out hanging clothes and was carrying baskets 
of laundry outside and she had been up until that morning very skeptical of all 
the news about flying saucers that was in the media and she wondered why she hadn't 
seen one and had resolved to keep an eye on the sky in case she had the opportunity and stepping out into her backyard she looked up and saw three objects she called out her husband 
and both of them watched these three objects which were disc shaped as she said like two hubcaps face 
to face and they were in a vertical position she had the impression they were spinning her 
husband disagreed but these three discs moved along maintaining a uniform distance and they 
said fairly high speed but occasionally dipping up and down as if moving along the surface of a wave 
so these objects moved Eastward until they finally disappeared towards the southeast 
and Mrs Berg thought of running into the kitchen to get some uh binoculars or some dark sunglasses 
rather which would enable her to see them against the Sun but at this point they disappeared 
and they estimate that they watch these objects for about three minutes they were silvery in appearance and glinted in the Sun but as they were watching them more witnesses 
did come outside so it wasn't just the Bergs the other Witnesses included their daughter was in 
junior high and a friend who was visiting in addition two of their neighbors the Joe 
lifts heard them talking and came out to watch and their other neighbor Mrs Sergeant came out 
and all of these Witnesses saw these objects until they quickly moved off into the distance
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred just about one month later this was on August 13 
1947 also in Idaho this was in Twin Falls Idaho and there were three Witnesses a farmer and his 
two young Sons aged eight and ten they were at a fishing camp and it was about 1 pm when the farmer 
went to look for the two boys he had sent them to the river to get some tape for his boat and 
this is when he noticed an object about 300 feet away and about 75 feet above the ground uh this 
was below the canyon walls which were about 400 feet high and he was really impressed by the way 
this object was moving it was as he said hedge hopping or following the Contour of the ground 
it was sky blue in color about 20 feet in diameter and 10 feet thick so not terribly large 
and it had little pods on the side from which it appeared Flames were shooting out 
it made little noise except for a swishing sound but he did notice that the trees were highly 
agitated by the craft as it passed over and it turns out his two sons also observed this object 
but it was only in view for just a few seconds before it moved off but long enough to leave 
a deep impression on them and as you can see from the drawing these look like your typical 
uh well not your typical but a very unusual shaped craft
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred the next year on July 24 1948 over Montgomery Alabama 
and this case became very very famous and it's very well known in the media 
this involves two pilots who saw a UFO from their airplane and it nearly collided into them that was 
their impression the Pilot's names are Clarence Chiles and John witted and it was 2 45 when it 
was kept in Childs who first saw what he called an unusual light dead ahead of him from his cockpit 
and it appeared to be closing rapidly and it was moving so fast it was leaving a glowing streak 
so he turned to his crew member John witted and said look here comes a new army jet job 
that was his first impression that this was some sort of new experimental aircraft 
but as this object began to speed directly at them in a slight dive and growing rapidly 
he was suddenly hit with the overwhelming Sensation that this object this light whatever it 
was was about to collide into them head on so we quickly took his DC3 plane into a bank to the left 
and at the same time he said this strange object turned to its left as if to avoid the airliner 
and John wooded looked out the right side of the windows as this object streaked by he said it was 
no farther than a half mile off their wing tip which is very close for aircraft and maybe about 
500 feet higher than their plane and he said it looked like a hundred foot long rocket ship right 
out of a Buck Rogers comic strip it had two rows of brightly lit windows or ports of some kind and 
the bottom of the craft glowed a strange bluish color and they could also see that there was an 
exhaust plume on its tail which was very brilliant and almost caused their night vision to go away 
and they watched this thing disappear as it climbed up into a Thunderhead 
it was only in view for about five seconds it took them a few moments to recover their composure 
and Clarence Childs the other crew member decided to go into the passenger cabin to 
see if anyone else had seen this thing only one had a gentleman by the name of Clarence McKelvey 
who was an editor from Columbus Ohio uh he was one of few passengers who were awake at that hour 
and he told Clarence witted or rather he told John witted that he had seen only 
a quote strange Eerie streak he said it was cherry red in color but he saw no major detail 
so this was a very well verified case the Witnesses are pretty much unimpeachable with 
a lot of military flying experience and as soon as they landed they talked to reporters and the 
incident became Front Page News across the country the next day and is now considered a classic case
just a few days later on July 31st 1948 there was an incredible sighting in Indianapolis Indiana 
this was in the morning at about 8 25 a.m when an electrician by the name of Vernon swigert 
and his wife where he was standing by an open window in his home shaving when this object in 
the sky attracted his attention he rushed to the kitchen to alert his wife and they both looked out 
the kitchen window and got a good look at this object which they said had a smooth surface and 
was shaped they said like a symbol they estimated this object was about 20 feet in diameter and 
maybe about six to eight feet high in its Center its highest point but not much larger than being 
able to carry perhaps one person according to Vernon this object was flat white not shiny 
and this thing passed at a high speed on a level Eastern course and shimmered in the Sun as if it 
were spinning he estimates it was about two thousand feet in Alta altitude he heard no 
sound there was no exhaust Trail and they were so impressed they reported it to the Air Force 
at this point Project Blue Book was not in operation but it was called project Grudge and they were beginning to collect UFO reports so they made the drawing you see here
and it was just three months later on October 1st 1948 when there was another incredible 
sighting over New Orleans Louisiana what's interesting about this case is the witness 
described this object as looking very much like a giant ice cream cone and he made a 
report to OSI agents of the fourth Army Branch intelligence office in New Orleans Louisiana 
and according to the report and I quote the witness stated that on the morning of October 
1st 1948 he was squirrel hunting on his property and he had gotten up very early in the morning 
at this particular time it was too dark to go into the woods hunting but was light enough to see what time it was by his watch and at 5 40 a.m he was looking to the south at the sky and saw the 
aerial object which he described as follows it looked like an ice cream cone he said traveling 
toward the East with the larger end in front at the front it looked as if it were white hot 
like the mantels in a gasoline Lantern and towards the rear it got gradually darker red 
there was no visible metal or other material and no projections of any kind only fire 
the object made absolutely no noise and left no trail of any kind 
I was traveling on a straight line from east to west and did not gain or lose in altitude 
he saw no visible means of proportion he estimates it was about three quarters of a mile away and at 
an elevation of about 2 500 feet and as he says I watched this object for approximately 10 seconds 
before it was obscured by some trees it appeared to be about the size of an average airliner and 
was traveling at approximately 300 miles per hour the larger end of the cone appeared to be thicker 
than the average airliner is through the fuselage but it was about the same length the object 
displayed no lights other than it appeared to be encased in flame and it did not light up the area 
the there was no visible means of support and no control surfaces that he noticed so after 
investigating this the Blue Book Intelligence Officers decided that this was a meteor 
case number 174. though the witness disagrees and believes that this was not a shooting star 
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred just 14 days later on October 15 1948 at Fukuoka Japan 
and this is a very interesting case in which two Air Force pilots basically interacted with 
this UFO and sort of a cotton mouse game and I'd just like to quote one of the Air Force pilots 
first and uh as he says and I quote my radar Observer and myself were flying 
a routine Airborne alert Mission approximately 50 miles out to sea Northwest of Fukuoka Japan 
we made our first contact with Airborne radar set with a Target we assumed to be a P-51 
we attempted a practice interception but the target put on a tremendous burst of speed and 
dived so fast we were unable to stay with it and at this point the intercepting aircraft 
was traveling at approximately 300 miles per hour and descending at 3 500 feet per minute 
this was a head on interception and when this Targets target passed under us we executed a 
chandelle back to our original altitude of approximately six thousand feet our second 
target was immediately picked up on the scope and a Stern interception was attempted but the 
aircraft immediately out distanced us at this time we were puzzled by the tremendous births of speed 
the third target was spotted visually by myself I had an excellent silhouette of the target thrown 
against a very reflective undercast by a full moon and I realized at this time it did not look like 
any type of aircraft I was familiar with so I immediately contacted My Ground Control station 
and asked for information regarding any aircraft flying in the area I informed them of what I had 
seen and was in contact with them from then on the fourth Target passed directly over my ship 
from Stern to bow at a speed of rustfully twice that of my aircraft of 200 miles per hour I caught 
just a fleeting glance just enough to know that he had passed me and the fifth and sixth targets 
were attempted radar interceptions but their High rate of speed put them immediately out of range 
the only aircraft I can compare are targets to is the German me 262 but it was not an me262 or 
similar jet and his co-pilot the other member of his crew was Barton halter a second Lieutenant he 
was the fighters radar operator and he agreed that this was unusual and as Barton halder halter said 
we dived in an attempt to follow it passed beneath us and was gone I was notified by 
my pilot that we were diving at a rate of 3 500 feet a minute at 300 miles per hour 
I'd intended to ask the pilot to peel off after it split but it was gone too fast 
the next or second interception was from the rear of the target as was the first however 
the target added a burst of speed dead ahead and out distance us immediately and on the 
third interception my pilot called a visual at 60 degrees port side and by this time I 
made the pickup it was at 45 degrees Port 3000 feet and five degrees below my pilot 
made a rapid starboard turn in an attempt to head off the Target by the time we got 
a start of it it was off again in a burst of speed and disappeared between 9 and 10 miles 
and then the fourth interception the pilot called me called to me that we had been passed from above 
from the rear by our Target I picked up the target as it went off my scope from 5 to 10 miles dead 
ahead and slightly above and on the fifth and sixth interceptions the target appeared at nine 
miles doing approximately 200 miles per hour then with the burst of speed the target pulled away to 
the outer limit of my set which is 10 miles for Airborne targets this took approximately 15 to 20 
seconds and in my opinion we were shown a new type of aircraft by some agency unknown to us 
so they were absolutely puzzled they do not believe this to be any conventional aircraft and they reported it to their superiors in the Air Force
the next case I'd like to talk about took place the next year actually on January 1st 1949 over 
Jackson Mississippi now what's interesting about this case is the Commanding General at right field 
intelligence in Ohio displayed a strong interest in this case and they conducted an investigation 
and took first-hand testimony from the pilot the witness who says and I quote my wife and 
I were flying from Gulfport to North Jackson Air Park and we were approaching the airport 
our altitude was about 1800 feet when I saw something go in front of us I assumed it was another plane since it was headed towards the municipal airport in Jackson 
and was on the Eastern leg of the Airways I watched the object to try to recognize the 
type of plane and after it passed it made a turn of about 50 degrees and headed Southwest 
and as the object made its turn it was then that I noticed the object didn't have wings 
at that time my wife saw the object and became excited she is a private pilot 
and familiar with plane identification from the air and when it crossed in front of us 
I estimate the speed to be about 200 miles per hour and about 500 feet in front of us 
so this is very close much too close for this to be another airplane and as the witness says we tried to point out the object to the pilot but he thought we were 
trying to show him something else and as the object turned and went to the Southwest with a 
sudden burst of speed it was out of sight in all I saw the object 10 or 12 seconds 
so they reported this to the predecessor of Project Blue Book this is case number 233 
in the Air Force files and their official evaluation of this report says and I quote 
there is nothing in this incident that can be said to have an astronomical origin which 
is in other words saying that this was actually some sort of structured craft of Unknown Origin 
so a very interesting case and it was that same month on January 27 1949 that there was another 
incredible sighting by an Air Force officer and his wife between Cortez and braderton Florida 
this uh Air Force officer had an engineering background and was actually assigned to the 
air material command intelligence Department and for a half an hour on that night January 
27 these Witnesses watched something very strange moving around the sky and they described this as 
an object that was resembling a cucumber in shape but had a double row of Lights 
uh they said it had the appearance of quote a row of lighted windows but brighter 
and as this thing moved off into the distance it became smaller and looked very much like a ball of 
fire and they could see what appeared to be sparks flying from it they described this as Sparks like 
from the burning log but the thing is these were appearing in a rhythmic pattern at this point 
it was pale red and the Air Force's summary says that this was exceptionally bright at Split Second 
intervals and that during the second sighting of this object the Sparks appeared more pronounced 
and were apparently pulsating at approximately one quarter second intervals and as the witnesses 
watched this object appeared to bounce up and down as it climbed rapidly and Faded off into 
the distance until it was a tiny point and then was gone so a very unusual object to say the least
just three months later on April 28 1949 there was an unusual sighting at Fort Bliss in Texas 
what's interesting about this case is the Witnesses were all Military Officers 
and they cited what they described as a flat shining object stationary in the sky 
so being Military Officers they reported this and all seven Witnesses submitted visual Impressions 
drawings of these objects and as you can see these drawings are all very similar 
so it's clear that they saw something they did not think it was a weather balloon however 
when the Air Force investigated it it turned out that the sky hook program had just started in 
White Sands several days prior to this sighting and these are giant balloons some 150 feet in 
diameter to test the upper atmosphere and the investigators concluded that this is probably 
what the witnesses saw but they're not sure because there were a number of other sightings 
at that time involving objects that were moving in ways that is not explainable as a balloon 
so there's some controversy or confusion about what these were and now we move on to the next 
case which occurred just one month later on May 24th 1949 this is at Rogue River Oregon 
and this involves a very unusual looking object but the Witnesses are almost unimpeachable there 
were five people in a group who saw this object in the air over Rogue River and two of them 
were actually aeronautical engineers and these Engineers approached the security officer at Ames 
who was a representative for the national advisory committee for aeronautics so good Witnesses and 
they were eventually interviewed by project Grudge investigators all five witnesses were questioned 
and all of them gave identical accounts and one of the witnesses says and I quote while fishing 
with a party of friends about two and a half miles up the Rogue River at approximately 5 PM on May 
24 1949 my attention was called to an object in the sky the object was to the east of my location 
with the naked eye little but a glare and a silvery glint could be seen But after watching 
it for approximately one minute and a half I was handed a pair of eight power binoculars and it 
was then possible to see that the object was roughly circular in shape and appeared to be 
30 to 35 feet in diameter it had somewhat the cross-sectional appearance of a pancake being 
thicker in the center than at the edges and a small triangular fin started approximately in 
the middle and grew gradually higher to the rear as the object traveled when first cited the object 
was moving slowly but as I watched it through the glasses it picked up speed and when it vanished 
from sight approximately 90 seconds later it was traveling as fast or faster than a Jet Plane 
as far as could be seen it had no openings or protuberances of any kind other than the fin 
and there was neither sight nor sound of any driving force so again a very unusual object
this next case occurred on November 30 the same year 1949 over Lexington Nebraska 
and this was not only investigated by The OSI district office of the U.S government 
but was also investigated by investigators Jay Allen heineck who was newly the astronomical 
consultant for Project Blue Book and later investigated by UFO researcher Jan Aldrich 
so an official report was filed by The OSI agents and one of the main Witnesses was Dean Wolfe 
he was a farmer there were several witnesses but Dean Wolfe had special training 
and according to the report by The OSI and I quote the men were threshing grain in an open field 
Dean Wolfe first noted the objects coming from the southwest and called his helpers attention to 
the airplanes as objects came closer it was noted that they were not of conventional airplane design 
and Dean Wolfe was a recent graduate of a two-year course of aeronautical designing 
and he said he first thought the objects were f-80 aircraft but as the objects moved he 
realized that the objects had performance of an f80 but did not have the design 
Dean Wolfe executed a free hand drawing seen here of what he believed the object looked like 
Dean Wolfe said the objects appeared to be drifting towards them over a low line of 
Hills seemed to pick up speed at which time two of the objects left a trail of Sparks 
as the objects approached them the lead and number two objects criss-crossed positions 
with the number three maintaining its position in the formation the objects 
then executed a 19 degree turn away from Earth and climbed straight up disappearing from View 
a dazzling brightness was noted from the objects and was believed to be a reflection until it was 
realized that the sun was almost on the horizon and the objects were going away from the Sun 
so this was clearly not a conventional plane and researchers later learned that there were in fact 
other Witnesses including Mr and Mrs Don balheim of Lexington Nebraska and their daughter Janet 
they were at their home standing in the front yard and saw these two objects which they said 
were traveling very fast they estimated was about a mile of altitude 5000 feet and uh they looked 
much bulkier than a conventional aircraft they said maintaining the straight and level flight 
until suddenly turning away from the earth and going straight up like Dean wolf and the 
other Witnesses said and they said that they noticed what appeared to be a trail of Sparks 
so they were not aware of the other Witnesses and this is a multi-witness case and as you can 
see from these drawings a very unusual object all right moving along now we move to March 15 1950. 
when Dr Craig Hunter was driving on the Hudson area on Highway 153
all right and now we move to March 15 1950. this case took place in Penfield Pennsylvania the main 
witness is Dr Craig Hunter who is driving along Highway 153 and as he drove up this Mountain Road 
in a sparsely populated area a warning light when on his Dash and the cars uh and a meter indicated 
that the battery was discharging so he parked and got up to check under the hood to see if there 
was an electrical short as he's poking around inspecting the wires leading from the battery 
another truck with a farmer pulled up a Mr Jaeger and he introduced himself and offered to help 
and they're looking at the engine when both men heard this weird odd hissing and whistling sound 
and looking up they saw what they described is a weird machine with a dirty aluminum grayish color 
it coasted leisurely into view soaring very low level about 350 feet above the ground 
they said there was no way this thing was a balloon he estimates that this object was 
a hundred feet or so in diameter and about 30 feet thick so we turned to the Mr Yeager and uh 
told him to look and Mr Jaeger looked at the object stared in disbelief for a few 
seconds then gassed my God jumped into his truck and drove away at high speed terrified 
Dr Hunter however stood his ground though he did later tell investigators that he was quite 
frightened but overcoming his fear as best as he could he studied this strange object and noticed 
three concentric circles on the underside that appeared to show a slowly rotating inner ring 
and he thought perhaps he was looking at a radically new type of military aircraft 
but as it passed out of sight he realized that this was probably one of those UFOs that people 
were talking about and he felt it was his civic duty to contact authorities so he called the local 
newspaper the Saint Mary Daily Press who was very much impressed by his story and uh after 
talking to the witness they realized that this was probably a UFO and put his story out on the 
AP Newswire and this caused a lot of publicity and Dr Hunter's phone began to ring constantly 
and he got many other calls from people but the one that really gave him some comfort was 
other Witnesses who were in the area at the same time and some of them were in a plane and they 
saw what they described as a shiny disk in the air and also there was a large group of people on the ground who also observed this object so he was not the only Witness by any means 
now here's another really fascinating case which also took place in 1950 just 
five days later on March 20th this took place in the city of Stuttgart Arkansas 
and this is a really good case because it involves Pilots uh who were actually flying at the time 
it was Captain Jack Adams and his co-pilot G W Anderson 
who were flying uh they're playing it's flight 53 at 9 30 PM their plane was at about 2 
000 feet altitude on the southwesterly course over Arkansas and when it suddenly 
Captain Adams noticed a bright light in the dark sky and as he says and I quote 
the light had an unusual bluish and Brilliant glow flashing on and off far more rapidly than 
the normal blinking of civilian aircraft lights so he nudged his co-pilot and said my God what's that 
and uh his co-pilot Anderson took a look at this object which is apparently coming 
straight at them with great speed this was a very bright light he said flashing every three seconds 
and uh they thought that this light was actually on the top of a flat round object because as 
they watched it crossed right in front of their airliner at an altitude of about 1 
000 feet higher than their plane and as it did so it tilted at an angle so that only its Underside 
was visible and at this point they could see 9 to 12 glowing ports on the underside these ports 
gave off a soft purple fluorescent light and as Captain Adams says although the object was 
moving at terrific speed the pattern was clear and constant it did not change shape as it darted past 
the night was dark but clear and visibility was perhaps 40 to 80 miles we could see no portion of the object other than the lights 
so they were convinced that this was not a meteor but some sort of craft about 100 feet in diameter 
and as Captain Adam says we kept this object in sight for about 45 seconds until it disappeared 
from sight and I would estimate that it was traveling between 500 to 600 miles per hour 
they asked if any of the passengers confirmed the sighting and uh Captain Adams said we didn't 
tell them because we didn't want to alarm them but they did contact Little Rock Tower 
to report their position and added that a quote Flying Saucer had just zoomed past 
well researcher and news commentator Frank Edwards heard about this and managed to contact Captain 
Adams while he was still airborne and Frank Edwards recorded this conversation and played 
it back over the air on the mutual radio network and the broadcast was a huge sensation captains 
Adams and Anderson became instant celebrities and by the time by the time they landed 
representatives of the United press were there in large crowds to question both of the pilots 
both Pilots said that they were absolutely convinced that they had witnessed the flight 
of an actual mechanical device which they thought might be a secret American experimental aircraft 
they were aware of the recent Air Force statements that dismissed UFO reports 
but they declared that it would be hard to fool them with all their flying experience 
as and pilate Anderson said we've heard and read a lot about flying saucers and were as skeptical 
as anyone else but when you see something with your own eyes you have to believe it 
we were flabbergasted so upon Landing they were approached by Air Force investigators 
and they discussed the UFO sightings for a few minutes and the Air Force officers told them 
that they had probably just seen a meteor and this shocked and angered the pilots 
however ultimately the Air Force records this case as unidentified and in support of this case 
besides the two pilots other Pilots came forward with seeing apparently the same object in the 
sky and these include Captain Paul W Bennett and first Officer William tuero who's saw what they 
described as a quote bright and strange object in the distance off of Greenwood Mississippi 
and the pilots said they didn't want their friends kidding us about flying saucers but they did tell 
the press and they said that the saucer remained in view long enough to call their stewardess 
Patricia Hicks and she pointed it out to several passengers as it turns out one of their passengers 
was a captain his name was Captain Tommy Bridges so this sighting created a lot of attention 
and sparked interest Nationwide and in fact Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt the Widow of 
the late president even invited the two pilots to appear with her on television 
and this caused a lot of commentaries so news commentators were very popular people 
like Walter Kiernan Drew Pearson and Fulton Lewis Jr took time out to comment about this sighting 
in fact another problem prominent gentleman w h shippen did a piece about the Air Force 
and their attempts to hush up Witnesses so this was great Vindication for major Donald 
Kehoe who had recently been denounced as a rumor monger and now people were beginning to listen 
to Donald Kehoe who is today considered a true Pioneer and hero in the UFO field 
all right moving along to the next case which occurred on May 29 1950 over Washington D.C 
this was about 50 miles Southwest of Washington DC when an American Airlines pilot Captain Willis T 
Sperry was cruising along at 8 000 feet in his dc-6 when his attention was diverted as uh he 
was looking at a map and his co-pilot Bill Bates caught sight of a brilliant blue glow and thought 
a collision was imminent so he yelled watch it watch it Captain Sperry quickly looks up grabs 
the controls and jerks The Airliner into an Abrupt turn as this strange glow zoomed directly toward 
his plane and as it approached they could see that this was a brilliant bluish fluorescent light 
and after returning to a straight course and Gathering their wits 
Captain Sperry and his co-pilot saw this blue light now appeared to be Motionless 
it was about 25 times the magnitude of the brightest star in the sky but after a moment 
this blue light started to move passed right in front of the Moon which was full at the time 
and Captain Sperry his crew members Gates and the flight engineer Robert arnholt all could see a 
silhouette and for about 10 seconds they watched this object hovered motion motionless and then 
they saw that it had a cigar-like shape as it moved forward and as Captain Sperry says 
and I quote when the object first appeared coming toward us I started to turn to the right then when 
it changed its course to parallel us I started turning to the left so as to be able to follow 
its path even so it went to the rear of the plane circled around to the right far enough so that 
first officer Gates saw it on his side before reversing its direction and going out of sight 
so he immediately radioed Washington Tower but the controller's there so that they did not 
see anything they did alert the press and the next day reporters questioned Captain Sperry 
and instead of being ridiculed by his fellow Pilots they actually approached him and insisted 
on having a serious discussion about what they called The Flying Saucer problem and in fact 
one of the pilots said that he had seen something just 400 miles to the south on that same evening 
uh this was a pilot by the name of Henry H Myers who is actually Franklin Roosevelt's personal 
pilot during World War II and he described seeing an object which he thought at first was a shooting 
star however this object dropped down out of sight fell a distance and then moved horizontally 
so he doesn't think it was a meteor and neither do uh Captain Sperry and uh Mr Gates 
and in fact a spokesman for the American Airlines reacted to Captain Sperry's description of this 
UFO's astounding speed and expressed amazement noting that this object being 
able to Circle a 300 mile per hour airliner twice demanded an engine of incredible power 
so a very good case and it remains unexplained to this day 
the next case I'd like to talk about took place on February 10 1951 over Argentia in Newfoundland 
the main witness is Lieutenant Fred w Kingdon Jr of the U.S Navy 
and on the day in question while serving as second plane commander on flight he 
says quote I was an eyewitness to an unusual sighting of an unidentified flying object 
we were at ten thousand feet altitude cruising on a true course of about 230 degrees my attention 
was first called to the occurrence by Mr Bethune this is one of the crew who asked me to look at an 
unusual light which was to my right I then saw that there was a glowing light beneath a thin 
layer of stratoform clouds beneath us this was to my right and down at an angle of about 45 degrees 
the subject appeared to lie on the surface and was throwing a yellowish orange glare through the cloud deck it appeared appeared to be very large and then I first thought that it could be a 
large ship completely illuminated Mr Bethune and I watched the object for several minutes and trying 
to determine its net nature we then called our Navigator this is Lieutenant Koger to the cockpit 
to scrutinize the object and render his opinion as to its nature while further observing the object 
I saw that it suddenly started ascending through the cloud layer and then it became quite bright 
the object was very large and was circular with a glowing yellow orange ring around its outer edge 
the object appeared to be climbing and moving at tremendous speed and it appeared to be on a more 
or less Collision Course with our aircraft when it appeared that there was a possibility of collision 
the object appeared to make 180 degree turn and disappeared over the horizon at terrific speed 
during the course of events Lieutenant Jones had come to the cockpit and he made a turn 
in the direction of the object but it went out of sight in a short period of time the speed was tremendous and the size was at least 200 to 300 feet in diameter 
the object was close enough to see and observe it clearly and my first view of it resembled a huge 
fiery orange disc on itch on its Edge as it went further away the center became darker but the edge 
threw off a fiery Hue and when it went over the horizon it seemed to go from a vertical position 
with only the trailing Edge showing in a half moon effect so when the plane landed in Argentia 
the pilots were interrogated by Captain Paulson of Pepperell Air Force Base and navy Commander 
weemeyer and of the Navy Men He later one of the Native men said of the questioning 
the types of questions they asked us were like Henry Ford asking about the Model T you got the 
feeling they were putting words in your mouth it was obvious that there had been many sightings in 
the same area and most of the observers did not let the cat out of the bag openly when we arrived 
in the U.S we had to make a full report to Navy intelligence and I found out a few months later 
that Gander radar did track the object in excess of 1800 miles per hour so despite this that this 
object was on radar they could see its size 300 feet in diameter it was clearly a solid object 
the Air Force concluded that what these Pilots had seen was Northern Lights this is typical 
of how Project Blue Book is trying to lie and cover up these UFO events absolutely ridiculous 
another very interesting case occurred on April 16 1952 in Yuma Arizona the main Witnesses in 
this case were Lieutenant Gerald Williams and his date Sally Ann Diggs who it turns out is the 
daughter of Colonel Edward R Diggs than the newly commanding officer of the Yuma Air Force Base 
and as Sally and Diggs says and I quote no detail could be forgotten from that night in April 1952. 
it was a calm night hot as usual for Yuma Arizona my date Lieutenant Gerald Williams and I had gone to a drive-in movie 
the first feature was approximately one half finished when I decided to get out of the car on an extremely bright light caught my eyes from an angle to the right side of the movie screen 
the object which emittedly light was one of the most awe-inspiring sites I have ever seen I stood 
looking transfixed for I have never seen anything like this it was quite quite large appearing to 
be the size of a car it was beautiful in a weird way the shape was that of two gently sloping bowls 
each with rims to the other and bottoms circular and flat it almost seemed to be a portion of the 
landscape for it was not very high in the sky and its form was completely illuminated by its own 
lighting system the top portion rotated ever so slowly and I would not have noticed any movement 
if what may have been scars indentations or some type of markings had not appeared and disappeared 
it was possible the lower portion moved also but I did not feel that it did the center rim or ring 
housed the yellow and Rose Red pastel lights which completely bathed the object in light 
with all the car windows open and the volume of the car speaker is on it would be impossible to 
say for sure that there was no sound but I do not believe that there was any it merely sat there and 
the top moved slowly so she called it for her boyfriend to come outside and he also saw it 
and he said I've never seen anything like that in my life my God it was huge so they tried to alert 
some other people in the theater but nobody saw it and they ended up going home and telling her 
father again the Commanding General of Yuma Air Force Base and he demanded that someone 
investigate and they sent over an officer who attempted to explain away their sighting as best 
as he could with the Commanding General there uh but this sighting was very well verified 
and in fact just a few days after that there was another sighting over the same drive-in theater 
I did cover this in more detail in my book UFOs at the drive-in and in a prior YouTube episode 
but years following the incident researcher Richard Hall working for nycap confirmed this 
incident actually writing to Colonel Edward R Diggs who confirmed the report and had little 
to add other than it caused quite a stir among those present at the drive-in theater at that time 
all right moving along I mean there's so many cases June 21st 1952 this is over South Texas 
Sergeant Howard Davis was on an Air Force training Wing as a passenger in an aircraft passing over 
South Texas again on June 21st when he witnessed an extraordinary spot of light flashing downwards 
he only got a brief glimpse of a brilliant object but he guessed it was about three feet by three 
feet and was trailing a tale of Sparks at least 15 feet long so the they thought this could possibly 
be a meteor but it's clear from the drawing that this was not a meteor and Sergeant Davis himself 
was convinced that he had viewed an actual machine whose shape and you know the glow around it 
he believed held vital Clues as to its power and its origin it's an unusual case for sure 
and here's another case involving your typical ice cream cone shaped object this occurred on 
July 13 1952 over Dayton Ohio and as you can see from this drawing it's very unusual this drawing 
was made by Ray Ellis who was then president of the Rubber seal products in Dayton Ohio 
and on July 13 he saw this thing which he described as looking very much like an ice 
cream cone it appeared overhead at about 12 25 a.m and as he got a close look at it 
he could make out a quote a Hemi sphere of white light in front of it in the elliptical dark object 
in the center where the ice cream would meet the cone and the rest of it a bright light
so this is one of several cases in which UFOs are described as looking like an ice cream cone 
investigators now believe that this is probably just in effect of people 
seeing a disc shaped object enveloped by a sort of plasma field trailing behind it 
hard to say but it's definitely a very interesting sighting moving along 1952 
was a huge year for UFOs it was just one week later on July 20th 1952 at around midnight when 
a farmer in Madison Florida was checking on some piles of tobacco stored in a shed on his property 
and looking out the window he caught sight of two quote somethings suspended in space 
he was so amazed by this site he yelled to a farmhand standing nearby and they both 
ran out to the window peeked out and the farm had said Lord Mr Woodson what is that 
for the next four minutes the two men stared at this glowing oblong objects they were very 
curious and we're not sure what these objects were going to do because they were just sitting there and finally one of these objects quote switched on a light and then it began to move horizontally 
and Mr uh Woodson the farmer was absolutely convinced he was watching something quote uncanny 
and he watches these object creeped forward and it didn't go far before it went back towards 
its companion stopped for an instant and then shot straight up out of sight seconds later the 
other object which had been still the whole time quickly zoomed upwards following the first object 
so clearly unexplained and it was just 11 days later on July 31st 1952 when there was another 
sighting this time over Passaic New Jersey and this sighting got a lot of attention because 
the Witnesses were able to take photographs there were two gentlemen one by the name of John H Riley 
and his friend George J stock and they saw this large gray desk about 30 feet in diameter 
with a large Central Dome hovering 200 feet off the ground they were able to take seven 
pictures with a Kodak duoflex camera and they said this object was traveling Southeast at a 
leisurely speed appearing to come to an almost complete stop when it came very close to the 
man as if posing it hovered for a few minutes the entire sighting lasted about seven minutes 
and John Riley says and I quote it was so near it could have been hit with a rifle it made no 
sound and appeared to tilt as though to observe the ground before speeding off to the Southwest 
now although the pictures were actually taken by George stock there was controversy that followed 
when John Reilly took these pictures and brought them to the New Jersey Morning Call newspaper 
office and they contacted major Herman at right field because they were amazed at how phenomenally 
clear these objects were and were convinced they were genuine and when John Reilly was 
questioned about it he insisted that they were genuine even when he was threatened with arrest 
but as it turns out George stock took the photos they are now considered a classic 
and I'm not sure who provided the drawing here I believe it was George stock 
there's some controversy about that but as you can see it's a very well verified case that most 
researchers to this day believe is genuine all right moving along 1952 again a very big year it 
was just two weeks later on August 15 1952 when two men in White Cloud Michigan were on a small 
boat casting for black bass on Diamond Lake this is again outside of the city of White Cloud was 
9 15 p.m when they saw something weird streaking overhead and one of the fishermen he was a pilot 
and familiar with jets and had attended aircraft recognition classes and he knew instantly this 
was not a plane and that he was looking at an actual UFO and he yelled To His companion look 
and as they watched this thing came out of the Northwest and disappeared to the South 
and it was in view of the estimate for only about five seconds but it was very low passing overhead 
at a mere 800 feet high and maybe about a thousand feet away the estimated speed is 
about 700 miles per hour so quite fast and the pilots estimated that this object was about the 
same size as the future Solage of a large aircraft and he was very much impressed by 
the fluorescent blue-green glow it can it gave off so he did provide a drawing for Air Force 
investigators and it turns out that there were 20 other people on the lake at that time plus 
residents in the area who also saw this object so it's a very well verified multi-witness encounter
just a short time later August 24th 1952 and this time over Tucson Arizona at 5 40 pm there 
was an amazing event which an object was seen a hovering overhead and then was seen shifting 
position in this weird wavering dancing motion and the witnesses watch this object as it flew 
towards the west and they described it and I quote the lower one-third of the object appeared to be 
surrounded by a misty substance less brilliant than the object itself and the lower extremity of 
the sphere protruded below this Halo so as you can see from the drawings a pretty interesting object 
here's another case which was investigated by Project Blue Book and this took place in Turkey 
this was on September 25th 1952 and this is in the Blue Book files and it's quite brief 
because the information on this was pretty much unreadable but what was readable was a 
few things that the appearance of this object was definitely saucer-like and that the source of the 
report was three U.S Air Force non-commissioned officers so good Witnesses and they estimated 
that the speed of this object was 1 000 miles per hour so very fast and that it flew in a very 
erratic flight path unable or not matchable to a conventional aircraft so it's a brief report but 
quite interesting and they were able to provide drawings so I did include it here in this list 
okay one month later October 22nd 1952 it was a huge disc seen over Laurinburg Maxton Air Force 
Base in North Carolina an air policeman by the name of Bernard De Monte was walking to his guard 
post at around 10 10 p.m when he heard an odd dull monotonous tone coming from above was a no noise 
he'd never heard before and looking up he saw a huge circular object which he estimated was 
between 100 and 150 feet in diameter and he said it was covered with colored steady glowing lights 
he saw two red lights along the Leading Edge and some 8 to 12 green ones on the trailing Edge 
and he said this disc flew around the earth air base in a huge Arc at very high speed 
and it was gone out of sight before he could summon the Corporal of the Guard 
and so a statement was written up for Project Blue Book he confirmed the unusual droning sound 
and the Corporal of the Guard said that he was actually lying awake in his bump when he heard 
the Drone and like Damonte he could not associate with any jet aircraft and it was Damonte who ran 
into the room and said that this object whatever it was was actually round and the Corporal of 
the Guard ran outside but whatever it was it had already gone but he did see it from 
a distance of about two miles as it moved off but at that point he could not see its shape 
so this was a pretty interesting case and as you can see from this drawing what's very 
interesting is the very first pass this object made was straight down the main Runway of the 
Laurinburg Maxton Air Force Base and they believe that this was absolutely a classic 
Flying Saucer not only because of its shape but they saw these lights in a circular pattern
the next case I want to talk about is quite brief this occurred on December 22nd 1952 the 
last one of the year and this occurred in Banning California the main witness is an 
instrument technician who is driving his car at around 7 30 PM not far from an Air Force Base 
and stopped to watch as a saucer-shaped object darted upwards from left to right then leveled 
off at a high rate of speed he said it was glowing white but what was very interesting 
he watched this thing roll over tumbling at least three times and each time he could see 
that one side of this object was bright red and this object began to move upwards he watched it 
for about 15 minutes until it finally rised up so high it appeared to be a star-like object and then 
moved higher higher up until it disappeared so obviously your classic Flying Saucer 
uh the next case I'd like to talk about occurred just a few days later this is on January 1st 4th 
1953 and this occurred in O Galley Florida the witness is anonymous uh it's a lady and she 
said that she cited an object that resembled the Davis aircraft wing he did not see any fuselage 
this was quite low she's estimated it was about 500 feet or less in altitude and flew very fast 
about 500 miles per hour she saw this object only very briefly for two to three seconds as 
it approached from a North Northwest Direction in a slight turn and departed to the South Southwest 
but she heard no sound and she actually was able to see it because the lights from the neon 
signs at the Westchester Motor Court actually illuminated the lower surface of this object 
and the witness says that she saw at least four and not more than ten blue lights on the lower 
surface as you can see on this drawing so this was a very clear night there was no wind and she says 
the witness that this object was within 250 to 350 feet of her very close as it passed overhead
this next case is very interesting because there was numerous Witnesses all of whom are very 
familiar with aircraft this occurred just two days later on January 6 1953 at Dallas Fort Worth Texas 
wileen Moore was a towerman at Love Field and he drew a sketch of what he saw he said this object 
flew at about 2 000 feet for five minutes and finally moved straight upwards at hundreds of 
miles per hour there was another witness Linwood Martin an amateur astronomer who viewed it to a 
telescope and he said that it quote had swept back wings with a red glow towards the front 
the wings were blue and the center white it moved forward and backward and seemed to be 
going higher all the time there was another witness a Mr fetchenbach who is an air traffic 
controller who viewed it through binoculars and said that this object seemed to hover east of 
the field before moving off and in fact as he watched it a number of Pilots gathered in the 
control tower and watched it and they all agree that this object at one point was moving about 2 
000 miles per hour and moved upward to an estimated they think one hundred thousand 
feet in altitude before disappearing into the distance so clearly not a normal aircraft 
we had nothing that could go that high and then disappear up into outer space 
next case I'd like to talk about occurred that same year on April 23 1953 in Addison New York 
the main witness is a 29 year old forest ranger and he was in the habit of looking out of his 
window to check for forest fires and looking out his window he saw a glowing lens shaped 
object darting across the sky so he actually Drew this object for Project Blue Book investigators 
and he described it as lens shaped he said it was highly polished silver and so bright that it 
lit up the ground below it it moved so quickly that it left what appeared to be a black line 
trailing behind it and it quickly disappeared into the clouds to the west and was gone
this next case the location is unknown it's not reported but occurred on June 24th 1953 
and was reported to Project Blue Book by weather Observer Richard a hall who made a sworn statement 
and he was actually watching a balloon through a theodolite this is a telescope which is used 
to track objects and observers can triangulate an object and estimate its size and altitude 
so he's watching this balloon through the theodolite when that balloon actually burst 
and where this balloon was he now saw a glowing red somewhat triangular shaped object which he 
said was at least eight feet wide so quite small but it was the movement that really 
impressed him as he said it was making and I quote slow circular movements such as a loop 
and as you can see from this drawing these are movements that are absolutely unconventional 
and according to Richard a hall this object picked up speed and gained in 
altitude until again it looked like just a little dot in the sky and disappeared upwards 
so what this was I don't know but clearly wasn't a weather balloon 
and the witness Richard a hall absolutely does not believe that this is a balloon because he 
was tracking one through a theodolite when this balloon actually burst and in its place was this 
object so perhaps it was investigating the balloon I don't know but it's a very interesting case 
here's an equally interesting case which occurred at Point Magoo in Southern California 
on December 16 1953. this is of course a very active area in the Santa Catalina Channel 
and the flight crew of a Navy Super Constellation wv2 aircraft we're doing a test fight and had 
just reached 20 000 feet when someone said look out there's a flying saucer 
and as one of the witnesses says and I quote I looked out the windshield towards where Roy 
was pointing and I saw some sort of an object at approximately the altitude we were flying 
so they tried to overtake this object but this object easily out distance them and all the crew 
members made official statements testifying to this sighting and the pilot himself after landing 
made a sketch which he provided to investigators and it turns out the next day they discovered that 
there were numerous other Witnesses in the area who saw it some from the ground and they were 
using actually binoculars so this was a very well verified multi-witness sighting the next case I'd 
like to talk about occurred on November 6 1954 one year later in Newcastle Delaware and again this 
involved two military Witnesses U.S army corporals by the names of James schmow and Robert G Hoffman 
they were driving at 8 30 p.m in the evening and I will just quote James schmow directly as he says 
first they saw these objects and as schmao says I told Bob to pull over because the objects were 
definitely foreign to me I rolled the window down and watched the objects cross the road slowly 
the objects stopped and changed position they were in a trail formation and changed side to 
side and continued this way until out of sight Robert Hoffman also gave a statement and as he 
says and I quote we first saw them coming from the left across the highway and we couldn't decide 
what they were we stopped and washed them from the car while they went on to Fade Out of Sight they 
appeared as a brilliant glow with a haze of light below Center and blue lights on the perimeter 
so they thought the sighting was over but it wasn't because moments later the objects reappeared and started circling behind them then back in front and then stopped and shot 
up super fast actually sending down a beam of Light which struck the ground 
both men could hear at this time a low drone or throb and as Robert Hoffman says I could 
almost feel vibrations in the ground they were impressed enough where they submitted a report 
to Project Blue Book who refused to label the case unidentified and called it possible aircraft 
this again shows Blue Book their reluctance to label anything unidentified even though 
these two officers were trained and saw this object from very close up 
this next case took place on December 6 1954 actually over a period of two days 
this was in Sheboygan Michigan the witness is anonymous she was in her home when she saw UFO 
but it was the next evening when she saw this saucer-shaped object hovering about eight feet 
above a lake off Orchard Beach she watched it for nearly 10 minutes she says as it started 
back and forth much faster than a jet and she at this point could see that it had two tiers 
of Square Windows along its side which was going so brightly it was hard to look at now she watched 
it it Rose straight up and disappeared and she reported it to Project Blue Book 
all right next year 1955 February 15. this is at Green City Missouri 
the witness is anonymous he was traveling East on Highway 16 about four miles west of the town of 
Green City was a clear day there was little wind the sun was very bright and he was approaching 
this flat stretch of road when he knows through the driver's side window a large metallic disc 
was quite low about 500 feet above the ground and he estimates about one mile away 
I'm looking at it he saw that this was a disc about a hundred feet in diameter 
12 feet in thickness and had what appeared to be several windows or portholes he watched it but 
did not stop to observe this object and lost sight of it as the road dipped he proceeded to the town 
of Green City and reported to the editor of the local paper who did report it to the Air Force an 
investigating team came over and interviewed the witness and had him sketch the UFO so they went to 
this area but found no evidence of this object but as you can see from the drawing it's quite unusual 
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred on June 20th 1955 just a short time later and 
this was over Dallas Texas and the witness in this case was Captain Richard s Berry of the 
U.S Marine Corps who actually did postgraduate work at Duke University and was very familiar 
with the latest aircraft and he told Air Force investigators that what he saw was very strange 
he was out with his neighbor a Mr Stewart when they saw a dull red object blowing in the sky 
and as they watched it started changing colors to white yellow and dropping in altitude 
and then they watched this object hover and then move faster than any jet could across the sky and 
it stopped and hovered again so he was very much impressed so Captain Barry ran inside to get the 
binoculars and observed this object through the binoculars and could now see that this was a 
round flat object at this point was glowing red he saw three lights alongside the edge 
this object moved off and a few minutes later appeared again this time showing only a line of Lights it left and returned a third time and this time he again saw the shape of the 
object in the line of Lights as it darted away for good and he made a report for Project Blue 
Book and provided a description and a sketch of this object which as you can see is quite unusual 
it was just one month later on July 25 1955 over Patterson New Jersey when 19 year old Daniel K 
sitting in a local park and he saw what he described as a peculiar object gray 
metallic shaped like a cylinder with a circular ring running horizontally around the center 
and according to Daniel this ring had a rotating light on it and as he watched it moved off to the West until it was just a dot in the sky remained there for 
about 10 minutes he says that there were other Witnesses in the park who also saw it and he 
reported it to Project Blue Book and provided this sketch that you see here of this object 
all right more cases to share this next one occurred on August 1st 1955 over Willoughby Ohio 
the main witness is Mr shenaman and he was driving up to his house when he saw this 
strange saucer-shaped object dropped down and it moved so fast he thought at first it was a plane 
about to crash into his home and his wife and children saw it and they thought the same thing 
but instead this object was not a plane it stopped and hovered about 60 feet over their garage 
they could now see that this was a disc about 90 feet across it had bright red and green lights but they quickly switched off at which point they 
could see a domed body with a long flat dome in profile that had many tiny points of lights on it 
and there was a sound it emitted which the witnesses compared to the hum of an electric fan 
and as they watched this ship quickly darted over to a nearby clump of woods 
where paused for another five minutes before drifting away at leisurely speed 
so it was about a year later when air force Project Blue Book agents found out about this case 
and by this point it had already been investigated by other researchers Donald Kehoe and they knew 
about this case and they wrote that in view of the fact that Mr and Mrs shinaman repeated 
almost exactly the story submitted in the UFO case dossier it appears that Mr shenneman is 
familiar with known types of aircraft and that he's still seemed frightened almost a year after his sighting the undersigned investigator was left with the impression 
that the witness is sincere and truthful and that he did see something unusual and unknown 
all right the next case December 21st 1955 this one occurred over Washburn Maine 
and the main witness is Roberta V Jacobs who she says she saw this object which was shaped very 
much like a flying fried egg uh she described it as a disc with a cupola and she washed it as it 
descended out of the sky to a position just above the roof of a snow-covered Barn she was struck by 
the gold appearance of this object's surface which she said was indescribably beautiful 
she was actually getting ready to go to bed when the whole farmyard lit up which caused 
her to look out the window and see this quote saucer-like craft it was revolving at high speed 
and giving off a brilliant light and at this point she said strange Sensations came over her 
she felt nauseated and had the distinct impression that this object was occupied and that the 
occupants inside this object knew she was looking out the window and were able to read her mind 
shortly thereafter this object streaked silently away and she felt that this object moved away when the thought crossed her mind to telephone for help 
so it's a brief sighting but very close up of a classic disc 
all right moving along to the next year May 6 1956. this occurred over Oklahoma City 
Oklahoma the main witness is a lieutenant an engineer from Tinker Air Force Base 
and he observed an object which he said was shaped very much like a soup bowl or a teacup 
he said it was intensely bright orange colored and rimmed by little lights that were far too 
numerous to actually count he said it was stationary in the sky when he first saw it 
but then it quickly darted rapidly to the North in a strange zigzag motion 
you could hear no sound and he said this object was Far brighter than any other object in the sky 
he was able to use binoculars and to this object was very sharply defined you wash it for about 
10 minutes from his house and as it started to move away he actually jumped into his car and followed it and he reported it to Blue Book officers and later other Witnesses were located 
so again this is a very strange case which does not match any conventional aircraft and 
shows those weird slight variations that we see in a lot of these cases 
all right June 27 1956 over Jamestown Ohio a family of four was drawn outside of their home 
around 225 in the afternoon when they saw a craft rising from the trees near their home 
they had the impression this object was actually landed they did not see it on the ground but it came up out of the trees and hovered at Treetop level it was quite close and was totally silent 
they said it was round about the size of a small car with a canopy or a bulge on top and 
as they watched this craft moved very quickly in a steep climb upwards then went vertically 
straight upwards and was gone in seconds one of the children said it looked quote like a button 
so I like this case because it's a solid object seen in daylight very close up 
and moved in a way that is absolutely not attributable to any known aircraft
just two or three months later on September 2nd 1956 a night Watchman from Dayton Ohio 
had a very interesting sighting he was at 19 years old and also a college student and he reported his 
sighting to the Air Force and I'd just like to quote him directly as this witness says and I 
quote I first saw this green object while making my last round at 4 30 a.m as night Watchmen at the 
Dayton Country Club it seemed to be hovering above the ground moving slowly towards the clubhouse 
where I was standing I flashed my five cell flashlight on the object when it was on the far 
end of the grounds but nothing happened later I went out on the grounds to see what was happening 
I heard or smelled nothing as the wind was blowing towards the object was moving towards the house 
at a very slow speed it was about 15 to 20 feet wide and 8 to 10 feet thick and was in oval shape 
this object came to 150 feet or less of me when I flashed my light at it again 
it disappeared from sight in an instant without moving away 
we have a dog in the stable just to the right of where I spotted this object that was howling something terrible normally this dog is well behaved and doesn't bark much I might say after 
this thing was as close to me as it was I was very frightened the object laid everything around it 
and was about five to six feet above the ground so that's low very close and clearly unexplained 
all right just a few more cases on September 15 1956 a couple was driving in the early morning 
upon near Salem Indiana When They Came Upon a UFO as the woman says and I quote at first I 
was too startled to speak at all I stared unable to believe my eyes thinking I must be mistaken 
but no there it was so I stammered to my husband look out there quick do you see what I think I see 
he took one look and brought the car to a stop we sat there on the hilltop and stared I said amazed 
why it's a fine saucer isn't it and my husband was a very conservative answered well it certainly 
appears to be something like that so they watched this in absolute Fascination they described it 
as looking very much like a metallic yo-yo they saw a line which ran around the perimeter of the 
object out of which came wisps of smoke or vapor this object undulated up and down in sort of a 
wavering motion and several cars were passing by they tried three times to stop other cars each car 
stopped took a look at the object and the drivers of the car sped away in fear the couple themselves 
so that they felt no fear but were just super interested to see that this object was so close 
and they watched it for at least five minutes when it suddenly turned on its side 
in a vertical position and darted away at super high speed so fast it almost appeared to vanish
this next case I'd like to talk about is very interesting and quite bizarre this occurred in advance in France on April 14 1957 was 3 P.M when two women Mrs Garcia 
and Mrs Rami were walking along Route d24 just to the east of Vassar karami 
and suddenly at about 100 meters from where they were standing 300 feet they saw this 
very strange metallic object which had landed on the ground they described it as dull metal 
in color and cone shaped with the nose of the operas apparatus vertically pointed downwards 
and this object seemed to be maneuvering to land and at this point they heard a deafening noise 
and this noise it turned out was actually being made by a metal traffic sign that was being 
you know vibrated by apparently the presence of this object was about five meters away from 
this object and was oscillating and a vibrating so violently that they feared it might actually 
come loose and they screamed in fear and surprise which actually alerted a third Witness 
a beekeeper who came running out in time to see this object take off and as it did it shook 
this sign again very violently police were called they found clear Landing traces Project Blue Book 
came in and after investigating Without Really any investigation they called it a hoax even 
though there were multiple Witnesses and Landing traces Jay Allen heineck absolutely disagreed as 
did other French investigators who believe that this case was 100 percent genuine it's 
another example of our own government basically lying about UFOs and trying to cover them up
here's another very interesting case which occurred on July 30th 1957 
in Galt Canada this involved a young teenager by the name of Jack Stevens who at 10 30 in 
the morning was walking with his dog in a rural area when he saw a star-like light in the sky 
and as he washed this light swooped down at which point it revealed itself to be a metallic saucer 
uh he estimates it was about 30 feet in diameter Chrome colored and had a row of glowing portholes 
or openings you heard a low throbbing noise he said this object glowed red and was surrounded 
by a bright orange aura and this quite frightened him and he was rooted to the spot at the same time 
his dog began whining and barking and groveling and he watched this thing for almost 45 minutes 
uh it was some distance away not far a few hundred feet and after 45 minutes or so this object rose 
up and left and he ran home and told his parents who could see that he was quite emotional about it 
and later they went to the site and reportedly there were some very interesting marks in the 
ground there appeared to be several three toad footprints on the ground 
so this case caused quite a sensation it was published in newspapers and was never explained 
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred exactly one month later over Odessa Texas on 
August 30th 1957. five kids were out playing one afternoon and one of the 
children a 12 year old noticed a strange object stationary in the sky almost directly overhead 
and the kids were amazed and curious because it was unlike anything they'd ever seen before 
they became very excited and they dashed inside and demanded that the grown-ups immediately go 
outside to see this object and at first the pleas of the youngsters were brushed aside 
with the remarks that the object was probably a weather balloon and not worth the trouble 
so the children ran back outside this object was still there the 12 year old discussed the object 
with his 13 year old sister and they thought it was unexplainable although they were young 
and didn't know that much they were absolutely impressed the other kids were about age 7 and 10 
and didn't really know enough to be good Witnesses but the 12 year old said that this thing looked 
exactly like a flying saucer even though they did not know what a flying satso even looked like 
but the girl never forgot that sighting and never saw anything like it again and it was 
many years later that she wrote to Dr J Allen heineck and she wanted to share her encounter 
so she told Dr heineck of Project Blue Book at that time that there was only a slight Haze in the 
error at that time the object was quite close it appeared to be metallic and never moved while it 
was being observed and it eventually Blended back into the sky as the sun dipped below the horizon 
so they watched it for quite some time and the parents never came out and saw it 
just goes to show you should listen to your kids when they say there's a UFO hovering outside 
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred on October 7 1957 outside of Los Angeles California 
off the Angeles Crest Highway this is a pretty remote area near the national forest there 
a man and a woman were driving when they saw a cylindrical shaped object which they estimate 
was about 3 000 feet high and they watch this object as it moved across the sky for about 10 
minutes until it disappeared and he says that quote we were in a State of Shock at what we 
were seeing to keep in an accurate account the size was close to a thousand feet or maybe eight 
or nine hundred feet the shape was cylindrical and came to a point at the bow at the stem was 
the most curious of all a glowing ball above the hull which appeared to have no Connecting Point 
which you can see from the drawing that they provided this ball of light pulsated about 60 
times a minute so once every second and it was between light blue and white they said it went 
to white as it pulsed but this object had Port lights or Windows they weren't sure but they 
were round and large and as the witness says I didn't count them but I estimate 15 or more 
and they were very large whatever they were the subject was close enough that they heard what 
they thought was a slight humming noise they were very impressed because there were snow Flames no engine that they could see no wings no visible people and was almost totally silent 
all right the next case I'd like to talk about uh just a few more this one occurred on November 
7 1957 over Montville Ohio the main witness is Olden Moore he was driving at night when 
he saw what he first thought was a shooting star until suddenly it split into two pieces 
one piece went straight up and the other swooped down towards him revealing itself to be a saucer 
and he watches this object came lower and lower appearing to come right towards him he stopped his car and watched this thing hover about 200 feet overhead and then it 
came in for a landing in the field about 500 feet away as old and more says and I quote 
I stood by the car watching the thing for some 15 minutes before I started to walk towards it 
so he left his car and walked about 300 feet towards it until he approached within 200 feet 
close enough that he could see that this was in fact a metallic saucer was surrounded by this Haze 
or the sort of mist he said it was bright it looks like a mirror like Chrome and it was standing on 
these tiny little legs he was concerned he decided it was too dangerous to approach any closer 
but realizing how strange this was he decided to quickly jump back into his car and drive the 
short distance home to get his wife so he could see it but Upon returning the object was gone 
they did report it to investigators who questioned people in the area and found out 
that there were electromagnetic disturbances one lady at the time of this sighting in the 
area was trying to watch TV and she says every channel was completely distorted and she ended 
up turning off the TV and discussed and just went to bed so it's a really good case I mean 
this thing actually came in for a landing you saw it within 200 feet and clearly not explainable 
and the last case I'd like to talk about occurred on December 16 1957 over Long Island New York to a 
lady by the name of Mrs Starr she woke up late one evening when light flooded her bedroom and looking 
out her window she was shocked to see a 30-foot long gray craft with portholes hovering five feet 
above the ground right outside her window outside of this object were two figures walking around 
they were very strange looking with uniforms and helmets and weird heads they seemed to 
be carrying trays she watched a third figure come out of the object she watched this for about five 
minutes at which point the figures entered the object which rose slowly upwards and darted away 
no noise was heard at any point so again another very unusual case as you can see from her drawings 
so honestly I could list hundreds upon hundreds of other cases but you get the idea 
contact is very widespread it's occurring all over the world these cases are just from 1947 
to 1957 a 10-year period and as you see from all these drawings there's quite a bit of variation of 
these objects and yet at the same time many of these descriptions are almost exactly the same 
so this shows that the reports are widespread it's clear our own government is lying through their 
teeth about them but I think the most important takeaway is that these are real UFOs are real it's 
clear people are seeing solid structured objects that are not from here all right that's it some 
50 cases evolving eyewitness drawings of UFOs and again as you can see there is a dazzling array of 
different types of craft being cited of different sizes and shapes and behavior and maneuverability 
and so forth being cited all across the world again this is just from 1947 to 1957 alone a 
very small representative sample of the actual number of cases but enough to show that contact 
is truly widespread much more common than people realize happening all over the world and of course 
still happening to the present day and I think these cases also show how our government has 
really mishandled the UFO phenomena that every opportunity to be truthful and transparent and 
forthcoming and they have not been so I really wanted to do this episode today to let people 
know exactly what is going on behind the scenes our government has known for 80 years that this 
is a real phenomena and despite even today their unwillingness to call this extraterrestrial I 
think they know full well exactly what's going on here so that's why I want to do this episode 
for you today I truly appreciate you watching so thank you very much for that and until next time 
keep searching for answers keep searching for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
