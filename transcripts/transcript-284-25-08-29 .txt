DON'T BE SCARED: TEN VERY STRANGE HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Aug 29, 2025

Summary:
Aug 29, 2025
Cases of strange humanoids come from all over the world. They have been reported by a wide variety of people for over 100 years. The huge number of cases represents the best evidence that something very profound is happening here. The video presents 10 cases, each of which shares remarkable commonalities but also have unique details of high strangeness. These cases have volumes to teach us about the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, such as who these beings are, where they come from and why they are here.

I BEHELD AN INCREDIBLE THING. Security guard Francesco Rizzi never believed in UFOs, but at 2:20 am on December 17, 1962, he changed his mind. He was guarding a textile plant in the heart of Milan, Italy, when a craft dropped from the sky and hovered mere feet above the ground. A short humanoid emerged and began to make weird hand signals for Francesco to approach. A second humanoid appeared calling the first one back inside, and the craft took off.

A NICE LITTLE MAN. Throughout October and November of 1965, a massive UFO wave struck the city of Mogi-Guacu, in Sao Paolo, Brazil. There were thousands of witnesses, but only a few saw humanoids such as one farm family who seemed to be a target when craft landed at least twice on their farm, humanoids came out and gathered samples from the ground. It was one of many other humanoid cases in the area.

I WILL DENY IT. One night in October 1968, a pastor and three female high-school students drove along a remote road near Hastings, North Dakota when a UFO began to pace their car. The two girls in the backseat watched excitedly as they saw short gray humanoids looking down at them. Strangely, the pastor and the girl in front refused to even look. The UFO followed them for several miles then quickly darted off.

NO SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION. On the night of October 1, 1975, two young men from Hakushu, Japan took a drive into the foothills of the southern Alps. Right after parking their car in an empty parking lot, one of the men saw strange humanoids around the car. Suddenly the car was drawn backwards several times. They drove off in fear. They returned later and the same thing happened again.

DON’T BE SCARED. At age 7, David woke up in the bedroom of his home in Plattsmouth, Nebraska to see a gray alien staring at him. It told him, ‘Don’t be scared, turn around,” which he did. When he looked back, the gray was gone. He woke up his brother who slept in the same room, and moments later, they saw the gray again peeking into the doorway.

DID YOU SEE WHAT I JUST SAW? One morning in May 1976, two men were driving along a road just outside of Valdez, Alaska, when they saw a UFO landed in the field right along the highway. To their amazement, a ramp opened up and two gray ETs emerged. They seemed to be in a hurry. The men drove on but immediately turned around. When they returned, the craft was gone.

NOT OF THIS WORLD. On the night of July 25, 1982, world-famous bullfighter, Rafale Peralta was driving near Punta Umbria, Spain, when he noticed strange lights along the beach. He stopped his car and went to investigate. To his shock, he came upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall silver-suited humanoid. The being tried to speak, but when Rafael answered, the being returned to the craft and departed.

I CONTINUE TO WONDER. On the night of October 27, 2010, Carlos woke up in his apartment in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to see a UFO hovering outside his window. Suddenly he sensed grays in his apartment and felt like he was put to sleep. Later, he awoke and saw one of the grays staring at him through the window and then was put to sleep again. He awoke again just in time to watch the UFO depart.

A CREATURE IN OUR HOME. On October 22, 2015, Emma (of New York State) dreamed that she saw a gray alien crouching under her dining room table. Suddenly she was waking up in bed to a loud crashing noise. Her husband leaped out of bed and into the dining room to see that a small table had broken and spilled its contents. Their burglar alarm was malfunctioning, and they both saw strange orbs outside.

I FELT I WAS BEING TAGGED. It was October 6, 2023, and struggling from a recent divorce, Chris took a drive near his home in Olympia, Washington, to vent his emotion. Stopping his car over a bridge, he screamed. At that moment, he felt electricity jolt through him and looked up, saw two craft with three gray ETs looking down at him. He felt a telepathic link as they suddenly flew off, but since then, continues to feel that they are observing him.

A face-to-face encounter with a humanoid being is one of the most life-changing experiences a person can have. Only a person who has had this experience can truly understand how transformative it is. There are now many thousands of documented cases, and some researchers believe they may number in the millions. There are too many cases to deny or explain away. We are being visited!

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and welcome to new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. I've got an
exciting episode for you today. I think all about humanoids. And in fact, the title of today's episode is called Don't
Be Scared. 10 very strange humanoid encounters.
Humanoid encounters are by nature strange, but these are particularly unusual. They've got some really unique
elements and I think each of these cases has something to offer in terms of our understanding of the extraterrestrial
presence on this planet. All different types of humanoids. Cases coming from
all over the world dating back to 1962 to 2023.
Got six cases from the United States and four from outside including from Italy,
Spain, Japan, and Brazil. and in the United States, Alaska, Nebraska, New
Mexico, New York, North Dakota, and the state of Washington.
I think you'll find these cases really interesting, and most I'm guessing you
probably haven't heard before. So, let's just get started. And the first case I'd
like to talk about today, I call I Beheld an Incredible Thing. This one
occurred on December 17, 1962 in Milan, Italy. I find this case interesting
because the witness is a night watchman. Quite a few cases of night watchmen
seeing UFOs, probably because they're outside all the time. But it's also
interesting in its location, right in the middle of a very crowded city. The
night watchman is not the only witness. So, this would be considered a multiple witness case. Another interesting thing
to me is that this case involves a UFO pretty much landing and humanoids coming
out, approaching the witness, and then going right back in. This is a pattern we see quite a bit again. It was on the
evening of December 17, 1962, at precisely 2:20 a.m. that Francesco
Rizzy, aged 36, was making his rounds as a security guard or a night watchman at
the Kasami textile plant located in the very heart of Milan, Italy. This is on
Via Santa Valeria Street. You can see it here, immediately adjacent to the Santa
Ambrosia Square. and he was walking across the courtyard when he heard what he described as quote a whistling
swishing noise and this was to his right and as Franchesco says in his own words
at first I thought it was in my ear but then I noticed that the swish grew stronger and stronger. I therefore
turned around and I beheld an incredible thing. There it was just in front of me
hanging about 3 feet above the ground. It was of a clear metal, perhaps aluminum, with silver reflections on it.
Its diameter may have been 12 to 15 feet, and on top there was a turret around which were a number of lighted
dormer windows. I was paralyzed and tried hard to believe my own eyes when
suddenly the noise stopped. A brilliant greenish light was pouring from the three windows on the conning tower. I
saw two strange looking creatures inside it. At the bottom of the disc, a door was opened through which a little man
came out. A little man of about one meter tall. I could not see him very well because it was very dark in the
courtyard, and the man's head seemed to be absolutely black. To make matters
worse, he wore a kind of luminous overall, which made it hard to see him clearly. Now, per Franchesco, the shape
of the craft reminded him a little bit of an English helmet. He said the figure's suit appeared to be silvery,
fluorescent, and was emitting a bluish light. The blackness of his head, he
believed, was actually a helmet. And Franchesco said it was his own emotion of fear which rendered him unable to
move. And as he says, the man perhaps had no hostile intentions. He pointed
one finger towards my hand, and with his other hand, he gave me a sign to come nearer and not to be afraid. Yet I was
completely unable to move. Soon after, another man jumped out of the disc,
submerged in a blue haze. With a commanding gesture, he made a sign to the other to re-enter the disc. The
first creature looked at me for a moment and then got back into the saucer. Suddenly, the door closed behind them
both. The swishing noise started again, and the disc took off vertically and disappeared in a cloud of white smoke.
So now that the craft and humanoids were gone, Franchesco recovered his mobility and he rushed out of the courtyard and
immediately told another night watchman what he had seen. His co-employee told him to go report the incident to their
superior, a man by the name of Mr. Poentesta, which of course he did, and
together Francesco and Mr. Poentesta went to the police. The police
immediately arrived on the scene, but were unable to find any evidence of the craft. Franchesco later spoke with
reporters, saying, "Of course, I had read about flying saucers and Martians coming to visit us and to spy on us, and
also about messages coming from other worlds, but I would never have imagined that it would fall to my lot to see such
an object under my nose. But I saw the Martians as I see you." Though Franchesco's report was published widely
in newspapers and later in a number of books, he received a great deal of publicity. And as a result of all this
publicity, several people came forward and said that they had seen a strange flying object above Milan on the same
night of Rzy's sighting. Now, despite all this, all the publicity resulted in
Francesco Rizzy being fired from his job. But he did have his supporters.
Walter Shiari, a very well-known Italian movie star, actually went on TV and
spoke about Franchesco's experience, wished him a happy new year, and asked
that Francesco Rizzy get his job back, saying, quote, "You can't fire a man
only because he happened to see a flying saucer." Unfortunately,
Franchesco's employers were not convinced and he was not rehired. But as
Franchesco's Rizzy's wife says, "Nobody believes my husband, but I know it's
true. He doesn't drink and has always ridiculed stories of flying saucers."
Case created quite a sensation when it occurred, as we can see, and obviously
affected the witness profoundly. It's a really interesting case with all these
weird patterns that we see. Like why would these ETs come down and just step
out of the craft for such a brief moment as if to just say hello to a person? I
don't know. There's a lot of cases like it though. But this next case is very unusual. Don't know if you've heard of
this one before, but it actually involves a series of really amazing events and several humanoid encounters.
I call this one a nice little man. This one occurred through October and
November of 1965 in Moji Guasu in Brazil. Multiple people
saw this and in fact there are thousands of witnesses to the UFO activity. A much
smaller amount to some of these humanoid encounters. But these are some really interesting humanoid encounters with not
your typical grays. certainly short little humanlooking beings. So, it's a
fascinating case on many levels. This case, yes, involves a great number of witnesses and a series of really
incredible humanoid sightings over a two-month period in October and November of 1965.
These were reported on by Coral and Jim Lorenzan who spoke to Olivote Ti Fontes,
their representative for Brazil, and was also investigated by many other researchers including Walter K. Bueller,
Professor Flavio Pereira, Drs. Leo Gdoy Otero, and Renato Baselar.
This case was published in both the APRO bulletin and the Brazilian publication SBEDV
among other places. There were so many reports involved with this one from so many people that the dates have become
somewhat confused. But starting in late October, numerous people in this area
saw strange objects hovering and maneuvering over Moji Guasu, Brazil, but
particularly over the huge farm complex owned by Daario Anua Filho. He's a
chemist who lived just outside of Moji Guasu. This is in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It
was around 10 p.m. on October 18, 1965 that Daario Filho was on his property
when he saw this sparkling orange object hovering about 100 m 300 ft over his
farmhouse. And he described it as quote floating like a leaf and quote swinging
like a pendulum. Immediately, he saw two other objects, both of which immediately
zoomed upwards to about 1,000 m or 3,000 ft, and switched off their lights. So,
he called out his wife, Luchia, and his grandson, Darinho, age 10, and all three
of them watched these objects fluttering in a falling leaf motion, and then disappear so low over the treetops that
it looked like they would almost strike the branches. They did notice a pleasant odor and this kept coming up when these
UFOs would appear because they appeared over and over again. They wondered if this odor might be something to do with
the leaves being affected by the craft. At any rate, lots of people were seeing
stuff at this time. It was one evening in October 1965 that 17-year-old Opera
Seda Korea Da Silva and her cousin Niday saw a green light pass over their house
and actually land in the yard of a large warehouse next to their home. You can see the sighting location here. They
said this object was round, glowing, and had three wheellike protrusions on the
bottom. They said that three humanoid figures just over 1 meter tall, 3 feet,
came out and started to bend down and seemed to be collecting samples of something from the ground. Now, the
craft was so bright the witnesses could see that the humanoids were wearing one piece blue coveralls and had stout
bodies. They had clear skin, but two of them looked more tan than the others,
and they were all wearing large transparent helmets. Somebody else nearby also saw all of this happening
and actually approached the landed craft and humanoids, at which point the humanoids immediately entered the object
through a small hatch. This craft rose vertically upwards and was gone. The
very next night, this family saw a glowing green object pass over their house again, only this time it moved off
into the distance. So around this time the UFOs started to be seen nightly over
Moji Guasu and people were gathering in large crowds to watch the activity. And
in fact, one evening, this is late October, police officer Xiao Ataviano
Ribero Nato and his c-orker Sebastio Andred Dilva went to investigate and
they came upon a crowd of they estimate 1,000 people who were collected near a
ceramics factory. They parked away from the crowd and were watching and observing and actually joking about the
flying saucers when the joke was on them because suddenly there was a luminous
object descending lower near the ground discshaped. They chased after it, lost
sight of it, but then they later saw it floating at treetop level just south of Moji Guasu over Moji Marim immediately
to the south. And that's just one incident. There are many. Another case
involved a doctor, Dr. Alswaldo Ronell Cardardoso, who said that he and another
person were followed down the road by a flying saucer. Another witness was Haimey Bueno. He owned a fish
restaurant, and he said that he and his son were awakened at 300 a.m. by an
object that was so intensely bright, it lit up the whole area, including the interior of their house. was just
outside their home about 20 m above the ground 60 ft and they watched it for
about 2 hours when it finally rose up silently. 2 days later they saw it again
and of course they learned that many other people in their neighborhood had also seen it. On the night of October
30, 1965, a night watchman at that same ceramics factory noticed a light on the premises.
So he went to investigate and he saw that it was a very large glowing discshaped object which was floating by
the large chimney towers. So he watched it as it moved towards the high voltage wires at the edge of the field, but then
it started to head straight towards him. This scared him badly and he made a dash for the inside of the factory and
actually locked himself inside. Now back to the farm of Daario Philho. On
November 11th, he headed to town on business, but upon returning home, he
found his wife, Luchia, in hysterics. She said that around 900 p.m., she and
their grandson, again, Darinho, they both saw this silent orange light approaching the farmhouse right above
the treetops. This had been going on for weeks. But on this occasion, without warning, the
object dropped down and hovered about a half meter, just one and a half feet, above the ground, sort of landing in the
cattle pen. It was moving back and forth. Now, they were afraid because of
all these previous sightings over the farm and the surrounding areas. They were both very nervous. But both Luchia
and Durinho approached the gate to the cattle pen and about 40 m away, 120 ft,
they could see this object, which they described as being about 3 to 4 m wide
and 3 m high. That's about 9 to 12 feet wide and 9 ft high. They said it was
roughly cone-shaped. They could see a tube extending from one side of the object and it was radiating sparks. But
they immediately noticed a little man who was wearing gray clothes with kind of white spots on it. And this little
man was walking among the cattle who were not reacting and heading towards a mango tree. Now, the object disappeared
at one point. So did the little man. But 5 minutes later, the craft reappeared in the same exact spot, and another figure
emerged, identical to the first, except wearing a white shirt and brown pants,
and they could now see them clearly enough to discern delicate facial features, or as she says, he had a very
cute little face. She said that he was quote, "a nice little man. I will never
forget his face." So this little man proceeded to go back and forth about
four or five times over to the Juru Baba tree and was collecting twigs, leaves,
and branches apparently from this tree and carrying them in his arms back to the craft. It turns out this is a
medicinal plant widely used for a number of reasons. And there were two other figures. Occasional people would pass by
the area because there was a wedding going on nearby. But each time anybody appeared, the figures would quickly
enter the craft going up this green colored tube on the side and the craft would move behind bushes apparently to
hide. One of the three figures during all this time would stand by the fence
and seem to be studying the family's mare. So after about 5 minutes of this, the object left, but it was just that
there was more sightings going on. Luchia and Durinho now saw two more glowing UFOs appear and one of them sent
down a beam of light onto this rough wooden post sort of pillar. And in the
beam, Luchia could see an image or what looked like a projection of a little man
standing with his arms outstretched kind of like he was holding a steering wheel or something and he was staring fixedly
at the house. She said this man had a light complexion, a bald head, and was
wearing a cream colored coverall. At one point, Durinho approached, and this
would cause the beam to become darkened. Finally, the beam of light stopped, and
this object sent out a beam of light to the other object, which kind of rolled
out like a staircase is how Luchia described it. One of the short figures
used what looked like a flashlight like instrument turned on a green light.
Immediately there was the sound of an explosion and a bright flash and both objects disappeared. At that very same
moment, all the kerosene lamps in the house went out and the covers on the lamps actually broke. Now, they tried to
light them with matches, but even the matches wouldn't work. And they found out that their batterypowered
flashlights were also inoperable. The next day, November 12, Daario checked
the area where Lucia had seen the little man and he found the fresh broken
branches on the Duru Baba tree. Again, this is a well-known medicinal plant used to treat liver, digestive health,
anemia, and other inflammatory conditions. So, having this happen, Daario decided to go to town and tell
his friends and work associates about all this activity. told him that this
craft would sometimes follow his car to the farm and he implored them to come
the next evening to help him investigate this ongoing activity. So the next night
arrived, November 13, 1965, and sure enough, this object reappeared.
Daario and his son Salvador, Salvador actually saw it first. They called over everybody to watch and a whole bunch of
people saw this including the director of the local bank Gilberto Rosha Das
Silva and the family priest Lino Vartinden and several neighbors and they
all watched this object hover and then land about 30 m almost 100 ft away. The
object immediately sent a beam upwards. Now, the bank manager had a camera ready, but he was so shocked he actually
dropped it and did not take any photographs. But at this point, two short figures described as being the
size of a seven-year-old child were seen. One was wearing overalls. The other had what looked like a gray shirt
and brown pants. And a third entity was also seen in the beam of light. It was
described as having a squarish flattish head and was wearing what looked like a surgeon's apron. All three of these
figures were glowing brightly. Now, this event was also viewed by other people.
There was a sheriff and a police clerk driving by and they actually stopped and watched this. Numerous other witnesses
also saw the craft and the beings, including the mayor, the chief of police, and dozens of people who lived
near the farm. After just a short period of time, these beings got back into their craft, which took off at high
speed. But events weren't over yet. Later that same night, a couple was
driving from Nova Lusan to Moji Mirram, again only a few miles away from this
location, when they came upon a huge light blocking the road in front of them. So they turned around and
immediately encountered a truck who was heading in this direction and warned him about the light in the middle of the
road. And as they were doing this, a third car drove by them towards the light, but of course quickly turned
around and joined them. So now all of these people in three separate vehicles
drove slowly together in a convoy approaching this light and as they got close it suddenly soared upwards. The
three vehicles stopped at the junction of the highways at Pinhal where there was a gasoline station and numerous
people had gathered there. Dozens of people and the whole crowd of people observed this object floating in the sky
and then finally darting away. It was one month later that Daario reported one more sighting of an object with a dome
hovering in the night sky over his farm. But it was also learned that six months earlier, Daario's son, Salvador, and the
farm foreman, Avalino Rivero Praau, were repairing a fence on the farm when they
saw two very short figures off in the distance. These figures were justesticulating and walking quickly,
urgently for about 5 to 10 minutes. They were wearing one piece white jumpsuits.
Now, both Salvador and Avalino assumed that these were people, thieves perhaps,
trying to steal wood. So, they approached from different routes, intending to surprise these little guys.
But when they arrived, nobody was there. What's interesting to me about that case is that it occurred during such an
intense wave of UFO activity. So many witnesses, quite a few people seeing
these little humanoids. It's like what are they doing? In the one of the main cases, it's quite obvious what they're
doing. They're collecting samples. I found it quite interesting that they were collecting samples of a well-known
medicinal plant. So maybe they are using plants for the same reasons we are. Hard
to say for sure, but yeah, lots of interesting details to that one. And here's another case that I found
particularly compelling. I call this one I will deny it. This is another multiple
witness case which occurred one evening in October 1968
outside of the small town of Hastings in North Dakota. I like this case in some
ways. It's pretty typical, but it's also got some really interesting elements to it in that this UFO was seen very close
up. These gray type ETs looking down at the witnesses. And also very interesting
is that this craft paced their car for some miles. Most interesting to me is
how at least one of the witnesses reacted. This case involves four witnesses, but as of today, only one has
come forward, and she has requested anonymity. I'll call her Suzanne. At the
time of her encounter, Suzanne was in high school. And it was around 8:30 p.m., one crisp, clear evening in
October, that Suzanne, her sister, and another high school student, and their
pastor were driving home from a church youth meeting in Valley City, North Dakota, heading south towards their home
in Lichville. The pastor was driving, this was a drive of about 27 miles. They
were approximately 10 miles from their home just a few miles north of Hastings when Suzanne and her sister who who were
both sitting in the back seat noticed something very unusual. And you can see the exact location here. As Suzanne
says, I glanced out the left passenger window and saw a silver metallic disc
rise nolessly from behind a small grove of deciduous trees. I could see lights
through the trees and suddenly the lights began to rise. And then there it was, a UFO hovering just above the
trees. The disc hung there, not moving, silent. Though Suzanne immediately shouted out, "There's a UFO." And both
she and her sister looked at it with quote great excitement. Now, strangely,
the girl in the front passenger seat did not acknowledge what was happening in any way, and she actually refused to
even look. The pastor who was driving also said nothing and did not appear to
react. But then something amazing happened. As Suzanne says, "As we
watched, the disc moved laterally, stopping over the car, no more than 30 ft above us, to our left and a little
ahead of us. It was shiny and metallic, but more of a dull shine, not like
silver. The bottom half looked like a shallow bowl. The top half looked like an inverted shallow bowl, but there was
a higher dome in the middle. There were red and green flashing lights alternating around the edge of the rim,
and there were also white flashing lights, but I cannot recall the exact configuration. There were also windows
visible in the higher raised dome, and there was a glow of light coming from inside the UFO's interior. As we
traveled along the highway, it kept perfect pace with us. My sister and I crowded in the window and craned our
necks to watch it. I could see the clear silhouettes of figures backlit in some
of the windows. In one window, it appeared like several figures were standing together, as though they were
trying to get a good look at us. So at this point, Suzanne shouted out, "They're watching us." This object was
continuing to keep pace with them, and it was close enough that they were able to make out some details of these beings
appearance. As Suzanne says, "I remember saying to my sister that the figures
were shorter than us. I am 5'4" in because the dome was low. The figures
looked grayish, and their heads looked big compared to their bodies and arms. The windows were tall enough that I
could see their heads and their torsos. Suzanne told her sister, "Look how short they are." Earlier, Suzanne had read the
book, The Interrupted Journey by John G. Fuller about the Betty and Barney Hill encounter, and this made her very
interested in this subject. So, she was incredibly excited to realize that they were not only seeing a UFO and the
beings, but that it was so close to them. And Suzanne said out loud, "Maybe
they want to make contact with us." And then she said out loud that she wanted to open the window and acknowledge them
in some way. But at that moment, the pastor, who had been dead silent through
the whole time, sharply ordered her, "Don't you dare. We are just going to
keep on driving the same speed. Ignore it and don't do anything to attract its
attention." Now, Suzanne wasn't having this. as she says. Despite his warning,
my sister and I continued to huddle at her window, staring up at the UFO and the figures in the windows. It followed
us for several miles with the pastor driving a steady speed and staring straight ahead. As we neared the tiny
town of Hastings, the UFO suddenly rose up and sped off at an angle to our right
and accelerated at an astonishingly high rate of speed, disappearing to a small
distant light in the sky in mere seconds. I remember exclaiming how quickly it flew away. I was very excited
about the experience and I kept talking about how I couldn't believe we had just seen what we did. So, at this point,
Suzanne asked the girl in the front, "Can you believe we saw that?" And without even turning around, the girl
replied, "I didn't see anything." At that, Suzanne and her sister just kind of stared at each other and rolled their
eyes. A short time later, they arrived at the church in Lichville where Suzanne's mother was waiting for them.
Suzanne and her sister were both very excited to tell their mother about this amazing encounter. But before they
could, the pastor ordered them not to get out of the car yet until he talked to them. And as Suzanne says, he ordered
us not to speak one word of what had just happened. He specifically told us we were not to tell our parents about
it. I argued with him a little and said we should be able to tell the truth. The
pastor was not convinced and he told them, "People will think I'm crazy if anyone hears about this. If you tell
anyone about what we have seen, and I'm with you, I will deny it. Though despite
this, Suzanne and her sister, to their credit, rushed up to their mother and immediately told her the whole story.
And her mother not only believed them, but said that she had herself seen strange lights in the sky over a farm
just one quarter mile from their home. 40 years later, Suzanne finally filed an official report writing, "It is still
vivid in my memory." At that time, few people talked about seeing UFOs. As for
the other girl, I do not think I had ever talked to her about it again, and I certainly did not talk to the pastor
about it. I will never forget being that close to a UFO and seeing it so clearly.
It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. How crazy is that? Here we have two sisters, very
excited about seeing this craft and wanting to make contact with the occupants. But the pastor and the other
passenger clearly frightened and not wanting to make contact. I also found it
kind of ironic that here we have a pastor who is you would think a very
moral person but literally told these witnesses to lie, withhold the truth.
Just don't think that that's a good policy in any case. But I wasn't there.
So, I certainly don't want to judge anyone to how they react to an encounter
because it can be very frightening as we've certainly seen over and over again, but an absolutely fascinating
case. And now, let's move to the next one, which is so unusual. I call this
one no satisfactory explanation. This is another multiple witness case which
occurred on October 1st, 1975 in Hakushu, Japan. This case does not
involve any apparent UFO and for that matter these might not even be
extraterrestrials as we think of them. It's a very unusual case with absolutely
really unusual elements that I don't know that I've ever heard quite before. Certainly not in this way, but it was
professionally investigated. By all accounts, it seems to be a legitimate event, which I think you'll find quite
unusual. This very odd case comes from APRO's Japanese representative, Jun Ichi
Takanashi. He's a UFO researcher and the chairman of the Modern Space Flight
Association of Osaka, Japan. This case involves two witnesses, Mitio Hikawa,
age 19, and his friend Takishi Feruya, age 18. They lived in the small town of
Hakushu, not far from the beautiful Southern Alps National Park in Osaka,
Japan. and on October 1st, 1975, decided to
take an evening drive in their father's 1971 Suzuki Fronte car. It was around
8:00 p.m. as they stopped in one of the parking lots to the park, which at that time was deserted. They were listening
to the radio and talking when Takishi noticed what he thought at first were
small beggar children standing near the car, but they looked strange. Now,
Machio was very much surprised because when he looked, he couldn't see anything. But Teishi was insistent. He
said he not only saw short figures, but other figures who were no more than 3 ft tall, 1 meter, and were wearing white
clothing and had glowing yellow eyes. They could barely be seen because it was quite dark out. And Teishi could only
say that they looked very strange. And he pointed them out to Mitio, who could not see them. So, it was so dark
outside, so Machio turned on the headlights of the car, at which point the figures seemed to just fade away and
disappear. Both young men were very confused as they were sure that they were alone in this parking lot cuz this
area was quite remote. There were no homes in the area. There were no other cars. Now, suddenly, it got even weirder
because without any warning, their vehicle was pulled rapidly and sharply backwards several meters. It actually
caused Takishi to fall forward in his seat. Mitchio had his hands on the
steering wheel so he did not fall forward. But this happened twice. The car was pulled backwards several meters.
So both the witnesses were very confused because the parking brake on the car was actually on and the parking lot was
totally level. The car wasn't just rolling. It was clear that some sort of force was pulling on the car. So they
were frightened. They started the car and drove back to town. And as they drove, Machia was the first to raise the
possibility that perhaps these figures were quote spacemen. This surprised
Takishi. But he did confirm that the figures did not look normal and said
that at one point one of these figures came right up to the car and he saw what looked to him kind of like a cow's hoof
rubbing on the glass window on his side of the car. So they quickly reached town. They told their friends and asked
them to return with them, but all their friends refused. After several moments, their curiosity overcame their fear and
the two young men returned to this location. Only this time, they did take the precaution of facing their car on
the downs slope near the exit so they could make a quick getaway if they had to. But no sooner had they stopped,
Mitchio still had his foot on the brakes when the car was pulled backwards about 3 m, 9 ft. Amazed, they opened their
windows and looked at the wheels of the car. And sure enough, they were rotating in reverse. This was not an illusion. At
this point, Takishi decided to step out of the car to try and communicate to whoever was doing this. He called out in
Japanese. There was no response. He tried calling out gibberish words. Still no response. So, he got back in the car
and once again was instantly pulled backwards by this invisible force. This
happened three more times which frightened them. So they drove home and decided that they're not going to tell
anyone. But it was the very next day. Mitchio was working with his father on
the farm cutting crops and his father saw him looking up into the sky and not really paying attention. And Mitchio
actually cut himself. So he confessed to his father that he was thinking about the prior evening events and explained
what happened. He really expected his father to ridicule him, but instead his father believed him as earlier he had
noticed some strange marks on the window of the car exactly where Mitchio had seen this hoof-like object actually
touching the car. So together they went to examine the car. And after looking at it and trying it out, they discovered it
was now in very poor condition, was making strange noises. It wouldn't start. They checked the battery water
and saw that it was half full, which was strange because they had just filled it 10 days earlier and the car had been
running smoothly. It was still pretty new with only 28,000 km on the odometer.
Coral Lorenzan writes in the Appro Journal about this case and she says there is still no satisfactory
explanation for the movement of the car with the brakes applied as described. There are no nearby homes and the
campground and parking area were unoccupied which virtually eliminates human pranksters. There are wild monkeys
in the vicinity, but it is doubtful that they could move the car. If monkeys were there, both youths should have been able
to see them. There is no mention in this report that either youth saw anything resembling any type of UFO. That's
another one of those kinds of cases that make you just go, hm. Like, what do you make of this? Was this ET? Could it have
been spirits? Very hard to say. But with two witnesses and physical evidence,
it's hard to deny that something did not happen. Something clearly happened to these boys. What it was? Well, I'm just
portraying the facts as we know them. You can make up your own minds about it, but I do think it's an important case.
And now, let's move to the next one. This is another multiple witness case involving two young brothers who saw
something together very unusual. I call this one don't be scared. This is the
case that actually inspired the title for this whole episode because this is something so many ETs do tell people and
it certainly told the witness in this case. This one occurred one evening in winter of 1975
in Platsouth, Nebraska. And this one is absolutely unusual and I
think you'll find it very compelling. This case was reported to Muon by the witness who provided a firsthand
testimony of an experience he had at age six or seven years old. He is anonymous,
so I'll call him David. At the time of his experience, he lived with his parents and two brothers in a rural area
outside of Platsmouth, Nebraska. This is about 15 miles west of Offit Air Force
Base in Belleview where his father worked. David shared a room with one of
his brothers and they slept in a bunk bed. His brother had the lower bunk and
David slept in the top one. And on this particular evening in 1975 winter, he
was asleep and facing the wall. And then, as David says, and I quote, "All
of a sudden, I woke up, still facing the wall, and I felt as if I was being watched. I slowly turned over only to
come face to face with something. Even though it was only two or three feet away from my face, I could not make out
its face. I could only see an outline of a head and what appeared to be a cape extending out from both sides of its
head. It reminded me of Dracula. Needless to say, I was petrified. But I
heard or felt a voice say, "Don't be scared. Turn back over." So I did.
Facing the wall again, I was wide awake and scaredless. But I don't know why I never called out
for mom or dad. I don't know how much time passed, but I stayed looking at the
wall and hoping whatever it was would just go away. So finally, David summed
up enough courage to turn around and look, and whatever had been next to his bed was now gone. In a split second,
David leapt from his top bunk and into the lower bunk where his brother was sleeping and pressed himself up against
the wall. This, of course, awakened his brother, who wondered what the heck David was doing. And David told him,
"Dracula was in our room." So this frightened his brother and both of them hid under the covers, examining the room
for anything. And it was at this point that they both heard a strange noise in the hallway followed by silence. And as
David says, "What happened next I will never forget. A big green head with big
eyes peered around the corner and looked at us. Then it was gone. We slowly
looked at each other as if to say, "Did you just see what I saw?" Needless to
say, we spent the rest of the night huddled there awake and waited until daylight. The next morning, they told
their parents, who said it must have been just a dream, which of course David does not believe was the case. As he
says, "To this day, I don't know why we didn't scream bloody murder for our parents, as was the case when we would
have a nightmare." The next morning, they went outside and checked for footprints or any other evidence of the
intruder, but found nothing. David did say that a few other strange things happened. He doesn't describe them, but
he said that the bedroom visitation by this strange creature made a huge impression on him. Despite this, as time
went on, the memory of this encounter began to fade. And as he grew older, he would think about the incident every now
and then, but started to wonder if it was perhaps just a bad dream. But then
at age 16 or 17, something happened which for him confirmed this experience
as being real. As David says, I happened upon a book in the library about UFOs
and aliens. As I read it, I became engrossed and couldn't put it down until
I came to an artist's rendering of what is now the classic gray. Seeing that picture sent chills down my spine and
scared me to where I put the book away only to get it out later because I couldn't stop thinking about it, which
brought me back to this night. Now, David has never seen a UFO, but the childhood encounter remains etched in
his memory. And as he says, it has been haunting me ever since. As an adult, he
did ask his brother about it, but all his brother could recall was that something scary happened. David showed
him a drawing of a gray, but his brother didn't say anything. And as David says,
he probably thought me to be crazy, so I haven't mentioned it since, even though I think about it time to time. I don't
know if what I saw was an extraterrestrial, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't Dracula or Frankenstein. Now,
interestingly and perhaps significant is that around this same time and only 50
miles away in Lincoln, Nebraska, there was another sighting was on October
31st, two young boys were trick-or-treating and had just walked past their school and were in front of a
house when they saw a massive UFO. As one of the witnesses says, we noticed
this huge discshaped object with lights of different colors spinning around the disc. As it started to clear the
housetops, and we realized the size, bigger than the house we were walking up to, we were horrified. My friend ran up
under the carport. I was too afraid the owners would find us and be mad. So, I
stayed out about 15 seconds more until it cleared the housetops and started moving slightly and very slowly south,
scaring me enough to go to the carport. I ran back out from the carport just in
time to see it hovering basically above us. I can't remember if there was any sound associated with it. Then, once it
cleared the trees, it shot into space and was gone. We were both horrified and decided it
was a Halloween prank. Neither one of us ever mentioned it again to anybody or even to each other. But there is no way
in 1975 that anyone could put together something of this magnitude. So, it's an
interesting sighting. It's impossible obviously to say for sure if these two events are related in any way other than
the fact that they occurred near the same area near the same time. There are so many cases of witnesses who see ETS
when they're very young and my heart goes out to them. That has got to be quite an frightening encounter,
especially when you don't really have any means to interpret what you're seeing. So, we often do have witnesses
waiting years to figure out what they saw and only realizing it when they see perhaps an illustration of a gray ET or
whatever type of ET they saw. So yeah, really amazing. It's that second case
that is in the same area around the same time. That's also interesting to me. I
suspect that most people who have encounters, there are other outside witnesses to them. But because so many
people are afraid to talk about it, afraid to report it in any official way, we lose a lot of data.
But the point is there are a lot of cases of this kind. And now let's move
to another one. This is another case that would have slid under the radar if the witnesses had not reported it. It's
a multiple witness case. I call this one, did you see what I saw? This one
occurred in May 1976 in Valdis, Alaska. This is a pretty small town, a very
beautiful area. What I like about this case is not only does it have multiple witnesses, but this was a daylight
sighting of a landed UFO and humanoids. Those are somewhat rare. And this one
has got some very interesting details to it. This case involves two men, both anonymous. I'll call them Chuck and
Patrick. And they had a very unusual experience in the small town of Valdis, Alaska. This town has about 3,500 to
4,000 people. And the main witness is Chuck. It was an early Sunday morning in
May of 1976. Bright and sunny. Both men, of course, had the day off. So, after having
breakfast at the Totem restaurant and Motel, which you can see here, they
decided to take a drive out of town in Chuck's pickup truck. and they had no sooner turned onto the highway and were
on the outskirts of town when they saw something in the field to the right about 150 to 175 ft away. You can see
the area here. But as Chuck says, it was so bizarre that I made a conscious
decision to concentrate on a couple of specific items so that I might recall these items later on. I fully realized
at that moment just how unusual this was to my routine everyday sights and
nothing before lent any perspective. So I was just trying to instill common sense to the moments of this unique
observation. And the object they were observing was clearly a craft either landed on the ground or hovering just
above it. They said it was oval in shape about 30 to 35 ft in diameter maybe 6 to
8 feet in height. And this craft was pink in color with a shiny luminescence
to it. They noticed a sort of hoselike band going around the perimeter circumference. And inside it, they could
see these individual lights moving in a counterclockwise direction every 5
seconds or so. And wherever the lights were, they seemed to expand this hoselike band. Both men stared in
absolute amazement and were even more shocked when they saw humanoid beings exiting the craft. As Chuck says, "I saw
a ramp drop from the belly of the craft approximately four to 5 ft wide and 6 to
7 ft long. I observed two metallic extensions which comprised at least part
of the landing gear. Last, but certainly not least, I saw two small gray green
animals that looked like the stereotypical description of aliens. At the distance of 50 or 60 yards, I cannot
provide any specific details, but they were about 4 to 5 ft tall and seemed to
be in a quandry. I got a very distinct feeling that they were caught with their pants down and were in much of a hurry.
Now, for some reason, Chuck did not stop the car. He just continued around the lefthand turn in the highway. But he did
notice that his friend Patrick was continuing to watch the amazing sight, turning his head. And as Chuck says, I
saw my buddy turning to look out his window as I continued around the corner. And perhaps 10 seconds later, sitting on
the edge of the seat, he turned, staring vacantly out the windshield. His mind
was very obviously involved with what he had just seen. So Chuck asked him, "Did
you see what I just saw?" Patrick did not answer and just stared blankly ahead. So Chuck asked him again, and
still there was no answer. So Chuck asked a third time when his friend abruptly turned and looked at him and
nearly shouted, "You're bleeping right I did." But he then continued to stare
blankly ahead with a far away look in his eyes. So Chuck said, "Should we turn around and go back?" and Patrick
shouted, "No." Now, despite this, Chuck drove about 1/5if of a mile ahead, then
turned around and went back. They immediately searched the sky and the ground for any traces of the object, but
saw nothing unusual. There was one final aftermath to this encounter that left Chuck deeply
dismayed. And as he says, "My friend became increasingly unwilling to discuss
the event after a few months. And these days he refuses to acknowledge the
entire experience. He says, "Geez, I don't remember." Not acknowledging
reality when it is imposed upon us is, I'm convinced, some of the worst
circumstances that we can impose on one another. was 35 years after his
encounter that Chuck decided to report his encounter to Mufon, writing that the details he submitted in his report. He
can say with quote great confidence, "I do wish I could interview these
witnesses directly and find more details about what they saw, but they certainly
did describe it very vividly. It clearly had a huge impact on them. Such a shame
that one of the witnesses doesn't even want to talk and now professes not to even remember it. This is not as unusual
as you might think. Some witnesses do actually completely forget their encounters. And sometimes they just
don't want to talk about it. It scares them so badly. an encounter, I've said this so many
times, affects a person for the rest of their lives, affecting them on multiple
levels, mentally, emotionally, spiritually.
So, I certainly understand why some people might not want to talk about it,
but other people absolutely feel compelled to share their experiences, and I'm really glad that this witness
did. So, let's move to the next case. This one is also really unusual. I call
this one not of this world. This one occurred on July 25, 1982 near Punta
Umbra. This is in Spain. What I like about this case is the witness is
actually really famous. I'm not sure that that adds any level of credibility
to it, but it certainly adds a level of interest. This is technically a
multiplewitness case. Although only one witness saw the landed UFO and humanoid,
many other people in the area did see UFOs on that same night. That definitely
adds a level of credibility. But this case is interesting because this gentleman got out of his car, walked
right up to this UFO and humanoid. And this is not your average humanoid by any means. The main witness in this case is
Raphael Peralta. He is one of Spain's best known bull fighters or rejiadors
which is bull fighting by horseback. In fact, Raphael with his brother developed, revolutionized and
popularized this sport. But what many people don't know is that Raphael Peralta had a very dramatic encounter
with a landed UFO and an extraterrestrial being. His case was investigated by researcher JJ Bonedz and
was also in the newspapers. It was about 400 a.m. on July 25, 1982.
Raphael had just finished a bull fighting festival and was driving his Mercedes west along the A5052
highway heading from El Rampedo towards Puna Umbria in Spain where his family
was staying. Now this road traveled east along the coast and he had just reached the intersection leading to Helva and
was heading along the beach towards Puna Umbria when his encounter began. As Raphael says, I saw several flashing
lights, red and yellow, on the beach beside the road. I could not see exactly
where they were. I stopped my car and walked towards them, thinking it could be a car crash and wishing to offer some
help. When I was about 10 m 30 ft from the accident,
I discovered that there was a bright metallic object behind the light. It was like a large illuminated silver platter,
a little bit oval, not exactly oval nor round, with blunt edges, I would say.
So, obviously, this wasn't an accident. There was nobody else on the road at that hour. And now, seeing the
strangeness of this object, Raphael started to become afraid. This object had a very smooth surface. There were no
openings or protrusions. He estimated it was 6 m wide, 18 feet, and 4 m high,
about 12 ft. It was hovering about 1 meter above the ground or 3 ft. He
started to cautiously back up towards his car, but this is when he noticed a strange figure standing directly in
front of the craft. As Raphael says, in front of the object, there was a strange
tall being clad in a metallic suit, like a space suit. It was two or more meters
tall and very bright. I did not see arms, but it must have had them. It was
not a robot. It was more human than robot. A very strange apparition indeed.
He was tall. His head could have been a meter or so from the edges of the device. that is. He was about 2 and 1/2
m tall. The guy was facing forward. His head was covered with something like a
wire mesh and I couldn't see his arms anywhere. There were no features, just a
square, just like his body. It was similar to a rectangle. His legs were
thin, almost cylindrical, and extended a foot below his groin. By now, it was
clear to Raphael that this being was not human. It couldn't be. Not only was it more than seven feet tall, its outfit
was unlike anything he'd ever seen. And as Raphael says, "When I came closer, he
emitted a noise, a guttural sound, like a short sentence. I was shocked and
answered, "What did you say?" At this question, he ran away very quickly and
entered the UFO on its left side. Immediately after, the UFO ascended and
moved over the sea at great speed. at 15 to 20 meters high, it just disappeared.
So Raphael later told investigator JJ Bonedz that the sentence he heard
sounded like quote ba rahra. He said when it spoke, both the being
and Raphael immediately retreated to their respective vehicles. He said when
the UFO took off, it did so in perfect silence. Raphael himself had no problem
starting his car and he immediately and quickly drove to meet his family. And as
Raphael says, I went home, woke my wife up and told her everything, but I did
not want to tell anybody else. You know, they could laugh at me. That night, I could not sleep because I was quite
afraid. So reporters did later ask him how his wife reacted and did she believe
him? And Raphael told him, "Yes, of course. My hair was standing on end, and
I was very much afraid. Of course, she believed me." The next morning, he returned with his wife to the landing
site, and they checked the spot, but could find no evidence of the craft. And Raphael did intend to keep this entire
experience a secret, but word soon leaked out. As Raphael says, "I told
nothing to nobody. But after a few days, I discussed the event with a lawyer, a
friend of mine, whose brother is a local newspaper director. So that was how the event went public. So Raphael did read
in the newspapers the very next day of his sighting that other people in the area and in nearby Kadis also reported
seeing a UFO. Apparently, many residents saw it in the neighboring towns. Ultimately, Raphael remains completely
convinced that he meant an extraterrestrial being. As he told investigator JJ Bonitez, "For me, that
was not of this world." I always find it interesting when skeptics dismiss a case
and say, "Oh, it's purely anecdotal, or this person was hallucinating, or they probably just made it up and it's a
hoax," or what have you. They weren't there. So, it's very easy, I think, to
judge someone else when you're not actually the person who had this experience. And what a lot of skeptics
don't realize is just how common this is. In this particular case, almost very
nearly was not recorded. It was only by pure coincidence and happen stance that
this witness even came forward. So again, the vast majority of people don't. If skeptics had any idea how
truly common this was, I think they would change their tune a little bit. It's happening all over the world as we
see. That's why I like presenting cases from a wide variety of areas. And that
case is really amazing. Now, let's move to the next case, which I call I
continue to wonder. This one occurred on October 27, 2010 in Albuquerque, New
Mexico. This is a single witness case coming from a gentleman who had an encounter in his apartment in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. This one is super interesting to me. It's got some
really unusual elements. It's quite a long and extensive encounter, and he
describes it in really vivid detail. I think you'll find it really interesting.
This firsthand testimony comes from Carlos, that's a pseudonym, who reports a very unusual interaction with a UFO
and what appeared to be three or four gray aliens. It was the evening of October 27, 2010, and Carlos was lying
asleep in his futon bed on the floor of his apartment in Albuquerque, New Mexico. and he woke up suddenly to see
brightcolored lights streaming in through the window in such a way that it seemed almost intentionally designed to
wake him up. As Carlos says, "Suddenly, I awoke and opened my eyes. Blinking
lights from a source outside were reflected perfectly from outside the window at just the right angle to
reflect onto the mirror propped against the wall behind me and then reflected across the futon to the wall in front of
me as I lay on my right side. I glanced up at the window and saw an aircraft
hovering motionless in the sky, perfectly positioned for me to see it clearly from my position on the floor.
It had many blinking lights, a red, blue, and white, possibly yellow,
similar to those of a police or emergency vehicle. The craft appeared to be in the shape of a boomerang. There
were round balls of colored light equidistant across both wings, which appeared to blink randomly. There was no
sound that I could hear. So, never having seen any aircraft like that before, Carlos instantly wondered if it
was an extraterrestrial craft. And at this point, he sensed, but did not actually see the presence of three,
maybe four beings in his room. The sense of their presence was unmistakable. But
for some reason, he simply lay there. But then in his mind's eye, he could
actually see these beings. And as he says, I saw the image of a gray ET, and
I telepathically heard, "We don't want to scare you." Before I could process
this statement to respond, the gray lifted his spindly arm and with an arc of his arm and like the flick of a
switch, I was out cold. At some point later, he woke up to go to the bathroom and once again immediately felt their
presence. Again, he did not react with fear, but felt strangely compliant. As
Carlos says, I could feel them watching me, observing. I sensed that they had me
arise to use the bathroom just to observe me to see if I could go about this common routine. I felt as if they
were scientists watching, whispering comments about my ability to carry out this routine task. I mumbled to myself
as I returned to bed, annoyed that I didn't know what was going on. Yet, I was compliant in completing the routine.
As I put my head on the pillow, I felt very sleepy, unable to keep my eyes opened. Carlos battled valiantly to
remain awake and kept forcing his eyes opened. But the feeling of sleepiness returned, forcing his eyes closed, and
this went back and forth until finally he couldn't resist it any longer. Later he did open his eyes, and for the first
time he saw one of the grays visibly face to face. And as Carlos says, I
reopened my eyes and gazed at the window where I saw a small gray ET peering in
the closed window at me. He was standing on the balcony just outside my bedroom window. I would estimate him to be about
3 feet tall. His large head was typical of the grays seen in pictures. His
large, expressionless, solid black eyes stared at me. His nose looked like a
couple of small holes with an almost non-existent mouth. He cocked his head to the left side in an inquisitive sort
of way. His movement and the expression on his face appeared rather mechanical,
as if devoid of emotion or any sort of deep thought. His affect and head
movement was more robotic than organic. So once again, Carlos was overcome with
sleepiness and shut his eyes, and when he opened them again, the gray was gone.
But he did wake up in time to see an orb of white light zooming up from his apartment out the window up to the
boomerang- shaped object and actually affix itself to one of the wings along with the other lights. Instantly the
craft darted up to the left and was gone. And once again, Carlos was overcome with sleepiness and didn't wake
up until morning. And when morning arrived, he felt fine and nothing in his apartment was out of order. And as
Carlos says, as I got ready for work, I kept wondering where the craft and the grays came from, why they visited me in
particular, and what did they do when I was asleep. I continued to wonder and
would love to find the answers. That case definitely has details we see quite
often. Quite a few people might not actually see the ETS at first, but sort
of get a mental image. These ETs are very telepathic. they communicate telepathically and that was clearly
going on in this case. Also interesting to me is how he described being unable
to remain conscious and fighting it and actually succeeding at one point but
ultimately the ETSs put him to sleep. He did not feel that they were there to hurt him or anything. They were there to
observe. That's also interesting to me. the craft that he described. All of
these little details start to add up because we hear them over and over again. Such a fascinating case. And now
we move to another case which is unusual in some ways that I've never heard before. This is technically a multiple
witness case, although only one witness did see the humanoids. I call this one a creature in our home. This occurred on
October 22nd, 2015 in an undisclosed lo location in New York. And this one, I
mean, you'll see why this is such an unusual encounter. Almost positive you
haven't heard this one before, but it definitely deserves to be wellnown. This case involves an engaged couple. I'll
call them Emma and Edward. Those are pseudonyms. And they report an encounter unlike any I've heard. It occurred on
the evening of October 22nd, 2015, sometime after midnight. And as Emma
says, my story begins with what seemed to be a very unusual lucid dream. I do
not remember dreams often, and they are always typical dreams that change and morph. This was different. In my dream,
I found myself standing in the hall bathroom doorway. I wondered how I had ended up there and why I was there. But
my attention was quickly somehow pulled to my left backside. I turned my head
over my left shoulder and I saw the view of my dining room. I noticed all at once
that there was a gray type looking creature crouched under my dining room table. Now there were normally four
chairs around the table, but strangely one of the chairs appeared to be missing. And in the dream, Emma was
puzzled by this discrepancy, but her attention was immediately drawn back to this gray alien, which seemed to have a
sudden telepathic link with her. And as Emma says, as he stared back at me, I
felt what he was feeling, and he was angry. I knew he had been there for a while. He had not planned or wanted me
to see him or know of his presence. And I felt his anger towards this dilemma. I
could feel his fury growing. He was short and crouched, naked with an
enlarged head and skin that I can only describe as seeming like shark skin. It
was bluish and it looked to be smooth, impervious, but textured as well. His
shoulders leaned forward towards me as though he were dramatically leaning forward with his hands on his knees. He
had a pot-like belly and wrinkles around his almond eyes. Now, the next thing Emma knew, she was back in bed with her
husband, Edward, and both were awakened by a huge crashing noise coming from the
dining room. Edward leaped out of bed and rushed to check the room while Emma
tried to stop him and tell him about her dream. But by this point, Edward was already walking down the hallway. So,
Emma followed him. And inside the dining room, they found a very puzzling scene.
As Emma says, he went and I followed from the bedroom to the dining room. The
corner table had smashed to the ground, two legs broken off, although no
pictures or vases on the table broke. Was even more strange that it seemed to be under the dining table. That's when
we realized the dining table had moved a good 3 ft towards the wall with the
corner where there is a window. This mystery soon deepened because this window is hooked up to an alarm.
However, for the first time, their alarm system malfunctioned. This alarm system
is controlled by an electronic tablet. However, when they tried it, none of the buttons would work. Nothing they could
do would make this work. All of the windows and doors were still secured and locked, so there was no evidence of any
intruder other than this broken table. But then something even stranger happened. as Emma says. My fiance was
then drawn to the front window and he said, "Let's look outside." And to our
shock, two unusual and completely never-beforeseen bright orbs hung ahead from our front
door. We saw unusual hovering lights. We've never seen anything like this.
They did immediately grab a camera and snapped several photos. They say that one of the photos does clearly show one
of these orbs. Unfortunately, this photo, although they tried, is not included in their report on the case.
That case is interesting to me in a number of different ways. One is that it starts out with what appears to be a
lucid dream. But was it? Perhaps this lady was awake. She herself is not
entirely certain, but absolutely made a point of saying that this was not like
any other dream she's ever had. And the fact is there's this physical evidence
with the table being broken and the alarm not working and then actually
seeing orbs right in front of their eyes. So clearly something was going on
beyond just a dream. and also really unusual gray type ET as well. A
fascinating case. Now, let's move to our final case in this compilation which I
call I felt I was being tagged. This one occurred on October 6, 2023 in Olympia,
Washington. This is another single witness case, but very recent. A number
of you out there have asked for more recent cases. Well, here you go. And this guy had a very closeup sighting of
a UFO and ETSs, multiple UFOs, multiple ETs. Actually, one really interesting
thing about this case is for me when it occurred. We often see people having
encounters at pivotal points in their lives. That's absolutely true in this case. The witness in this final case is
Chris. That is a pseudonym. He was upset from having just gone through a recent divorce and decided to take a drive and
he was crossing over a bridge located at 794 Madrona Beach Road Northwest. You
can see it here. This is over a tributary of the Puet Sound in Olympia, Washington. It was about 9:30 p.m.
October 6th. There were no cars on the road as Chris pulled over to vent his
anger over being forced to move out because of his recent divorce. So he
yelled out and this is when something very strange happened. As Chris says,
right after I yelled, I looked up and was struck in my head with a beam of electric current that sent a shock wave
through my body. I saw red current flowing through my head and body. I
started to mumble. Time went very slow, like being zapped and having time slowing down. So wondering what the heck
was happening to him, he looked over to his side, over the side of the bridge to the water, and this is when he saw an
incredible sight. As Chris says, I looked to the side over the lake bank,
hovering about 20 to 50 ft off the ground, parallel to my view from the small bridge about 100 ft away from me,
I saw three gray aliens in two different crafts. One gray alien was in a 30foot
circular craft that was about 30 ft away from me at eye level to my height from the bridge where the zap pulse
electrical surge had come from. I glanced at the other two grays who definitely heard my yell. They were in a
triangular craft. I could see a panel of lit buttons in the craft as I was level to their height from my point of view on
the small bridge. The triangular craft had to have been over 100 ft because what I could see was just the front of
the craft. The two gray aliens looked at each other in a sort of confused telepathy. When
they looked back at me, I felt they were wondering, "Why am I yelling now?" My brain realized, "Wait, what? Holy bleep.
These are gray aliens. What the f?" I could tell they were doing telepathy
because right after my thinking of these words, they felt like, "Oh crap, he knows." Kind of a feeling from my
observation. These objects made no sound at all that Chris could hear. And as he
watched these two grays, one of them appeared to press a button on this panel and the craft at this point seemed to
dissolve and disappear. Weirdly, Chris could still see the outline of the craft hovering there. So, it was like it
cloaked itself and actually watched the outline of this craft as it moved in a slow upward diagonal movement and was
gone. Now, in the days and months that followed, Chris felt as if he was somehow being tracked by these ETs. And
as he says, I felt I was being tagged. Even one year later, he says he is still
able to sense their presence. Pretty short case, and I suspect that a
face-to-face interview with the witness would reveal quite a few more details.
What's interesting to me is his feeling of being watched following this encounter. Like you said, I felt like
I've been tagged. This is something many witnesses describe that once they have
an encounter, they have this ongoing connection with the ETSs. Clearly, they
showed up for some reason. And as I said at the beginning, some people when they
have their encounters, it's during a really important moment in their lives. They might be going through a breakup.
They might have just gotten a new job or moved or going through some sort of spiritual awakening. And we see that in
this case. So that to me is fascinating because I think what's going on here is
that the grays are connected to these people and are coming for that reason. I
am just speculating here, but we see it so often that clearly something is going on. There has to be a connection. I
don't know. There's the facts. You can make up your own mind about it. But those are the 10 cases I've chosen for
you today. I hope you found them interesting. I think this is such an important subject. Everyone in the world
deserves to know about it. There's so many cases. There's far more evidence
than certainly skeptics realize. And I think it's time that this subject goes
mainstream and gets some real attention and study because it's not going away.
UFOs are a part of our culture permanently and it's time we accept
that. At any rate, thank you very much. I truly appreciate you guys tuning in
every week. Hope you've enjoyed this episode and perhaps learned something. Until next time, keep asking those hard
questions. Keep searching for the truth and most important of all, keep having fun and I will see you next Friday. Bye
for now.
