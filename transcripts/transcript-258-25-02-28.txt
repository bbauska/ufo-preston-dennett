UFOS IN ANTARCTICA: TWELVE TRUE CASES
Feb 28, 2025

Summary:
Feb 28, 2025
It’s the coldest, windiest, driest, highest and most remote place on Earth. Its average temperature is 50-70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. It has no permanent residents. It contains up to 90 percent of the world’s freshwater. It covers 5.5 million square miles, about 98 percent of which is covered with ice. This is, of course, Antarctica. Nobody owns it. The 1951 Antarctic treaty outlawed ownership, and limits its use to peaceful, scientific research. Each year, 1000-5000 scientists and military officers are stationed at the various bases. About 40,000 tourists visit there yearly. As with the Arctic, conspiracies abound, from secret Nazi bases, to an entrance to the hollow Earth. True or not, what is undeniably true is that the Antarctic has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. This video presents twelve cases of UFOs in Antarctica. They reach back 75 years and include sightings, landings, and humanoids. A few represent some of the best-verified UFO encounters in the history of ufology.

WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS TO PROVE WHAT WE SAW. While at the Chilean base, Arturo Prat, on February 23, 1948 Captain Augusto Vars Orrego of the Chilean Navy says that “During the bright Antarctic night, we saw flying saucers, one above the other, turning at tremendous speeds. We have photographs to prove what we saw.” Sadly, the photos were never released.

THE COLD SCRUTINY OF UNKNOWN EYES. On January 8, 1956. Four Chilean scientists stationed at Robertson Island in the Weddell Sea saw two metallic cigar-shaped objects hovering in a vertical position overhead. Thus began an hours-long encounter during which their Geiger counter went off. They took many photographs, but again, the photos have never been released.

I’M ASHAMED TO SAY I PANICKED. On December 11, 1958, McMurdo Sound Base, AQI Roger Benson was driving a snow-tractor outside the base when he came upon a landed UFO and a strange humanoid. He drove away in fear. At that time, a wave of sightings swept the area, many of which were caught on radar. Rear Admiral Dufek, then in charge of the base said, “I believe in UFOs.”

A POLISHED GOLD SURFACE. On June 7, 1962, Navy scientists at Hallett Station saw a brilliant golden disc in the sky. They were able to use binoculars to discern the disc-shape of a solid object. Despite this, Project Blue Book labeled the case as the sighting of Jupiter.

UFO INVESTIGATES NUCLEAR TEST. On July 9, 1962, the US detonated a 1.45 megaton in space 250 miles over Johnson Atoll, blowing out Earth’s magnetic field for 30 seconds, knocking out several satellites, and damaging the electric grid. Following the explosion, an expedition in Antarctica viewed a massive UFO heading to the area of the explosion.

UFOs TAKE CONTROL OF AIRCRAFT. On April 20, 1964, a C-130 flight near McMurdo Station lost power. Nine UFOs showed up and held the plane aloft for many miles. The crew took 9 rolls of film. The strangest part of the encounter happened when the plane landed and the crew unloaded the equipment, which weighed far less than it should.

UFO WAVE OVER DECEPTION ISLAND. In June and July of 1965, a wave of UFO sightings swept over the military and scientific bases stationed on Deception Island. With hundreds of observations by trained observers, recorded with a variety of scientific instrumentation, including photos, the wave represents undeniable evidence of UFO reality.

THE BUZZING CLOUD. On May 22, 1966, a British survey team at Mount Gaudry observed a strange cloud-like object sending a beam down to the ground, and moving in ways that ruled out conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon.

UFO OVER VOLCANIC ERUPTION. On December 4, 1967, a volcanic eruption at Mount Deception forced an emergency evacuation and destroyed both the British and Chilean stations located there. Incredibly, a photo captured not only the disaster, but what appears to be a UFO.

ANTARCTICA UFO CRASH. Reports of UFO crashes abound and there is at least one in Antarctica. Although not well-verified, reportedly in October 1982 when an expedition searching for meteorites allegedly came upon a crashed craft and five ET bodies.

THEY’RE DOING THE STRANGEST THING. Per Linda Moulton Howe, in 1983 (date approx.) “Brian,” claims that while based at McMurdo he was on a flight over the Transantarctic Mountains when they encountered a group of UFOs on maneuvers, one of several strange events he experienced.

AN ENORMOUS CIRCLE OF LIGHT. In April 1991, scientists at the Argentinian General San Martin Base received anomalous readings on their scientific instrumentation indicating the presence of a large power source overhead. Hours later, one of the men made a visual observation of a massive object.

With so many encounters, observed by so many trained scientists, verified by such a wide variety of scientific instruments and photographed, there is only one possible conclusion: the Antarctic is being visited by UFOs.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal thank you for joining me
today's episode is called UFOs in Antarctica 12 true cases some of you
have may already seen my episode about UFOs in the Arctic 24 cases please don't
confuse these two locations they're very different Antarctica is of course located in the South Pole and yeah I
wanted to do some real deep Research into this particular location because the number of conspiracies and wild
speculations about this area are off the charts so it really took me some time to
sort of sift through all that and get to the truth of what's going on there in regards to UFOs but I did find at least
12 very well authenticated cases that's what I want to talk about today but
before I dive into the actual cases let me tell you a little bit about this very strange and unique location on our
planet you may not be aware of this but the Antarctic is the coldest windiest
driest highest and most remote location on this planet there's some very
interesting things about it nobody actually owns Antarctica in fact in
1959 some 12 countries agreed to abide by the so-called Antarctic treaty and
this holds that nobody owns the area but but that will be reserved for scientific
peaceful research at least seven countries have made territorial claims
including Argentina Australia Chile France New Zealand Norway the UK and of
course the United States these are not really internationally recognized uh but these countries have
maintained bases there on a fairly regular basis now the population in
Antarctica as you might expect is quite small it ranges anywhere from 1,000 to
5,000 people at any given time interestingly 11 babies have been born
there there have been quite a few deaths one murder as far as I know of uh now
here's a really interesting fact about Antarctica it contains somewhere between
60 to 90% of the world's fresh water that's a
lot and it's very cold there like I said the coldest place on Earth with an average temperature somewhere in the
neighborhood of- 76° F that's cold it is covered by a
huge ice sheet uh which is about 3 mil
thick it's actually now a tourist destination some 40,000 tourists visit there each year if
it is the fifth largest continent contains about 5.5 million square miles
90% of which is covered with ice again zero permanent residence it
has six months of constant day alternated with 6 months of constant night and here's another interesting
fact when you stand at the the South Pole every single Direction you point to
is North so I mean that seems obvious but it's still kind of interesting
uh there's not much Wildlife there really the only major Wildlife are penguins seals whales there are no polar
bears in Antarctica and of course all kinds of
wild conspiracies as I mentioned Admiral bird and his Flames or
you know rumors of there being an entrance to the hollow Earth which I frankly don't find credible but also
rumor of a secret Nazi base um Lost Cities I mean you name it people have
speculated about the Antarctica for a long long time so again
I'm just going to confine this episode to cases that I think are pretty well
authenticated uh there's one or two that might be a little bit dubious but most
of them are really well authenticated very well documented and and extremely
important actually I mean a couple of these cases might be some of my favorite that I've ever looked into so this
includes mostly sightings but apparent landing and a humanoid a possible UFO
crash that is the dubious one as you might expect but I think you'll find this
super fascinating there's so much speculation about what's going on there
it should be interesting to see you know what we can actually verify so let's start with the first really
well documented early case which I call we have photographs to prove what we saw
this occurred on February 23rd 1948 at the base of Arthur Pratt and
this is like just a few months before the Modern Age of euphology which really
began in July of 1947 so that alone makes this a pretty important case but as we get into it I I
think you'll find it really quite astonishing it was during an expedition to the Chilean Antarctic base of uro
Pratt on February 23rd 1948 that Captain austo vars origo of
the Chilean Navy said that and I quote during the bright Antarctic night we saw
flying saucers one above the other turning at tremendous speeds we have
photographs to prove what we saw now in another statement to reporters he said I
don't think that this was an optical illusion we have corroboration of what we saw from photographs taken of the
phenomenon now according to some sources it wasn't just photographs that they took but actual videos we don't have a
whole lot of information other than this Donald kho heard about this case and he
said and again I quote later when I requested copies from the Chilean Embassy in Washington I was told the
pictures were classified but get this in a direct letter to the Chilean Navy itself this
message was received in response it says and I quote we are pleased to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter regarding the photographs showing UFOs informational flight which you mention
were taken by Captain Oro of the Chilean Navy near Antarctica in
1948 regarding this matter we wish to inform you that recently we received a
communication from Captain Oro stating that he had not seen any UFOs over the
Antarctica in 1948 therefore the photographs requested by you do not exist signed Herold Nagel
captain Chief of the Chilean Naval Mission so there you go that's all we
know about this first case in Antarctica so there you have it a Lar
large group of trained military observers not only seeing UFOs but photographing them and what happens
these photographs are covered up never released never happened according to
authorities so the cover up was in place very early on and here's another case
that speaks to that this is such an amazing case I can't believe this one is not more welln I call this next case a
cold scrutiny of unknown eyes this occurred on January 8th
1956 at Robertson island of course in the Antarctic this is such an important case
I think it has a lot to say about UFOs it's very well documented and not relying simply on eyewitness testimony
because in this case as in a good number of these cases there's scientific instrumentation verifying the presence
of these unknown objects there are four witnesses to this case all Chilean
scientists their names are celestino Castro Abelardo Bez Jorge motor and Juan
Adat they were all stationed at the foot of a glacier located on the tiny and remote Robertson island in the wetle sea
of Antarctica this is about 13 M long 6 Mi wide and they were there in order to
make scientific observations now the first strange event which occurred on January 8th
1956 was The Unexplained failure of the camp radio which considering what
happened next the scientists believe this is significant it was at this time the sun
was never completely setting this was affecting all of their sleeping habits two of the men celestino and Jorge
shared a tent and around 7 a.m. celestino stepped
out of his tent and saw a metallic object hovering overhead the sky was
perfectly clear at this time the temperature was about 15 to 20° below zero so he immediately woke up Jorge and
insisted that he'd come outside the two men saw two metallic cigar-shaped
objects hovering in a vertical position straight overhead and as one of the
witnesses says the things looked utterly solid with smooth polished seemingly
metallic surfaces so another one of the witnesses was Abelardo Bez you can see
him here he recently granted an extensive interview about what happened
and as he says there were two Zeppelins like pencils with that shape which were
vertically in the sky and did not move static in the air they had no windows
you could see Violet purple and silver color changes it was something impressive I didn't feel scared but
rather I was asking myself questions as to what this was all about Jorge motor
went crazy he went back inside the shelter to make certain measurements he brought an altimeter which for me a
Layman was something spectacular with that he measured the height of the object it was practically 150 M long 450
ft so that's pretty big so wondering if this was a trick of the atmosphere the four men moved to another position but
still the objects remained in the sky one was slightly higher than the other so all four of them watched in amazement
for the next two hours and it was during this time they took numerous photographs
both in color and in black and white film after about 2 hours of observation
the higher object moved to a horizontal position and began to glow and Flash
multicolored lights then as if intentionally putting on a display for the four scientists it began to perform
a series of fantastic Maneuvers doing instant accelerations zigzagging across
the sky coming to a complete stop turning at 90° angles it did this for
about 5 minutes then resumed its original vertical position but then the
second craft did the same darn thing flashing colors and cavorting around the sky doing about 10 Maneuvers for a
period of 3 minutes both of these were done in perfect silence but during this
time the G Geer counter that they had on site became activated and indicated a
radiation exposure some 40 times greater than normal so all four of the men as
you can imagine we very much impressed by the movement of these objects and as Abelardo Bez says the objects began to
make some movements at a speed that was calculated at 45,000 km per hour they
moved in zigzag and then stopped dead in their tracks human beings at that speed
inside those objects would be crushed by inertia that meant to him meaning Jorge
motor that they were not beings of this planet so at this point they realized
that they were seeing genuine UFOs and became quite concerned about it being in
such a remote area with such a hostile climate they had no means of Escape or protection the four men felt certain
that the UFO occupants were there for them as there was nothing else in this area they felt that they were being
quote subjected to the cold scrutiny of unknown and unknowable eyes now Jorge
said that being the object of attention from a quote such Superior technology
was anything but soothing now these objects stayed there for an incredibly long time they remained overhead for the
entire day and into the night when night arrived the men were too concerned by the presence of the objects to even
attempt to go to sleep and these objects remain there through the night and into the next day by late afternoon of the
second day some serious clouds moved overhead Jorge began to use a theodoly
and he estimated that the two cigar-shaped craft were about 24,000 ft
overhead which again meant that they were some 450 ft long and 75 ft in
diameter celestino used binoculars to view the objects and he saw what looked like a hatchway on one of them finally
to sort of provoker response hor Jorge decided to take a mirror with a
polarized lens and he pointed it at the upper object flashing it immediately as
if in response the object flashed an intensely bright light and dropped to a
much lower altitude and as it moved lower celestino became upset fact he
became upset to such a degree that he kicked this device and broke it as Abelardo says celestino Castro got very
upset he got scared he hit it with a stick and broke the mirror so that the objects would not continue to approach
because as he communicated the objects came a little closer celestina was afraid that if they kept coming closer
and the radioactivity kept increasing we would all die so yeah this did provoke a
fear response from at least cestino Abelardo says that he and the other two men experienced no fear but
celestino who he describes his quote A very wise old man an extraordinary man
was for some reason very much affected as Abelardo says he went into a state of
Anguish of panic so after several long tense moments the objects rose up back
to their original positions and performed this incredible sky dance stting across the sky with
extreme speeds eventually the clouds rolled in and obscured the objects from View was around 2 a.m. that the Geer
counter stopped flashing which indicated to the men that the objects had likely left and a few hours later when the
clouds cleared the objects were as they suspected now gone but the four men were
then picked up by their country on January 20th they were reluctant at first to speak about what happened but
finally agreed to tell a high ranking officer and this had some consequences
as Abelardo said says the Commodore the captain who was in charge of the whole Expedition strictly forbade us to
comment anything otherwise we would have to assume the consequences now despite this one of the
witnesses Jorge motor did agree to a television interview but only if his
face was not shown and it was many decades later that Abelardo Bez did agree to a lengthy
interview unfortunately the photographs that were taken of this incident have
never never been released man oh man what I would do to get my hands on those
photographs must be amazing they're somewhere hopefully at some point this
ridiculous UFO coverup will end we can get access to all of this documentation
and photographs about all of these cases cuz really it's time why this subject
continues to be covered up is beyond me to some extent I mean we know why I
think it really needs to end now here's another Super interesting case this is
the only well verified case I could find of a humanoid in the Antarctic but it's
a pretty darn interesting case I call this one I'm ashamed to say I panicked
that is of course a direct quote by the witness himself this occurred on December 11
1958 at the very famous McMurdo Station in Antarctica this one is amazing this
incredible account comes from researcher Ivan s derfield who published the story
in ideal UFO magazine issue number two there's only one witness a Navy officer
by the name of Roger D Benson he was 30 years old at the time stationed at
McMurdo base which is in the shadow of Mount arabus Roger D Benson was an
AQ I an aviation Fire Control technician petty officer so part of his duties
included transporting waste and it was on December 11
1958 it was a warm day for Antarctica 20° fah Roger was driving a w11 weasel
truck vehicle transporting waste off of the base when he noticed a strange
object in the distance and I'll just quote him directly as he said there shouldn't be anything there I was
curious I radioed that I was getting out of my vehicle jumped out onto the ice
and took a closer look at first I thought I was looking at some object made up of girds like a Tower
observation or a gigantic radar antenna I looked through the binoculars I was
seeing what resembled a side view of an airplane fuselage and the beams were a
network of support structures like a gear train Landing this quote fuselage
was a cigar-shaped metal capsule with a small indentation that could have been a
door this whole thing seemed to be about 500 yards from me which would make the
object the same size as a DC airplane 3 although I am completely familiar with
aircraft that was not any plane that belonged to us or the Russians then I
saw the creature so this strange craft was parked on the ice with large Landing
legs he says and the creature Roger says he saw was walking beneath it was
walking in slow circles around the base of the craft and he could clearly see that it was not any normal human being
as Roger says the being was very thin and grayish in color its arms were
swinging as it walked on the ice from a distance I couldn't be sure but it seemed to have humanlike facial features
except that the face consumed almost 2/3 of its body at full height I'm ashamed
to say now that I did exactly what I shouldn't have contrary to the training I received I panicked I climbed into my
vehicle went back to the base and screamed into the radio after a few
seconds I controlled myself to look back the fuselage capsule minus the beam
shaped landing gear which could have been retracted was now Rising into the air I stopped long enough to see the
thing Fly Away presumably with that strange creature inside so Roger was apparently afraid of ridicule and
disbelief and did not report his sighting to his superiors he did learn something interesting however he learned
that his second panicked radio transmission was never received he did
report a sighting to his friends and later of course to researcher yvon derfield but as it turns out a lot of
sightings were occurring at this time as EV Ivon derfield writes and I quote as
operation deep freeze spread spre across the Antarctic in 1957 and
1958 radar trackingsm commonplace and she's not the
only person saying that Phi Steven B bugs a member of deep freeze later wrote
we were getting radar tracking which were confirmed by operators at three or four different locations on the air and
ground there was absolutely no doubt that real UFOs were being observed regularly and frequently and in fact
fact only two months earlier Dr Yuri I danov a leading Russian Glacier expert
stationed at vasto near the South geometric pole wrote that he and his fellow scientists were quote pestered by
a low-flying disc as he says it was like a flat stone but apparently made of
steel and it moved in total silence it flew over us and then made another pass
at lower altitude we had an eerie feeling not only that we were being watched but that some force was
attempting to communicate with us I remember a stirring in my mind I'm
absolutely convinced this was a voyager from the cosmos so it sounds like he's
describing telepathy now this again during operation deep freeze which Roger D
Benson says he was a part of was led by us rear Admiral George J duek Who You
can see here and he later gave an interview with certainly raised eyebrows when he said and I quote I believe in
UFOs I think that the existence of flying saucers cannot be discounted
reports of meteors probably were saucers driven from Venus or other planets by
intelligent beings how incredible is that I tried so hard to locate the
firsthand witness Roger Benson I could not do it and yeah it is a single
witness case but give all those sightings going around that area at that time I think that provides
a level of corroboration to what Mr Benson says he saw again you can make up your own minds
about it I'm just reporting the facts as we know them and I think that's an important and amazing case and here's
another one definitely UFOs are showing an interest in Antarctica as this next
case shows which I call a polished gold surface this occurred on June 7
1962 at helit station in Antarctica and
another amazing case of a UFO seen by trained military scientist observers
Navy scientists were at halet research station on June 7 1962 when their
attention was drawn to a brilliant white light which they said was 20 times brighter than the brightest star in the
sky they watched this thing move across the sky low on the horizon and then stop directly between two mountain peaks they
use binoculars to view this object and could now see that it was circular with a dazzling gold color which they said
was similar to the sun's reflection off of a polished gold surface now at the
time of this sighting the sun was actually below the Horizon and after about 5 minutes this glowing object
moved to the South behind one of the Peaks and not come out the other side as it should have this is when project
Bluebook investigated and they had to use Mental acrobatics and blamed the scientists get this for mistaking the
object for Jupiter apparently ignoring the fact that this object had a polished gold surface moved across the sky
stopped and then moved again not to mention the fact that these were trained observers and that Jupiter had already
set below the Horizon nevertheless Blue Book writes it is probable that a strong
inversion was present in the area at the time of the sighting and that strange effects associated with this condition
contributed to the sighting there were a few other sightings around that time 2 weeks later on June 22nd
1962 there was a 2 second long sighting of a brilliant object zipping across the
sky leaving a vapor trail this was observed from Detachment alpha blue book
heard about this one and concluded that this was a meteor which certainly seems possible 2 weeks after this on July 7th
1962 a man was on the roof of the building when he saw a brilliant light
which he first thought was a flare he said it was as large as a basketball and it had two smaller dimmer lights all
three moved across the sky from Southwest to Northwest this was labeled as a bolide
now these last two sightings may have been due to as Blue Book says quote natural causes but the first sighting on
June 7 absolutely seems genuine researchers who looked into Blue Book's
conclusions called them quote bogus and inconsistent and pointed out that if it
had in fact been Jupiter it would have been seen on succeeding nights which of course it was not how about that amazing
it's even more amazing is how Military Intelligence Project Blue Book does back
Bend IN incredible mental gymnastics to try to explain these cases away honestly
saying that these scientists observed Jupiter when they know full well what Jupiter looks like and again as someone
else noted it would have been seen there on a nightly basis and was just seen there the one time so don't know what
they're trying to make us believe with these ridiculous explanations it really
only goes to show how faulty they are in their attempts to discredit this
sighting and this subject in general so now let's move to the next case which is
a really important one and this one is very interesting which I call UFO
investigates nuclear test look this date up July 9
1962 I think you'll find it fascinating what happened on that day where a
nuclear bomb was launched punched and caused some very strange effects which I'll get into in just a second as part
of what came to be known as operation starfish Prime on July 9
1962 the United States detonated a 1.45 Megaton hydrogen bomb in space 250
Mi above Johnson ATL now this is 100 times more powerful than the bomb
dropped on Hiroshima and was in fact the largest nuclear test in outer space it
knocked several satellites out it created a power surge which impacted the electrical grid on the Hawaiian Islands
actually destroying more than 300 street lights on the island of aahu this
massive explosion sent out a powerful EMP an electromagnetic pulse which
created a widespread Aurora throughout the Pacific it reportedly expelled
Earth's magnetic field for a period of 30 full seconds now important here is
what happened following this explosion a massive UFO appeared over Antarctica Dr
helard and seven other members of his party observed an object that they
described as a Shining Light circular in shape this object was in view for about
1 minute as it passed from South to Northeast as it moved overhead they took
color photographs of this object speaking later to reporters Dr helard described the UFO as completely alien in
design and performance to any known phenomena in relative to this earth the members of the team knew about the
explosion over Johnson ATL as the Aurora was clearly visible from their location
they thought it significant that the object they observed was heading on a straight course directly for the
location of this explosion very strange and while that nuclear test wasn't done
anywhere near Antarctica witnesses there apparently saw a UFO heading for that
area so I can't say for sure that those two events are directly connected but
knowing that UFOs Express an incredible interest in anything nuclear I think
it's safe to say that they certainly knew about it and the fact that it occurred moments before or you know
around the same time as this nuclear test also I think argues for there being a connection there and now we get to
what is absolutely my favorite case in this episode and perhaps one of my
favorite cases I've ever heard about I mean this was this one's so astonishing
on multiple levels I absolutely love this case because of the aftermath mostly of what happened here but all
throughout it I mean it is amazing I call this one UFO takes control of
aircraft and not in a bad way I don't think I think actually as we'll see in this case
these UFOs were rescuing this aircraft from what appeared to be inant disaster
this occurred on April 20 1964 near McMurdo Station in the
Antarctic and wow I mean just listen stay tuned because this one is amazing
it was early on the morning of April 20 1964 as six members of a Uso Coast Guard
aircraft were flying to McMurdo Naval Air station in a C130 turboprop
Transport Aircraft filled with supplies for the base they were at about 35,000
ft altitude when one of the men looked out the right side of the plane and was shocked to see nine glowing white
objects approaching their aircraft in a V formation at an estimated speed of
about 400 knots in mere moments these objects were flying right alongside the
plane on the right side slowing their Pace to match the speed of the
C130 after just a few moments these objects Rose upward and took position on
the left side of the plane now these objects were not visible on the plane's radar the pilot attempted to communicate
by radio but discovered that the radio was not working also the plane's radar
stopped functioning now it appears that the plane was in distress because it was around this time that the engines
stopped functioning apparently due to the oil freezing from the very very low
temperatures the pilot tried to switch to auxiliary power and discovered that this also was not
functioning now even though the engines were not actually running at this time the aircraft maintained a quote steady
altitude and course which is really quite strange it should have dropped Like a Rock they thought but this plane
would but the plane was flying in perfect perfect silence apparently with the assistance of the UFOs or so
believed the crew the pilot was unable to steer the plane at all he could not make it go up down left or right it
appeared as if someone else clearly the UFO occupants had taken control of the
C130 things became even more strange when they began to enter a quote strange
Haze causing a complete white out now this can be very dangerous in a previous
incident Colonel Joseph dobratz he was well known for flying the
c130s in McMurdo at this time in fact he could very well be the pilot on this
flight though I was not able to confirm this but again on a previous incident
Colonel Joseph dobratz described how they had entered a cloud and it coated
the plane with ice and they were barely able to land so this is a very
concerning situation as this C130 enters this quote strange Haze and it was
strange because immediately that when they flew into this Cloud the air became filled with static electricity which
actually started to cause arcing inside the aircraft itself the passengers who
got too close to the Fus Lage actually found themselves getting shocked and it was during this time that
crew members managed to take no less than nine rolls of photograph graphs of these glowing objects next to their
plane now after about 20 minutes this Haze vanished the power suddenly
returned and the crew were immediately able to restart the engines all of their equipment functioned normally the radar
the radio all of it now this flight had covered a distance of some 265 nautical
miles over a period of 50 minutes from the moment the UFOs appeared to when
they departed and this did not make sense as the plane had been traveling only about 160 to 190 knots per hour so
in other words the appearance of the UFO had shortened their travel time by almost an
hour finally they landed at McMurdo and the crew members excitedly discussed
their incredible UFO encounter among themselves and later to their superiors
they turned in seven of the nine roles of film to their superiors keeping two of them but they also discovered some
other strange details was then that they realized that the C130 still had far
more fuel on board than it should have which confirmed that some 265 miles were
flown with the aircraft engines off and not consuming fuel then came the most
astounding and Incredibly strange detail of this event as they began to unload
the equipment and the supplies from the C130 much of the material weighed far
less than it should it had been reduced in weight as one of the crew members later told
researchers if you had a metal chain that should weigh one pound it now weighed a half pound so it appeared that
the objects made of iron or steel were the most affected while the metal Island
while the metal items made of aluminum and other Alloys did not appear to be affected but they all lost weight in
fact the most dramatic example of this were the two heavy d18 tractors which
weighed far less than they should have and were easily unloaded because they were half their normal weight so
following this incident all six crew members were questioned for a period of no less than two days about what
happened uh some of the questioners were Naval Intelligence Officers all of the
crew members of the C130 were told in no uncertain terms to keep their mouths
shut about the incident now the crew member who had turned over the seven roles of footage to his superiors and
save two roles for himself had his two roles of film developed only to discover
that the film was completely fogged as if exposed to some kind of radiation not one of his photos came out and he later
learned that the other seven roles given to his superiors suffered the same fate
now incidentally this is a tangent was only 4 days later that one of the most famous UFO incidents in US history
occurred the April T4 1964 landing at sakuro New Mexico which was witnessed by
police officer lonni Zamora but meanwhile back at McMurdo one of the
crewmen states that 9 months later on January 3rd 1965 he was a crew member of another
C130 flight about 100 miles from the location of the earlier encounter when
suddenly the C130 lost all power including secondary power and also radio
crew members actually began to prepare to parachute from the craft when suddenly quote an elongated glowing
tear-shaped object passed by the plane making a quote hell of a bang the C130 slipped
into the wash left behind and was buffed around this craft that was bu them they
said it glowed gold and light blue and left a vapor trail one of the crew members did manage to take seven Rolls
of film he said this thing was larger than the C130 3 minutes later the power on the
plane was mysteriously restored so perhaps this is another incident where the UFO is helping the plane somehow
hard to say for sure but they radioed the base to see if they had any other aircraft on radar and were told no upon
Landing the film was turned over to the Navy reportedly the film did show the objects in perfect clarity but once
again we never got to see these photos another case that's really undeniable
well more than one case as you've seen love to get a hold of those photographs the ones that turned out man oh man that
case of these UFOs next to that plane and afterwards them unloading the
equipment and realizing it had been reduced in weight significantly I think
that's an very important detail which has a lot to say about how gravity is
connected to electromagnetism this is the kind of case that really offers us an
opportunity to learn more about this universe we live in such an important case on multiple
levels now let's move to another case which is absolutely undeniable because
this is not just one sighting or two or three or four but a dozen over a very short period of time this is clearly
some kind of display with the UFO occupants wanting us to know that they
are absolutely aware of what we're doing down in Antarctica I call this one UFO
wave over Deception Island this occurred through June and July of
1965 again in Deception Island and such an amazing case because it's so well
verified so widely viewed residents of multiple countries saw these objects
again these are scientists trained weather observers but even more astonishing is how they were able to
verify the presence of these craft using scientific instrumentation that really revealed
some incredible details about these UFOs
so yeah this one is such an important case really should be taught in history books honestly Deception Island got its
name deception because it looks like an island but it's really in a tall it has has a watery Center it is one island in
the group of South Shetland Islands located on the Antarctic Peninsula which
is just south of South America well not just south some distance but it is also
the location of one of the most remarkable series of UFO Encounters in this history of encounters not only in
the Antarctic but really in the world at the time of this wave from June to July
of 1965 three nations were maintained aing research stations on the island
including the English base Bravo at Keta balanos the Chilean base Pedro auir
Serta at Keta pendulum and the Argentinian base at May Bay and the
first of what would be at least a dozen sightings occurred at 5:45 on June 2nd
1965 when five witnesses at the English base Bravo saw a brilliantly lit
fast moving silent object maneuver across the sky in a zigzag fashion
accelerating decelerating hovering but moving generally towards the east the
witnesses said it would flare red green and yellow as it performed these fantastic Maneuvers a pattern which
would be repeated on several sightings soon to occur it was one day later at almost exactly the same time 5:30 p.m.
June 3rd 1965 when two officers stationed at orcadas observed a round white object
moving at High Velocity in a parabola across the sky disappearing after about
15 seconds of observation day after day sightings 4 days later at 5:50 p.m. June
7 1965 meteorologist Jorge stanich was
performing routine observations at the Argentinian base at May Bay when he
noticed a bright yellow light low on the horizon he estimates it was just over 1
mile away and about 100 to 150 ft in diameter was only in view for about 5
Seconds when it disappeared but just one day later less it was the next morning at 2:20 a.m.
June 8 1965 that he saw the same or similar object again near the same area but
closer this time about 3/4s a mile away he estimates that this object was was
about 50 to 65 ft in diameter so 2 minutes after it disappeared into the
clouds he heard what he described as a quote grave sound which was apparently
unusual and he mentioned it because he felt it might possibly be connected in
some way to the encounter though of course this was never confirmed the wave wasn't over yet 11
days later at 2:20 p.m. on June 18 nine Air Force officers at the Chilean base
at Kaa pendulum saw a glowing solid object zigzagging across the sky for
some 25 minutes they described its appearance as being very much like a large star white with orange Hues
clearly not a star if it's zigzagging and there's some reports that there were other sightings on the 19th
and the 22nd but really it was some 2 weeks later at 7:15 p.m. July 2nd
1965 when five Garrison off officers at English Bas Bravo were doing routine
weather observations and they said that they saw a light hovering accelerating
zigzagging for a period of a full 15 to 20 minutes again during this time this
object would change colors turning green red and yellow it was the very next day
at 5:03 p.m. July 3rd 1965 when two weather observers Jose
jerik and Jose mazuch K were at the Argentinian base on Lori Island when
they observed a blue white object which say they said was brighter than the brightest star and it moved in a
parabola from east to west but most interesting was that during this time
their variometers which measure magnetic fields showed a sudden and strong
disturbance which coincided with the appearance and movement of this object
and it was just 2 hours and 20 20 minutes later at 7:20 p.m. that nine
Garrison officers at the Chilean base on Deception Island described their
sighting of a glowing solid object which maneuvered overhead for a full 20
minutes again it also changed in color from green to yellow and orange it moved
in a straight line oscillating slightly but did hover momentarily they were able
to view it using binoculars they tracked it with a theodolite instrument and and
on magnetic instruments the commander of the base Don Maris Juan Barrera said and
I quote what we observed was no hallucination or Collective psychosis it
was not a star for it had a very rapid and continuous movement as far as I'm
concerned it is a celestial object that I am unable to identify that it could be
an aircraft constructed on this Earth I do not believe possible but what's most
about this is a magnetic field was detected coming from this object and it
was a huge magnetic field adjusting for its distance they measured this magnetic
field at some 49 million Earth Deads now this is really a high magnetic field cuz
the highest artificially produced magnetic field is 20 Teslas and one Tesla equals somewhere between 4,000 or
10,000 EDS so yeah clearly this object was producing an enormous magnetic field
just 2 minutes later after this sighting 17 officers at the Argentinian base on
Deception Island described their sighting of a large circular object
solid with a red Center and edges that appeared to flare in different colors
yellow green orange blue and white they watched as it moved in a zigzag pattern
hovered accelerated sharply reversing directions and Performing all kinds of
movements for a period of 1 hour and 2 minutes now some of the officers said
that they were able to take photographs of this object as it maneuvered overhead
later the secretary of the Argentinian Navy released a statement saying in part
that the object was quote a giant lens-shaped flying object solid in
appearance they estimate its altitude was about 15,000 ft professor Charles
man calls the July 3rd sightings quote one of the most significant sightings of
an unidentified flying object because as he says this sighting is notable because
it was observed by scientists and Navy personnel of three countries by a total
of 31 persons but the wave wasn't over yet 4 days later at 8:55 a.m. July 7
1965 Personnel at gable Island saw a circular bright silver object which
remained stationary overhead for 2 or 3 minutes then moved off to the east over
beagle Canal actually sending down a brilliant beam of light into the water piercing right through a cloud layer the
last and final sighting of this month-long wave occurred on July 8th
1965 when another object was seen again performing fantastic Maneuvers again
flashing multicolored lights in the same manner and again described as zigzagging
just like all the previous sightings and apparently the sightings at that point came to an end or they were no longer
being reported amazing I mean that is absolutely undeniable when you have that
many witnesses over that widespread of an area over so many days seeing UFOs
and verifying them with scientific equipment you'd be a fool to deny that
something is going on I think that case is again clearly a display the UFOs are
making it very aware to everyone there that they know what's going on at Deception Island so one of the most
important cases I think really in UFO history and here's another pretty
interesting case this one is quite brief but very unusual can't say I've heard of any case quite like this one one which I
call the buzzing Cloud this occurred on May 22nd
1966 at Mount gri on Adelaide island in the Antarctic was early in the morning
on May 22nd 1966 as two members of a British Antarctica survey team both of
them were meteorologists stationed at Mount gri they became witness to a very
unusual UFO display in the Antarctic Skies if began when they noticed a
Strang looking very dense cloud in the southern Sky not only looked strange it
was moving in a weird way Rising vertically at an estimated speed of about 10 ft per second they estimated it
was somewhere between 500 to 800 ft high and about 100 ft in diameter and as they
watched this Cloud it repeatedly expanded and contracted but even more
strange was that it was emitting a buzzing sound sound which they said sounded like a swarm of bees now the
biggest shock came when this Cloud emitted a thick black Ray at 45° angle
down to the ground they also noticed a secondary Ray visible next to the larger
one where the beam hit the ground the Witnesses were amazed to see what looked like a small snow devil they quickly
snapped a photograph the entire event lasted some 45 minutes at which point
this weird Cloud dissolved the witnesses did report this event in their
meteorological report and also to the US Air Force but never received any
response and an amazing case because I mean well you can see for yourself it's
just unique and unusual certainly an interesting case as is this next one
which I call UFO over volcanic eruption this occurred on December 4 1967 at
Deception Island and yeah if you look that up you you will see that yes a
volcanic eruption did occur there there are photographs uh this case is quite
brief but important because it involves apparent photographic evidence of a UFO
now Deception Island is volcanically active and when earthquakes were detected in this area in April of
1967 it became clear that there could be in eruption sure enough some months
later on December 4 1967 the active volcano on Deception Island erupted it actually opened up new
vents along a miles long fisure on the North part of the Caldera quickly
forming a new island on the western side of tfon bay there of course was an
emergency evacuation of the Personnel stationed there at that time which included 13 people from the Chilean base
14 from the Argentinian base and eight from the British base there was no
apparent lava flow but the eruption was severe enough to demolish both the British and Chilean stations which led
to the island being completely abandoned for a number of years now while films
and photos were taken of this eruption as you can see there is only one photo
again which you can see here which shows what appears to be a classic Flying Saucer hovering over the eruption in
progress I wish there was more information about this Photograph but alas none has been forthcoming perhaps
it's been covered up hard to say for sure but it's certainly an interesting photograph a pretty interesting case and
like all these cases I just know there's more information out there about it but
with this brutal coverup going on and our governments spending an enormous amount of time money and energy to
suppress UFO information very difficult to verify a lot of these events did the
best I can and I think you know we do have some good information on a lot of these cases but if it ever involves Hardware
or photographs or anything that absolutely confirms the presence of UFOs
our governments almost always step in to cover it up which may be what's
happening in this next case which is of somewhat dubious authenticity I include
it because of I'm sure events like this do happen I call this one Antarctic UFO
crash which allegedly occurred in October of 1982 again you'll have to take this one
with a little bit of salt because I I just don't know if this is you well
verified enough to say that we can absolutely conclude it did happen but
you can decide yourself I found this case in the UFO news clipping service
and again its authenticity may be somewhat dubious I present it here for what it's worth but it comes from an
article published in the sun which is kind of a tabloid newspaper was written in an article by Lewis Clifford under
the title scientists discover crashed UFO in Antarctica with five dead aliens
on board so this is the only source I could find again please take it with a pinch of salt the account allegedly
comes from an anonymous physicist who in the summer of 1982 was part of an Arctic
Expedition search for meteorites this much is very credible as the Antarctic
is very well known as being a treasure Trove of meteorites with thousands being recovered there but per the physicist it
was during this Expedition that they came upon the charred and shattered chunks of an apparent spacecraft that
were scattered over a mile long area it appeared to them that this craft had
struck a column of ice in a glancing blow then skipped end over end breaking
apart and tossing the contents over a wide area the physicist is quoted as
saying a couple of the aliens were badly torn up but the other three bodies are in good shape and are perfectly
preserved by the ice for this witness the five occupants were all males with unusually large heads quote three times
the size you would expect but were otherwise surprisingly humanlike he said
that they had Asian looking eyes slightly pointed ears just two nostril holes for a nose a normal mouth filled
with about 32 teeth the body is averaged 4 feet tall slender with normal human
anatomy except for a bluish tint to the skin though it was unclear to the physicist whether this color was due to
the bodies being frozen for an extended period of time or was their actual
complexion visist did say that one of the beings appeared to have what looked like acne on his face so while this
discovery was made by an American team apparently scientists from several Nations became involved in the
investigation which turned the case reportedly into a political Hot Potato
due to the fact of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 I suspect that the vast majority of
UFO crash retrieval cases are covered up to a point that we hear zero nothing
about them so the some 100 200 cases that we do know about are surely only
the tip of the iceberg now let's move to the next case
which is again somewhat brief and I don't know you make up your own mind
about it I call this one they're doing the strangest thing this occurred
somewhere around 1983 in the transarc mountains this case does come from Linda
Molton how who interviewed the witness firsthand but
there's it's a pretty controversial case some of his claims are a little
different I'll put it that way so again you can make up your own mind about it
again this case comes from researcher Linda molon how she claims to have interviewed a gentleman using the
pseudonym Brian who said that he was stationed in McMurdo for a number of years he told her that in 1983 the exact
date was not given he was on a squadron mission in the trans an Arctic mountains
when he and the whole crew said that they saw a whole bunch of round silver
darting objects he told her quote they were doing the strangest thing they were
going to this peak in a group and then they all take off he told her this happened over and over again and he told
her quite a few other things that on one occasion during another mission he and his crew observed a strange opening in
the pack ice at which time they detected a the magnetic field Upon returning to
the base they were instructed never to talk about what they had seen he told her many other strange goings on
including the apparent disappearance of a group of scientists the possibility of a secret base Linda red all of this in
an episode of Ancient Aliens on the History Channel and of course in other interviews on various podcasts i'
suggest going there if you'd like to learn more information about it some have been skeptical of these claims but
yeah take a look it's certainly interesting because again it fits in with the other reports we are getting
from this area at least to some extent perhaps one day that witness will step forward and we can learn more
information but certainly an interesting event and absolutely does fit in with all the other cases we're hearing about
going on in Antarctica now let's move to our last case of this compilation this one is
pretty well verified and super interesting which I call an enormous circle of light this occurred in April
of 1991 at the General San Martin base and a super interesting case the witness
in this final case is Miguel Amaya a non-commissioned Argentinian Air Force
officer at the resistencia airport his specialty is meteorology with a subsp
specialty as a meteorological Observer he says it was in April 1991 the
beginning of the long polar night he was based at the General San Martin base
with 20 men all scientists and military personel it had been snowing for 6 or 7
days was just below 0° was around 1:5
a.m. he was in the meteorological station when the phone rang this is the
only phone that connected the station to the main base and on the other line was an
engineer who wanted to know if the radio operators had their equipment connected to transmit to the
mainland now it was late and Miguel replied that he was the only one awake so the engineer hung up without further
comment which Miguel thought was a little strange later that evening around
5:00 pm. Miguel actually asked the engineer why he had called and as Miguel
says he looked at me with a face that seemed to not know what to answer now
silence rained in the room and the engineer finally said that at the time of the call their riometer a radio
receiver which measures how much the ionosphere absorbs radio waves had begun
to record unusual measurements and it was happening at weird precise 15minute
intervals these measurements indicated a very large energy source overhead so finally they went outside
expecting to see something a UFO but nothing was visible and after about 4
and 1/2 hours the signals stopped just hours later around 10 p.m. Miguel
returned to the meteorological station one of the men came to pick up his coat and said he was going to bed as he had
stayed up all night due to the strange signals received earlier so he left the
station 5 minutes passed and the phone rang and it was the same guy who had just been there and he told Miguel to
come to the lab immediately so Miguel arrived at the lab and the man told him
and incredible story as Miguel says when I arrived I noticed that he was very
nervous and in a hurry to tell me that when he left my office and walked about
15 M from the main house he needed to look up at the sky even though it was
still snowing and the clouds were low he noticed an enormous circle of light pass
over the base very attenuated by the cloudiness but still noticeable and it
headed towards the sea very slowly without any noise no so clearly a
massive UFO really incredible another case that doesn't rely solely on
eyewitness testimony but involves scientific instrumentation verifying that something
very unusual is going on in this area again one or two cases would be easy to
dismiss four or five but no we have a dozen and again just the tip of the
iceberg and I think the use of that term is particularly approp riate considering
this is Antarctica but seriously 12 cases we know that there's a lot more
going on there such a shame that we have to deal with this stupid coverup I'm
done with it I think it's time for everyone to just stand up and say enough is
enough don't know if that'll do it I think our governments are going to go to their grave Kicking and Screaming
fighting all the way and will never be fully truthful and transparent with with this subject certainly not
voluntarily but we'll see how this all rolls out as the years move forward
meanwhile I think we can say we have enough cases to conclude definitively
that UFOs have been seen over Antarctica and do show an interest there to deny
these cases would be wholly unscientific with photographic evidence
with multiple eyewitness testimonies with cases stretching back decades um
clearly UFOs are being seen there so that's it for today thank you guys so
much I truly appreciate you tuning in each week and listening to the
information that I work so hard to bring to you so thank you thank you thank you and until next week keep asking those
hard questions keep searching for answers keep having fun and I will see
you next time bye for now
