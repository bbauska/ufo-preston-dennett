FIVE AMAZING HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Aug 11, 2023

Summary:
Aug 11, 2023
The UFO phenomenon is one of the most persistent and perplexing mysteries of modern times. But is it still fair to call it a mystery? Or do we know what UFOs are? Sightings can be misidentified. But when someone experiences a landed UFO and humanoids, the chances of misperception are negligible. These cases make it very clear that we are dealing with humanoids, people like us, but from beyond Earth. These are the cases which teach us the most about the UFO phenomenon, how it manifests, where ETs come from, why they are here, and their agenda on this planet. These five cases, spanning many decades, and coming from across the planet, answer many of the questions surrounding this subject, and show just how amazing and transformative UFO contact can be.

TURKEY’S FIRST UFO CONTACTEE. In December of 1948, Behcet Ocal was only 15 years old when he became a UFO contactee. He was shepherding sheep near his home in Nigde, Turkey, and a glowing UFO dropped down and landed next to him. Out stepped three unusual humanoids, two males and a female, who told him not to be afraid, and that they would be contacting him in the future. One of them reached out and touched his shoulder, causing him to pass out. In the days and weeks that followed, Behcet was visited many times and given profound information about the nature of the universe. 

THE ALIEN IN THE FACTORY. One of the most amazing humanoid encounters in UFO history occurred at the Ika-Renault Factory in Santa Isabel, Argentina. On the morning of September 21, 1972, factory janitor Teodoro Merlo opened the company washrooms and was puzzled to find one of the lights burned out and the room unnaturally hot. Then looking at one of the washbasins, he was shocked to see a 7-foot-tall humanoid figure looking at him. One day later, another factory worker, Enrique Moreno was delivering papers when he came upon the same humanoid, causing his 3-wheeler to malfunction. Later, he would see the figure again. The next day, another employee, a truck driver had an encounter with the same being. Unknown to any of them, multiple workers and even people outside the factory also saw the humanoid and UFOs too.

THE SIDEWAYS ALIEN. It was the middle of the night in December 1993, and Monsieur VM of Vilvoorde, Belgium woke up to relieve himself. He noticed an eerie green light shining in through the kitchen window, and looked outside, was shocked to see a short humanoid figure wearing a helmet and jumpsuit walking through his yard. The witness shone his flashlight at the being, which turned around, gestured at him, then proceeded to walk sideways up the 9-foot-tall brick-wall in the backyard. Moments later, a glowing craft with a transparent dome rose from behind the wall and hovered for several minutes, before darting away. Nobody else saw the event, but VM had encounters both before and after this, and both times, he did have witnesses.

“THEY WALKED LIKE ROBOTS” On the evening of May 27, 1977, three 14-year-old boys were hiking in the fields near their homes in West Pittsburg, CA. Without warning, a massive craft with red lights and portholes darted back and forth and then landed right next to them. Then three tall shadowy beings exited and began to walk towards them. The boys fled the scene. To their shock, the entities followed them, chasing them at high speed for several blocks through the suburbs. The encounter attracted leading researchers, such as J. Allen Hynek, who called it one of the most credible humanoid reports of the year.

TWELVE BEINGS APPEARED. It was a late August night in 1979 when Carol X, a resident of Gateshead, England noticed a strange orange light shining in through the window. Parting the curtains, she saw a brightly lit craft hovering near her home. It darted away, but moments later, a tiny UFO entered her bedroom and released a swarm of tiny lights which descended upon her. It was the beginning of a series of strange events, including an incredible visitation by a dozen short humanoids which crowded into her bedroom, and were soon seen by other family members. Then the high strangeness continued to escalate.

So many people all over the world having extensive encounters with ETs. The coverup is ending. Disclosure is happening. The time for skepticism is over. The truth of the ET presence can no longer be denied. Now it’s time to accept the fact that we are not alone and try to determine how we can engage with these visitors to our planet.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in 
the Paranormal I call this episode five amazing humanoid Encounters this is somewhat similar to 
last week's episode and that involved humanoid cases direct face-to-face contact but of course 
these are all different cases I really love the humanoid encounters don't get me wrong as 
I've said many times sightings themselves are very interesting I've covered them many times 
but it's really the humanoid cases where we learned the most about these et's who they 
are where they come from what their agenda is on our planet I just find these the most interesting 
and what I also find interesting is it seems like each case while they do have really strong 
commonalities also contain unique elements that we've never seen before or since and that 
certainly turns up in a number of these cases what I found interesting about this particular 
compilation that I've chosen for you today is four out of five of these cases actually take place in 
areas that you would not think contact would occur by that I mean heavily urbanized areas 
places that are densely populated all but one of these cases are like that that I think is really 
interesting and of course we do see the usual incredible variation of humanoid types though 
again all humanoid in form and some looking very much like us so that is interesting and of course 
these cases do reach back quite far into the past a case all the way back to the 1940s actually 
and they go on up through the decades and I do like choosing cases that come from all over 
the world so we definitely see that here now just some really interesting and unique cases that have 
a lot to offer to our understanding of the UFO phenomenon so let's get started got a lot of cases 
a lot of information to share with you today and the first case I call turkeys first UFO contact d 
I don't think I've ever covered a case in Turkey before but looking into it there's quite a bit of 
activity going on there but this case is really unusual because it is apparently turkey's first 
Contact D case and it's quite an interesting and complicated account of a young teenager who had 
a dramatic encounter that was ongoing for much of his life this case took place all the way back in 
December in 1948 this is near Istanbul Turkey the actual location is the knee day the main witness 
is beset okal and he was only 15 years old and he was working as a Shepherd in the niday area 
and he had taken his sheep to a little high Plateau to feed and he was sitting down to eat 
his lunch and this is when his experience began to his amazement this huge glowing sphere landed 
not far away from him on a mound of rocks and he said it was very bright as bright as the sun 
and I'll just quote basat directly as he says I shivered it was as if a thousands of pins 
were being stuck in my body it was a glowing light resembling that of a fired gun shell I was afraid 
that it would explode and from inside the light there came out three beings one woman and two men 
they were all the same height one woman had long hair slanted eyes all the men were bald they said 
that they would not harm me and that they came from other worlds but did not explain where from 
so according to base set this object looked metallic he said it was very large almost 90 
feet long and while he was a little scared he was even more intrigued especially by the beings their 
appearance really amazed him he said that they all looked very similar like siblings or twins even 
and he was even more amazed by what hung around their necks which he described as 
quote an illuminated instrument he wasn't sure what it was but it was flashing lights also they 
wore belts which had what looked like glowing buttons on them and they told him to remain 
calm and do not be afraid at that point he says he felt an absolute sense of Peace come over him 
like he never felt before and as they said says in his own words after telling me that 
they would appear to me often and would send me pictures they left the place just as they had come 
now before leaving him one of these beings reached out and touched him and this is when he noticed 
that their hands were quite different from ours that have really round deep concave Palms and as 
soon as one of these beings touched him he felt a kind of a shock which he's described as quote in 
energy wave and he fainted and this is where his family found him they rushed into the hospital 
and the doctor diagnosed him as having had some sort of electrical shock and in fact his skin 
was red which developed into a deep town so this is an interesting physiological effect 
but he didn't tell anyone what happened and his time passed he started to have contact regularly 
this usually occurred at night in his bedroom when this weird kind of glowing screen would appear and 
the beings would talk to him through this screen this is what he perceived and he drew the beings 
as you can see and many other things he said that the ETS communicated with him giving him all kinds 
of information about our universe and in fact they had him draw a map which they said showed our 
solar systems and others and they said that the entire universe actually originates from a center 
which they called Kerr k-u-r so he actually kept completely quiet about his experiences for about 
30 years but finally decided to go public and he became pretty well known he attracted researchers 
scientists military officials his account was published in the newspaper but he didn't like 
all the attention he quickly fled the Limelight he refused to do further interviews he never tried 
to sell his story or write a book or do any TV appearances so there's really not a whole 
lot known about his case but what is interesting is he is apparently turkey's first UFO contactee 
so yeah pretty amazing case and I can't blame the witness for not going public or well he 
did go public but basically retiring from the Limelight I think this is a 
lot of stress it takes a lot of Courage for people who have encounters to step forward 
and he did so pretty early on yes he did wait some almost 30 years to go forward but that's 
the 1970s and even then this subject was not fully accepted it's not accepted fully today 
so yeah that took a lot of Courage I think for that witness to step forward 
and now we move to the next case and this one took place in Santa Isabel Argentina I 
call this one the alien in the factory and this is such an amazing and unusual case with many 
many witnesses we see an E.T in the place you would least expect it inside a factory and this 
is a series of encounters which occurred over a period of a week or two and it's got incredible 
confirmation with electromagnetic effects physiological effects and more as we shall 
see this case is very complicated and quite extensive it was researched and documented by 
Oscar a galindez who is the founder of c-a-d-i-u this is a major Argentine UFO study group 
there are a lot of witnesses this one occurred on September 21st 1972 in Santa Isabel Argentina 
now the first witness was quite shy he would not allow himself to be photographed 
his name is teodoro Merlot and he worked as a janitor at the Santa Ina Renault plant this 
is a car factory quite large as you can see here and it was at 5 40 a.m on on September 21st 1972 
and the company was just beginning to open and it was his job to unlock the washrooms the restrooms 
and turn on all the lights and get everything ready for the workers so he's doing this and oddly 
he noticed that light number one as you can see in the upper left corner of this illustration was not 
working he also noticed that the room itself was abnormally hot so he walked into this washroom and 
this was when he was absolutely shocked to see a strange figure sitting on one of the basins 
and although he looked humanoid his appearance was very bizarre this was not a regular human 
this figure was he estimates seven feet tall was dressed in a skin-tight dark blue one 
piece jumpsuit a coverall which covered pretty much everything except for his hands and face 
according to teodoro this figure had a short thin neck and long pointed ears Asian looking eyes 
though much larger than normal a bald head and chalk white skin now he couldn't see the mouth and 
nose very well as the figure had its right hand placed over its lower face as you can see here 
so that was weird and after only a few moments of looking at this guy teodoro heard a loud 
banging noise Light number two went out at the same time Light number one went back on 
and the figure disappeared so this confused and baffled him teodoro thought that perhaps this 
figure had escaped through door number one but this door was still locked so this freaked him 
out he was worried about his job so he didn't tell anybody he opened all the rooms and went back home 
now when evening arrived he had to go back to the factory to close all the doors and he took 
a bus back to the factory as he usually does and something very strange happened on this 
bus there were about 25 other passengers so he sits down and notices something really weird 
The Entity that he had just seen that morning was being reflected in the rear view mirror of the bus 
so his first instinct was to whirl around and look behind him where he could see the reflection 
of his figure but it wasn't there it was only in the mirror and nobody in the bus noticed anything 
so he stared at this mirror and got a pretty good close look at the face of this being and it was the same one as far as he could tell only now he got a better look at the face itself 
you could see that the top lip jutted out past the lower lip you can see a long straight nose 
and this reflection remained for about three minutes and then just faded away 
so he really wasn't sure what to make of this and he decided that the next morning 
on September 22nd still being troubled by all this that he would report it to his superiors 
now they didn't seem to make a big deal out of it which kind of surprised him however teodoro did notice that he himself was experiencing some weird symptoms 
he had pretty severe eye irritation in fact his eyes watered for three days following 
this encounter in the washroom his nose was red and he said he developed a bad and persistent 
headache and back pain which remained for a full week which he relates to this experience somehow 
also one interesting thing is the lights in the bathroom continued to malfunction 
and it was two weeks after this incident actually on October 9th that teodoro 
noticed that his wristwatch and bed table alarm clock were both mysteriously one hour behind 
so perhaps this was a continuing encounter hard to say but he's certainly not the only person in this 
Factory was experiencing weird events so I was on September 27 one week after teodoro's encounter 
in the washroom that another employee at the Santa Ina Renault Factory had a series of encounters his 
name is Enrique Moreno he was 19 years old at the time and he worked in the teleprinting department 
and he had a little three-wheeler motorcycle which he used to to Traverse the distances in 
this Factory because it's quite a large Factory and he had to deliver documents all the time 
so yeah it was the evening of September 27 around 10 30 p.m that he was delivering documents to 
the engineering office and as he went into that room as you can see here a little diagram of it 
the lights went off and on by themselves three times they flashed off and on 
and this was followed by a very unusual humming noise permeating the whole room 
and this confused him and scared him a little bit so he hopped back on his motorcycle left the room 
and started to drive towards the security office and looking towards the edge of the factory at 
this point he saw a bright rainbow-ish light very near to the ground was unusual but he 
didn't think much of it and as he headed off towards his destination he noticed a strange 
looking figure about 300 feet ahead of him on the right side of the little roadway there this 
is still in the factory and this figure he could see was wearing a blue green jumpsuit 
now he first thought it was a worker because some of the workers do wear green jumpsuits 
but this figure appeared to be glowing he also noticed it was extremely tall and this 
is when he wondered if perhaps someone was playing a joke on him by walking on stilts 
so he's trying to figure this out and as he kept driving towards this figure he got to about a hundred feet away when this figure swung around to face him and at that exact instant the 
engine on his motorcycle began to lose energy the exhaust backfired the whole bike shook 
and he basically drove right up to this entity at which point his bike failed completely 
now Enrique did describe this figure as being very much like what teodoro had seen one week earlier 
according to Enrique this figure was seven feet tall it wore a blue green plastic looking jumpsuit 
a coverall that seemed to Glow it had a sick a thick silver belt with a little pouch on it 
said the head was bald it had large round sparkling eyes you couldn't see any eyelashes 
no eyelids or any eyebrows even you did see a long straight nose just a slit for a mouth 
and he says the figure almost looked robotic to him so he's right next to this entity and as he stent or on his bicycle his motorcycle 
his head he said was filled with this loud buzzing noise and a strange itching sensation permeated 
his entire body he said his arms and legs became paralyzed you could not move he felt a stifling 
hot heat all around him you could also smell an odor which he said was somewhat like burning oil 
he said his mouth felt very dry he became immediately nauseous and would have nausea 
for the next 24 hours and it went on from there he felt sharp pains in his neck his arms and 
his back all of which also persisted for days and finally he said his eyes started watering 
and that lasted for three days so these are somewhat similar to what teodoro was experiencing 
now Enrique says he was face to face with this entity for about 30 seconds 
when ikarian stranger suddenly his motorcycle his three-wheeler seemed to get a life of its 
own and it took off with him on it all by itself the speed limit in this Factory is about 5 miles 
per hour but Enrique says his motorcycle took off at almost 10 times that speed 
he could barely control it he nearly had an accident in fact this bike drove itself to 
the security office where he was reprimanded by the security officers for reckless driving 
now it was at this moment that the quitting bell rang which meant it was 11 30 pm 
this confused Enrique he couldn't understand how it got late that fast and looking at his watch he 
saw that it read 1113. so he couldn't account for at least 17 minutes there possibly more to this 
encounter possibly some weird time distortions but to his credit Enrique did tell the security 
officers what had happened and together they all returned to this scene of this encounter 
now the security Personnel were investigating it and they saw no evidence but Enrique pointed to 
where this figure had stood and he could see two footprints and bending down and examining them he 
could actually feel this abnormal heat coming from these Footprints and saw what looked like 
luminescent particles so he points this out to the security officer who actually accused Enrique 
of imagining things and then get this proceeded to use his feet to basically erase the footprint 
and at this point the security guard and other employees actually began to tease him 
so Enrique kind of regretted going public but now he was feeling unwell he felt a lot of pain 
and nausea to the point that he was rushed to the first aid office in this Factory and the 
doctor was there checked his blood pressure which was abnormally low at which point Enrique fainted 
so at this point they called an ambulance and he started to wake up and it was interesting 
because he said while he had fainted he could recall all these weird numbers and figures and 
all these information entering his mind kind of like a download perhaps but he couldn't make much 
sense of them so he's in this ambulance being driven to the hospital and Enrique surprised 
himself by demanding that the ambulance does not take him to the hospital but take him home 
so he didn't really mean to do that he felt sort of compelled and once he got home he says he 
fell immediately asleep and his fiancee watched as Enrique began thrashing around in his sleep to the 
point that she thought he was having convulsions this really concerned her she woke him up made 
him drink some water and he recovered as best as he could he was feeling a little better the next 
day still suffering somewhat but now September 28th he's returning to work doing the night shift 
and he was near the teleprinting section when he had this strong feeling of being watched 
and looking out the window he saw this same exact entity that he had seen the day before 
staring at him from outside the window about 10 feet away at this point all the lights in 
the room again blinked on and off and that same weird loud hum filled the room not only that 
the printer is turned on by themselves I mean this is like a scene out of Close Encounters 
this absolutely freaked Enrique out and he fled directly to the security office 
tried to tell them what happened he was hysterical they calmed him down and after listening to what 
he had to say told him do not report this incident to management if you report this 
to management they are going to think you're insane and this will put your job in jeopardy 
so he agreed not to report it to management but he did notice at this point that his watch no longer 
worked at all he did take it to get repaired and the watch repairman said that he could not repair 
it the watch was heavily magnetized so some very interesting physical evidence here physiological 
and electromagnetic and it goes on there are more witnesses to this same apparently the same entity 
it was one day later on September 28th this was at 3 40 AM when a new witness luff told Rodriguez 
also saw this entity he was a truck driver making a delivery to the factory and again 
this is the middle of the night he's delivering sheet metal trimmings and he was had just unloaded and was about to leave to pick up more stuff when he noticed 
that the area around him was all lit up so he's sitting in the front seat of his truck 
and at this moment he heard footsteps he heard the sound of someone approaching his truck from behind 
to the right and looking through the mirror of his truck he saw a very tall figure approaching 
I was at this moment that his truck lights went out this weird loud buzzing sound 
filled the area and like the other Witnesses lufthold found himself paralyzed truck began 
vibrating violently the transistor radio he had emitted a loud bang and failed and this figure 
walked right by the truck right in front of the truck crossed over and went behind a building 
now the witness Loof told gave a very familiar description it's apparently the same entity 
he said it was quite tall again bald long pointed ears a very white complexion round luminous eyes 
a long straight nose very small mouth and again this being was dressed in that same blue green 
kind of glowing plastic looking one-piece garment and he said Not only did it look strange and have 
strange clothes it moved strange he said it turned its whole body at once never turning its 
neck or anything and nor did it Bend its knees as it walked it walked very stiffly he said it 
had very long arms and legs and he noticed that in its left hand it held a small glowing white sphere 
so it walks by his truck Walks Behind a nearby building as you can see here this little diagram 
and after this figure disappeared behind this building the buzzing went away the truck stopped 
vibrating the lights in the radio went back on lift told estimates that the whole sighting lasted 
about one minute though afterwards he was too still too stunned to move he just sat there in 
his truck and this is when other workers in the factory saw him there approached him and asked 
him why he wasn't picking up his next load and this is when Lou told told them what had happened 
so they searched the area where this figure had walked and they couldn't find anybody 
so this did attract the attention of researchers and researcher Oscar galindez and his team 
interviewed the witnesses and found that there was another factory worker who around 11 45 pm 
on September 27th the same night as Enrique's sighting actually saw a UFO in the sky hovering 
over the factory and watched as this glowing humanoid figure rose up from the factory grounds 
and into this object and it turns out there were several other Factory workers who also saw either 
the entity and or the UFO but they refused to talk for fear of ridicule or losing their jobs 
so a lot of people are saying this meanwhile people who lived next to the factory were also 
observing activity on September 27th again the same day as Enrique's sighting Mrs Quiroga saw 
a UFO send down a crystal like beam of light and it's scooped up this same weird looking humanoid 
and this same exact event was witnessed by Norberto Grosso and his wife who are 
driving by the factory at the same time so so many people are seeing this in fact the 
researchers started going through the nearby Town adjacent to this Factory and asking about 
it and they found many people who were seeing or had seen the UFOs particularly on September 27th 
and as Oscar galindez the main researcher says and I quote 
we believe these facts are eloquent and entail features which render them of great significance 
the various eyewitnesses were unknown to each other they are sincere folks the truthfulness of 
what they were saying never failed to come through the existence of other independent Witnesses 
confirms our verification of a number of unwanted phenomenon which taken as a whole constitute may 
be the most remarkable episode to have occurred in Argentina in the matter of anthropomorphic 
manifestations of an unknown nature and by that of course he means non-human humanoids 
it's a truly astonishing case so what a case that is with so many witnesses all in the same Factory 
who don't even know each other all experiencing a very similar encounters with what appears to be 
the same entity I find this case particularly interesting because it does take place inside 
a factory and as anyone who's studied this phenomenon for any length of time you know that 
ETS UFOs are very interested in anything technological we see encounters over nuclear power 
stations dams airports military bases prisons so that fits right in here I speculate that the ET 
is perhaps investigating what's going on at this Factory materials we use the technology hard to 
say for sure but what an amazing case with so many witnesses and now we move to the next case which 
took place in vilvord France again this is taking place in a pretty heavily urbanized area I call 
this one the sideways alien and once we get into this case you'll see why it's got a really unusual 
element to it but I don't think I've heard ever before or since it's actually a pretty well-known 
case you may have heard of it it's certainly well known in Belgium where it took place but I think 
it's the kind of case that deserves a lot more attention and that's why I wanted to cover it here this next case was thoroughly investigated by Belgium researcher Jean-Luc vertongen 
and the main witness has requested anonymity and is known only by his initials Monsieur VM 
he was 28 years old at the time married and lived in the small town of vilvord in Belgium actually 
right next to a Convent of Ursuline nuns and it was around 2 A.M on a mid-December evening in 1973 
that Monsieur VM woke up to use the Outhouse which was in his backyard so he reached the 
kitchen and this is when he heard a sound like a shovel striking the ground and saw a green 
glow coming in through the window you open the curtains and was shocked to see a three foot tall 
humanoid wearing a glowing one-piece suit which she said was sparkling brightly this humanoid 
wore a clear glass-like helmet with a sort of tube attached to a little backpack on its back 
so the clothes had no markings whatsoever no buttons no zippers nothing like that 
though it did have a belt which had a glowing sparkling red box on it and this figure also wore 
what looked like boots and gloves now we couldn't see the head well it was pretty dark outside but 
it could see that the head was very dark and they thought that perhaps this was due to the 
possibility that this being had very dark hair but what really caught the witness's attention is that 
this figure held a strange instrument kind of like a metal detector or a vacuum which this figure was 
using to scan a pile of bricks that Monsieur VM had piled up in his yard a few days earlier 
now this short being according to the witness seemed to have trouble walking with somewhat clumsy and moved with this weird heavy waddle so VM the sure VM was holding a 
flashlight and he flashed it twice at the entity who immediately reacted by swinging 
his whole body around it to face him and the witness could now see this little man's face 
he didn't see any mouth or nose though he could see pointed ears and large bright oval eyes where 
she said looked yellowish with a green rim and he was close enough he says that he could see 
the iris of these eyes and he saw a little black and red kind of veins in the being's eyeballs 
so this being blinked a few times at which point he said every time it blinked the entire helmet 
would become darkened sort of become dim and then would become translucent again and this being 
raised its hand and gave Nasir VM sort of like the peace sign with two fingers in a V position 
the figure then turned back around and proceeded to walk to the back wall now this year vm's yard 
had a nine foot tall brick wall all around all three sides of it and this figure did something 
very strange walked up to the wall put his foot flat against this vertical wall and then walked 
straight up the wall sideways with his body now horizontal to the ground perpendicular to the 
ground he basically walked straight up this wall reached the top and now stood vertically under the 
top of the wall and went down the other side in that same weird perpendicular horizontal fashion 
so the witness is watching all of this with astonishment and he says just a few minutes later he saw this bright glow coming from behind the wall and heard what he described 
as a loud churring or trilling kind of whistling sound like crickets and he's still watching from 
the kitchen window and he saw this circular craft rise up very slowly and hover just above the wall 
he estimates it was about 15 feet wide this is sort of a classic saucer as you can see here the 
upper half was glowing orange it had transparent Dome on top which had a green light inside and he 
could see the same humanoid figure seated in the center of it the bottom half of this craft was 
red and had three lights in a row and each was a different color the left light was blue the middle 
is yellow and the right light was red and all three of these lights were blinking in sequence 
and according to the witness the perimeter of this craft seemed to emit little Sparks of light 
now on the top section of the craft just below the Dome the witness noticed what he perceived to 
be a strange sort of symbol sort of like a black circle with a bolt of lightning intersecting it 
you can see a drawing of it here but this craft remained there hovering for about 
four minutes rocking back and forth it rose up to about 60 feet Still rocking 
and as it rose up and stopped there for a second the whistling sound increased became much louder at the same point he heard a loud hissing noise and at that point the object 
shot up so fast that it left only a luminous Trail of Light and he tracked it with his eyes 
until it became a tiny little dot in the sky and disappeared up into the distance and it was gone
so after this encounter he decided to report it and investigators arrived on 
the scene and they could find no physical evidence no Footprints no Landing traces 
uh the main witness said he got no mental messages there was no physiological reactions uh he was not 
frightened by this encounter so the investigators went next door to the convent and asked the nuns 
and the people there if they had seen anything they didn't however and they also confessed the 
town and nobody had seen anything so apparently he's the only Witness however they did learn that 
the witness Monsieur VM his wife and cousin had seen a UFO earlier in August of that year 
they were walking along the beach and saw a craft with portholes moving by this was at night and the 
crvm flashed his flashlight at it at which point the lights in the portholes immediately went out 
so he does have other Witnesses here to this previous encounter and then a few months later 
in April of 1974 the next year he had another sighting with his wife and this was also very 
close they saw a UFO flying at very low level their car engine sputtered and died the Lights 
Went Out after a minute this object moved away and the car restarted by itself so yeah not a one-off 
apparently this is a series of three encounters but a very unusual entity encounter so how about 
that what a weird case the E.T walking sideways up the brick wall like that and it's interesting yeah 
this is a single witness case but given the fact that his family members was were with him when 
he had sightings previously and after it I think does lend a level of credibility to it uh so yeah 
super interesting case and here's another one I call this one they walked like robots 
this involves three teenage boys who had really a kind of harrowing frightening 
encounter with a landed UFO and entities not far from their home 
this occurred in West Pittsburgh California Pittsburgh California the West part of the city 
and has some really interesting elements to it again some things I don't think I've heard much 
before as we shall see it's a really amazing case this next case is really amazing again it occurred 
in Pittsburgh California actually West Pittsburgh and it occurred on the evening of May 27 1977 
and this case was actually investigated by J Allen heineck who at that point was working 
at the center of UFO studies an organization that he basically founded and was also investigated by 
Richard Haynes a clinical psychologist and again the three Witnesses are three 14 year old boys 
their names are Lenny young he lived at 10 Robert Street in West Pittsburg 
and Patrick Morrison his friend who lived right around the corner at 90 Bayview Avenue 
and then the third witness is George Ferreira who was visiting he actually lived in Pacheco 
and was around 11 pm when these three teenagers were in a field north of Willow Pass Road near 
Mallard Slough Road between the Santa Fe railroad tracks and the marsh at the edge of Suisun Bay as 
you can see here and they were actually on their way to go to the local teenagers Hangout this is 
nicknamed the pump house it's near Shore Acres not far away it's a structure of concrete and 
steel and part of a water processing Factory where a lot of teenagers would just hang out at night 
so they never made it there they were in this field when they saw a group of red 
lights apparently connected to a single object they believed and they also saw 
this one blue light quote fleeting like a flyer Firefly around the other lights 
so they're looking at this thing wondering what the heck it is when this object these 
red lights zoomed across the sky all the way to the Horizon and zoomed straight back and 
then proceeded to land in the field fairly close to them and they could now of course 
see that this was a vehicle of some kind and they could even see what looked like Square portholes 
as one of the witnesses Lenny young says it was quote round but flat Patrick Morrison said the 
object was quote round flat with a row of square lights like windows with one window larger than 
the others suddenly the lights started blinking on and off reflecting from the sides of The Craft 
George Ferreira said that this object was large enough that it reminded sort of reminded him or 
looked like a flying building so they're staring at this in astonishment and as they're watching it 
three figures emerged and began to approach them and they got to about a distance of 100 feet away 
and they could see these figures pretty clearly even though it was dark as Lenny young says they were like smoke they were black but they had no faces I don't know 
if they had arms or heads it was like they had no clothes on they were walking towards us they were 
about five feet six inches to six feet tall I've stayed out all night in that field several times 
and I know what people look like walking in the dark they were not people they were something else 
and Patrick Morrison his friend agrees as he says they were weird looking walking slow they 
looked like they were wearing long skirts over their heads they were black they walked as if 
they were linked together like figures in a chain gang and George Ferreira says that 
they were kind of quote a gray object with a kind of human shape but no eyes 
they walked like robots so yeah they're walking strange they look strange they came out of this 
object and this freaks the teenagers out so seeing these figures coming towards them they 
ran they fled and here's where it just gets so crazy these three figures followed them 
through the town of West Pittsburgh for several Blocks close behind them they said chasing them 
and when the boys were about one block from Patrick's house these figures suddenly disappeared 
the boys made it into Patrick's house absolutely hysterical and Patrick's mother immediately called 
the police Sheriff Douglas Pendleton showed up took the report and he was absolutely 
convinced these boys were truthful all three of them offered to take a lie detector test 
he could see that these boys were genuinely terrified in fact one of them was still shaking 
in fear now psychologist Richard Haynes did interview these boys as he says and I quote 
we questioned all three boys separately found that the three boys had a consistent story with 
a level of detail present that does not appear to have been manufactured if they had made up 
the story they would have had to remember it very well their fright was very real 
Jay Allen heineck also found this to be a particularly compelling report and in fact 
he said it was one of three reports of humanoids that year which he thought was absolutely credible 
and according to George ferreira's mother her son began having nightmares and he refused ever to 
return Duets Pittsburgh and when the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind came out he had no 
interest in seeing it so yeah this really affected them emotionally it's quite an amazing case 
so I like that case for a number of reasons I mean Jay Allen heineck and Richard Haynes both 
gave it a pretty high level of credibility and again this is so weird and that took place in a 
densely populated suburb and these beings actually chased these three kids all the way to their house 
that's weird uh I don't know it's a really odd case it might be significant that there is an 
Air Force Base or a military base rather nearby hard to say for sure but truly an astonishing case 
that really affected the witnesses profoundly and definitely I think deserves a spot on this list 
and here's another case this one is also very interesting I call this one 12 beings appeared 
this is unusual an unusual case for sure this took place in gateshead England 
and initially involved only one witness but it wasn't long before her whole family became 
involved and there's quite a bit of verification to it with so many witnesses and yes some 
really unusual elements the final case in this compilation is very complicated it was researched 
by Jenny Randalls a very well-known ufologist and occurred in August 1979 again in gateshead England 
the main witness in this case did not give her last name but her first name is Carol she's 22 years old married to a man by the name of Steve 
and they have a three-year-old daughter and she was in her home in gateshead caring for 
her three-year-old daughter her husband was at work it was around 2 am when she woke up to get 
some coffee and noticed a red light shining into her bedroom through the curtains so she pulled the 
curtains aside and there was this UFO hovering right next door kind of over a nearby house 
and she said it was shaped kind of like a flattened Bell uh really a kind of a saucer 
shape and covered with many lights different colors red orange and white and as she's 
watching it all the lights winked out except one at which point the object zoomed up and was gone 
so that kind of freaked her out was definitely unusual and it was only a few minutes later she 
had just laid down in bed when she heard this low rumbling sound echoing through the house 
and at that moment a one and a half foot wide object identical to what she had seen outside 
the window except of course much smaller appeared in her room and emitted a swarm of tiny glowing 
lights which moved to the center of the room and then came over to her and descended over her body 
so this absolutely terrified her she was unable to move as they came at her her entire body she said became numb she felt this weird pressure 
and a tingling sensation and at the same time heard a loud buzzing noise 
and after a moment these lights lifted up returned inside the disc which darted out into the hallway 
so this really freaked her out concerned about her baby whose name was Nicola she jumped up out of 
bed and ran into the hallway the object was gone and Nicola was fine but Carol wasn't she was still 
crying when her husband Steve came home she told him what happened and over the next three weeks 
Carol had physiological effects she felt really unwell with pains on her face and an unexplained 
rash on her neck her doctors thought she was just hallucinating and gave her tranquilizers 
so this was needless to say upsetting to Carol we decided that she was going to stay with her mother 
and not far away and it was a few days later that she had another experience 
Carl was sleeping in the spare bedroom at her mother's house this is at 4 00 am on September 3rd 1979 when she felt her body become paralyzed 
at the same time the small object appeared in her room and she says a group of 12 beings appeared 
some were kneeling some were standing she said they were very sharp maybe two and a half feet 
tall very pale skin kind of feminine facial features they were wearing white clothes one 
wore a cape-like cloak and it approached her and she says it spoke telepathically 
and perhaps to the other figures because this figure said she is just like any other Earthling 
at this point she heard a strange clicking noise and the beings vanished now at this 
point it's only her seeing these things but over the next few weeks everyone in the family began to 
experience weird events her husband and mother began to notice all kinds of weird things they 
heard the strange buzzing noise sometimes inside the house sometimes outside of the house they 
felt very strong and strange tingling Sensations Carol's brother Walter came over he heard it too 
even their dog started to hear stuff and would react and bark to these buzzing noises 
one evening Carol's grandfather came over and he says he saw three of these same beings 
and Carol said that these beings return on several occasions it's a long complicated case I wish 
there was more information on it but this is all the information I have but as Jenny Randalls says 
and I quote this case is a major challenge but it presents one with an enthralling Chase towards 
the limits of human credibility we still need to know the how and why of it the search Must Go On 
so that's the gateshead England encounter very strange but it was investigated by Jenny Randalls 
a very well respected researcher and with so many witnesses and physiological evidence it's hard to 
ignore that something did in fact happen there I suspect there's a lot more to this case than 
was presented in the report but definitely really unusual with the 12 entities appearing in her room 
there are a few cases like that that I know of but yeah it's pretty unusual 
so those are the cases I'd like or those are the cases that I'm happy to have presented to 
you today I hope you found them interesting I think each of them does have something to say 
about the ET presence on our planet the different types of UFOs people see the 
different entities the way they behave the way people react the evidence that comes with it 
it's all just fascinating stuff there's just layers and layers to this phenomenon rabbit 
holes you can go down which continue to teach us quite a bit about not only the ETS but about 
ourselves so that also is really interesting to me I do want to do a quick shout out here because I 
have a new book out it's called humanoids and high strangeness I'm super excited I will be presenting 
some cases from this book in the future but I just wanted to let you know in case you're interested 
that's my new book humanoids and high strangeness 20 true UFO encounters is now available super 
excited about it and uh yeah thanks very much for watching this episode I truly appreciate it 
I hope you found it entertaining and educational and enjoyed watching it 
uh thanks again always appreciated and until next time keep searching for answers keep 
looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye till next time.
