ET HITCHHIKERS
Jan 13, 2023

Summary:
Jan 13, 2023
Imagine driving along a remote highway and you see someone stick out their thumb, asking for a ride. You don’t pick up random hitchhikers, but for some reason, you feel compelled to stop. The hitchhiker, you now realize, looks weird, is dressed strangely, and starts to behave in unusual ways. Suddenly you realize that the hitchhiker is not human. This may sound crazy, but the fact is, there are more than a dozen cases on record that fit this exact pattern. Extraterrestrial hitchhikers! It happens more often than you think.

1956: Army officer Virgil Atkinson is driving along the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica, CA when he picks up two young sailors. After dropping them off, he finds himself being followed by a UFO.
 
Oct 10, 1967: Norman C is driving to his home in Lakewood, CO when he is stopped by an odd tall man alongside the highway. The man begins asking him very odd. As the man walks off, a gigantic UFO appears overhead.

Mar 1973: Frank Bales is driving through WA when he stops to pick up two tall strangers wearing white robes. Frank is amazed to see that they have six fingers on each hand! The hitchhikers give him predictions and tell him they are “the Watchers.”

1973: Musician Steve Boucher is driving with his fellow musicians along a highway in Ontario, Canada when they pick-up a hitchhiker. The next thing they realize, a UFO lands on the road in front of them, and the hitchhiker is leading them onboard the UFO.

Oct 18, 1974: Edmoana Toews and Nuria Hanson are driving through a remote area of British Columbia, Canada when they are followed by a UFO. At some point, they feel compelled to give a strange hitchhiker a ride. So begins an ordeal that leaves them convinced that the man was an ET.

1978: Gina and Lois traveling to Phoenix, AZ see a strikingly handsome blond-haired, blue-eyed man thumbing a ride. They never pick up hitchhikers, but can’t stop themselves. The man tells them to have no fear when their car is levitated off the road and into a UFO.

2004: An anonymous pilot driving through the remote desert outside of Yuma, AZ stops to give a man a ride. As they converse, the hitchhiker reveals that he is an extraterrestrial in disguise, working on Earth to help humanity.

Jul 25, 2001: Irina and her father drive near Mishor, Ukraine and see a very handsome man on the side of the road asking for a ride. They give the man a ride. The next thing they know, they are paralyzed, lose control of their car, and discover that the hitchhiker is actually an alien.

Jun 12, 2003. Mr. Zilmerman is on his way to work in Limeira, Brazil when he feels compelled to stop and pick up a hitchhiker. The man in his car is not normal. He is very short, has cat-like eyes, a bald head, a pale oily complexion, smells awful and wears a one-piece tight jumpsuit with bizarre thick-soled shoes. He’s definitely not human!

2004: Mr. O.B., drives near Salisbury, VA and picks up a hitchhiker. O.B., is shocked to see that the man has huge eyes, pale skin, thin blond hair and unusual features. He warns O.B. about the dangers of our political system. From there, things get weirder.

Undated: Dakota is driving between Window Rock and Chinle, AZ and stops to give a man a ride. He now sees that the man is very odd-looking, with thin limbs, very pale skin, and is wearing a shimmering white jumpsuit. Next, they come upon a flying saucer blocking the road.

Undated: Four men leave a wedding reception near their home in Guatemala City when they agree to give a man wearing a cowboy hat a ride. Shortly later, they find themselves confronted by a UFO. The hitchhiker disappears and reappears, and leads all of them onto the UFO.

Aug 1, 2018: An anonymous trucker driving through Corsicana, TX sees a tall, thin, green-skinned figure standing alongside the highway as if looking for a ride. Shocked by the man’s strange appearance, he doesn’t stop. But luckily, he does have an operating dash-cam, which captures the entire incident on video!

With more than a dozen cases, it is clear that this is a thing. Aliens are hitching rides from unwary drivers all over the world. In case after case, the people who have this experience find themselves taking a route they don’t normally take. When the hitchhiker appears, they feel compelled to stop and pick them up. Only then do they notice that the hitchhiker is strange in appearance, dress and behavior. In many of these cases, the drivers end up being taken onboard a UFO! It is one of the most bizarre types of UFO encounters on record, and yet, the chances are, the cases presented here are likely just the tip of the iceberg.

Jan 13, 2023
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
as you know I love exploring the more unusual aspects of UFO contact and that's what I'd 
really like to do today the topic I'm going to discuss is something I bet you've probably 
not heard of before maybe you have but I don't think so I know it really shocked me 
the title of today's episode is extraterrestrial hitchhikers Yes you heard right alien hitchhikers 
and I mean that literally these are cases in which people have been driving along highways and this 
is all over the world and picked up people who turned out not to be human this is in some ways 
related to the very well-known phenomena Phantom hitchhikers and in those cases people pick up a 
hitchhiker which usually vanishes disappears and these are probably ghosts what I'm going 
to be talking about are extraterrestrials not ghosts and I became interested in this after 
hearing about a few cases decided to do a deeper dive and see if I could find more and I did I was 
surprised to find over a dozen cases so yes that's what I'm going to be talking about today I think 
these cases have something really interesting to say about the UFL phenomenon they're really 
unusual they again occur all over the world involving different types of ETS um as you'll see 
and I'd like to take you sort of on a journey through time starting with the earliest cases 
which occurred in the 1950s all the way up to about 2018 I think is the most recent case 
so I've got a lot of cases I want to present to you today and let's just get started in the 
first case I'd like to talk to you about occurred actually in Santa Monica in Southern California 
this was involving a man by the name of Virgil e Atkinson and it occurred in 1956.
Virgil e Atkinson is a military officer from Port winemi Naval Base 
and as Virgil says in his own words about what happened to him and I quote I swear to 
you what I'm about to share with you is truth while he was in the military Virgil Atkinson 
says he's had multiple experiences with apparent extraterrestrials I just want to tell you about 
the first one his first encounter occurred again in 1956 he had just met a girl in Santa Monica 
California and was driving with her to Port Hueneme Naval Base this is likely along the 
Pacific Coast Highway which by the way has many many cases of UFO encounters I mean you can't 
go a mile along this highway without running into a case at any rate Virgil was driving with 
his girlfriend when they saw two young Sailors hitchhiking and being in the military himself 
Virgil decided to pick up the two Sailors and give them a lift but he was shocked when they 
got inside because they looked very young he guessed that they couldn't have been more than 
15 years old and he became suspicious that they were truly Sailors and he asked them where they 
were heading and one of them replied the Coos head Naval facility in Charleston or Oregon 
now Virgil hadn't heard of this facility which in fact at that time had been newly commissioned 
coincidentally or not he would later be assigned there but he continued to drive a few miles down 
the road and then arrived at his turn off and pulled over to let the sailors exit which they 
did and after letting the sailors out he resumed driving they had just gotten back on the road and 
turned the corner and that's when they came upon a large UFO hovering over the center of the road 
uh Virgil drove right up to it when suddenly it disappeared he continued driving and looking back 
in his mirror he was shocked to see that the UFO was now back and now appeared to be following them 
he was about to stop but his girlfriend became extremely frightened she dropped to the floor of 
the car and began sobbing in fear so he continued driving and this UFO followed close behind them 
as they approached the lights of the city of Oxnard which was some miles away this 
object suddenly ascended at a 45 degree angle and disappeared into the night sky 
Virgil Atkinson did call the police and report the sighting and afterwards he felt certain that 
the sailors he had seen and picked up and the UFO Were Somehow connected and now he wonders 
if the sailors were what they appeared to be or if perhaps they were in fact extraterrestrials 
and again following this one year later Virgil Atkinson did find himself assigned to the newly 
commissioned Coos Bay facility he was there from 1957 to 1959 and then was transferred but it was 
while he was at this base that he had another encounter with what he believes were human looking 
extraterrestrials now I did cover this case in more detail in a previous episode which I called 
ETS teach people to build energy free Motors so I'm not going to get into the whole case I just 
really wanted to present the Extraterrestrial hitchhiker aspect of it but I will say that 
Virgil Atkinson believes he was taught all kinds of physics and how to build an energy free motor 
in so many words by these ETS and in fact he worked quite hard on it and did file patents 
with the U.S penned office so if you want you can check that episode out but important here 
is that Virgil Atkinson believes he picked up two gentlemen who may very well have been 
ETS and again it's strange to this this sounds it is not unique yeah a very unusual case and there 
are so many more the next case I'd like to talk about occurred in Lakewood Colorado to a gentleman 
who's Anonymous we only know him as Norman C and his case occurred on October 10 1967. this 
case is investigated by pioneering researcher Leo sprinkle who was then working for apro the aerial 
phenomenon research organization again this occurred on October 10 1967 when Norman C was 
driving to his home near Lakewood Colorado when he was flagged down by a strange man that Norman 
described as being well over six feet in height he had a forked goatee and was wearing a jacket with 
what looked like four gold bars on each shoulder sort of unusual in appearance and dress Norman 
stopped and the man began to get this communicate telepathically and asked the main witness Norman 
where the North Star was and what date it was so these were unusual questions to say the least 
Norman answered the questions and the man replied oh in your primitive time meaning what date it was 
so at this time Norman was smoking a cigarette and this hitchhiker seemed puzzled by it and 
asked what it was Norm told him what it was it was a cigarette and the man said oh one of your vices 
uh the man then asked other weird questions such as about Norman's car Norman described 
it in detail and the man said oh this is your primitive mode of transportation 
so Norman was quite puzzled by all these weird questions and who this man was so he asked him 
who are you and where'd you come from and The Hitchhiker replied I cannot tell you now but my 
colleagues and I will return so at this point uh this gentleman walked away and disappeared 
Norman heard a strange noise and looking up he saw a glowing red object was huge he said about 
the size of a football field and it made a loud whining noise proceeded to zoom straight up joined 
two other objects and disappeared at tremendous speed the third case I'd like to talk to you 
about occurred in March of 1973 and this occurred outside of Mount Saint Helens in Washington to 
a gentleman by the name of Frank bales that is a pseudonym but this is a very interesting and 
unusual case involving two extraterrestrial hitchhikers this next case comes from lawn 
strickler who runs the very popular Phantoms and monsters website he's a researcher and an author 
and this case occurred in again March of 1973 to a gentleman I'll call Frank Bales this is 
a pseudonym he was 20 years old at the time and was visiting Mount St Helens in Washington State 
scouting the area for a future canoeing trip he parked his car and decided to clean up the slopes 
of the mountain to a certain degree to obtain a better view but shortly after beginning his 
hike he had this weird fear sweep over him and he actually had this Vivid premonition of the 
mountain erupting in a catastrophic volcanic explosion which freaked him out he raced back 
to his car and drove down the Steep curving Mountain Road and after driving for a while 
he comes around a corner and this is when Frank sees two figures a man and a woman 
and they were unusual both in appearance and dress they were dressed in dirty white robes 
and were standing right alongside the road and Frank first thought they might be Hari krishna's 
but it was odd to him because they were they were so far from any town so he pulls the car over and 
offers them a ride and up getting closer than he sees that these two figures are very strange 
first of all they are absolutely far taller than any human being unusually tall 
Frank's not sure how tall they were but he says it could have been nine even ten feet 
and he had asked them if they wanted to ride to town and the female figure turns to her 
partner and says to him her partner I thought we were supposed to meet someone here at this 
point the man replies that Frank was actually quote the contact that they were waiting for 
what's funny because at this point another car drove up and stopped and asked Frank if he was 
all right and Frank had the weird impression that the occupants of this other car could not see the 
two strange figures he was talking to so Frank said he was fine and just pulled over to admire 
the scenery and this other car drove off and Frank invited these two strangers into his car 
now Frank was driving a little Volkswagen Beetle and seeing how tall these strangers 
were he wondered if he had made a mistake offering them a ride but to his shock as 
if reading his mind the man said will fit fine and as he watched these two figures 
appeared says Frank to shrink down to normal size and they climbed into the back seat 
so he pulls onto the road and he's driving along and he pulls out a beer and begins to drink 
this point he's wondering if the figures in his car might be angels and he turns around to examine 
them and he was amazed to see that they had six fingers on their hands now the male figure at 
this point talks to Frank and says turn around and watch the road Frank assured the man that 
he was a good driver but the man Ben asked Frank what he was drinking and Frank said it was a beer 
with alcohol and the man said alcohol that's poison alcohol is going to cause you a lot of 
problems in your lifetime this was a prediction that later turned out to be very much true 
but Frank became increasingly curious about these two strange figures in the back of his car and now instead of angels he wondered if they might be extraterrestrials and he 
really wondered how had they shrunk themselves in size and looking at them again he saw that 
they both looked like humans they had long hair he estimates that they were in their early 30s 
so he starts talking to him and he told them about his vision of Mount Saint Helens exploding 
and the man said that yes Frank was correct that the mountain would explode in 1980. 
and this man said and I quote about 60 to 70 people will die on the mountain when it erupts 
and this prediction of course did turn out to be absolutely accurate and Frank was really intrigued 
at this point and just asked him flat out who are you the woman turned to her companion and said 
should we tell him Who We Are and the men said no then turned to Frank and said we are Watchers 
so Frank asked them their names and the man gave him his name um it's hard to pronounce 
but I will try the man said my name is gurusia Maine and the woman said my name is is you 
so this was the uh main part of the experience uh actually Frank completely forgot about this 
experience or at least part of it for years he wanted to ask them more questions but for 
some reason he didn't fully understand he didn't it was about 10 miles outside of Toledo Washington when the gentleman said pull over here when we get out don't look back 
so Frank pulled over the strange hitchhikers exited his vehicle and Frank pulled back onto 
the highway and despite the man's request for Frank not to look back he did and he saw these two 
hitchhikers these figures grow back to about 10 feet in height and then promptly disappear 
and to this day he wonders he believes that he gave a ride to two extraterrestrials such a 
bizarre case I really don't know what to make of some of these but there are so many and another 
case really probably my favorite occurred to a gentleman who was initially Anonymous he's now 
stepped forward his name is Steve Boucher he is a Canadian musician and he had an encounter in 1973 
with his fellow bandmates with an extraterrestrial hitchhiker and this was outside of Jordan Ontario 
in Canada the case of Steve Boucher was originally investigated by Canadian researcher Graham Conway 
though Steve Boucher would later write a book about his encounters and at the time that he 
first talked to investigators he gave the name the pseudonym Tom Campbell but has since come forward 
and given his real name which again is Steve Boucher and Steve says that late one evening 
in 1973 he and his friends and fellow musicians had just finished a gig in Jordan Ontario this is 
in Canada and began to pack up their gear and while doing so a stranger approached 
them and asked for a ride home by the way the his band at the time was called Harmony Grove 
so Steve and his friends agreed to give the man a ride they headed down the road and here's where it 
gets weird instead of taking their planned route they turned off on a service road bordering the 
Queen Elizabeth Highway and Lake Ontario and after driving for a while they approached the Charles 
Paley Park area where there was a restaurant by the name of the Lake House Restaurant and they 
could see lights up ahead on the road and Steve and his friends thought it might be a vehicle 
accident and uh everyone in the back of the car uh was peering and the driver said I think you 
all better take a look at this so they all peered through the windshield and were amazed to see that 
it was not a car accident it was a classic Flying Saucer landed on the road right in front of them 
so at this point the driver freaked out and tried to turn the van around but said he was unable to 
do so and at that moment the van actually started to float sideways towards the saucer uh they tried 
applying the brakes but that had no effect Steve had the impression that the van was actually no 
longer touching the road and it floated towards this craft and stopped about 30 feet away from it 
and the drummer called out he says do you see that I don't believe it somebody's getting out of that 
thing and at this point all of the men saw small figures with pale skin and large dark eyes exit 
the craft and surround the van at this point the strange hitchhiker they still didn't know who he 
was opened the van door and the small figures entered the vehicle in fact they were so short 
they could stand fully erect inside the van at this point Steve found himself paralyzed but he 
could see these figures they had no ears a very small mouth and cream colored skin he said they 
had three fingers on each hand and Steve heard one of these beings speaking telepathically and one of 
these figures told Steve that they had rendered him unable to move because he was thinking of 
attacking them which Steve says he was thinking that the figure then said that they would not harm 
him or his band members and that their mission was peaceful they only wanted to examine the men 
so Steve and two of his friends were then taken inside the object through an oval shaped doorway 
inside this craft they saw three Chrome colored cots beds and they were instructed to undress 
and lay down on these Beds which they did Stephen the others were then exemmed by the 
figures using what looked like Dental like instruments and probes at one point one of 
the beings shown an instrument on Steve's body which allowed them to view his internal organs 
they were then separated into different rooms where samples were apparently taken and Steve 
started asking them questions like who are you and the ETS said that they were extraterrestrials but 
they did have bases on Earth including beneath Lake Ontario everyone was asking them questions 
Steve asked them about Earth's religions and which one was correct the ET seemed surprised 
by the question and replied and I quote there is no correct religion on Earth so that's what 
they told him this was not a scary experience for Steve in fact he felt strong feelings of kinship 
and love towards the ETS and he became actually tearful when it was time to go he ended up giving 
them a gift he gave them his flute which they took and afterwards they were returned to their van and 
resumed their Journey The Hitchhiker at this point was gone and as often happens when one of these 
types of encounters occurs nobody spoke they did not mention it at all and in fact by the time they 
arrived home Steve and the others had no memory whatsoever of being taken on board and it wasn't 
until years later that Steve's memories were recalled using hypnotic regression Steve by the 
way is a contact D he has had encounters since he was a little boy so have his relatives his parents 
Steve did write a book about his encounters called beyond the Extraterrestrial firewall 
and he says that he did have further communication with this strange extraterrestrial hitchhiker 
but you'll have to read his book I don't want to give it away uh if you want to learn more about 
that check out his book it's really quite good again it's called beyond the Extraterrestrial 
firewall and it's quite an unusual case of an extraterrestrial hitchhiker a really unusual 
case yeah if you're interested in learning more about that definitely check out Steve boucher's 
book and if you don't believe that case there's always another one after it and here's another one 
this occurred to two ladies the main witness is edmona toes and her friend Nuria Hansen 
this occurred when they were driving in near the area of Steamboat Mountain in British Columbia 
Canada and this occurred on October 18 1974. these cases do seem to have very high levels 
of strangeness and consider this next account account which first appeared in the magazine fate 
uh this was written by edmona toes and she titles the article the UFOs that led us home 
so again it was October 18 1974 when edmona and her friend Nuria were driving along the highway 
at the summit of steam boat mountain in British Columbia Canada when they saw two strange lights 
ahead of him on the highway one appeared to be resting actually on the side of the mountain but 
the other which was three times the apparent size of a full moon flew towards them been darted up in 
the sky and hovered ahead of them and looking at the light on the mountain they could see 
that this was a craft it appeared to be a craft with portholes shaped very much like a derby hat 
so they pulled over to watch and actually waited for 45 minutes to see if anything would happen and 
finally something did the slanted UFO Rose upward flew 150 feet and then landed again 
at this point a trucker drove by and seeing the UFO he stopped exited his vehicle to gaze at 
the objects for a short period of time and then continued on his way so at this point edmona and 
Nuria also continued driving the weather wasn't good at this time was very foggy and the road 
was quite icy and edmona reports that something else seemed to be controlling her vehicle moving 
them along the highway at about 25 miles per hour this does turn up in UFO cases people feel like 
the UFOs are taking over their car and this is exactly what edmona is describing and it was then 
that they again noticed a bright cloud-like object hovering only about 20 maybe 30 feet over their 
car and it remained there for the entire duration of their trip and what was really interesting is 
this was quite a long ride that Mona noticed that her gas gauge showed that no fuel was being used 
so they continued along the highway evening arrived and they stopped at a lodge at muncho 
Lake a very popular tourist destination although the lodge was closed they were approached by a 
young man with dark hair and a beard although the temperature was near zero this weird gentleman 
wore no jacket only a shirt pants and shoes and he approached them and asked for a ride and the 
woman declined pointing out that their car was fully packed with belongings and there was no 
room for him which was true there was only room in the driver's seat and the front passenger seat 
despite this this man somehow persuaded them to give him a ride 
and since there was no room he actually sat on nuria's lap in the front passenger seat 
and here's where strange goes to truly bizarre because at one point Nuria realized that this 
man was not exerting any weight on her in fact he seemed to be floating about an inch above her 
lap and she commented on this but the man kind of just made a vague response and edmona also noticed 
this I mean she saw that this guy was actually hovering a few inches above noria's lap and she 
reached out and verified this by reaching her hand and checking so at this point they're both 
puzzled they feel strangely okay with what's going on at the same time a little bit sedated 
but edmona asks the man what his name was and he stared deeply into her eyes and replied Gordon 
both women felt like he looked slightly familiar but they couldn't Place him so they just continued 
this drive with this weird gentleman uh it was again a pretty long drive and they stopped for 
the evening at an inn it's called the Fireside Inn it's a hotel in Northern British Columbia 
they all stepped out of the car and at this point Gordon inexplicably vanished he was gone 
shocked the two of them looked around and called his name but sure enough he was gone and this is 
when they noticed a very strange detail there was snow all over the ground untouched snow 
and there were no tracks at all leading away from the car so this seemed to be impossible they went 
inside the hotel they found another truck driver there who was absolutely shocked to see them 
and when they told him that they had just come 165 miles from Steam Boat Mountain he didn't believe 
them and so that that was impossible as the road conditions made that route absolutely impassable 
so something was going on there the strangeness continued the next morning as they continued their 
trip because again as they drove along the road this strange glowing cloud-like object returned 
and hovered above their car and although the weather was blizzarding the road they said 
seemed to be dry and free of snow in front of them and at some point during their trip their 
car engine mysteriously failed they said two mysterious gentlemen showed up seemed to know 
all about the two women in their trip and actually helped them restart their car and then they left 
in under mysterious circumstances so the two women drove up into Alaska to edmona's home in Anchorage 
Alaska and it was only then that this glowing cloud-like object above their car disappeared 
so a very strange series of events which edmona did write about in fate magazine 
and it was only later after this incident that she realized that this strange hitchhiker did 
in some ways have an appearance similar to her husband but she doesn't know what's going on 
here after reviewing the entire Journey they finally came to the conclusion that Gordon 
was either an angel or more likely given that she had seen UFOs in extraterrestrial 
so yeah again she wrote this up in fate magazine in an article titled the UFOs that led us home 
so yeah make of that case what you will it's a very interesting case and here's yet another 
this current case took place somewhere in the deserts of Arizona the exact location wasn't 
specified but this case occurred to two ladies one of them is named Lois the other is her friend Gina 
and this occurred in 1978. this next case comes from researcher Brad Steiger again it occurred 
in November of 1978 to Lois and her friend Gina Lois was a church-going businesswoman 
from Arizona and was driving with her friend Gina from Denver Colorado to Phoenix Arizona 
and they were on a remote section of Highway in Arizona when they saw a hitchhiker now mind 
you there's nothing around here there are no towns this is just an isolated section of desert highway 
and here's this gentleman which they described as being very handsome clean shaven with long 
blonde hair brilliant sky blue eyes and he was wearing a flannel shirt and jeans now Lois is 
not in the habit of picking up hitchhikers she had never picked up a hitchhiker before in fact 
and being two women alone on a highway this was not something that they would normally have done 
but Lois said she felt strangely compelled to slow down and stop she couldn't help herself and this 
man leaned in the window and spoke in a soft musical voice and said and I quote I'm so glad 
you've come we've been waiting for you so Gina was absolutely entranced by this gentleman as she says 
as crazy as it sounds it was as if I had known him all my life Gina is usually kind of shy 
around strangers especially males but she was smiling from ear to ear as if she was greeting 
an old friend so both the woman seemed to be in some ways hypnotized if you will or entranced 
by this guy who enters the car and begins to speak to them in soft soothing musical tones 
and suddenly to their amazement their car is actually levitated off the highway and 
floated into a large craft hovering pretty high up there overhead next thing they know 
they are inside the craft and I'll just let Lois describe what happened next as Lois says 
Gina and I were separated and I didn't see her again for quite a while the beautiful 
hitchhiker disappeared and I was surrounded by smallish entities with large staring eyes their 
mouths were straight lines that I never saw open but I seem to hear voices perhaps by telepathy 
Lois found herself obeying docily as if hypnotized as the beings undressed her and instructed her 
to lay down on the table the beings then exempt her took samples of her blood her skin her hair 
she had the sense that they were interested in the fact that she was infertile but they also seem to be very interested in their possessions as well her purse and so forth 
and as Lois says they still seem to be examining my clothing my purse everything that I had with me 
I had been really nervous when The Hitchhiker brought us aboard the space vehicle but it kept saying over and over that Gina and I had nothing to fear that they would not hurt us 
so after this exam Lois was taken to another room where she sat on what appeared to be a comfortable 
sofa facing a large window which showed a panorama of stars an old bearded man human looking entered 
and told Lois that she had been contacted because she was one of them and that she would remember 
all of this in the fullness of time Lois asked them why she had been examined and the being 
replied to see how you are to see if you are well and she said well why do you care about me 
and the man replied because you have the key that puzzled Lois so she asked him what key do I have 
and he said you will remember when the time is right the next thing Lois and Gina know they're 
back on the highway in their car on the road they were both hungry thirsty and somewhat dazed they 
drove silently into the next town and here's where they got an incredible shock they called their 
families and friends who were frantic with worry and told them that they were missing for five days 
so this is very much like the Travis Walton case it's very unusual for people to be missing that 
long but this is what happened to Lois and Gina now following this event Gina absolutely 
refused to talk about it Lois said her home became stricken with Poltergeist like activity 
and in fact her children began reporting bedroom visitations by strange entities this activity 
became so intense it caused friction with her marriage and Lois's husband actually divorced her 
the weird activity continued and in the mid 1980s Lois's youngest daughter who was four years old 
told Lois and I quote mommy it won't be long now before the hitchhiker comes back to see you 
that really shocked Lois and she had not told anyone about her encounter 
and that's where this case uh rests I don't know anything more about this encounter Brad 
Steiger never revealed anything else as of 1988 this hitchhiker has not returned 
so I don't know but as you can see in a number of these cases these hitchhikers appear and the next 
thing people know they are being taken on board not always I love these cases they're so strange 
and it's interesting that there's a number of them that have occurred in the state of Arizona 
because here's another one this one occurred outside of Yuma Arizona this is in 2004 and 
the main witness is a retired Anonymous airline pilot it's a very unusual case this case comes 
from Jan harzan a UFO researcher and actually the former executive director for mufon and in 
2004 Jan harzan says he received an intriguing call from a retired airline pilot this pilot 
is no slouch I mean he's got an impressive resume with more than forty thousand hours of flying time 
and again this encounter occurred when the pilot picked up a hitchhiker about 15 miles outside of 
Yuma Arizona and I'll just quote Jan harzan here as Jen harzen says he the pilot found it strange 
that this man was out in the middle of nowhere literally out in the middle of the desert standing 
on the side of the road with his thumb out he normally did not pick up hitchhikers but something 
told him to stop and give this guy a ride so this is very similar to the previous case I just cited 
anyway The Hitchhiker told the pilot that he was looking for a ride to San Diego California 
this surprised the pilot and because that's where he was going and this is what he told 
the gentleman The Hitchhiker that he was actually heading to that City and as they 
spoke The Hitchhiker revealed something incredible he said flat out that he was an extraterrestrial 
that this was not his normal form in that he was in disguise he said he had come to help 
humankind and was on his way to a research facility in San Diego now Jan harzen again 
spoke with this uh pilot the main Witness and said that this gentleman was absolutely sincere 
and the witness said that being next to this man this alleged extraterrestrial hitchhiker 
he felt this really weird strange calmness and that at the time of this encounter everything the 
man said sounded quote rationable and reasonable it's a really weird case and Jan harzen is 
perfectly aware of this as Jan harzan wrote about this case he says I know I know sounds crazy 
but it would be even crazier not to get to the facts and we'll see where this one goes 
unfortunately there is no further information on this case but it does fit in with these 
other cases of extraterrestrial hitchhikers not a lot of details to that case some cases have more 
details than others here's a case that which does have considerable detail this occurred in 
the town outside of the town of nishor this is in Crimea Ukraine and this occurred on July 25th 2001 
to a young lady by the name of Irina and her father it was on the evening of July 25 2001 
when Irina and her father were driving near the town of nishor again this is along the southern 
coast of Crimea in Ukraine that just stopped to pick up some food and water when they saw what 
they described as a handsome young man hitchhiking along the highway and in fact Irina in particular 
found herself absolutely mesmerized by this gentleman's perfectly proportioned features 
she described him as being tall blonde-haired and very attractive and she began to beg her father 
to give this hitchhiker a ride and for whatever reason her father agreed they pulled over and this 
man got in the car and sat in the back seat and as they started to drive off they saw that this man 
was behaving strangely first he held this strange bock-shaped box shaped device in his hands and 
then he began to mumble unintelligibly to himself almost as if he was speaking a different language 
so here he is he has a strange appearance he's got this weird box device he's talking the 
strange language this freaked irina's father out and he immediately pulled over and told the man 
to get out well the man did not comply instead of exiting the car he grabbed irina's hair pulled her 
head back and pressed this box slice like device against her back and at this moment both Irena and 
her father says that they became paralyzed weak and dazed they could not control themselves at 
this point The Hitchhiker exited the car sat down on a log and began to speak into this black box 
both Irena and her father said that they were fearful they wanted to leave but were still unable 
to move the man then returned to the car which now began to move by itself so again here we see a car 
being controlled beyond the control of the people who are supposed to be driving it at this point 
Irina and her father both noticed a white glowing light surrounding their car and after traveling 
along the highway for a short distance their car stopped by itself near an abandoned gas station 
The Hitchhiker again exited the car and began collecting plant samples from the ground very 
strange again typical E.T Behavior you then approached the car and speaking in Russian 
said thank you the man then disappeared into a beam of Light which turned green as it arced over 
the front of their vehicle and both Irina and her father promptly lost consciousness they woke up 
the next morning and here's another very strange detail following this encounter Irina noticed this 
very strange after effect her eyes which had been Brown since birth were now green in color 
and I know how that must sound but I actually do have another case just like that where someone's 
eye color changed following an encounter I think you'll agree like all these other cases 
that one is quite unusual but of all the cases I found I think this one is probably 
the most unusual because the gentleman that this driver picked up was clearly not human 
this case occurred outside of linera this is in Sao Paulo Brazil it occurred on June 12 2003 and 
the main witness is a gentleman by the name of Mr zillerman this very bizarre encounter again 
occurred on June 12 2003 outside of lymera in Sao Paulo Brazil was very early in the morning 6 20 
a.m when Mr Zimmerman had left home to go to his place of employment he had just passed through the 
toll gate on the highway when he saw a strange looking figure hitchhiking alongside the road 
he knew it was risky to pick up random strangers but as happens in other cases 
of this kind he found himself compelled to stop the car and pick this figure up 
by the way this case is covered in the book et's in Brazil by researcher author Antonio falero 
so moving along with the story this figure approached the car and Zimmerman surprised himself 
by rolling down his window and he could now see that this figure had large sort of cat-like eyes 
a very small nose a bald head and he was exuding this strange powerful odor and this stranger this 
hitchhiker pointed towards the city of paracicaba ahead of them on the road and then entered the car 
now Mr Zimmerman at this point was nearly overcome by the strange odor of this man 
and looked at him to examine him more closely and saw that this man was quite short about 
five feet tall had a very pale complexion sort of an oily complexion and wore a strange 
tight-fitting outfit with strange thick sold shoes so again we see these figures have a 
strange appearance and are dressed strangely so Mr Zimmerman asks this figure where do you 
want to go and The Hitchhiker remained silent but pointed ahead on the highway 
Mr Zimmerman asked him what is your name and again this figure didn't answer but 
at this point Mr Zimmerman could see that this man's eyes appeared to turn really dark black 
and this really frightened him he continued down the highway he felt compelled to and this is when 
the man began emitting loud croaking noises so very similar in some ways to what Irina described 
and at this point Mr Zimmerman looked at this figure more closely and noticed other odd details 
this man's hands had six fingers and they were tipped with black pointed almost claw-like 
fingernails and getting a closer look at the man's complexion he saw that it was slick and almost 
oily in appearance he tried again to talk to this figure but the hitchhiker remained totally silent 
and after each question that Mr Zimmerman asked this man's eyes would flash this dark black color 
finally they reached the outskirts of the town of perazikaba and this is when Mr Zimmerman 
felt compelled to stop the car this strange figure exited the vehicle actually smiled at Mr Zimmerman 
crossed the road in front of him and disappeared into the bushes there's nothing around here so 
it's not clear where this figure was going to go Mr Zimmerman drove off and he said the only 
other effect from the encounter other than being absolutely puzzled by it was a severe headache 
moving along here's yet another case I'm telling you there's a lot of cases like this there must 
be something to this this next case occurred near Salisbury Virginia the main witness is anonymous 
but goes by the initials o b and this occurred in 2004. so this case does involve a gentleman who's 
Anonymous as I said his initials are o b and it occurred near Salisbury Virginia around 2004 when 
Mr OB saw a man alongside the highway wearing a thin top coat now this was a freezing cold day 
and OB was concerned so he stopped to give the man a ride and the man got in the car and OB 
saw that this man was quite Young had blonde hair he immediately climbed into the car and said that 
the van the inside of the car was uncomfortably hot and complained about it several times so OB 
suggested that the man go ahead and remove his coat which the man did and this is when OB got 
a shock because the man had nothing on under his coat he was nude this shocked OB and he asked the 
man where he was from and the man replied in kind of a strange manner I'm from Venice and OB wasn't 
sure he heard this correctly and asked Venice California and the man replied yeah California 
so I'll be thought that was curious because the man had a strange tone to his voice that he said 
was difficult to describe but the man did have a message for Obi and he began talking about how 
Earth's governments were taking the sides of Corporations instead of the common people and 
this was purposeful with the intention of causing a financial collapse he talked quite a bit about 
this sort of thing made several other political predictions but OB was more puzzled by this man's 
strange Behavior speech and appearance and he kept staring at him and looking at him because he says 
this man's face was oddly different than a normal human he had abnormally large bright blue eyes and 
very long very thin blonde hair and it was at this point that he wondered if this man was in fact 
an extraterrestrial or some kind of Supernatural creature uh so after at some point he pulled the 
car over the man exited the vehicle and warned the witness not to tell anyone what he had been told 
now the witness says he dropped this man off on Fair Ground Road outside of Salisbury Virginia 
as an interesting endnote to this case he later heard that a couple claimed that they 
had actually been abducted into a UFO on that very Road OB says he never saw any UFO but to 
this day he wonders if he encountered an alien hitchhiker and he says that on another occasion 
he was driving with his wife along this same stretch of road and saw what appeared to be the 
same figure in the same exact place he had seen him before the only difference was that instead 
of wearing a thin top coat this strange man was wearing a silvery white jumpsuit 
and remembering his earlier encounter with this very strange hitchhiker he didn't stop this time 
and just drove by the man yeah truly a bizarre case I love this next case um this case is undated 
so I don't know when it exactly happened but it involves a Native American gentleman by the name 
of Dakota and this again occurred in this state of Arizona it's a really interesting case this next 
case comes from Artie six killer Clark and again involves the Native American gentleman by the name 
of Dakota who one evening was driving along State Highway 191 between Window Rock and Chinle Arizona 
this is a remote desert area and this is not a long drive it normally takes about one hour it 
was around midnight when Dakota Came Upon A Man Standing alongside the road and he first thought 
it was another Native American which was not unusual and as he usually does when he sees a 
fellow Indian walking along the highway Dakota stopped to give the man a ride and as Dakota 
says in his own words at the time I didn't know he was an alien that's what I think he was but 
I thought he was an Indian when I picked him up very quickly however Dakota realized his mistake 
as Dakota says when he got into the car I noticed he was not dressed like an Indian 
s around here wear jeans denim jackets neither a t-shirt or a shirt it was a cold night it was 
snowing and he wasn't wearing a jacket he was wearing something like coveralls but it was a 
strange material it seemed to Glow in the lights of the dashboard and when I asked him where he was 
headed he pointed ahead without saying a word so here we see this pattern again a strange looking 
figure wearing strange clothes acting strangely Dakota thought this was strange but wondered if 
perhaps the man was Navajo who are sometimes more private than the people of his own tribe 
so he continued driving until coming over a small hill at which point He Came Upon A blinding light 
ahead of him he thought it might be a semi truck and without warning Dakota's car engine failed 
he was trying to restart it when The Hitchhiker exited the vehicle and walked into the brilliant 
light ahead of them on the road moments later The Hitchhiker returned with another man and 
told Dakota to go with them as Dakota says at first I thought it was a joke but then I felt 
like I had no choice not only that I felt like I had no will so Dakota became worried about 
his car parked in the middle of the highway but these men told him it would be all right and the 
next thing he knew they walked into this light which turned out to be a spacecraft a UFO landed 
on the center of the highway and onboard this craft Dakota saw many other Native Americans 
he tried to speak with them in fact but all of them he said seemed to be dazed almost entranced 
Dakota examined the men who had taken him on board and as Dakota says they were about as tall as me 
but much slimmer they were a type of jumpsuit with a silver triangle on the chest they looked 
like humans but they were fairer I remember seeing their hand against my skin their fingers were so 
long and white Dakota said he was taken from the room with the other Indians to another room and 
then was left alone he became frightened and exam exited the room running down the corridor trying 
to escape at which point he did become paralyzed as Dakota says I remember thinking I am stronger 
than these guys because they were so slight of build but I was wrong they rendered me helpless 
and after that I don't know what happened the next thing I remember is being back in my car 
so back in his car he started up the engine and drove into town and this drive which should have taken one hour actually took four hours Dakota says the next morning his body felt very sore 
but worse than that he was more emotionally shaken than physically and as Dakota says 
I believe I picked up an alien along the side of the road thinking I was picking up a Navajo 
but it taught me one thing I am more careful about picking up strangers and following this 
Dakota was picked up at least twice after this and he says each encounter lasted about four hours I 
love that case it's clearly not involving a human being I'm telling you there are extraterrestrials 
thumbing rides along highways across the United States and the world and here's another case from 
rd6 killer clerk I love her as a researcher she's introducing some really interesting cases I think 
and this next one occurred outside of Guatemala City it involves three brothers and their cousin 
and again this case is not dated so I don't know when it occurred but yeah once we get into the 
details of this one you'll see that this is a Whopper I mean this is a really unusual case the 
Three Brothers in this case go by the names Alicia Javier and Jose and their cousin is named Miguel 
and again this card occurred in Guatemala City in Guatemala and they had just attended the wedding 
reception of their sister afterwards they loaded up their van with the chairs and tables that had 
been borrowed and need to be needed to be returned to their owner the wedding reception was over 
nearly all the guests had already left and as the four men who were preparing to leave they 
were approached by a young man who asked them for a ride now this looked like a normal person he was 
tall slender dressed in jeans a white shirt and a cowboy hat that was pulled low over his eyes 
and they all thought that he was perhaps a friend of the bridegroom and they agreed to 
give him a ride so they all climbed into the van and headed down the road Jose was driving and as 
Jose says instead of following the main highway I took a service road that led around the city 
it was strange because I had never taken that road and yet I felt compelled to choose that road 
that's the same thing that happened in other cases so here's this weird pattern turning up again 
and as they drove out of town one of the front tires became flat I wonder about this too they 
pulled over not far from a textile Factory and proceeded to change the tire and this is when they 
all noticed that the factory lights were out which was very strange because they were always lit 
it almost finished changing the tire when they noticed two strange things one was a thermisturius 
hitchhiker had inexplicably disappeared and another vehicle appeared about a half mile ahead 
of them and then another brilliant light appeared behind them over the factory parking lot and this 
is when they realized it was in fact a UFO the four men became frightened and piled into the car 
it tried to race away not surprisingly the car engine would not start 
so they tried to exit the car but in all four men said that they became paralyzed unable to move 
and Eliseo the oldest brother describes what happened next as Eliseo says 
that's when The Hitchhiker reappeared he was no longer dressed like the four of us 
he was wearing a white one-piece suit but the strangest thing of all he was 
still wearing the cowboy hat he opened the door and climbed into the passenger's seat 
he told us not to fear he closed the door and then the van began to move toward the craft 
a bright light fell on the road in front of us and I felt the van move upward 
all the time the stranger is saying that we should not be afraid the next things 
that happens is the men found themselves on board the craft which they said was brightly lit inside 
humanoid figures with light-colored brown hair and big round bright blue eyes surrounded them placed 
them into a room and began to take blood samples that's all they really remembered actually they 
didn't remember that because the next thing that Brothers knew it was morning and they were back 
in the van elysio woke first and had no idea what had happened he couldn't recognize his brothers 
he had no idea where he was or even his own name who he himself was Jose and Miguel lay unconscious 
in the back of the van and Javier lay unconscious on the ground outside so this was quite uh 
unnerving to them very concerning they were very much dazed very confused Eliseo tried to flag down 
a driver for help but the driver of the car fled and shortly later the police arrived so apparently 
he called the police and brought them all to the police station all of the men had profound amnesia 
only after a few days did they remember who they were and what had happened 
as Javier says we were on board a UFO and we were LED there by The Hitchhiker The Three Brothers 
all agree on the basic details of their on-board experience Jose was the first to remember that 
they had been taken on board but he actually had the least recall of the three of them and 
it was really their cousin Miguel who remembered the most detail he says that after they had been 
taken to a room and had blood samples taken they were all separated and brought to different rooms 
Miguel remembers being undressed and physically examined and following this encounter he actually 
slept for three days straight and when he awoke his memory slowly returned 
he did find a strange round mark on the left side of his torso that hadn't been there before his encounter and for him this was further evidence that their encounter was entirely real 
so again this case comes from researcher Arty six killer Clark and as she says and I quote 
I have repeatedly been told about the paralysis that accompanied an abduction 
it was only the third time however that a hitchhiker was involved who was actually an alien 
it makes me wonder if this practice is more common than we know I never pass a hitchhiker without 
thinking of Eliseo Jose Javier and Miguel even if I am tempted to stop I drive on those are pretty 
much all the cases I found there's one more case I would like to cover I'm really not sure what to 
make of this one this occurred in Corsicana Texas along the Corsicana Highway it was reported to 
mufon by an anonymous truck driver this actually was featured on a few paranormal reality TV shows 
and what's interesting about this case is it involves an actual photograph of this alleged 
E.T thumbing a ride along the Corsicana Highway you can make up your own mind about it but here's 
the case so again it was August 1st 2018 when this Anonymous truck driver was driving along 
the Corsicana Highway in Corsicana Texas one afternoon when he says he saw a strange figure 
standing alongside the highway and in his report to mufon the truck driver writes and I quote 
witnessed person walking dressed strangely when I passed and looked at my mirror it was gone 
what makes this case interesting is that the driver had a dash cam video playing at the time and was able to capture several seconds of footage as he drove by this figure 
and this video has gone viral on the internet you could probably find it and it does show what appears to be a greenish gray humanoid figure with its 
face turned towards oncoming traffic and its arms extended almost as if thumbing a ride 
this did appear on the Travel Channel series beyond the unknown with host Don Wildman it was 
featured in season two but it does not appear to have been the product of an official investigation 
nevertheless this video is somewhat intriguing and I will say that this case does fit the pattern we 
have seen in other cases so those are all the cases I could find and that's quite a bit I 
suspect there are more out there I did Cover these cases in my book not from here volume 4 which 
again is all about the really unusual types of UFO cases and you can't deny cases of extraterrestrial 
hitchhikers are really unusual very much like the vanishing hitchhiker syndrome only involving a 
parent extraterrestrials really cool it kind of reminds me of that book by Douglas Adams 
the science fiction novel called Hitchhiker's Guide to the universe so yeah I think this is 
a good thing to keep in mind if you're driving along the highway and you see someone dressed 
up in a silver suit or someone with big staring eyes and no hair and a huge head thumbing a ride 
uh I don't know how many cases there are like this but the 12 or 13 I present here I do 
believe are just the tip of the iceberg because if this happened to you would you tell someone 
something to be aware of in case you're driving along and you see somebody looking very unusual 
so that's the show for today I hope you've enjoyed it it's definitely an unusual one 
I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it until next time keep 
searching for answers keep asking questions and most importantly keep having fun bye now
