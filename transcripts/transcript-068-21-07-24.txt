hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal 
got a big episode for you today I call it the top 20 ufo encounters in new mexico I've scoured all 
the cases I could find I've taken place in new mexico and I've come up 
with a list of what I think are the top 20 cases these are the ones that got the most attention 
were widely publicized unique had a lot of evidence or somehow shaped our understanding 
of the ufo phenomena ones that contributed to how we feel about ufos I'm sure another researcher 
would have come up with a different list but this is my list I'm going to start with number 20 and move all the way to the most influential case number one so let's get started because there's a 
lot of information in this episode and the first case I want to talk about I call case 20 the ufo 
contacts of daniel frye daniel frye writes and I quote this is a true story of a unique event 
believe it or not on the evening of july 4th 1950 I had the experience of seeing touching and 
writing in an unmanned remotely controlled space capsule which landed near the white sands proving 
grounds outside the city of las cruces new mexico this is how daniel frye's controversial book 
the white sands incident began in which he presented his experiences with ufos in a being 
named alan at that time dr daniel fry worked for an aerojet group as a missile engineering 
executive at white sands proving grounds he and his group helped to develop many guided missiles 
on the base and on the evening of july 4th 1950 daniel fry planned to join a fireworks celebration 
in las cruces however he missed the bus and instead decided to take a walk around the base 
he walked along a two mile dirt road that ended at the base of the oregon mountains and 
as he walked daniel fry noticed that the bright stars above him were becoming blocked by a large 
silent object and he became alarmed and realized that it appeared to be approaching him 
and when it was just a few hundred feet away he could finally discern its shape as he says 
finally I could see what it was at the same time I realized why I had not been able to see it sooner 
its color appeared to be nearly identical to the color of the night sky so that even when 
it was quite close it was difficult to make out anything but the outline its shape was an 
oblate spheroid about 30 feet in diameter at the equator or the largest part and his shock this 
craft landed quietly on the ground about 70 feet away his first thought was that this was something 
secretly developed by the soviet union however as he looked at it and inspected it he quickly 
rejected that explanation he estimates it was about 16 feet tall and 30 feet in circumference 
and as he says and I quote a closer inspection showed that the highly polished metal surface 
was silvery in color with a slight violet iridescence I walked completely around the craft 
without seeing any sign of opening or seams his first instinct was to return to the base and get 
more witnesses however he was afraid this thing would leave so he decided to remain there and 
watch it and he actually approached the craft and touched it as he says was only a few degrees above 
the air temperature and incredibly smooth it's difficult to describe the degree of smoothness 
if you were to run your fingers over a large pearl which had been covered with a thin soap 
film you might receive a sensation similar to that which I felt when I touched the metal of the ship 
at this point a voice spoke out audibly and it said better not touch the hull pal it's still hot 
so daniel fry stumbled backwards astonished and this voice said told him 
do not be afraid and that you are among friends so this is how his contact with the being named alan 
began and this voice first explained to to daniel fry that it was dangerous to approach 
too closely to the craft because its radiation uh is being given off by this ship and he told 
fry that it was his assignment to quote become an american and live undetected among humanity 
he told fry that he had spent the last two years studying the english language and would spend the next four years going through various procedures to adapt him to earth's atmosphere gravity 
and germs and bacteria he told fry that one of the principal reasons for his expedition was to 
determine how adaptable people's minds are to the idea of their presence and that previous 
expeditions centuries ago met with quote almost total fair failure in this respect 
alan said that one of their main purposes was to quote stimulate a degree of progress 
which will eliminate the reasons for war on earth and finally after all of this alan invited 
daniel fry on board the craft which he called quote a remotely controlled cargo carrier 
at this point a door opened and daniel frye was surprised to find that this craft was largely 
empty inside was a very sparse room with four chairs mounted to the floor each facing the same 
direction there were two rows and he walked inside and following alan's instructions sat in the seat 
alan asked daniel fry where he would like to go and suggested new york city daniel was skeptical 
but agreed there were no windows in the craft so daniel was surprised when suddenly the wall 
in front of him became clear as quote the finest type of plate glass or lucite window 
holland then began to provide a lengthy scientific explanation explaining how they were able to 
turn metal transparent by creating quote a field matrix between the atoms 
and suddenly this craft took off and daniel watched in amazement as the ground fell beneath 
him as he says and I quote the lights of the army base at the proving ground which had been hidden 
by a small hill sprang into sight instantly and began drawing together like a flock of baby chicks 
when called by the mother hand a few seconds later the lights of the town of lost cruises came into view and in the lower left hand corner of the window
i knew that we had risen at least a thousand feet 
i was also able to see the highway from las cruces to el paso a narrow but brilliant ribbon 
illuminated by the headlights of the many cars on it so this craft kept rising until according to alan they were 13 miles above the surface of the earth 
the craft then shot off at 8 000 miles per hour to new york city at this time allan continued 
to talk to daniel providing detailed explanations regarding how the craft worked how it was operated 
uh alan told daniel fry that they do plan on landing on earth and publicly revealing themselves 
but only when humanity becomes more involved evolved and he explained that they often travel 
to earth on mining expeditions as there are materials on earth in great abundance which 
are scarce elsewhere alain did not communicate through telepathy as daniel thought but he said 
through a technology that allowed them to modulate the nerves in the eardrum to simulate speech but 
he did say that they do have the ability to look into people's minds and examine their memories 
their thoughts and feelings and he told fry that it was no accident that fry had been contacted and 
they had searched through the minds of many other scientists including daniel fryes but found that most were too skeptical 
but daniel fry they believed was open minded enough to new ideas and so they contacted him 
and it was just moments later when daniel frye found himself over new york city at a height of 
20 miles fry said that the lights of new york were incredibly beautiful and that the entire city was 
pulsing and shimmering with luminescence daniel fry asked if he could take a tour of the mother 
ship and allan said no this was impossible due to the atmospheric conditions on their ship 
and said that they didn't live on a planet like humans but permanently inhabited a mother ship 
which was much larger than anything humans had ever made alan did say that tens of thousands 
of years ago they did live on earth in a small continent called limeuria at which time there was 
another advanced culture which we know as atlantis and these two cultures according to alan were very 
scientifically advanced and exterminated each other through greed and the abuse of power
so after this the craft that daniel fry was in returned to white sands daniel was told to 
exit the craft and alain told him that they would meet again so daniel steps out of the 
craft and watches with amazement as it takes off as daniel fry says and I quote the door closed 
behind me and as I turned a horizontal band of orange colored light appeared around the 
central part of the ship and it leaped upward as though it had been released from a catapult 
i managed to keep my eyes on the craft with the band of light while the band of light went 
through the colors of the spectrum from orange to violet by this time it was several thousand 
feet in the air and as the light passed through the violet band the craft disappeared from sight 
once it was gone daniel fry found himself consumed with a wave of sadness and depression as he says 
i felt as though my work and my life had lost all its significance a few hours before I had 
been a rather self-satisfied engineer setting up instruments for the testing of one of the largest 
rocket motors ever built now I knew that the motor for those rockets was pitifully inefficient 
and might soon be obsolete I felt like a small and insignificant cog in a clumsy and backwards 
science which was moving only towards its own destruction four years later on april 28 1954 uh 
in oregon actually elan contacted fry again and told him that it was his mission to quote avert 
the holocaust which is otherwise inevitable and they told daniel fry that they wanted him to go 
public with his story of contact daniel if I asked them why don't they just land on the white house 
lawn and allan said that they could not do that as it would seriously disrupt our civilization 
and that millions of people will go to great lengths to deny or disprove their existence 
30 would end up worshiping them and 70 percent would consider them tyrants 
and he also said our military forces would feel very threatened and would try to surround 
and take over the craft and then cover up the event alan told daniel fry that our material 
science had advanced too quickly and that humanity was not evolving spiritually or socially 
and because of this we were on the pathway to imminent self-destruction 
so that was the whole real reason for the contact and daniel fry's book the white sands 
incident reveals no other contacts over at some point daniel fry was able to take 
photographs and apparently moving films of their ships and at first he did keep his experiences a 
close secret he told only a few friends but in 1954 under increasing pressure from his friends 
he finally went public and began to lecture about his encounters and ten years later his book was 
published as daniel fry says no report was made of this event at the time it occurred partly 
because the u.s missile proving grounds where I worked operated under a tight security cover 
unfortunately factors involving the rules of military security prohibited the publication 
of a large amount of the specific data I received this was the greatest and most exciting event in 
my life and I can't keep it entirely to myself he later wrote a second book called alan's message 
to men of earth in which he elaborated on the importance of social and spiritual progress and 
the dangers of abusing technology so fry's case is definitely controversial some researchers 
believe it to be a hoax or just a story but many others including timothy good a prominent reserve 
believes that there is some validity to the case in april of 1955 two researchers bryant 
and helen reeve actually visited daniel fry in his home and they came away completely convinced 
as they write in our own private research we have applied our own methods of coordination 
in comparison to our study of this contact we have even studied the history of various efforts which 
were made to ridicule it we only wish that in our reporting we could somehow convey to our readers 
some of the qualities of daniel fry himself especially his humility and sincerity while 
our own ideas may not be too important for others for the sake of the few who may wish to know our 
own study indicated to us that this was a physical contact and we feel that the information gained 
will in time emerge as a historic landmark in man's effort to understand and master outer space 
so that's case number 20 and I think it's a significant case one that deserves to be well known and certainly had an impact on how we view this phenomena 
he's one of the major contactees of the 1950s and now we move to case number 19. for case number 19 
i chose the airship of 1880. on march 26 1880 four men were walking outside near gallisdale junction 
in lamy new mexico when they saw quote a strange balloon shaped like a flying fish overhead the 
craft was described as monstrous in size and seemed to be guided by large fan-like device 
attached to the back of the craft this turned out to be one of the first of many airship sightings 
which really became more popular in the turn of the century the 1890s to the 1900s so this is 
one of the earliest of the airship reports what's interesting about this case is there were strange 
written characters decorating the side of the object and even more startling the four witnesses 
described eight to ten normal looking humans on board this craft they spoke in a strange language 
that none of the witnesses were able to understand they also heard shout sounds of shouting 
laughter and music and at some point a few objects were allegedly tossed out of this craft and fell 
to the ground the craft flew at low altitude over the junction gained altitude and moved off towards 
the east the objects tossed from the craft were quickly recovered and allegedly included a flower 
a sheet of fine silk like paper covered with what looked like a strange asian type writing and what 
appeared to be a strange teacup and according to the santa fe daily new mexican newspaper the cup 
was of quote very peculiar workmanship entirely different to anything used in this country 
these objects were apparently put on display temporarily but were immediately purchased by an 
older gentleman who identified himself as a collector of curiosities and these objects were 
never seen again so it's a very strange case it's called caused quite a bit of controversy one of 
the first airship sightings in the united states yeah and it was just 15 years later that this huge 
airship wave struck the united states and the world and really kind of ushered in the idea 
of extraterrestrials from outer space so it's a significant case for sure and that's why I 
included it in this list and now we move to case number 18 which I call blue book case number 139 
unidentified this was the first new mexico case to be declared officially unidentified by the air 
force's project blue book staff and it occurred on april 5th 1948 on that day three trained balloon 
observers also identified as navy missile trackers and a scientist they were from the geophysics labs 
section at holloman air force base and were conducting tests when they observed a white 
object with a golden aura fly at quote tremendous speed over the base this object performed 
incredible maneuvers including steep climbs and vertical loops and one of the witnesses 
described the object as an irregularly rounded craft with a slightly concave top and all of the 
witnesses agreed that it was roughly disc shaped in about one-fifth the apparent size of a full 
moon or about 35 feet in diameter what's amazing about this case is that one of the scientists was 
able to train a theodolite on the object which allows it's sort of a telescope a 
track attached to a protractor which allows them to track the speed and trajectory of the object 
and after viewing it through a theodolite for several minutes this craft accelerated to the west at a speed that the theodolite measured in excess of 18 000 miles per hour 
air force investigators were of course impressed that the men had seen something that flew 
faster than any known object and they labeled the case unexplained one of several cases in 
new mexico that the air force was never able to identify as anything conventional 
so a strange strange case uh one that should be more well known than it is and that's why 
i included it and now we get to case number 17 which I call case 17 ufo destroys water tank 
this occurred in tucumcari new mexico on december 13 1951 when numerous witnesses uh including 
lorenzo gutierrez and other looked up in the sky and saw a bright ball of light what appeared to be 
a fireball streak across the sky and actually land right next to the tukumkari water tank it then 
proceeded to move towards the tank and collided into it and this tank which had metal holes about 
3 eighths of an inch thick held uh estimated three million gallons of water and when this fireball 
collided into the tank the tank immediately collapsed this caused a huge flood a lot of damage 
many structures were knocked right over and four people were killed 20 structures were destroyed 
property damage was estimated in the millions and there was of course an investigation and 
accident investigators inspected the tank and were puzzled that the breach in the whole of this tank 
was so clean that it appeared as if it had been cut by a knife there was no other clear evidence 
to show what exactly had crashed into this tank so this was a very puzzling event which caused a 
lot of attention ufo investigators like jim and coral lorenzen harold t wilkins and others uh 
heard about this an event and investigated and news of this event spread and 
astronomer dr lincoln lapaz was actually asked about this case and after reviewing the details 
he said that this object could not have been a meteor or a natural fireball because if 
it were it would have left a crater or some evidence of meteorotic residue nevertheless 
officially the cause of this water tank failure according to the authorities was a welding fault 
no mention was made of this strange fireball-like object which was seen by multiple witnesses this 
was the course of huge event was published in many newspapers and still remains unexplained 
to this day I don't buy the official explanation that this was a welding fault because they simply 
refused to include any mention of this strange fireball so perhaps this was a ufo of some kind 
hard to say but it's definitely a very interesting and puzzling case which is why I included it on this list and now we move to case number 16. for k16 I chose 
astronomer robert schaldak sees a ufo this is a really interesting case and it shows it's a good 
example of how project blue book officers appeared to be unfairly biased in their investigations and 
would often discount really good cases I remember robert shaldack is a professional astronomer he 
worked at lowell observat observatory and uh this case occurred in january 25 1955 and at that time 
robert schuldak was working in a civilian capacity in the technical service unit at white sands 
proving ground and it was his job to it involved the camera monitoring of missile launches 
and at 10 pm on january 25th 1954 he was setting up his ballistic camera to monitor a launch 
and as he looked up at the stars to calibrate his instrument he noticed a quote yellow white 
light moving from the northeast to the southeast in a shallow arc this object seemed to 
pulse in brightness at regular intervals and unknown to robert shaldack another white sands 
employee 17 miles to the southeast was also watching this object these were both 
trained observers and after they discovered each other's reports they were able to perform 
triangulation measurements and determine that this object was about 12 miles distant and moving at 12 000 miles per hour as robert shall deck writes I have observed many 
thousands of meteors and can definitely state that this object was not any kind of meteor 
robert shaldack worked with famed astronomer clyde tombaugh and quickly alerted him 
of the sighting and clyde tombaugh encouraged robert shaldack to report his sighting to project 
blue book which he did along with the other witness and however despite the fact that 
robert schaldack a professional and straw astronomer insisted that this object was 
not a meteor project blue book investigators wrote in their official conclusion of the case 
it was astronomical a meteor so that's ridiculous here's a professional astronomer saying it's 
not a meteor and the blue book officers who have no astronomical training called it a meteor anyway 
this should have been an unidentified case so project blue book was not being objective 
something that we now know to be true and it's an important case which is why I wanted it on this 
list and now we move along to case number 15 and for case 15 I chose the ufo contacts of paul villa 
this gentleman his full name is apollinar paul alberta via jr and he is a very controversial 
contactee case uh some investigators have tried to debunk his case others stand by him but his 
case is really interesting because he was able to photograph ufos very clearly on numerous occasions 
paul villa was born in 1916 he's a native american he's also spanish german and scottish 
and he claims that from a very young age age of five actually he was telepathically contacted 
by extraterrestrial intelligences and was taught by them and uh he became very well versed in 
mathematics electricity physics mechanics uh he had an unusual talent for detecting defects in 
engines generators and other machines and he worked as a mechanic first for the air force 
and later as a private citizen so a good witness I mean an air force mechanic and he claims that 
his first face-to-face contact occurred in 1963 at the time he was working for the department of 
water and power in los angeles california and he was at long beach one day in 1953 actually 
when he had a strong inclination to go down to the beach a very strong impulse and there he met a 
seven foot tall humanoid this humanoid scared him but called him by name and at this point paul via 
realized that he was communicating with a quote very superior intelligence and that 
this was probably an extraterrestrial as paul via says he knew everything I had in my mind 
and told me many things that had taken place in my life he told me to look out beyond the reef 
i saw a metallic-looking disc-shaped object that seemed to be floating on the water then 
the spaceman asked me if I would like to go aboard the craft and look around and I went 
with him on board the craft via says he saw more human-like ET's though they were more refined 
in their face and body they were very intelligent with a advanced knowledge 
of science and they proceeded to give him all kinds of scientific information they told him 
that the galaxy to which our planet belongs is just like a grain of sand on a giant beach 
and that there are many many other galaxies out there and they told him that they because of their 
advanced technology they're able to evade earth's radar and they can will only appear on radar when 
they want themselves to be seen when they want to call attention to the presence of their craft 
they told them that their craft are constantly active around their our planet at all times 
and that as time went on there would be more and more sightings and landings which was an effort to increase public awareness of their existence 
which is exactly what we have seen they said that they were on a friendly mission to help the people 
of earth they told them that they had bases on the moon on phobos which is one of the moons of mars 
they told him that phobos was actually hollow and had been artificially constructed 
so many investigators began to look into this case particularly because of the photographs investigators like gabriel greene another investigator was brad steiger 
timothy good has looked into this case many investigators have wendell stevens 
jim and coral lorenzen timothy green beckley in fact wendell stevens published a book 
on paul villa's contacts and why paul villa's case generated so much attention was because of 
later contexts in which he was able to actually photograph these craft one of these photographic 
sessions occurred on june 16 1963 when paul villa received a telepathic message which told him to 
drive alone in his pickup truck to a site near the town of peralta which is about 15 miles south of 
albuquerque and at this point a ufo appeared which paul via estimates was about 160 maybe 170 feet 
in diameter and this ship appeared to pose and hover at low altitudes and at various distances as 
paul via took photographs of it around the trees he used his truck to show it in the foreground 
and yeah it took many many pictures a couple of these photos show the ship as it flips on edge and 
according to paul via the beings told him that they created an artificial gravity field within 
their craft so that it could assume any position although the people inside were 
totally comfortable and didn't feel like they were moving around at all at one point this 
craft hovered about 300 feet above his truck and actually caused it to rise slowly into the air 
about three or four feet for just a few minutes it was a little demonstration showing them how they 
were able to levitate vehicles and uh when this craft was about a quarter mile away a controlled 
flexible rod could be seen extruding from the craft probing the ground in trees at 
different angles and while this was going on a small shiny remotely controlled sphere 
about six to nine feet in diameter exited the main craft and shot around glowing a reddish color 
and so he took many photographs of this craft occasionally it would change changing color from 
a shiny chrome to a dull aluminum and then back to amber he said when it glowed amber it looked like 
hot metal and at one point it became so bright that he could barely look at it it passed over 
his head and he could feel heat from it and a prickly tingling sensation all over his body 
at one point it actually landed on tripod legs and nine crew members five men and four women 
disembarked and uh he said that they were well proportioned immaculately groomed dressed in 
tight-fitting one-piece uniforms they told him that they came from the constellation of coma 
berenice which is many light years distant this constellation is notable for the large number of 
galaxies that it contains and after communicating telepathically they told him that they were able 
to speak many of the languages of our planet and he had a 90-minute long conversation 
in which they conversed both in english and in spanish and uh told him all kinds of things 
talked about personal issues as well as general uh matters they told him that by 1966 
17 nations on earth will have obtained atomic technology and will have an atomic bomb 
and uh all of this communication was through telepathy uh it was their desire that earthlings 
would rise above their aggressiveness their warlike instincts and they told paul via that 
love is quote the most powerful force in all the universe and when used correctly could transform 
the hearts of men they said and I quote when the law of love rules the minds of the men of earth 
then the people of other worlds will come in great numbers and share with us their advanced sciences
so that was the end of that particular contact but it wasn't his last one in april of 1965 he had 
another visitation and I was able to take a bunch of photographs this was on april 18 1965 about 
20 miles south of albuquerque very close to the rio grande river the ship again landed on tripod 
gear landing gears which protruded from the bottom of the craft crew members exited thr three of them 
this time and uh yeah he photographed all of this and this was thrilling for many researchers 
brad steiger examined these photographs and calls as he says and I quote these are 
among the clearest ufo photographs ever taken though controversy over their authenticity has 
raged for decades his apparently last contact occurred in late june of 1977 early in the 
morning well at around 11 30 a.m paul via was washing dishes in his kitchen when he heard a loud 
crashing sound and looking out through his window he saw that the truck bed in front of his home 
had just fallen off of its blocks and looking above the truck he was shocked to see a small 
silver chrome-like flying machine was flat on the bottom with a domed top and appeared to be about 
10 to 20 feet in diameter he grabbed his 127 instamatic camera and rushed out into the yard 
and quickly snapped a series of approximately 11 photographs as the object circled overhead 
so yeah this is absolutely an amazing and controversial case there have been 
accusations of a hoax but no one has been able to prove it no one has been able to determine 
how paul via was able to take these incredibly clear photographs so it's a very interesting 
case which has had an impact upon this field for sure and that's why I wanted to include it here 
and that moves us along to case number 14 which I call burned by a ufo this is a classic case 
it's been quoted in many books it was recently investigated in depth by researcher david marler 
who happens to live in the same town where this case occurred which is hobbes new mexico 
and this case occurred many years ago at 4 p.m on june 2nd 1964 and the main witness 
was an eight-year-old boy by the name of charles keith davis and he had gone with his grandmother 
to the local laundromat the deluxe laundry and he was playing outside 
the doorway of the laundromat while his grandmother miss frank smith was inside 
and she was just about three feet away from charles when she heard a strange sound which she 
described as like a whizzing bullet and she told reporters and I quote there was a whooshing sound 
and a blackish ball of fire covered charlie he was covered with black his hair standing on end 
and burning charles was just as black as he could be his hair was standing up on top his 
head I grabbed him and tried to smother out his hair which was on fire she just barely had time 
to see what appeared to be a metallic object that looked kind of like a top swooped down out of the 
sky hang just above her grandson's head poured out smoke soot and fire and within seconds this object 
darted away other employees at the laundry rushed out and helped extinguish the flames 
charles keith was badly burned and his face and neck immediately began to swell there 
was a strange city substance all over him and uh he turned to his grandma and said grandma 
am I going to die well they quickly rushed him to the local lee general hospital lee county hospital 
and he was treated for second degree burns on his hand and face and he explained to the doctors that 
while he was playing he saw this quote small black object with flames a fire that came out of the sky 
a bunch of his hair was burnt off one of his ears according to his grandmother looked like quote 
a piece of raw meat his head and face were so swollen that his eyes had been forced shut and 
his nose was just barely visible this of course did get the attention of the fbi 
they requested more scent samples of the boy's burned hair his skin and t-shirt for analysis 
this is according to charles's grandmother and she said she never heard back from the fbi and 
has no idea if they found anything unusual researcher coral lorenzen was able to speak 
with the doctor who treated charles keith and the doctor obviously believed the story and told uh
uh mrs he told coral lorenzen that there was nothing particularly unusual about 
charles keith's burns except for one thing which is that charles suffered no pain and he 
recuperated in the hospital for about five days uh at which time he healed from his injuries he 
felt no pain only intense itching that was so severe he had to be sedated what's interesting 
about this case is david marler was able to locate charles keith davis many years later 
and did a follow-up interview on the martin willis ufo podcast and charles keith davis recounted 
the whole story there I definitely recommend taking a look at it it's an incredible story 
it's one of very few cases in which people have claimed to be injured by an apparent ufo 
what exactly this was is hard to say it's not a unique case but it's certainly 
very very unusual it's an excellent case involving physiological reactions and that's why I wanted 
to include it here and now we move along we go to case number 13 which I call the ufo wave of 1965. 
and this was investigated largely by frank edwards a ufo researcher and 
broadcaster and also by coral and jim lorenzen and what's amazing about this case is it was witnessed 
by tens of thousands of people this is one of the most widely viewed ufo incidents in u.s history 
and at the time there was a huge wave going on across the entire united states 
on the evening of august 1st 1965 police officers in hobbes new mexico 
observed a quote round white object with an orange tail which moved overhead from east to west 
and it was just a short time later in about 69 miles to the west that a police dispatcher in 
carlsbad new mexico reported his sighting of a similar or the same object and at the same time 
36 miles northwest of carlsbad policemen in artesia received four separate reports 
of a bright white round object with a red colored tail which passed overhead northeast of town 
so this little mini wave was spectacular in its own right but the next night proved to be one of 
the most dramatic events ever in u.s history and according to researcher frank edwards and I quote 
one of the great landmark dates in the unfolding ufo mystery was the memorable night of august 2nd 
and 3rd 1965. again a huge ufo wave was going on but this night proved to be unbelievably active 
thousands of reports came from all across the central united states from north dakota down 
through new mexico all the way to arizona and as frank edward writes and I quote tens of thousands 
of persons in the great plains states stood out on that warm clear night and watched an awe-inspiring 
aerial exhibition sometimes the lights moved in formation sometimes it was a single pulsing 
light sometimes they went high sometimes so low that they could be photographed by amateur camera 
operators they were tracked on radar both civil and military according to state police reports 
and they changed formation from time to time they changed speed and they changed color and size it was a magnificent display that brought out an estimated quarter of a million 
viewers the next morning the air force uh released an explanation and according to frank 
edwards the air force's conclusion was quote four stars in the constellation orion
this turned out to be an absolutely ridiculous debunking explanation according to frank edwards 
this widespread sighting and the air force's weak response actually inspired him to write his 
first ufo book flying saucers serious business which became the first ufo book ever to reach the 
best seller list and the air force explanation that this was four stars in the constellation 
orion is completely ridiculous professional astronomer dr robert risser pointed out that 
this could not have been correct because the constellation orion at that time was not even 
visible from the united states which just once again goes to show that the air force is 
lying lying lying when it comes to ufos and that's why I want to include this case because 
it is one of the most widely viewed cases in the united states and remains largely unknown 
and now we move on to the next case for case number 12 I chose norad confirms pilot encounter 
this is definitely one of the most significant sightings of the 1990s on may 25th 1995 the crew 
of american west airlines flight 565 was flying from tampa florida to las vegas when 
they had a dramatic encounter with a large unknown object which raced by their plane 
this flight was piloted by captain eugene tolleson and first officer john waller and they were at 
about 39 000 feet heading north over texas when at about 10 25 p.m they observed a strange looking 
craft just below them at thirty thousand feet they estimate that this object was about 400 feet long 
was thin cylindrical and had blinking pulsing pulsating strobe lights flashing in sequence 
along its entire length and as flight 564 was entering new mexico they radioed albuquerque 
air control and asked them if there was any other traffic in the area and at this point 
the following conversation ensued and I'd just like to play the audio tape which was released
and it basically presents the conversation that took place between these pilots albuquerque air traffic control and cannon air force base and eventually
norrad
one aircraft
i had a couple of aircraft reported something 300 to 400 foot long slender pool is shaped 
with a strobe oh at 30 000 feet we don't have anything going on this guy 
definitely saw it run all the way down the side of the airplane it's right out of the x-files I mean it's a definite ufo or something like that
yeah he's real serious about it too he looked at it
now
10 miles
is
uh
one of those weird things
so as you can see this is a very significant case the only other known traffic in this area 
at that time other than flight 564 was an air force f-117a nighthawk stealth fighter 
from the 49th fighter wing at holloman air force base and they actually you know spoke to this 
uh stealth fighter pilot so none of the people were able to identify this 
and this object whatever it was eventually accelerated off into the distance and was gone 
uh albuquerque control was of course concerned about this unidentified craft and that's when 
norad became involved in this whole conference conversation and norad 
confirmed that they were actually tracking this object so later researchers were able to 
actually obtain copies of this recording and on december 16 1995 after they had contacted norad 
norad responded with an official letter denying that they had any information about this incident 
and that they knew nothing about it that they had quote no reports and no recordings of the alleged 
incident and they actually asked investigators not to attempt to use the freedom of information act 
to get records from norad as they as norad they said is exempt from the freedom of information act 
so this is just a blatant cover-up it's an incredible event we've got the proof of it 
and that's why I wanted to include it on this list of new mexico encounters and now we move 
to case number 11 and for case 11 I chose the invasion of canon air force base this is an 
incredible encounter this occurred in 1976 when a series of ufo sightings over cannon air force base 
which is located in clovis californi or clovis new mexico and this series of sightings over this very 
sensitive air force base caused deep concern at very high levels of military and government 
the actual date was january 21st at 4 55 a.m when security police at the base observed 
two glowing objects hovering near the flight line on the base the objects were an estimated 
25 yards in diameter 75 feet they were gold or silver in color with a blue light on top 
a hole in the middle and a red light on the bottom air force launched an immediate investigation they looked into weather data 
radar evidence and this sighting was eventually actually reported to the national military command 
center in washington d.c where it was recorded in a memorandum by rear admiral jb morin 
who was at that time the deputy director for operations at the national military command center 
so we have actual proof that this encounter did take place these objects over canon were also 
seen by a large number of clovis residents one of them was scott price who was a journalism student 
at new mexico university and he actually took a photograph of this object as it performed strange 
maneuvers over clovis another witness was a high school senior by the name of steve moscato and he 
was in the top floor of the clovis hotel when he saw this object and this was on january 21st but 
the next day on january 22 1976 the ufos returned they again appeared over cannon air force base 
which on this time cannon air force base scrambled jets to try to intercept these objects 
these objects reportedly easily evaded the jets darting at 90 degree angles and accelerating at 
very high speeds and the encounter wasn't over yet the next day january 23rd the ufos came 
back for a third night in a row shortly after the objects appeared the clovis police station 
received a huge flood of calls by now everyone in clovis knew about the sightings and a lot 
of people saw this third sighting according to police dispatcher diane kennemar it seemed that 
quote nearly everyone end quote in clovis called in to report ufos as she says and again I quote 
that many people can't be wrong they all saw them at the same time plus our officers saw them every 
citizen that called was really willing to give his name address and phone number and according 
to the clovis police they received well in excess of 30 reports made between nightfall and midnight 
and according to diana kennemar several callers reported seeing up to 20 objects at once 
hovering directly over the sandia elementary school which was located in the north part 
of clovis and it was at this same time that the town marshall willie roncheo of the nearby town of 
texaco received a ufo report and going outside he saw an object totally silent hovering at 
about 900 feet directly over the town of texaco and according to him this object glowed green 
and yellow and blue and when it moved northward he actually chased the object in 
his car and heard several other police officers reporting their observations of the same object 
one of the witnesses was actually a newspaper journalist with the clovis news journal and he was 
one of the witnesses who viewed no uh less than 23 objects he said sliding in and out of formation 
across the sky over clovis and a group of state police officers reported one of the last sightings 
of that evening they saw a single object moving at a high rate of speed heading towards tucumcari 
so by this time of course the objects made front-page news they were the talk of the town and according to witness steve moscato and I quote everybody was excited about it 
all the major networks were in town and they were all on top of the hotel clovis 
various ufo groups of course descended upon the town in hopes of that the ufos would come back and make another appearance but apparently this wave of activity was over 
and a spokesman from reese air force base which is 90 miles east of clovis so that they had nothing 
on their radar and officials from cannon air force base were less forthcoming they said nothing 
a mate a gentleman by the name of major bert roton who was the command post controller on that day 
did tell reporters that the base had received numerous inquiries from citizens about the sightings but that and I quote as far as the military is concerned it is strictly no comment 
so thanks so much again these guys are covering it up it's ridiculous one serviceman who was a 
vietnam veteran actually reported to the national ufo reporting center that he was stationed at 
canon air force base during this incident and he watched these jets get scrambled after the 
bogeys as he called him and he spoke with the radar operator and as this officer says he the 
radar operator said he had never seen anything like this the bogies would appear and disappear 
seeming without cause and would occasionally move at incredible speeds over and near the base 
so this serviceman actually called the radar shack again and asked about the bogeys and a man 
answered the phone identified himself as a captain and threatened the witness and said and I quote 
there were no bogeys and no scramble what you are talking about never happened you 
are a lying bleep I'll censor that word and I can prove it I will have you busted I will be watching your every move airman you are not 
to mention a word of this to anyone ever am I clear their servicemen report replied yes sir
so here we again have a valid incident viewed by dozens scores of people including military 
officers jets scrambled after it and the air force is saying absolutely nothing
researcher brian vike actually interviewed a service man who said that he found several burned 
circles in a rancher's field in clovis and that each of these circles was 30 feet in diameter and 
the service this same service man told brian vike that he was interviewed by an agent from 
washington dc regarding the events later ufo researcher ray stanford also uh studied the 
case and came away convinced that this was a real sighting researcher richard dolan also looked into 
it and came away convinced of the authenticity of this incredible wave of encounters and as 
richard dolan writes it appears that something strange was going on in eastern new mexico 
this is actually not the first time cannon air force base has had incredible encounters it was 
some years earlier on may 18 1954 when there was a really incredible sighting so this is more than 20 
years earlier and this was investigated by jacques valle and a ufo landed directly on canon military 
base the witnesses were two people who were on the grounds of the base when they saw a lens shaped 
object about the size of a house swoop down out of the sky and land next to the railroad tracks and 
as it landed it disturbed the local environment causing a minor sand storm around it and after 
the dust settled one of the witnesses started to walk closely towards this landed object and as he 
got close he became overwhelmed with fear and ran away and this object took off and departed 
so that is the invasion of clovis air force base it's an amazing case not that well known and very 
well verified though completely covered up by our wonderful us government and military that's why I 
wanted to include it here it's an important case that should be well known so there you have it 
that is case number 20 all the way to case number 11 of the top 20 ufo encounters in new mexico 
these cases are taken from my book ufos over new mexico a true history of ufo encounters in 
the land of enchantment so if you want to learn more about these cases please do check out that book I've decided to chop this episode up into two parts because it was just getting too long 
i have a lot of information I want to share so part two will come next week and we'll include 
case number 10 all the way to case number one so please stay tuned and check it out next week 
until then thanks very much for watching I really appreciate it and keep having fun.
