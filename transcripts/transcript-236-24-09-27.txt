UNKNOWN HUMANOIDS: TEN CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND
Sep 27, 2024

Summary:
Sep 27, 2024
A close encounter of third kind: meetings with humanoids. This happens more often than most people think. There are thousands upon thousands of cases on record, coming from all over the world. This episode presents ten cases of extraterrestrial humanoid encounters you probably haven’t heard before. Short and tall humanoids, human-looking ETs, robotic beings, grays…and more. Each case reveals remarkable insights into the nature of UFO contact, what they are doing, and why they are here.

PLANT-PICKING ETS. One morning in July 1954, Harold Carpenter woke up to hear a buzzing noise coming from the woods near his home in Temple Ewell, England. When it happened several times, he went to investigate, and came upon a landed UFO and five short humanoids. They were using tweezer-like instruments to place twigs and leaves in small jars. Seeing Harold, they fled into their craft, and flew off.

SOMETHING ABNORMAL. Driving near Girona, Spain one night in October 1958, Jose Luis Angelo observed a UFO descend into the forest. Suspecting a plane crash, he pulled over and ventured into the forest. Instead, he came upon a UFO hovering above the ground. Next to it were two short, large-headed humanoids wearing jumpsuits. He watched for 15 minutes until they returned to their craft and departed.

I WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE! As 13-year-old Maria Ivanovna returned to her home in Vitebsk, Belarus one day in July of 1963, she saw two metallic discs overhead. Suddenly her 4-year-old brother ran towards them, and one of the discs swooped down apparently to pick him up. Maria’s sister grabbed him and pulled him away just in time. But they were all close enough to see a four-foot-tall humanoid sitting inside a transparent dome on top of the craft.

THE WINSTED ENCOUNTERS. On the night of September 15, 1967, two teen-age girls looked out the window and saw a glowing UFO crisscrossing the fields behind one of their homes in Winsted, Connecticut. Moments later, they heard a noise in the barn, and saw two short humanoids with big heads run across their yard. Soon a third one appeared. This was just the first of a wave of encounters that put Winsted on the UFO map.

BLUE RIDGE HUMANOID. On the night of March 1, 1974, Billy Wayne Plasters saw an odd glow on the hill near his farm in Vesta, Virginia. Alerting his family, they all observed a strange craft ascend and dart away. When the strange glow remained, Billy and his brother-in-law drove to the area and came upon a landed craft and a tall “well-built” humanoid. They tried to talk to it, but when it moved towards them, they panicked and fled. Later, they found a huge burned spot.

THE SHINY SILVER SEWICKLEY HUMANOID. In January of 1974, numerous people across central Pennsylvania reported UFOs. Many reported that they were chased down the highway by strange craft. But events came to a climax on the night of March 24 when a young man was motorcycling in a rural area of Sewickley and caught a tall, silver-clad humanoid figure by surprise. The figure crouched and then darted away, leaving behind strange footprints.

THE SWEET-SMELLING ALIEN. Hearing footsteps outside his home in Villorba, Italy on the night of June 25, 1974, Mr. DP went outside and saw his cat was bristling with fear. He also smelled a strange sweet odor. Sensing a presence, he was then shocked by the appearance of a glowing humanoid in a shiny skin-tight jumpsuit. The strange being quickly floated up into the sky and was gone. Mr. DP was stunned and after his encounter, had a headache that persisted for a full week.

THE ET WITH THE FLASHING EYES. At 9pm one evening in July 1975, Carmen B stepped outside of her home in St. Dizier, France to hang her laundry. Without warning, the yard was flooded with light. Turning around, she saw a short humanoid staring at her. It had a huge head and large flashing eyes that left her hypnotized and paralyzed with fear. She almost fainted from shock, but managed to break free and flee into the house.

THE ETS IN THE FOREST. On the afternoon of February 14, 1984, a group of young children playing in the Tuchola Forest near their homes in Linowek, Poland saw a small craft descend downward. At least two metallic-looking short humanoids frightened the children who fled to their homes. Investigators had the children draw what they saw. Later, landing traces were found.

AN INTERRUPTED JOURNEY. At 4:30 pm on August 25, 1999, mechanic Carlos Colon’s truck mysteriously stalled along National Route 5 near Trenque Lauquen, Argentina. Five tall figures in a glowing dome appeared in front of him. Suddenly, the beings turned away and they disappeared. Carlos found himself standing in a field some distance away. After the encounter, numerous psychic and paranormal events occurred.

Ten more cases showing once more that we are not alone in the Universe. It’s time for the world to face this fact. UFOs are real. Extraterrestrials are here!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is called unknown humanoids 10 Close Encounters of the Third Kind every
single one of these cases involves very closeup encounters with humanoids of various kinds I love the humanoid cases
we've got a lot to learn from them they're super interesting it's certainly the most popular subject on my channel
so these 10 cases I chosen come from all over the world including England Italy
France Spain Poland as well as bellarus uh one from Argentina and three
from the United States including Pennsylvania Connecticut and West
Virginia so some really interesting types of cases here all different kinds
of humanoids short little dwarf-like beings Grays robotic beings tall beings
human looking ets a full range of humanoid types and of course supported
by a wide variety of evidence including not only multiple eyewitness testimonies
but of course Landing traces physiological effects uh electromagnetic disturbances
animal reactions the whole gamut that we see so often with these types of
encounters so all of these cases are super interesting and again I think have
something to add to our knowledge of what's going on here in the first case I'd like to talk about I call plant
picking ETS I chose this case because it is quite unusual it's a very early case and
it also is sort of typical of the patterns we see in so many of these cases with ETS coming down to apparently
scientifically study our planet it's Al interesting because this case started
with a very mysterious set of circumstances and events and culminated in a very close encounter with a landed
UFO and quite unusual looking humanoids this one occurred in July of 1954 in a
rural area of the UK known as cold blow this is outside of Temple Ule in Kent
England this case comes from UK researcher Chris Ral the witness Harold
Carpenter he's a wood cutter and the weird events began early one morning around 4 a.m. in July of
1954 when Harold woke up in his home in Temple e this is a small community he
started hearing a strange loud humming noise it seemed to be coming from a
nearby forested area but it lasted only two or 3 minutes and then went away but
over the next few weeks this humming noise occurred several times times waking them up usually between 4: and 5
a.m. and always coming from the same area so one day curiosity got the best
of Herold and he got up and followed this noise to a wooded area it was still
dark in these pre-dawn hours as he traced this noise to a clearing and this
is when he noticed a Strang looking round craft hovering about 8 to 10 ft
off the ground he said it was about 20 ft wide but most shocking was that five
very strange beings were standing underneath it he said they were each about 4 and 1/2 to 5 feet tall and
carrying what looked to him like large jam jars jelly jars in one hand the
other hand they were holding tweezer like instruments which they were using to sort of pick up twigs and leaves
which they put into their jars now Harold did notice that none of them seemed to stray far from the crack
which was now hovering in complete silence no longer making any humming noise so he slowly crept closer and as
he did he got a better look at these guys he could see that each of them were wearing a onepiece flexible gray suit
which covered them pretty much from head to toe covering everything except their faces he says they looked very much
humanlike had normal eyes but their faces were strangely expressionless and
he also noticed that their noses is stuck out kind of like a pig's nose he said he also saw that they only had four
fingers on each hand seeming to lack a thumb so he continued inching forward
until he got real close to within about 10 ft of this craft and it was at this
point that one of the beings looked up and stared at him still totally expressionless it didn't speak didn't
make any noticeable movements to alert the other beings but suddenly all of them immediately stopped what they were
doing the craft lowered to just a few inches above the ground and one by one
these little humanoids walked up to the craft and stepped into the lip of the rim and went inside the craft
immediately began to rise Herold actually saw one of the beings stepping inside an opening the last one which
then closed this craft rose up it moved slightly towards a clearing among the
trees then gradually gained altitude and speed until it suddenly emitted a flash
of light and took off with instant acceleration and was gone another amazing case and yes it does rest on one
person's anecdotal eyewitness testimony but certainly fits the pattern we see in so many cases and the humanoids are
quite unusual as well I think it's an important case and you can always discard one case but there's another one
where that came from like this one which I call something abnormal this occurred in October of
1958 in gona Spain I like this case because it started out with a simple
sighting and could have ended there but the witness decided to stop his car and walk out into the forest to investigate
further and this simple sighting turned into a very dramatic close-up encounter with a landed UFO and humanoids it's
also a super interesting case because the his description of this craft is
really unusual this is a briefcase and somewhat typical if you can use that
term when describing an encounter with humanoids in a landed UFO the witness is a gentleman by the
name of Jose Louie Angelou he had spent the day working and around 700 p.m.
again this is in October of 1958 he was driving his motorcycle between s Jordi
Deval and Seria deer again in gona Spain
and was heading west to his home he was near the tur River when he saw
something abnormal happening in the sky which actually prompted him to stop his
car and observe coming out of the blue he said was a powerful white Spotlight
it was approaching the forest near the road and descended at high speed and when it reached the trees the brilliant
illumination from this object disappeared but judging by its speed and sudden disappearance Jose Louie assumed
that the object must have been a burning plane that had crashed in the forest but it was strange because he did not hear
any noise nor did he hear or see any evidence of a crash so this made him
even more Curious he got out of his car walked into the forest to search for
what he assumed would be the remains of some aircraft accident cuz he had seen
exactly where this object went down and traveling There He Came Upon something
that left him absolutely astonished because right in front of him about 70 M
away this is about 200 ft was an oval object metallic with an appearance of
aluminum he said about 8 m tall 2 and 1/2 M wide or 25 ft by 8 ft he said it
was hovering about 4 M 17 ft or so above the ground it had transparent Dome on
top with what looked like quote metallic nerves around it so these weird sort of
struts around the Dome he says light was coming out from the top of it and he said the craft made a sound similar to a
buzzing it's almost as if there were nozzles that launched a very strong jet
of air he said he said it also looked like it had Small string-like Things
dangling down from the bottom but he couldn't get a good look at them to see exactly what they were but the most
astonishing part was that just a short distance from the craft he saw two
humanoid beings now he couldn't see them that well it was quite dark but he did see that they had very large heads they
were about 1 M tall about 3 ft dressed in dark suits that looked a little like
leather or perhaps rubber so he walked up as near to them as he dared and he
could see that they appeared to be collecting samples from the ground and were always staying quite close close to
the craft a third being was actually looking out from the Dome of the craft and watching the other two so he hid
behind a tree and even though he did that the beings at one point did turn and look at him again because of the
darkness he couldn't see their facial features but they remained there
watching him and still collecting samples for a full 15 minutes uh says
Jose and then finally they returned back into the cow which at this point made a loud buzzing
sound and it Rose vertically once it reached a height of about 150 ft it
hovered there briefly at this point a metallic ring around the circumference emitted multicolored lights and the
object darted off instantly at very high speed to the Northeast it was now completely dark so
Jose did not check the ground where this craft had hovered or these beings had walked around instead he just returned
home he did say that the only real effect other than the amazing sight of
these beings was that he was unable to sleep at all that night so true this is
another case that rests on a single person's eyewitness testimony but it was professionally researched by an
experienced investigator and I think it does add to our knowledge of what's going on here there's so many cases like
these and here's another one which is really unusual I call this one my want
to go for a ride this one occurred in July of 1963 in the shumu Lino area of VB bellus
don't get a whole lot of cases coming from this area but I like this case because it is a multiple witness case
really unusual humanoids a very close-up encounter and also it's interesting
because in most cases the Witnesses are quite frightened of what they're seeing and that's true with some of the
Witnesses in this case but one of the witnesses is was very excited and actually went running towards the craft
so it's a pretty interesting case this case comes from the bellerian eological
committee and probably would have remained Unknown by most of the world if
not for Albert Rosales who presented it in his books now this is a very unusual
case involving multiple Witnesses it was around known as 13-year-old Maria ivanovna was is
returning to her home near the railway station in the shumu Lino District of
vitb this is near the village of mazero in the bellarus area and as she reached
her home she noticed that the sunlight seemed brighter than usual and looking
up she saw two quote plates discs round and steel colored like tin foil they
were hovering in the sky one object was quite high up and the other was much lower now at this moment her
four-year-old brother Anton also saw these objects and he started running
towards the lower object actually ran right through a small stream soaking his
pants Maria shouted at him asking him where he was going and that he needed to
put dry clothes on by this point the objects were descending to near ground
level and suddenly this is when Maria noticed that Anton was getting very close to one of them in fact he shouted
out at one of the objects I want to go for a ride Maria wondered for a second
who he was talking to but realized he was shouting to this UFO now for her
this object was so bright she couldn't see inside it clearly but as it came in for a an apparent Landing apparently to
intercept Anton her little brother who was still running towards it Maria could now see that this object was actually
disc shaped with a transparent Dome on top it was quite small no wider than 5T
she said and inside this transparent Dome she could see a little man sitting
in a metallic looking chair and this figure was not large she says about the
size of a 10-year-old child he wore a steel looking helmet and she noticed in
fact that this figure occupied almost the entire interior of this object
he appeared to be using his hands which were below the transparent Dome not visible uh to operate or maneuver this
dis shaped craft now Maria's little sister nadda
she's age 10 quickly ran towards Anton at Maria's instructions grabbed him by
the arm and pulled him away from this object and Maria felt absolutely certain
that if her other sister hadn't shown up Anton would probably have been scooped up by this object but now Anton was now
in the safety of his sister and this disc apparently in reaction to this quickly rose up to about 500 ft and both
of these objects promptly darted away at very high speed I have to wonder what
would have happened in that case if Anton's siblings hadn't intervened and pulled him away from this craft it might
have been an onboard encounter hard to say for sure but C certainly a compelling and important case and
interesting because of the area where it comes from there's some really
interesting elements to it so many cases of these short little humanoids I read a study once which showed that over 60% of
reported humanoids are 4 feet and under and we certainly see a lot of these
short little humanoids now let's move to this next case which is unbelievably interesting
this actually involves a series of encounters one of which is a very close-up and longlasting encounter with
a landed UFO and multiple humanoids it's also a multiple witness case this one occurred on September 15
1967 in the small town of Winstead Connecticut now if this were the only
case there that would be super interesting but it's not there are a whole bunch of cases in this tiny little
town very close encounters a lot of witnesses there's something really
unusual going on in this town all of the events in this case occurred very close
to each other all in this little town of Winstead Connecticut but the first big
event was investigated by nightcap researcher Ted thin and this occurred
again on September 15 1967 along a little road called wallin's
Hill Road you can see it here it's just a small stretch of dirt road about a
mile long the two primary Witnesses are 14-year-old girlfriends Carol Luke and
Ruth Pacini it was 8:45 in the evening and
they were looking out the Second Story window of Carol's bedroom window when they noticed a glowing elliptical object
not big about the size of a small car and it was moving back and forth at very
low altitude over a field just south of their home this was above and beyond the
barn which was about 50 ft away from their house so this object appeared to
be less than 200 ft Beyond The Barn pretty close they watched it for a full
half hour as it moved up and down left and right pulsating in brightness they
had never heard of UFOs they weren't sure what they were looking at but this is when they suddenly heard this strange
sort of putt putt noise coming from the barn area it sort of reminded them of a
lawnmower that f failed to start and it was at this point that they saw two
small figures run from the barn and stop by a mailbox right along wallen's Hill
Road these two beings appeared to be about 4T tall they were wearing similar
outfits the girls couldn't see them very clearly because it was a cloudy night
but one of the girls was able to see that these figures had abnormally large
heads and they house appeared to be staring in the direction of their house
so after about 2 minutes of this the figures darted across the road and stood
under a large tree now Ruth and Carol are talking about what's going on here and trying to
figure out who these figures might be they wondered if they might be children but decided that they couldn't be as
they didn't know of any other children in the area and furthermore the Figures were not reacting to the presence of
this object which was still moving around back and forth it would have been
impossible not to see from that distance they said gets even more interesting
because at one point a car started to come down the road approaching this area
immediately the two figures ran back across the street towards the barn again
where they were joined by a third figure and at this point all three ran across
the lot alongside the barn and disappeared into the darkness so as this approaching car arrived and
passed by the glowing object immediately extinguished itself but when the car
moved out of sight up the road it lit up again again pulsating turning white and
red and continuing to maneuver around by this point almost an hour had passed and
Carol's mother who had been out shopping drove up to the house immediately this
object became dim again the girls did alert Carol's mother about this object
when she came inside she saw it but by this time it had moved off into the distance and was much dimmer so she
really wasn't super impressed by it did nothing to investigate it and this time
it was now 1 p.m. so both Carol and Ruth went to bed but later it was discovered
that there was in fact another witness the neighbor who lived right across the
street apparently a Miss pascan she said that when she stepped out to bring in the laundry she noticed
a glowing watermelon shaped object out in the field exactly where the girls
were seeing it in fact she watched it for a few moments but becoming frightened by its unusual appearance
hurried back inside and when later investigators asked her for more
information she became very tight lipped she refused to become involved she wanted nothing to do with it but later
two additional Witnesses who lived less than one mile away said that at 7:50
p.m. on that night they saw a glowing object which they said was kind of shaped like a clam and was glowing
bright red so that's that case but two nights later at 9:30 p.m. one of the girls and
her mother had another sighting of a bright star-like object moving at about 25° elevation across the
sky and suddenly it stopped hovered in place just south of the house remained
motionless for several minutes when a plane approached this object returned back to the direction that it had come
from and disappeared into the distance and there were other sightings
going on cuz in fact the day before this which is one day after Carolyn Ruth
sighting at 7:45 p.m. September 16 1978 Joan Richie and her three children
Scott age8 Billy 7 and Barry 6 were driving along plat Hill Road this is
located on a hill that overlooks the town of Winstead it's real close to this
other case and coming around a slight Bend in the road They Came Upon what
looked to them like kind of a cone-shaped object sitting on the road about 300 ft in front of their car it
was quite large it looked like it was almost as tall as the utility poles and as Janes says was almost a triangle in
shape like a cone it went up to a point with red lights about the sides and
through the middle now she had a hard time seeing any structure she mostly saw
lights she immediately became frightened because even though she had her high beams on all she could really see were
these lights which started about one foot above the road this object or lights quickly moved
away in a very smooth manner totally silent she quickly drove up to where
this thing had been but there was no longer any sign of it and then came another dramatic
sighting in Winstead only 4 days later was September 20 1968 10:30 p.m. Irene
pascow went to check on her son jack who was in his bedroom and this is when she
noticed a sort of peachy pink glow outside his window in the woods next to
their house so she quickly woke her son jack up and alerted him and he looked
out the window and said Mom that's not a fire cuz that's what she thought it was so they looked at this strange glow
that remained in the same place for quite some time but nothing else happened so Irene eventually returned to
the living room to watch TV still wondering if this might be a fire of some kind a short time later she
returned to her son's room and saw that this strange glow had disappeared story
is not over yet 3 Days Later a ranger arrived at the home he expressed an
interest in buying timber near their property so Irene's husband Charles
accompanied him into the woods to their property line and this is when the Ranger noticed a 35 foot wide teardrop
shaped area of crushed burned vegetation and it turned out this was precisely
where Irene and her son jack had seen this strange peachy pink glow now a
closer inspection of this revealed four distinct triangular imprints in the soil
one was in the exact center the other three were arranged around it in an
equilateral triangle with exactly 10 ft between them the ranger he said
immediately that this looked like a UFO landing spot and that he himself and his
brother had seen UFOs and other similar Landing sites on previous
occasions so Winstead something's going on there I'm telling you but hearing about this
alleged Landing site two School teachers visited the area and they noticed a few other things some of the tall trees
surrounding the site were burned scraped and broken and it looked to them as if
an aerial object had come in for a diagonal Landing so the Winstead cases
continued this next case was investigated by faucet David Webb and Ted bletcher and this occurred on
February 21 1968 the witness is a Miss Amato age 12
we don't know her first name but she was in her house in Winstead when she heard this weird bloop bloop bloop noise
outside the window of her home turned out her bedroom overlooked an abandoned
railroad station which was being used as a storage site for ammonium nitrate
fertilizer and hovering close to the ground beside this building she saw a
white egg shaped object about the size of a family station wagon and as she
watched this craft emitted a short beam of light at a downward angle much like a ramp
and then 15 or 20 little men she said each about 3 ft tall exited via this
glowing ramp walking in single file jumped from the end of the beam to the
ground she said each of them was dressed in a dull silver jumpsuit and wore a fishbowl type helmet and she observed
them as they proceeded to climb up the side of the building housing the fertilizer one after another using a
hand overhand motion it looked to her almost like had suction cups on their hands the way they were able to climb up
this wall reaching the roof they spread out in different directions and these little men appeared to be looking down
inside the building through a skylight at this point she became so frightened
by what she was seeing she went to bed and hid under the bed covers but George faucet and the others
were very impressed with their testimony even more so because later that night there was yet another report also in
Winstead was 1 hour later at 12:12 a.m. that Miss Cecilia Brewer and five of her
companions were driving home from work between Winstead and bark Hamstead and
this is when their car engine started to fail looking ahead of them they saw a silvercolor domed disc hovering
alongside the left hand side of the highway right over a Forest Clearing now
they viewed this object from a distance of about 50 ft they could see a cone of
white light coming from the bottom down towards the ground they said the Dome of
this object was lined with rectangular Windows Each of which emitted a green
light and they watched it for about 15 minutes at which point it flew
away so quite a few cases and here's a final and truly amazing Winstead
encounter which occurred 8 years after this flap of s this one occurred on July 28th 1976 at
Camp Delaware this is a private summer camp located very near Winstead along
Route 183 that afternoon the camp counselor a gentleman by the name of Ira leafer and
13 other boys aged 13 to 15 all decided to take a hike up to the peak of nearby
blueberry Mountain about, 1400 ft High mon among the boys were
Carrie ezol Greg Bond Billy Weissman and others who don't know the names of the
other children but they had just they had just reached the top of
this little mountain some were standing and enjoying the view others were sitting down to rest when without
warning they all heard a high-pitched whining sound which they said sounded a
little bit like feedback from a speaker and looking up all simultaneously they
saw a dome shaped Craft only 50 to 60 ft overhead they estimated it was about 20
ft in diameter they said it had a flat shiny reflective bottom the top was Dome
shaped with a smaller Dome on top which was eternally illuminated by a reddish
light it seemed to be rotating now per Ira the entire object itself was
rotating he could tell by the reflections on its surface all of them said it was surrounded by a slight mist
and they all said it glowed sort of a purple violet color as soon as it was overhead this
whining sound stopped and the object hovered in perfect silence for about 15
to 25 seconds and as it was hovering there the whole area around them became
unnaturally quiet IRAs said that the object was your basic classic saucer
quote like you see in the movies it was really weird he said that he and all the
kids were quote dumbfounded and that it was quote a very shocking
experience all the kids left descriptions of what they saw which
matched pretty much perfectly this whining sound started again the object darted vertically
upwards at high speed and was gone but this sighting caused a complete Panic
among this group all of the boys fled down the mountain as fast as they could run followed by
Ira leafer they all ran into Camp breathless excitingly discussing what
they had just seen as Ira said it left and we ran at first everyone there
agreed that they should keep their sighting secret but pretty soon they were persuaded to call the police now
the police did not investigate but did refer the case to to both qos and AO and
UFO researcher Paula Holmes of AO showed up was able to actually sneak into Camp
interviewed Ira leafer talked with the boys Alan Henry of cuos also did an
investigation and again all the witnesses provided written statements about what they saw all said pretty much
exactly the same thing with minor variations regarding the size of the craft how high up it was how long it
stayed for example some said it was 15 seconds others said it was 30 some said
the craft was 15 wide 15 ft wide others said it was 25 ft wide so minor
variations they pretty much all agreed on the sound and the appearance of The Craft all agreed it departed at
tremendous speed as one witness said I was still staring at the space so I
couldn't tell how it left another said it was quote faster than anything I had
ever seen so soon word leaked out about this multi- witness sighting and the story
exploded into National headlines several articles were written in various
newspapers now here's where get even more interesting because later the evening Citizen newspaper received a
handwritten letter saying quote we would like to confirm last week's sighting of
a UFO at as a hoax our group along with the leader wanted to see just how far a
story would go we fooled everyone it now seems to be getting out of hand so cool
it now this note was signed by initials TR JT MJ and TM but here's the problem
with this is that none of the witnesses had those initials and none of the boys apparently
said anything about this so the hoax story itself was deemed to be a hoax as
IR leafer said I know what I saw he reiterated this when he heard about this
letter coming to the newspaper now Alan Henry regarding Carrie ezal and Greg Bond he says quote
I put it to them that we knew it was a hoax and we only needed their verification of it both stuck to the
original story and insisted that the sighting had really taken place I couldn't budge them now this was a
private Camp owned by Joseph and Ruth Winestock and they also agreed that this
hoax accusation was not credible as they said quote they did see what they saw
they swore by it these boys swore that they saw it and they ran like hell I
questioned them myself so still rumors of a hoax continued to circulate no
Landing traces were found none of the witnesses were affected physically in any way but hoax or not there's a whole
lot of cases going on in Winstead something very unusual is going on there
you have that many cases that many witnesses even if one case should fall apart there are so many others it's very
clear that UFOs are attracted to this tiny little town I don't know why I
couldn't find anything particularly unusual about Winstead it's just another small town in the United States so I
don't know what the draw is there for the ETS perhaps it's the people who are contact these I don't know but what an
amazing series of Encounters in a very sharply defined area over a very short
period of time now let's move to the next case really compelling case this
one which I call the Blue Ridge humanoid this occurred on March 1st 1974 in the
unincorporated a area of West Virginia called Vesta it's quite an amazing case
because it does have multiple Witnesses it's quite a long lasting case it has
really well verified Landing Trace cases and a very close-up encounter with this
landed UFO and an unusually described humanoid figure this case which was
investigated by researcher George faucet he found it after it was written up in the local newspapers
and I said West Virginia it's actually Virginia Vesta Virginia this case begins
at 800m on March 1st 1974 when Billy Wayne plasters who was
then 27 years old had driven off his father's farm along Route 58 in this
small unincorporated community of Vesta this is in the Blue Ridge Mountains and
he was off to go visit the Vesta supply store and this is when he noticed that
quote the whole Hillside was lit up this was right near his father's farm and as
he said it was quote not the color of Fire Light but more like a bright yellow
Coleman lantern now he kept driving returned shortly later and immediately alerted
his brother-in-law Richard Clifton and his twin sister Jane who was married to
Richard all three of them watched this strange light from the windows of Richard's and Jane's home
and they were trying to figure out what it could possibly be when suddenly a reddish oval object described as quote
bigger than a Volkswagen rose up from the area of Illumination to an altitude
of about 300 ft sending down a beam of white light from its bottom side as it
rose up it then stopped and hovered it did a series of right angle turns and
headed towards the South much closer to all of this to this glowing area were Noel Castle his wife
Dorothy and their daughter Freda all of them also saw and heard this object as
Dorothy says it made a shrill penetrating sound we were afraid to go
outside to see what was causing all the commotion on John plaster farm and as Billy Wayne plaster says
quote it looked like a huge round plate fat in the the middle and tapered at
each end was red and oval we watched it until it got out of sight his brother-in-law Richard Clifton
said quote I saw something but I don't know what it was and I've never seen
anything like it before or since and Jane his wife said it was like a science
fiction story come true because of what happened next although this UFO had left
the strange illumination on the nearby mountain side was still there so Billy
Wayne plasters and his brother-in-law Richard Clifton decided to get a closer
look they hopped into their truck drove across the highway and right up to this
illuminated area they immediately noticed that all the farm animals there
which included two white horses a brown steer and three black calves all of who
normally came to greet them were now nowhere to be found they crept closer to
the source of Illumination which they could now clearly see Billy stood in front and Richard was right behind him
and this is when suddenly bills saw a strange figure ahead of them which he
described as quote a big tall heavy set Man Billy could see he was silhouetted
on a nearby Ridge in front of this glowing light so he shouts out who are
you what are you doing here what's your name there was no response other than
this figure now started to advance towards the two men at which point Billy
shouted out to Richard something is coming at us so they shouted out several
times asking you know who are you why are you here what's your name and so forth but this figure did not respond
just kept walking towards them Richard couldn't see the figure as well but seeing Billy's fear both men decided to
run away they ran towards their truck and got in now me meanwhile Jane is
watching from a small Hill near the home which afforded her a really good view of
everything and as Jane says I watched the truck stop and its lights go out was
awfully silent when suddenly I heard the truck door slam and the motor start up
when the men came back to the house they looked like they had just seen a ghost they were so white so despite their fear
the men decided to return to the site only this time they took their guns along with them going back now armed
they returned to the spot but when they arrived the glowing object in the huge figure were both gone but they did find
a large burned area where this object had apparently sat right on the ground they returned to the house and
immediately called the Patrick County Sheriff department and explained what they had just seen they did not get the
reception they had hoped for in fact the officers began to ridicule sh them over the phone saying what have you folks
been drinking up there are your eyes Playing Tricks on you in fact the officer on the phone shouted out to his
fellow officers what do you know some of the folks in the Vesta Community have a
flying saucer in their backyard so needless to say the police
officers did not take this report seriously did not investigate but not to be put off the witnesses decided to call
the local newspaper who put them in touch with researcher George faucet George his assistant
investigator Mike leonis and news reporters very quickly arrived to
investigate spoke directly with the witnesses they went to the site and they found that several hundreds of yards
across the Hillside and into the woods showed evidence of exposure to high heat
the ground The Ivy and Laurel bushes pine needles woods and twigs Tre liims
even fence posts were charred and blackened over a fairly wide area there
was an electric fence here and it looked like that had somehow uh also burned there was a
prominent burn smell pervading the area soil samples were taken they were tested
for radiation though none was found but George faucet was convinced that the Witnesses were telling the truth and
calls this quote an incredible sighting by credible multiple Witnesses
and as Billy wayanne pler says I don't know what I seen but I sure seen
something how about that can you imagine calling the police being that traumatized by your encounter and what
do they do laugh at you and ridicule you such a shame this subject should be
treated much more seriously than it is because so many people are having encounters and these Witnesses are
clearly very sincere it's a great case with Landing Trace cases
uh and also professionally researched by an experienced investigator so an
important case I think on many levels Now we move to the next one which I call
the shiny silver sewickly humanoid this case occurred on March 23rd 1974 in
Sewickley Pennsylvania and involves a gentleman who had a very close encounter
with quite an unusual humanoid but what's amazing about this case is yeah
it's a single witness case but it does have some Landing traces in the form of footprints and it's also supported by a
huge number of encounters occurring in that general area very close to the same
time so this is what we would call a wave or a flap of sightings which
involve quite a variety of types of encounters with simple sightings and cars being chased down the road
electromagnetic evidence physiological effects and of course a humanoid this
humanoid encounter was preceded by a flurry of UFO encounters all across Pennsylvania most of which were
researched by investigator Stan Gordon it was on the night of January 27
1974 when an anonymous female was driving near Irwin this is about 33
miles away from Sewickley where later there would be a humanoid encounter and this is when she saw two bright lights
in the sky like car headlights they disappeared but abruptly reappeared only
now they were at very low altitude much closer to her in fact she could see a dark shape covered with lights and this
object began to Pace her car and then very suddenly flew quite close to the vehicle actually causing her car engine
to lose power it finally flew off leaving her hysterical with fear was the
next day January 28 1974 10:30 p.m.
when two women in Sewickley saw a very large silver
cigar-shaped object which suddenly dropped to about 150 ft right above the
trees he said it had bright red and white lights in front a white light in the rear and that was pretty much it but
events were still in progress it was just over a week later on February 7
1974 a man was driving along Route 982 near near laurelville this is about 60
mi from Sewickley and this is when he saw a 30ft wide disc he said it was
flying about 150 ft high and was only 100 ft from his car he said it was solid
white on top but had red green and blue lights on the bottom he could make hear
it making a humming noise he said he also smelled a strong sort of chemical
odor and the encounters continued because it was the next month at 8:30
p.m. March 18 1974 at West Newton this is about 36 mil
from Sewickley and 13 mi from Irwin a man was driving along a remote Highway
when he saw a cluster of lights that appeared to be attached to an object when suddenly it swooped down right
towards him he said it came only feet from his car this point his car radio
immediately filled with with static his headlights dimmed his amp meter showed
that his battery had actually discharged and the object flew off but the witness
says at this point he became suddenly and abnormally incredibly drowsy to the
point that he could barely keep from falling asleep and he did in fact hit the guard rail alongside the road with
his car at same night a doctor and his family in the area also saw a
disc-shaped object glowing first red red then gray then blue green as it darted
back and forth across the sky several times and events came to a climax less
than one week later this was at 12:55 on March 23rd
1974 when two officers for the State Game Commission were patrolling the Handover area this is some distance
about 200 mil from Sewickley when they saw a glowing cigar-shaped object which
they said quote was like a giant fuselage was very close to them about
900 ft from their car they said it was probably about six times the length of
their own car silent and was emitting a pulsating light towards the
ground now that was their encounter but it was just 7 hours earlier in sewickly
that an anonymous 16-year-old teenager reported his encounter with a very unusual visual
humanoid was 600 p.m. he was riding his motorcycle in his favorite spot this is
a Thousand Acre area of woods and hilly terrain southeast of his home in
Sewickley he had climbed up a hill on his motorbike rode around there for some
time and then was gliding quietly down the hill this is an important detail
because he feels like his because his bike wasn't making a whole lot of noise he may have surprised what this being
that he saw because reaching the base of this hill he comes around a corner still coasting and this is when he saw a
figure standing in profile facing up the hill only about 750 ft away he revved up
his motorcycle and switched gears which apparently caught the attention of this figure as it immediately changed from a
side position turned and faced the witness then started to squat down on
the ground now this did allow the witness to to get actually a good view of this being and he said that this
figure was humanoid in form but was at least 7 ft tall perhaps taller and was
completely covered in a wrinkly shiny stainless steel colored bodysuit from
head to toe this includes his face the only part that wasn't wrinkly was the
head said it had a football-shaped head but yeah still covered with this silvery
covering only it was skin tight and smooth so after remaining in a half squat
position for a few seconds this figure turned towards the hill took three large
steps and vanished into the forest now this witness did not see any
UFO or any object just the humanoid but after interviewing the witness
researchers returned to the area and they believe they did find Footprints in fact as Stan Gordon says investigators
who searched the area found some possible Footprints of the creature in the same spot where it was seen climbing
up the hill Into the Woods three Impressions were found that were dug into the terrain and went straight up
most humans climbing such a hilly area would angle their feet to obtain a better balance big thanks to Stan Gordon
for investigating all these events he's one of the few researchers out there who I really trust and admire I think he's a
great researcher who's worked really hard to just present the facts put out the information verify it to the extent
that we can and what an amazing series of events that always makes me wonder
when a person sees a UFO is this someone else's Close Encounter of the Third Kind
where they're seeing a humanoid or even being taken on board I think so all
right let's move to another case this one is really unusual I call this the sweet smelling alien that occurred on
June 25 1974 in vorba Italy and this is
a single witness case though it does have some interesting details to it it's got
animal reactions to me the most interesting and compelling part of this case is the witness's description of an
unusual sweet smelling odor which he associated with this encounter a really
compelling case on multiple levels this case comes from researcher Roberto
penatti of C the Central eological National Group and this case appeared in
his book UFO contacts in Italy and was also published widely in other magazines
the witness is known only by his initials DP it was around 3:00 a.m. on
June 25 1974 when the witness woke up went down
to the kitchen to get a drink of water and this is when he heard footsteps coming from the courtyard outside his
home curious who it might be he turned on the outside light and peered outside a
slight drizzle of rain was falling and he didn't see anybody but he did notice a couple of unusual details as he says
first the house cat was planted in the middle of the courtyard clearly in a
defensive position with his eyes fixed towards the road that runs alongside the house he had unruly hair and a bushy
tail second a strong Swedish smell he smelled something sweet so he's very
curious about this he went back inside retrieved a flashlight going back
outside he began to walk along the road next to the house this road was lined
with a hedge of AA now the cat was still all riled up he wondered if perhaps it was upset at the
neighbor's dog but still he didn't see anything out of the ordinary and he was about to go back inside when as he says
quote I had the sensation of a physical presence so he turned and to his shock
he saw a glowing white figure he said it was covered in this sort of shiny skin
tight jumpsuit he said the shine may have been because the suit could have been wet from the rain but most alarming
was that this figure was as he says quote staring at me or so it seemed to
me through two small slits located where the eyes are normally found and a man so
this figure was quite unusual looking it shocked the witness he automatically
stepped back and he began to feel a real sense of fear and became even more alarmed when this figure did something
totally unexpected as he says the strange figure slowly Rose from the
ground almost perpendicularly as if he were on an escalator presenting himself
in profile until he passed the acaas about 10 10 m high and off he went and
disappeared there was no noise the witness did not notice any unusual lights or objects as this figure
disappeared into the night he went back into his house was quite confused and puzzled by the whole event tried to come
up with a logical explanation for what he had seen but there was none he says
he ended up getting no sleep that night he did notice that his cat disappeared
for three full days as did the neighbor dog he did look around for landing
traces or any evidence didn't find any but he says that he himself suffered from quote a severe migraine for about
one week following this incident he never did find any explanation for what he saw and wonders if whoever or
whatever it was might have been some sort of projection of some kind uh he's open to interpretation but definitely
agrees it was quite strange so there is you go one more case to add to our knowledge of what's going on here case
with animal reactions physiological effects some really unusual details can
only imagine what it must be like to walk up to a figure that you can't identify who's clearly not quite human
and then floats off into the sky and over a tree I don't know I don't can't blame the witness for really freaking
out about his encounter now I move to another one this one is really interesting because this
witness was very close to this really unusual humanoid I mean only feet away I
call this one the ET with the flashing eyes I can't say I've ever heard a case
quite like this it's got really remarkable similarities to a lot of other cases and also some unique details
as well this occurred in July of 1975 in St dier France
and I think you'll agree this is a case that deserves to be widely known it was around 9:00 p.m. one evening towards the
end of July 1975 when Madame Carmen B we don't know
her last name decided to take advantage of the warm temperature and hang out her laundry in the backyard this is in the
lenu district of St dier France as she did so a sudden brilliant white circular
light illuminated almost her entire backyard so Carmen stood in the center
of the illumination and was a struck by its incredible Brilliance she also
noticed that all the noises around her had suddenly stopped and this light she
said looked like a very compact circular wall totally opaque blocking the view of
her house behind it so this is not normal light strangely despite its Brilliance it did not cast any shadow
so Carmen at this point realized she was paralyzed unable to move at the same
moment although there was no noise she had the distinct feeling that somebody or something was standing very close
behind her and although she felt unable to move she was somehow able to look to her side and she was amazed to see a 3ft
tall humanoid figure standing only 50 cm this is less than 2 feet away from her
said it was well proportioned its arms were a little longer than normal the head definitely larger than normal and
kind of egg-shaped it wore a light cocky colored onepiece uniform this covered
the entire body it came over the head like a hood she said but she was most
impressed by this being's strange eyes These Eyes had no irises no eyelashes no
eyebrows they were very bright yellow and in fact fact they seemed to be emitting flashes of light Sparks of
light she said they were so large they covered almost the entire face and this
being was staring at her with this incredibly hypnotic gaze never once
blinking this point she's on the verge of total panic she kind of felt like this being was exerting some kind of
power over her with its hypnotic eyes and standing there under its intense
gaze she felt like she was about to have a nervous breakdown but did finally manage to break free of
this trance of this paralysis and ran back into the house taking refuge in the
kitchen but to do this she had to walk right through this opaque wall of Light which she did and she said it had no
effect whatsoever on her body that she could tell but now in the house
trembling and thoroughly frightened she immediately sought out her husband quickly told him what happened he
immediately went out into the backyard but but of course the light and the humanoid were gone the next day they
looked around Carmen discovered that the electric lamp she had left on a bench near this place where this little being
had stood was now missing she did ask her neighbors a few days later none of
them had seen anything unusual however in the days that followed her neighbor's
house mysteriously did catch fire an investigation by firefighters failed to
reveal a Cause hard to say if there's any connection to kon's experience perhaps not but it was an unusual event
right after a very unusual event one more amazing case of a humanoid adding
up with all the other incredible cases which make it so clear that we are not
alone on this planet we are being visited and you can interpret these events however you want I personally do
think the vast majority of these are extraterrestrials in the classic sense but certainly not all all of them I
think there's a lot of stuff going on here and some of this stuff gets put under the UFO umbrella the ET
explanation that perhaps has other explanations but you can make up your
own mind about it I'm just presenting the facts as we know them and here's another case which I call the ETS in the
forest this is a multiple witness case also does have Landing
traces and what I like about this case is the ETS are quite unusual usual uh
the witnesses saw them very close up this occurred on February 19 1984 in the
toola Forest this is in the Leno area of Poland it's a professionally
investigated case and also thank goodness the researchers had the
witnesses all produce drawings of what they saw which I think really adds to
being able to visualize what exactly happened we don't know a whole lot about
this case but it was investigated by several researchers primarily by
arcadius AR maaza it was around 2 p.m again on February 19
1984 as a group of young children age five all the way up to 10 were playing
in a meadow in the toola Forest this is in OA linck in Poland so the children were
slipping and sliding around on the ice this is in February when a strange
looking figure appeared they said it was black had a roundish head frightened
they ran away and this is when they saw a dark oval egg-shaped object appear
overhead it quickly lowered to the ground extended a sort of ladderlike device and coming down was a metallic
looking figure very short less than 4T tall and it immediately began to walk
towards them just a short distance the kids were running away and this being
returned to the craft went inside and the craft moved along the edge of the forest then
disappeared but following the event researchers Andres remlin and K pichota
did record an interview with the witnesses had them produce drawings of what they saw took
photographs unfortunately the recorded interviews were lost only the drawings
and the picture remain but one of the witnesses a Miz doota was contacted by
researcher AR many years later and she said quote it wasn't a lie that day my
brother and I went to the forest with a friend when we suddenly saw this strange figure as children we got scared and ran
home but at home they thought it was a child's invention it was so terrifying
for us that we didn't go back there for a long time I don't remember many
details from that day because as I wrote I was only 10 years old and no one believed us so we also tried to
forget but the researcher AR maaza is convinced it's the real case in fact as
he says since I was there about 1 hour after the event I went with the children
to see if there were any traces there was snow there were precise traces of
the children running away apart from that that nothing I am not gullible but
I believe these children another amazing case and yes although it is a multiple
in this case these are very young children and some might argue that children aren't particularly reliable
and I think it's true that they might be given to a active
imagination and perhaps aren't the best Witnesses in some ways but I think
actually on the other hand they make really good Witnesses because don't overlay their own interpretation of
these events most of them have never heard of UFOs they're like sponges able to absorb
knowledge in a really remarkable way and as we've seen the investigators contacted couple of these Witnesses
years later and they still remembered them this is something that impresses a person in most cases for the rest of
their lives it's a super amazing case and now we move to another one this is
probably my favorite of the bunch it's such a poignant and emotional case involving a gentleman who had a very
close encounter while driving on a lonely Highway at night so many cases like this I call this one the
interrupted Journey it occurred on August 25 1999 in tran loen
Argentina and of all the cases this is probably the most famous certainly pretty well known in Argent artina but
to me what's most compelling about this case are not the electromagnetic effects
which are quite prominent but really the psychic after effects with the witness
which were really pronounced and so unusual and while it is a single witness
case these after effects from the witness were observed by many people
around him and it was clear that this encounter affected this man for the rest
of his life it's such an important case it was 4:30 p.m. as car mechanic and
owner of a very successful machine shop Carlos Cologne who you can see here he's
an upstanding and highly respected member of his community he was driving
his 1998 Chevy pickup along National route number five again this is August
25 1999 his car is pretty much brand new he had reached kilometer marker
465 when his truck radio began to make a strange buzzing noise now he was
charging his cell phone at the time and thought perhaps it might be malfunctioning but when the buzzing
sound became intense to the point of becoming almost deafening he realized
something else was going on in fact he said it sounded like quote a thousand mosquitoes buzzing in your ear he
wondered if perhaps his truck alternator had broken which again really angered
him as this truck was only one year old he began swearing he tried changing the radio stations but that didn't work
either and this is when he noticed movement up ahead slightly to the right
and looking in that direction he saw an unidentified quote something and it was
zooming towards him at very high speed next thing Carlos knew his truck stopped
he got out of his truck and this is when he saw the Silhouettes of five white
figures standing in front of him on the road he could see that they were 2.5 m
in height this is over 7 ft tall and they seem to be standing in inside some
kind of circular screen said it looked almost like a globe of frosted glass
they were standing side by side legs spread Arms by their side and actually
seemed to be floating slightly above the ground and sliding around inside this
Dome this globe it did move their head slightly appearing to look at each other
but then looked directly at Carlos it was real shocking to him because he could not see any faces there was just a
dark oval where the face should be he said they were all dressed in white they appeared to have helmets with a dark
visor obscuring the face kind of reminded him of diving suits but then
they did something even stranger they appeared to grab each other's hands forming a kind of circle with their
heads facing in inside this Dome the screen almost touching each other the
screen like thing appeared to shrink into a cone or a bell-like shape became
dark gray a Dark Mist obscured the object and suddenly everything
disappeared as Carlo said it was quote just like turning off a television set
he looked around him but the strange humanoids were gone however he did notice several
concerning details his truck was now facing the opposite direction he had
been standing outside of his truck but now he found himself standing in the middle of the field alongside the road
and he could hear the ra radio in the truck playing loudly so needless to say
this quite frightened him he ran back to his truck jumped inside almost in a
trance drove it high speed down the highway towards Tran loen the whole
event he estimated lasted about two to 7 minutes he's really not sure but as he
passed the village of lasagna he seemed to quote snap out of his trance and he
was surprised to see how fast he was driving he says he then felt a wave of incredible tiredness fatigue he thought
he might be having a blood pressure attack he suffered from low blood pressure but later visiting his doctor
his doctor said no you just have nervous tension uh he did have some dizziness and blur Vision however he found that
his problems with blood pressure had disappeared and never returned so this
appears to be a healing of some kind he did return to the site a few days later
was quite surprised to find some of his paperwork lying on the ground at the site he found his own Footprints but no
evidence at all of the humanoids or this thing craft that they were in but he did
learn that another trucker and His companion had seen several luminous objects crossing over the highway near
the village of lazanja on the night of his encounter but it was what happened
afterwards that really changed everything this encounter changed his life in the days weeks and years
following his encounter everything changed profoundly for him in many ways
he says electrical equipment began to malfunction in his presence which is hard for a mechanic including watches
and TV and more he found that he had a near tic photographic memory he began
experiencing precognition all kinds of weird psychic abilities probably the
strangest was one day his wife woke up to see Carlos wandering around the house
apparently sleepwalking but his body was glowing with white light Carlos never felt
normal again he says all of this was quite stressful and this psychic abilities these paranormal events
continued to plague him till the day he died amazing and we see that pattern in
case after case of someone who has a very close encounter and suddenly their psychic abilities are awakened to a
remarkable degree and that's clearly what's going on in this case I suspect it probably is a full-blown onboard
experience hard to say for sure cuz he can't say that he did have missing time
but given the fact that he sort of blacked out and woke up outside of his
car out in the field when he was standing next to his car by the road at one point and doesn't know how he got
out in the field that's a pretty big red flag that there's more to this counter
than he remembers what an amazing case so there you go 10 cases from all over the world
involving a wide variety of human noids many of them multiple witness cases many
of them just one event surrounded by a sort of conglomerate of
events and all of them contributing to our knowledge of what's going on here so many different types of humanoids so
many different people having these encounters occurring for such a long time I just don't see how anyone can
remain skeptical of this subject it's my belief that people who are skeptical
simply have haven't done their homework and looked at the huge number of cases going on here any explanation such as
hoaxes hallucinations misperceptions and mental illness just don't hold water
this is why I do this research we need to stop this ridiculous government cover up and accept the fact that we are not
alone in this universe so thanks very much for watching I truly appreciate it
hope you found it interesting and informative and until next week thank
you very much keep asking those important questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep
having fun I'll see you guys next Friday bye for now
