Jul 30, 2021

Summary:
Jul 30, 2021
UFOs have visited virtually every location on this planet, but one of the most active areas in the 
world is the state of New Mexico. Some of the world's most famous and influential encounters have 
taken place here. These are cases that have helped shape our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.

Part One of this video presents the best cases from number twenty down to number eleven. Now, in 
Part Two, we explore the top ten cases, moving from number ten all the way to number one! 
Sightings, landings, photographic cases, face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials, onboard 
UFO encounters, UFO crashes -- they're all here. These top ten cases cover the entire gamut of 
the UFO phenomenon, and provide conclusive evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials. 
These "best of the best" cases will change the way you feel about UFOs.

If you would like to learn more about these cases and the rich and fascinating history of UFO 
activity in this state, check out my book, "UFOs over New Mexico: a True History of UFO Encounters

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal 
this is actually part two of a two-part episode I call the top 20 ufo encounters in new mexico last 
week's episode covered cases number 20 all the way to case number 11 and now we're going to do the 
top 10 countdown of the very best cases from new mexico so let's just get started because this is 
a big episode and for case number 10 I chose the ufo abduction of sergeant charles moody this is 
considered a classic case I like it because it's one of the first cases of an onboard ufo 
experience that really preceded the sort of flood of abduction reports in the 1980s this 
occurred on august 13 1975 to sergeant charles moody a great witness he was a united states air 
force flight mechanic who worked at holloman air force base so a trained observer 
and he had decided on august 13 1975 to go outside and watch the perseid meteor showers 
which were very active that evening he left his home in alamogordo and drove outside of town to 
watch the meteor shower and after seeing several shooting stars he was shocked to see one of these 
apparent shooting stars swoop down drop out of the sky in front of him and come to a complete stop 
and at this point it landed as sergeant charles moody said in a later interview 
and I quote I observed a dull metallic object that seemed to just drop out of the sky 
and start to hover with a wobbling motion approximately 100 feet in front of me 
uh sergeant moody uh went to his car tried to start the car but the engine mysteriously died 
the object approached closely and sergeant charles moody could hear this high-pitched whining sound 
coming from the craft looking left he saw oddly shaped windows behind which he could 
see two or three human-looking forms and as sergeant charles moody says and I quote 
at this time the high-pitched sound stopped and a feeling of numbness came over my body 
the fear that I had before left me and I felt a very peaceful calmness the object lifted very fast 
it made no sound and after the object departed sergeant moody's car started easily 
and he drove home but looking at his watch he was shocked to see that it was now 2 45 
a.m it was one hour and 25 minutes later than it should have been so he had over an hour of missing 
time not only that he was suffering from lower back pain and a strange rash appeared on his lower 
body so he was concerned and he contacted apro the aerial phenomenon research organization and 
two of the main investigators which included jim lorenzen and colonel wendell c stevens 
agreed to investigate and they interviewed him about the incident sergeant charles maui 
was very concerned he wanted to be anonymous he did not want the air force to hear about this 
but apparently they did because they did something which actually jim lorenzen 
predicted that would happen if they did find out they transferred sergeant charles moody overseas 
but before he left uh sergeant moody wrote a long letter to jim lorenzen explaining that his 
memory of the incident had returned naturally over the past few weeks and he now consciously 
recalled almost everything that had occurred and that he had actually been taken on board this 
craft according to sergeant moody after this craft hovered in front of him it actually landed on the 
road two men dressed in tight-fitting suits approached his car sergeant moody attempted 
to shoot at them with his revolver but he suddenly felt powerless as these two figures 
pulled him out of the car and dragged him into the craft as sergeant charles moody says and I quote 
the beings were about five feet tall and very much like us except their heads were larger and 
had no hair the ears were very small the eyes a little larger than our than ours small nose 
and the mouth had very thin lips I would say that their weight was maybe between 110 to 130 pounds 
there was speech but their lips did not move so they actually communicated to him telepathically 
according to moody these beings were dressed in featureless black skin tight suits except 
for one of the figures whose suit was silver white sergeant moody was taken into a room where one of 
the figures who sergeant moody perceived to be the leader placed a rod looking device around his body 
and as moody says this being told him that quote there had been a scuffle when they first made 
contact with me and he only wanted to correct any misplacement that might have happened so basically 
what they were doing was healing him of the back injury that had occurred during his abductions 
these beings were highly telepathic and answered all of sergeant moody's questions as he formulated 
them in his mind as sergeant moody says I was thinking to myself if only I could see 
the drive unit of the craft how wonderful that would be the elder or leader put his hand on 
my shoulder and said to follow him he went to a small room that had no fixtures and was dimly lit 
the floor seemed to give way like an elevator I guess we went down six feet and what I saw 
then was a room about 25 feet across and in the center was what looked like a huge carbon rod 
going through the roof of the room and around the rod were three of what looked like holes covered 
with glass inside the glass covered holes or balls were what looked like large crystals with two rods 
one on each side of the crystal one rod came to a ball like top the other came to a t type top 
i was told that this was their drive unit and I could understand it if I tried the beings told 
sergeant moody that this craft was just a small observation craft and that a much larger craft 
was hovering about 400 miles above the earth moody asked if he could see the main craft and they 
told him no that time was too short they told him that limited contact with humans would be made in 
the future but only over a gradual period of time they also told them that they were very concerned 
about the radiation tests being conducted and they told him that radar interferes with their 
ability to navigate they also told him that there was currently several different alien 
races working together around earth and they also told him that he would not remember what happened 
on that evening but that his memory would return over a period of time and the contact ended when 
they told him that they could find him whenever they wanted and that they would quote see me again 
another interesting facet to this case is moody said that this craft was not that 
large but when he went inside it appeared to be much larger on the inside than the outside and 
it couldn't believe there was two levels to it because it just did not appear that large 
this is a feature that does turn up in many cases this did turn out to be as far as we know sergeant 
moody's final contact kind of disappeared from the public eye to this day no one has been able to 
track him down and talk to him about this case but nevertheless his case was published 
and did cause quite a bit of attention among investigators not only jim coral or renzin 
uh but certainly timothy good and richard hall have all looked into this case and believe it to 
be genuine it's an absolutely astonishing early case that preceded the large flood of reports 
that would come forth in the next few decades and that's why I wanted to include it here and 
gave it spot number 10 on this list and now we move to case number nine for case number nine I 
chose the ufo wave of november 1957. I actually did another video on this wave of sightings 
which really encompassed a larger area than just new mexico in fact it was largely centered in 
texas but really went all across the united states and the world but it's such an important case 
such a dramatic case that I felt it deserved a spot on this list so I 
thought I would just cover it again and this again occurred in november of 1957 
but the first indication of this wave occurred when miss ella louie's fortune 
was driving by holloman air force base on october 16 1957 mind you this is just 12 days after the 
launch of sputnik earth's first artificially launched satellite and at 1pm that afternoon 
ella fortune was driving along white sands when she saw a large cigar-shaped white glowing 
object scooting across the sky and she quickly snapped a very clear photograph of this object 
and this was how it all began but it was just a week later when a huge wave of sightings occurred 
and what's amazing about these sightings is many of them involved electromagnetic interference 
and stopped cars across new mexico texas and many other areas this was a clear display a clear show 
of technological ability and I think a way of letting earthlings know what the ETs can do at 
any rate on november 3rd at about 3 am corporal glenn h toy and pfc officer james wilbanks were 
on army jeep patrol at white sands when they saw quote a very bright light high in the sky 
was egg shaped 100 yards in diameter and descended about a hundred feet above the old atomic bunker 
used in the first atomic explosions and after a few moments that light blinked out a few minutes 
later it flared up again becoming quote nearly as bright as the sun it then descended towards the 
ground at an angle and disappeared and as glenn toe says it looked like a completely controlled 
landing a search party was sent out but they found no landing traces
from outer space uh in open session
uh
reports have been turned into the provo marshal's office
um
saw the object first about 3 am sunday noting in this series called sky
then it came to the ground fairly fast about a 45 degree angle and the light went out quickly 
uh this was about two or three miles away from me it looked like a completely controlled landing 
uh wind banks have been on a three-day
it was just 11 hours later at almost 2 00 p.m still on november 3rd when a test pilot was 
flying from texas to roswell new mexico and landed at holloman air force base and told 
base operations that he had just encountered a large oblong glowing object which had passed 
over his aircraft it moved so quickly it left only what appeared to be a streak of light four hours 
later six pm military police at white sands made a second sighting of a brilliant vermillion covered 
object about 300 feet in diameter right over the atomic range and at the same time a resident in 
deming new mexico claimed to see a strange glowing object overhead two hours later 8 p.m november 3rd 
another officer forrest r oaks and officer barlow were on a two-man army jeep patrol at 
white sands when they saw a glowing object hovering above the test base directly over the old atomic bunker according to forest oaks this object was quote 200 or 300 
feet long and very bright it was two miles away when this object ascended at a 45 degree angle 
lights pulsated on and off it moved slowly sometimes stopping but continually ascended 
upwards until it had the appearance of a bright star finally became a pinpoint of light 
but the soldiers believed that they had witnessed a controlled landing and ascent and here i'll just play a short portion of audio tape in which they describe this
class sighting farlow spotted what appeared to be the same object some 17 hours later about 8 p.m 
sunday when they're on patrol together they say they first noticed it out to covering motionless
then all of a sudden we didn't see it anymore
tip of the range 90 miles north of uh like that headquarters uh is the other 
focus used in the first atomic bomb explosion 1945. uh the terrain is uh
on sunday morning on an unidentified flying object 
it was around the same time of this same sighting when another guy was driving through roswell he saw ufo his car lights dimmed and then went out but it was the next day 
november 4th 1957 at 1 10 p.m that a very famous incident occurred and this is when the military 
started to get really concerned because all of these car stalling incidents this appeared to be 
something that hadn't happened before certainly not to this magnitude and on that afternoon 1 
10 pm november 4th 1957 james stokes who is was a good witness he worked at holloman air force base 
he was a high altitude missile engineer and a navy veteran and he was driving along the proving grounds when his car radio failed seconds later his engine stalled he rolled to a stop 
and 10 other cars next to him all failed some of the drivers got outside of their car 
and were pointing at looking and looking at this object to the northeast this point james stokes 
looked up and saw a glowing pearlescent egg-shaped object of huge proportions he estimates 300 to 500 
feet and it had no visible portholes or external features but it started performing incredible 
maneuvers it passed overhead twice sending down a strong wave of heat performed several dives 
and sharp turns before darting off that he estimates 2500 miles per hour 
and as he says and i'll just quote him directly I saw a brilliant egg-shaped object making a shallow 
dive across the sky then it turned and made a pass at the highway and crossed it not more than two 
miles ahead then it moved away towards white sands proving grounds and as it passed I could feel a 
kind of heat wave like radiation from a giant sun lamp there was no sound and no visible portholes 
when I got back to my car and checked the engine I found it intact but the battery was steaming 
another witness alan baker who also worked at white sands proving grounds and mr duncan a resident of las cruces said that when the object appeared he was able 
to take photographs of it with his camera and as it maneuvered the low-level clouds would dissipate 
and after the object departed all the vehicles started up normally and they left the scene it 
was then that sergeant james stokes discovered that his face had been sunburned by the object 
this was what provided the inspiration for the scene in close encounters of the third kind when 
richard dreyfus was burned by a ufo um got a sunburn and sergeant james stokes 
reported his sighting to his military superior at holloman air force base who told him that it 
was all right to go public if he wanted he was given a physical examination by base doctors 
and later did provide an interview to coral and jim lorenzen but he's now seemed reticent to 
discuss the sighting and suggested that he perhaps saw quote some kind of atmospheric phenomena 
coral and jim lorenzen believed by this point he had been pressured by his superiors to cover up what happened as coral lorenzen says it was generally agreed that later stokes had changed his 
story somewhat after his interview with military authorities they met with him again two months 
after the incident by this point his case had been widely printed in newspapers and in some cases had 
been viciously attacked as a hoax and james stokes was really upset by the accusations of the hoax 
and said that if he ever again saw anything out of the ordinary he wouldn't tell anyone he did 
give a taped interview on k-a-l-g radio and said that what he saw was definitely a solid object 
but refused to elaborate and said only I just hope we're ready for what it is 
interestingly air force public information officer lieutenant colonel john mccurdy did 
reveal that he questioned stokes extensively and was convinced that james stokes had in fact had 
a genuine sighting and coral lorenzen learned of additional witnesses to the event 
one who was an officer at holloman air force base who declined to come forward another was a nurse 
at the local hospital hospital who said that she knew of a couple who were on the highway near oro 
grand during the time of the sighting but they also refused to come forward for fear of ridicule 
but they did say that this was definitely a real flying object and not a quote natural phenomenon 
as some of the newspapers were reporting so I would like to play a small portion 
of a audio tape which describes this the sighting by james stokes reports keep coming in of a 
mysterious brilliant object being cited in areas of new mexico and texas the latest report is from 
james stokes an engineer from the air force missile development center at holloman air 
force base in alamogordo new mexico he has told of seeing a brilliant colored egg-shaped object 
yesterday and he's quoted as saying some force emanating from it stalled 10 
cars on an isolated desert road between white sands proving grounds and alamogordo 
stokes also told terry clark a news director of a radio station in alamogordo 
that as the object passed in a shallow dive across the sky he could feel a kind of a heat wave like 
radiation from a giant sunland but he said he heard no sound earlier reports in recent days 
told of a big ball of fire spotted over much of west texas the air force is investigating
and now the news from the united states the air force apparently is convinced that an electronics 
engineer actually saw an unidentified flying object over the new mexico desert 
the engineer who works at the air force's white sands missile proving grounds said the egg-shaped object with rings around it was spotted at the same time as his car 
and 10 others were mysteriously stalled monday a spokesman said the air force is trying to locate other motorists whose cars are set by stokes to have stalled 
so it was just six hours later when uh on november 4th there was another sighting miss van fleet 
observed a gold colored object larger than the full moon hovering over the sky a few hours later 
10 45 p.m kirtland air force base tracked what appears to be the same object on radar 
controllers on duty at the airport tower at kirtland in albuquerque observed this object 
and according to a blue book report on the case one of the controllers saw quote a white light 
traveling east between 150 to 200 miles per hour at an altitude of approximately 1500 feet 
the controller called the radar station which confirmed that the object was on radar and that the this object moved across the east end of runway 26 in a southwesterly 
direction and began a steep descent and one of the controllers was actually able to observe 
this object through binoculars and said that it was shaped like in quote automobile on end 
this case of course did reach the attention of project blue book officers and as the report on 
this case reads this was estimated to be 15 to 18 feet high one white light was observed to the 
lower side of the object the object slowed to an estimated speed of 50 miles per hour and disappeared behind the fence at drumhead a restricted area which is brilliantly flood 
lighted this is approximately one half mile from the control tower and at this point the object 
reappeared moving eastward at an altitude of 200 to 300 feet and one of the helicopter one of the 
controllers now wonder that this might be a helicopter in distress and according to the 
blue book report on this particular sighting and I quote although completely cooperative and willing 
to answer any questions both sources appeared to be slightly embarrassed that they could not identify or offer an explanation of the object which they are unshakably convinced they saw 
and meanwhile unknown to either of the controllers the radar operator was also watching this object as it slowed down reversed course and orbited over kirtland air force base 
this object then took off towards the northwest and disappeared from the radar scopes the whole 
sighting lasted about five minutes however this radar technician told blue book investigators 
that 20 minutes after the sighting the object reappeared over the outer marker approximately 
four miles south of the north-south runway and then flew at a high rate of speed 
about a mile south of the east-west runway where it made an abrupt turn 
and fell into formation with a c46 aircraft that followed the plane for a half mile for the next 
14 miles and at this point the radar scope shows the object turned to the north hovered for one 
and a half minutes and faded from the scope so he tracked this object for about 20 minutes and 
jalen heineck looked into this case and he was shocked by blue books conclusions which were 
typically confusing and contradictory the officers of blue book concluded that the object 
quote may possibly have been an unidentified aircraft possibly confused by the runways at 
kirtland air force base the reasons for this opinion are one the observers are considered 
competent and reliable sources in the opinion of this interviewer they actually saw an object 
that could not identify and two the object was tracked on a radar scope by a competent operator 
and three the object does not meet identification criteria for any other phenomenon 
so high neck was exasperated by this sighting and as hinex says and I quote that is the observers 
were reliable the radar operator was competent and the object couldn't be identified therefore it was 
an airplane in the face of such reasoning one might well ask whether it would ever be possible 
to discover the existence of new empirical phenomena in any area of human experience what 
indeed can one say of a radar visual case like this the basic agreement of the radar and visual 
reports and the competence of the three observers in my opinion rule out questions of mirages false 
returns on radar ETc something quite definitely was there if it was an ordinary aircraft one might 
ask how it was that the two visual observers with a total of 23 years of control tower experience 
could jointly not have been able to recognize it when visibility conditions were good even if there were no radar confirmation of the slow and fast motions of the object 
or indeed just the presence of an unknown object this question would still have to be answered 
so again an amazing case but we have to move on because there are many other cases to cover 
on this amazing wave 4 24 am november 5 1957 don clark an electronics and radar technician 
employed at holloman as a civilian contractor was at his home in alamogordo when he saw an 
orange red cigar-shaped object hover at 15 degrees in the western sky 
he wanted to take a photograph but it disappeared real quickly five minutes later lyman brown jr 
was in his home in alamogordo and he saw apparently the same object as it darted 
off over the sacramento mountains 15 minutes later 7 45 pm a bus driver by the name of delbert boyd 
observed a mysterious light southwest of albuquerque november 5th 8 30 p.m 
a gentleman in hobbs new mexico said his car engine and headlights failed when a ufo swooped 
down over his car another vehicle reported the same thing next day november 6 there 
was a car stalling incident which occurred to two witnesses this was at 1 15 a.m santa fe residents 
jay martinez and a gallegos were driving their car when they saw an egg-shaped object with quote red 
green and yellow lights it approached them at a low altitude moved slowly directly over their car 
illuminated the entire area and at the same time emitted a loud humming noise and as soon as it was 
overhead their car engine suddenly died and their clock and wrist watches also ceased 
to function and on that same evening apparently at the same time two residents from santa fe told 
police that they saw quote a huge ball of fire traveling overhead in santa fe and seven hours 
later now it's november 7 november 7th this is at 9 20 a.m 20 miles from the encounter where james 
stokes saw his ufo mr and miss trent lindsay and their son byron were driving on highway 54 
when byron noticed that the speedometer on their 1954 mercury was behaving strangely it was weaving 
erratically back and forth traveling from 60 miles to 110 miles per hour and they were discussing the 
problem they looked up and saw a ufo they could not identify what it was but it looked like an 
object that had highly polished metal with sharply defined edges no visible means of proportion 
and as they watched it arched in a trajectory of high altitude towards the oregon mountains 
two days later november 9th on at 7 20 p.m a tularosa resident a college student and several 
others observed a large brilliant fast-moving light approach their car on highway 54 causing 
the vehicle's lighting system to fail and as it flew over the car it accelerated at a high rate 
of speed off into the distance and at the same time as this sighting investigators jim and coral 
lorenzen were traveling east on highway 380. this is about 10 miles from carriozo when they spotted 
a ufo which they described as a bright light silhouetted against the mountains to the east 
and it moved erratically until it moved off into the distance so the air force was apparently 
dismayed that many of their employees were talking freely with the media about their sightings 
and they put forth a bulletin that was addressed to all military and civilian officers on the base 
and according to this bulletin and I quote it was titled unidentified flying objects on november 7 
six airmen claimed that they cited an unidentified flying object and did not report this to proper 
base authorities they did however give this information to the local press requests that 
each member of the military and civilian employed at the center refrain from any public statement 
on political diplomatic legislative or scientific matters or any controversial subjects such as ufos 
without first contacting the center information services officer this request is in accordance 
with afr afr190-6 disciplinary action may be taken against the offender signed lieutenant colonel 
mccurdy coral lorenzen was upset about this regulation because it quote restricts individuals 
at air force installations in relating the details of ufo sightings and that this 
regulation is a violation of the constitutional rights of civilians and should be challenged 
so that in a nutshell if you will is the incredible wave of november 19 uh 57. 
it's quite a case put a series of events cause concern at high levels of government 
and that's why I wanted to include it here and now we move to case number eight 
and for case number eight I chose astronomer clyde tombaugh sees a ufo clyde tombaugh is of course 
world famous in 1930 he stunned the world with his discovery of the planet pluto which has now been 
relegated to a planetoid but uh in 2007 but the discovery of pluto electrified the world 
and it earned clyde tombaugh a permanent place as a hero in the field of astronomy 
and it was 19 years later on august 20th 1949 that clyde tombaugh went public with his own sighting 
of a ufo unfortunately it failed to generate the kind of publicity the discovery of pluto did 
but it's definitely an amazing sighting it was 10 45 p.m clyde tombaugh his wife and mother-in-law were in the backyard of their home in las cruces 
it was a very clear night and uh all the stars were easily visible when suddenly the three 
observers saw something they couldn't identify flying overhead in a strange geometric formation 
were six to eight blue green rectangular shaped lights they were at low altitude 
and moved quickly and silently from the northwest to the southeast it became clear to 
clyde tombaugh that the lights were attached to a single object which appeared to have a half dozen windows or portholes along the front and side each of which emitted a bright light 
clyde tombaugh concluded instantly that these were neither meteors nor conventional aircraft 
but was clearly a unknown solid object he wrote an official report to the air force which stated 
in part and I quote the remarkably sudden ascent convinced me it was an absolutely novel airborne 
device I have done thousands of hours of night sky watching but never saw a sight so strange as this
well uh of the three different types of objects that I have seen I would say the most extraordinary one was one I saw in 1949 in august 
in las cruces from my backyard on that particular evening my wife and her mother and I were 
enjoying the cool air and I was mine the beautiful transparent sky with the stars and I happened 
to be looking overhead and suddenly I spied a strange group of lights moving and I said uh look 
and they thought immediately and then I would say they were visible for about three seconds of time 
and they disappeared at a height of about 35 degrees above the south southeastern horizon 
no sound and they seem to kind of pale out the rectangles of feeble light seem to 
foreshorten into slits slit and i've never seen a rocket before since and i'm very much puzzled as to what this thing was 
he also wrote a report to nycap the national investigative committee for aerial phenomena which 
said and I quote as I have said before I was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was 
really petrified with astonishment consequently some of the details I might have noted 
were missed uh clyde was always very vocal about this sighting and on november or february 13 
1954 he gave a talk to the astronomical society at las cruces surprising the audience by predicting 
that he believed there would be an increase in ufo sightings three years later he wrote 
a letter to researcher leonard stringfield in which he revealed that this was not his only sighting and that he had in fact seen quote three objects within the past seven years which defied 
any explanation of known phenomenon such as venus atmospheric optics meteors or planes he wrote that 
he had also seen on other occasions unexplained green fireballs over new mexico 
and he closed his letter saying and I quote I think that several reputable scientists are 
being unscientific in refusing to entertain the possibility of extraterrestrial origin and nature 
so yes astronomers do see ufos as we have seen robert scholdek and clyde tombaugh 
both made this list here it's quite an amazing sighting and deserves to be much more well known 
and now we move to case number seven and for case number seven I chose a cluster of cases 
a phenomena we now known at we now know as cattle mutilations new mexico has been particularly hard 
hit by cattle mutilations and there's no way I can cover the entirety of the events in a video of 
this size so i'm just going to briefly go through as briefly as I can some of these amazing cases
this phenomena really got a lot of publicity in the mid 1970s when linda moulton's howl when linda 
moulton house award-winning documentary film a strange harvest which was actually from 1980 was 
really the first in-depth look at this mystery years later we're still no closer to solving it 
it first appeared primarily in new mexico and colorado which is not surprising considering that 
these states are the leaders in cattle farming and many many researchers have looked into this 
however and it does involve many different species of animals though it does appear that cattle 
are the primary target and in a typical case a cow or a bowl is found dead with eyes tongue 
rectum and sex organs removed apparently surgically with a laser-like object and no 
blood is spilled on the scene typically there is no evidence of any struggle 
and predators will not approach the carcass in some cases mutilations are 
directly associated with ufo activity and many others they are associated with unmarked black 
helicopters leading to a lot of speculation that our own government is responsible 
as researcher lawrence fawcett and barry greenwood offers of the ufo cover-up also titled clear 
intent they write quote the connection between helicopters ufos and mutilations is becoming 
more distinct but what is the ultimate purpose behind this seemingly incongruous association 
skeptics say that this is predators natural causes satanic cult activity this is ridiculous 
that no way accounts for the many many cases but new mexico is one of the hardest hit areas 
and escalated to the point where these types of events could no longer be ignored in the year of 
1975 there were dozens of these cases one occurred on october 21st when residents of union county 
observed five unmarked helicopters buzzing a herd of cattle at the cannon ranch near seneca 
and on november 2nd 1975 residents of two ranches in quay quay county watched a helicopter flashing 
colored lights and sending down beams of white light to the ground and over the next two weeks 30 unidentified helicopters were seen over union and quay counties at which time four 
cattle mutilations were reported the faa started to receive a flood of complaints 
and they launched an official investigation however the revolt results of this investigation 
were never revealed and the faa has subsequently denied the existence of any such investigation 
around the same time the new mexico livestock board investigated the mutilations and they 
concluded that it was possible involvement of clandestine satanic groups but the 70s is when 
this really escalated may 13 1976 a mutilated cow was found near pot mountain on june 13th 
a state police officer from dolce gabe valdez was called to the scene of another mutilation 
and he soon became one of the lead investigators because within a year he was called to investigate 
more than 30 similar cases in the adults area and he became an expert in 1978 he was informed 
that some mutilated cows were being marked by an unknown substance which would fluoresce 
under ultraviolet light a black light and on july 5th 1978 valdez and a cattle rancher by the name 
of manuel gomez put gomez's cattle through an ultraviolet light and five of gomez's cattle were 
found to have a fluorescent substance on their necks ears and legs and they had it the substance 
analyzed and it showed a high proportion of magnesium and potassium levels 70 times 
above normal so this was an ongoing phenomena from 1975 to 1980 gomez lost over 50 head of cattle 
the most recorded on any single ranch but many ranches suffered badly in 1978 rancher neighbor 
montoya of trueschass lost account of mutilation also in 1978 a taos news article by phil bateman 
described ufo sightings in ranchitos that were tied to an epidemic of mysterious animal deaths in 
1979 three race horses near mulga were mutilated two months later in april dulse experienced a 
wave of low level sightings and soon afterwards several mutilations were discovered nearby 
and it was a result of this particular incident and other cases that then new mexico senator 
harrison schmidt a former astronaut called for a multi-state mutilation conference in albuquerque 
and on april 20th 1979 senator schmidt and new mexico u.s attorney r.e thompson held a public 
hearing and more than 200 people attended schmidt opened saying that the mutilations are real 
they're taking place their criminal acts they're causing a great deal of damage but we don't know 
who's doing it and he wanted official help such as the fbi there were 11 other speakers and 
finally this did result in an official investigation to investigate the reports but the 
report did not come to any official conclusion as to what was causing this so ultimately it was kind 
of a bust and meanwhile the mutilations continued 1979 carlos miranda a tribal police officer from 
the bureau of indian affairs found responded to a call and found two dead heifers in santa clara
there was a cover-up of these events according to him and the uh 
fbi launched an investigation known as operation animal mutilation oam and the oam report said that 
by 1979 more than 10 000 head of cattle had been mysteriously mutilated and that new mexico was 
unusually hard hit and since 1975 alone more than 100 cases had been reported 
and they're often accompanied by strange sightings of helicopters and or ufos 
so these mutilations continued through 1988 to 89 1990 there was another case in 1996. 
i mean it just kept going on and on over and over all through the 1990s there was a whole wave of sightings uh one particularly uh 
frightening incident occurred to larry gardea who was hunting in luhan canyon when he came 
upon a herd of cows and came upon on a mutilation heard a strange sound like a welder's torch from 
the forest and all of a sudden one of the cows in the herd floated up into the air over the fence 
towards this herd towards the source of the sound rather and at the same time he saw another cow floating down out of the sky and landing in the pasture 
and he quickly took his rifle and fired at the source of this noise at which point it 
immediately stopped and he called the sheriff to report this incident and they did find that these 
cars had been mutilated uh one researcher who looked into this was gail stalin a reese stalin 
a researcher from albuquerque she investigated many cases firsthand and is certain that it's 
not the work of satanic cults she says for you to walk up to a cow that size and kill it 
you'd have to slit its throat you'd have blood all over the place if it is confirmed that it is laser 
cuts the equipment they'd have to use is fairly good sized that's why I think the cows are removed
another researcher was santa fe based researcher david perkins and he charted the locations of more 
than a dozen mutilations that had taken place in new mexico over the last 16 months in 19 
since 1994 and he found that the majority of these cases occurred in the area of 
eagle nest which is where according to perkins nuclear fallout from a may 1955 nevada atomic 
test had landed and he speculates that the purpose of the mutilations might be to measure the effects 
of atomic pollution on the local animal population at any rate these mutilations occurred all 
through the 1990s gabe valdez continued to investigate these unusual animal deaths 
and many other investigators looked into it as well one researcher was john pastor noester 
john paternoster and he researched several cases 
and he said that he believes most of these cases are going unreported because farmers and ranchers 
are very reluctant to report them and don't want to be viewed as crackpots or ufo believers 
timothy good excellent researcher interviewed some of these ranchers interviewed a guy from 
a ranch near taos who had experienced a large number of mutilations so many many 
investigators have looked into this and while cattle seem to be the main target many other animals have been reported mutilated such as in november of 1988 a rare case involving 
a small piglet was discovered near the talpa reservoir and it hasn't stopped this 
continued on into the 2000s uh near 2000 there were several cases 2003 
2007. it's just going on and on and john paternoster is convinced that these mutilations 
are not being caused by satanists or scavengers he says there's got to be a different explanation 
and he says perhaps it's something we can't even comprehend researcher gabe valdez says whoever it 
is they're coming down by the air I don't know who they are but whatever is behind it it's something 
big richard dolan looked into it and he says the theory is that mutilations are occurring as part 
of a covert random sampling of cattle to test for excessive levels of radiation contamination the 
area of northern new mexico which was the hot spot of mutilation activity during the 1990s 
happens to be downwind from the nuclear test site in nevada possesses several active uranium mines 
was the scene of many nuclear detonations in past decades and also has two major 
nuclear research laboratories and over the years an estimated 1 000 kilotons of radioactive dust 
fell on new mexico nevada and colorado and researcher david perkins agrees 
he says when mutilations first became popularized in the late 1970s he conducted a statistical study 
and found that many of these were downwind of nuclear power plants nuclear weapons labs nuclear 
test sites and military bases and that others were reported near uranium mining operations such as 
in grant and hidalgo counties and near the site of underground nuclear detonations in the 1960s 
he's also discovered that mutilation events formed a tight ring around los alamos national 
labs including sandoval santa fe and rio arriba counties he isn't sure who is responsible as he 
says my theory is that the government doesn't know any more than us but he thinks that they might 
know some and he's now leaning towards military as he says right now i'm leaning toward the military 
secret operation theory I see all kinds of lights zooming around here but I don't know what they are 
lawrence fawcett and barry greenwood agree they say it may take some time before the pieces fall together but ultimately we believe that the government 
will have to admit to deep involvement in this aspect of the quote ufo mystery 
so yeah animal mutilations is definitely a huge problem it's still ongoing it doesn't 
receive as much publicity as it used to but it's definitely one of the big events 
that is still taking place in new mexico and that's why I wanted to include it on this list 
and now we get to case number six which I chose project twinkle and this is a series of mysterious 
green fireballs that descended on a particular area of new mexico throughout 1948 and 1949 
these are enormous green fireballs like meteorites which showered down on the landscape and in a 
few cases actually struck the earth however in every single case there was no physical evidence 
that could be found of their existence it was they were first assumed to be natural meteorological 
phenomena but as their numbers increased it became clear that these were not normal fireballs first of all they were bright green they were far too numerous they were totally 
silent they left no evidence of their passing and while meteors uh unlike meteors these these things 
often traveled in a nearly horizontal path at an altitude of forty thousand to sixty thousand feet 
and there was also the question of why they never appeared before 1948 and seemed centered almost exclusively over new mexico at any rate from 1948 through april of 1949 at least 
39 reports of these green fireballs came to the attention of officials at the air material command 
for example on december 5th an air force pilot flying a c-47 at 18 000 feet over albuquerque 
saw a huge green fireball fly upward then level off on a horizontal trajectory and seven minutes 
later another pilot saw an orange fireball approaching a horizontal trajectory it turned 
green in color then darted to the side and fell to the ground and before long these fireballs were 
coming down in huge numbers captain edward rupelt of project blue book wrote and I quote everyone 
including intelligence officers at kirtland air force base air defense command people dr 
lincoln lopez and some of the most distinguished scientists at los alamos had seen at least one 
so many of these were over los alamos for example on the 5th 8th 11th 12th 
13th 14th 20th and 25th of december 1949 witnesses saw these green fireballs and these included 
special agents of the united states air force the office of special investigations airline pilots 
los alamos security inspectors scientists and military officers of virtually all ranks all 
these witnesses the pentagon actually called quote observers whose reliabilities are not questioned 
dr lincoln lapaz who is a professional astronomer had a sighting on december 12 1948 he and others 
watched as a green fireball which was four times brighter in magnitude than venus 
flew on a horizontal trajectory at low altitude for at least eight miles directly over los alamos 
j allen heineck was consulted about this problem and he interviewed several leading astronomers 
and found that most of these astronomers had no idea about these fireballs anomalous features and 
according to I mean he pointed to lincoln le paz as the best source of information on the subject 
and according to heinek and I quote it appears that the green fireballs can be 
characterized by being extremely bright most of them lighting up the sky in the daytime 
estimated magnitude -12 which is extremely bright they appear to come in bunches 
no noises associated with them despite their brightness they leave no trails or trains if these 
data are correct that is if this many objects are actually seen all extremely by bright all 
having this particular green color all exhibiting no noise all showing a preferential direction 
all being homogeneous in light intensity all snapping out very quickly and all leaving no 
trails then we can say with assurance that these were not astronomical objects in the first place 
any object as bright as this should have been reported from all over the world if the earth 
in its orbit encountered for some strange reason a group of large meteors there is no reason that 
they should all show up in new mexico if the data as reported by la paz are correct then 
we do have a strange phenomena here indeed so these sightings continued throughout 1949 
officials from kirtland air force base contacted washington and organized an investigation lincoln 
lapaz triangulated the path of these objects estimated their speed at anywhere between 25 000 
to 50 000 miles per hour there was no reports of any sonic boom and he assured the afosi 
office of special investigations that the objects were quote surely artificial and these weren't 
always green some of these fireballs were different colors red yellow orange on one occasion 
a fireball approached within 500 feet of an airport drop to an elevation of 200 feet and then 
explode with a shower of reddish spray according to donald kehoe famed ufo researcher it was feared 
that this might be some kind of gas but it caused no ill effects this was repeated on three nights 
at the same time and locations proving the red spray of the ufos were under precise control 
the incidents were confirmed in the air force project grudge report which is the precursor 
of project blue book but had no opinions as to the purpose but by this time of course air force 
officials were becoming increasingly concerned these objects were appearing over sensitive atomic 
installations like los alamos sandia labs kirtland air force base and on february 16 1940 net 1949 
a secret meeting with dr edward teller the primary inventor of the atomic bomb and dr lincoln lapaz 
who was the director of the institute of meteorologics at the university of new mexico 
this meeting was held at los alamos scientific labs to study the phenomena and after studying 
the reports they concluded that these fireballs were artificial constructions perhaps some sort of 
controlled missiles but he was absolutely opposed to the meteor theory astronomer clyde tombaugh 
agreed with lincoln le paz and said that these were not meteors so at this point the air force 
office of special investigations at kirtland air force base issued a list of fire ball reports 
to air force headquarters which gave the common characteristics of these sightings which included 
green color green white bright green yellow green or blue green horizontal path with sometimes minor 
variation speed less than that of a meteor but more than any other type of 
known aircraft no sound associated with observation and no persistent trail or dust cloud
finally a period of visibility from one to three seconds and it was in august of 1949 
that kirtland air force base finally got the investigation they'd been asking for and the 
united states air force created a special study we now know as project twinkle and they brought 
in a theodolite camera which allowed them to track these objects and triangulate their size 
speed and altitude on september 20th 1950 more than 100 witnesses across idaho and new mexico saw 
one of these objects the project twinkle failed to capture it from november 9th to november 20th 
the green fireballs were reported on 11 consecutive evenings and the objects were 
witnessed by military personnel and astronomers however project twinkle was unable to capture any 
of the objects on their instruments however by this time they had logged more than 150 
sightings and edward rupelt called project twinkle quote a bust and it was dissolved on december 27 
1950 said it was badly organized pitifully funded and never tracked a single fireball 
in 1955 researcher leonard stringfield spoke with captain robert c white and inquired about these 
green fireballs captain white replied they do exist that's why thousands of dollars were spent 
on investigating them the project files have never been declassified the air force thinks the 
fireballs are astronomical phenomena springfield of course disagreed and quoted dr lapaz who said 
they are not any kind of meteor I have ever heard of and said simply we cannot explain them 
so these continued to appear all throughout the 1950s but by the end of the decade they slowed 
down scientists didn't did find unusually high levels of copper in the atmosphere where these 
green fireballs were and speculated perhaps this was an unknown cloud of asteroids uh but 
this failed to explain why new mexico was the only location where these were being seen and there was 
at least one contact he was told that uh these fireballs were intentionally generated by the 
ets and sent to this area in order to reverse the atmospheric damage that atomic testing had caused 
so every now and then these fireballs continued to appear and eventually they stopped by uh 
19 the late 1950s it was pretty much over but uh this wave of green fireballs 
has never been explained despite the existence of project twinkle and remains a unique 
and fascinating era of ufo history over new mexico and that's why I wanted to include it here 
and now we get to the top five cases and for case number five I chose the invasion of white sands 
air force base and this really began on may 15 1947 when a v2 rocket was launched at white sands 
it went 40 miles high when suddenly another target appeared the v2 veered off its path and crashed 
in two minutes and a team headed by lieutenant colonel harold r turner the commanding officer 
told intelligence investigators that the missiles crashed because of this ufo and the office of 
scientific research and development had a board of highly placed scientists put together to study it 
and it was headed by vaniver bush who as we now know is part of mj12 
it was just a short time later one month later june 29th 1947 three naval scientists 
dr zone curtis rockwood and john koch prepared for a test involving a captured german v2 rocket 
and they saw a silver disc dr zone reported to army intelligence and told them it was not 
a balloon and from this point on white sands was visited constantly april 6 1949
scientists observed several objects over the base using a theodolite this is again a telescope with a protractor it rotates vertically and horizontally and is used for rocket launches 
two weeks later april 24th 1949 another ufo was observed using a theodolite at the time they were 
launching a skyhook weather balloon when this ufo showed up commander robert mclaughlin of the base 
was supervising charles b moore was watching this balloon when he noticed that the otolite 
operator wasn't observing the balloon anymore and began berating him but the operator said 
but i've got it right here so charles b moore took over the theodolite and observed the ufo for about 
60 seconds and estimates it was 40 feet wide 100 feet long with solid edges and moving at about 
2200 miles per hour project blue book was called in including j allen heineck and as jaylen heineck 
says charles moore was disgusted with the air force's and my lack of attention to this sighting 
who can blame him it was typical of the air force's practice of spending a great deal of overkill effort pinning down cases for which there seemed to me an immediate logical explanation 
in sight and devoting only modest follow-up to a case that was truly baffling nevertheless they 
labeled this case unexplained it caused waves in high circles and dr vannever bush's group came 
to investigate it was leaked to newspapers which the air force seemed to be more concerned about 
than the study of the objects itself and it was then that commander robert mclaughlin actually 
went public and as he says flying discs have nothing to do with any experiments carried on by 
american scientists or for that matter by anyone on earth these things are real they come from 
another planet where creatures are far ahead of us in science I have heard it said that they are 
spaceships from mars which have been attracted to the earth by our atomic bomb explosions 
and fascinated by what they saw have continued to keep an eye on us he told true magazine 
i am convinced it was a flying saucer and further that these discs are space aliens from another 
planet operated by animate intelligent beings so he just went right out and said it they're aliens 
and the sightings just continued on april 27 1949 for army u.s 
personnel for u.s army personnel were stationed near los alamos when they observed a tiny object 
described as a four inch diameter light with a metallic cone attached to the rear fly directly towards them they estimate it moved at 70 miles per hour at a height of only 
seven feet and it was in view for just a matter of seconds before disappearing to the southwest and 
there are some reports that white sands actually shot down one of these objects on may 29 1947 at 
white sands proving ground according to researcher and reformer republican state representative john 
kistner radar technicians at white sands observed one or more unidentified rhaegar radar targets 
hovering to the southwest of w white sands proving grounds launch row and at 7 15 pm one surface to 
air missile with a 674 pound atomic warhead was fired at one of the radar target targets five 
minutes later the warhead exploded at an elevation of sixty thousand feet and meanwhile witnesses 
in las cruces saw this rocket climb to the sky move towards two star-like objects and explode 
and following this explosion this target was tracked on radar moving south and 10 minutes 
later it impacted the earth 30 miles to the south outside of the town of juarez new mexico 
and officials attempted to go to mexico and retrieve the object however the town of juarez at 
this point had been closed off by mexican military officials who refused to allow anybody inside 
the area and according to john kistner whatever had crashed had been largely vaporized upon impact 
so sightings continued throughout may and june of 1949 uh two more v2 rockets were launched 
at this time and both provoked sightings and according to commander mclaughlin and I quote 
many times I have seen flying discs following and overtaking missiles in flight 
at the experimental base at white sands where is as is known the first american atom bomb 
was tried out and sightings continued through 1950 april 27 1950 a missile launch at holloman 
air force base fell to the earth when four unknowns swooped down and were viewed on 
a theodolite officers determined that these objects were 30 feet in diameter 
on may 29 1950s officers at white sand tracked another unknown object at two separate theodolite 
stations and actually took camera footage of the object strangely this case was never reported to 
blue buck an even more impressive case took place just a few months or actually one month later july 
1950 and is warning of many ufo incidents that the air force attempted unsuccessfully to censor 
in this case the witness was an electronics engineer who worked at the base and over the past several months he had seen quote high groups of shiny objects end quote 
over the base and he had already accepted that there was something going on here involving ufos 
and one day in july he was eating lunch in his office when the telephone rang 
and it was a nearby radar station phoning to say that an aerial object was being sighted 
over the base and could he view it on a theodolite so they went to their station and quickly located 
the object with the theodolite and according to coral lorenzen who interviewed this officer 
the object was cigar-shaped metallic and iridescent meaning it glowed they could 
see fins extruding from this object and portholes as well and after they located on the theodolite 
it maneuvered around dropped stopped short moved forward turned on its side doing all these extreme 
maneuvers the officer alerted other nearby radar stations however when 
he got back to the theodolite this object was gone they turned over the film they had taken 
and two days later they were called in by an unidentified lieutenant and uh 
were basically told not to talk about it according to coral lorenzen they were asked over and over 
again if they had taken pictures and to describe over and over the object they had observed the 
two men were asked if they could identify the film of the object they had photographed one of the men 
became quite angry about the questioning telling the officer that he had seen what he had reported 
had photographed the object and was convinced the object was some sort of vehicle from outer space 
and he was shown a film of 14 frames on a projector and this 
these frames showed a blurred ellipsoid with a dark center but no details and they were told by 
their superiors to quote forget the whole incident so another incident occurred in 1951 when july 
14th when a fast-moving object was seen again over white sands it was hovering near a b-29 caught on 
radar observed visually through binoculars and was photographed at about 200 feet of elevation 
on a 35 millimeter moving camera which showed this object clearly 
and uh there was other reports of ufo crashes according to researcher todd zechel 
an anonymous army helicopter pilot uh was an aide to an air force general who told him that a crash 
saucer of an ovoid shape about 18 by 30 feet was recovered along with four uh four foot tall bodies 
and it was retrieved near white sands in 1953 then shipped off to langley and according to the 
witness this craft was found in near perfect condition with the doors open though all the 
occupants were dead they were reportedly hairless but otherwise looked very much human looking 
and in 1977 researcher richard hall spoke with the lieutenant colonel who confirmed this incident 
and said that he had actually seen the four bodies at langley air force base and was told that they were recovered from a crash in 1950 through 1953 near white sands
so uh many many cases I mean I can go on and on there was a case in 1956 
on in september when numerous witnesses observed a disc shaped object with the dome on top land on 
the highway within the white sands proving grounds just 12 miles east of holloman air force base 
right alongside highway 70 and as it landed the engines of all the cars rolled to a stop and 
other witnesses on the base also observed this object and other the people on the base personnel 
who observed this object were all brought together in a hangar and sworn to secrecy and this order 
came not from the air force but from the cia who told him that the origin of the ufos was unknown 
there was another landing on november 3rd 1957 this was of course during that huge 
wave of sightings I also already covered that but many many other sightings may 15 
1964 two ufos were tracked on surveillance radar and on the radars of other stations and these 
objects performed very precise maneuvers they were described as brown colored and football 
shaped and were flying so low that they actually disappeared behind the site of buildings
researcher frank edwards says that in may of 1965 officials at holloman air force base which guards 
white sands missile range reported that their radar had tracked ufos for two days june of 1967 
edward beatty an engineer with 850 rocket launches was overseeing a launch at white sands 
when one of the officers saw an object circling over the launch pad and as edward beatty says we 
saw the rocket rising from the launch pad and the quarter inch disc was pacing alongside the 
rocket going straight up all of us saw this and I know we did not possess an aircraft at that time 
that could fly straight up and pace that rocket I can't explain it ralph and judy bloom looked into 
this activity and they heard from an officer that there was graffiti written 
on the wall of uh bathroom wall at white sands which said and I quote I saw a disk up in the air 
a silver disk that wasn't there two more weren't there again today oh how I wish they'd go away 
so this continues all the way to modern times I mean on july 7th 1997 a gentleman was driving 
his car along white sands missile range had just reached the curve at launch complex 32 when he 
saw an orange ball of fire floating alongside the mountain and as it got closer this object 
suddenly turned white turned directly towards him and approached until it was less than a block away 
and then it began to descend came within 15 feet of the ground he said it was about the size of a v 
w beetle shaped like a kind of a light bulb it stopped in mid-air and stayed still in one place 
it was extremely bright and as he's watching it it suddenly became extinguished a few moments later 
it lit up again he flashes headlights at it and the object reacted by moving slowly away it joined 
two other identical looking objects and then all three lights moved off and disappeared 
so yeah white sands is a ufo magnet and the complex of events that have happened there 
unrivaled any other air force base except for perhaps edwards maybe or area 51 it's 
definitely an area that is known for high levels of ufo activity and that's why I 
wanted to include it on this list and now we're at the top four and for case number four I chose 
the aztec ufo crash this is perhaps one of the most controversial ufo crashes 
it's been summarily dismissed by many researchers as a hoax unintentionally perpetrated by ufo 
author frank scully who was the first to mention ufo crashes in his book inside the flying saucers 
however today many researchers are taking the aztec crash very seriously and that scully was 
in fact the victim of a debunking campaign as leonard stringfield writes some researchers 
have never given up and believe that scully was the victim of official counteraction and that 
his smeared book was actually true stringfield was of course a pioneer of ufo crash retrievals 
and uh he wrote that the backlash from the publication of scully's book actually slowed down 
the progress of research into crash retrievals as he says at that time active researchers including 
myself did a little more than scoff we thought we had good reason our collective scoffing was the 
result of an alleged grand hoax here I refer to the book behind the flying saucers by frank scully
with the book's subsequent exposure as a hoax which got a lot of publicity it became 
unfashionable to write or talk about crashed ufos and their alleged little men 
but now he's changed his tune and he says we now must take a new and honest look at old rumors and 
we must also take a new look at the possibility of a grand official cover-up and why researcher 
timothy good is one of many people who are taking a new look at the aztec crash and as timothy good 
writes according to a number of sources the most important case involving the recovery of an alien 
craft took place outside the little town of aztec new mexico in 1948 a great deal of technical and 
other intelligence resulted from this recovery intelligence which gave them americans a 
giant leap forward in technology and weaponry unparalleled in human history researcher linda 
mueltenhau is also convinced and she writes I have interviewed some of the people who are still alive 
who saw it in march of 1949. aztec is a very important piece because of the technology received 
there according to mrs frank scully she said that both she and her husband were visited by captain 
edward rupelt who said that scully's book was actually a huge pain in the ass for the air force 
and he said and I quote confidentially of all the books that have been published about flying 
saucers your book was the one that gave us the most headaches because it was closest to the truth 
so the aztec crash really began on march 8 1950 when silas newton 
an alleged texas oil millionaire gave a public lecture lecture the university of denver talking 
about this ufo crash he said that his friend quote dr g was actually an amalgam of several 
other scientists were brought in to study this ufo this aztec ufo and its occupants 
and scully's book was actually one of the first ufo books published in the us if not the first 
and scully claimed that again dr g was not one person but a combination of several scientists 
and they informed him that this craft had been found outside of aztec on february 13 1948 
uh some researchers say march of 48 or even 49 it's there's some controversy about the date but 
again this craft was almost completely intact except for a small hole in one of the portholes 
was exactly 99.99 feet in diameter it was composed of metal so light that only a few men could lift 
the entire craft they were not able to find any way to enter the craft and it took them 
several days to open it which was finally achieved by sticking a stick 
through this tiny pencil sized hole in one of the portholes which turned a latch and opened 
the door and inside they found some 16 small ETs all dead apparently from explosive decompression 
they found hieroglyphic hieroglyphic type writings small wafers which were apparently food 
the craft was able to be dismantled into separate parts and carted away for study and this was the 
story frank scully told and this story remained uninvestigated and debunked for years until really
investigators started to look into it such as leonard stringfield and really researcher william 
steinman who wrote the book ufo crash at aztec and basically built a very convincing case that the 
whole affair with dr gebauer and silas newton and their subsequent arrest as hoaxers was actually 
a debunking disinformation campaign and uh he was able to locate new witnesses to the azt tech crash 
more recently scott and suzanne ramsey have published another book on the aztec incident 
called the aztec incident and this case is now seriously considered to be an actual 
ufo crash retrieval event it was report supposedly allegedly reported in the farmington 
daily times but no one has been able to locate this article one witness 
uh is bill devlin who's come forward and uh he befriended a soldier and got to talking about 
ufos and soldier revealed that he had personally been involved in this crash incident and said that 
he was one of three drivers who delivered the remains of this saucer from aztec to fort riley 
and he confirmed that there were 16 bodies all dressed alike in tight jumpsuits he said the yellowish skin human-like features and a light peach fuzz on their skin 
another witness is chuck oldham who knew a former military officer with a very high security 
clearance and this officer said he was on base when he stumbled upon a file which described the 
aztec case in detail and even included photographs he described one of the photos and I quote there 
was a perfect intact circular shaped craft and it was lying somewhat tilted to one side on the 
ground in the desert there did not appear to be a crater or ground disturbance that would indicate a 
crash but I couldn't tell for sure the material of which the craft was composed was metallic 
and resembled brushed aluminum according to scott and suzanne ramsey the first people actually to 
discover this craft were was a group of firemen and shortly after the military arrived and 
escorted all civilians off the scene and opened the craft dismantled it and carted it away
the so this is a very strange event and uh according to the reports on it uh it's made 
of an unknown metal that was impervious to dry diamond drills a settling torches 
and at a very very difficult time as I mentioned earlier
gaining entrance into this craft so yeah it's a controversial case but it certainly had an 
impact on the ufo field and that's why I included it here and now we get to the top three and 
for case number three I chose the farmington ufo display this has got to be one of the most unusual 
ufo incidents in recorded u.s history it occurred on march 17 1950 over the small town of farmington 
which then had a population of somewhere between four to six thousand residents 
and early on the morning of march 17th around 10 a.m st patrick's day more than a thousand 
witnesses in farmington observed an enormous group of hundreds of saucer-shaped objects 
maneuvering above the town performing fantastic loops dives turns accelerations and decelerations 
and other fantastic maneuvers panic ensued as the population uh of the town poured out into 
the streets and watched this display which went on for two hours it was in fact photographed uh 
the level of activity was described by some of these as an invasion uh citizens throughout 
farmington saw this uh not only citizens but several city officials including the mayor 
members of the highway patrol the local newspaper staff pilots and uh of course they reported 
to the local press and uh the farmington daily times wrote a article about it 
about this huge saucer armada and the story was quickly picked up by other newspapers 
the la times printed an article and many other newspapers reported this 
and all these objects were described as being uh sort of silvery objects some had like a red hue 
or were silver in color and uh one appeared to be very large and nobody could explain what 
these were the editor of the farmington times was walt rogel and he said that at least 85 percent of 
the town's population of 6 000 residents saw this object the denver post had a headline new mexico 
town shore saucer mass flight scene and gave the testimony of some 50 witnesses who had seen this
so this was a big big event there was a lot of people looking into it according to walt rogel 
these objects actually came back there was two incidents and came back over three days 
and as he says on each of the three days their arrival was reported between 11am and noon 
and fully half of this town's population is certain today that it saw spaceships or 
some strange aircraft hundreds of them zooming through the skies whatever they were that caused 
a sensation in this community which lies only 110 error miles northwest of the huge los alamos 
atomic installation some of these objects were estimated at moving at about 1 000 miles per hour 
and some believe that their size was about twice that of a b29
magnetic bomber that has ever happened in this universe in so far as we know 
came on the second day of the memorable day at pharmacy new mexico 
when there the sky was filled with flying saucers the editor of the local table 
selected some dozen reliable businessmen of that city and on the second day hoping for the return 
of the visitors of the previous day were amazed when suddenly at 11 a.m in the morning 
the sky was again filled with these strange circular visitors from another world 
these calm although accepted beyond everything that had ever happened to them 
undertook to estimate and count the ships that swarmed the air for nearly an hour and they 
reported that in their adjustment there was between 4 and 500 ships that had flown 
into the vision of the people of that northern new mexico town from another planet 
from another world the air force was of course contacted and refused at first to release 
any statement but newspaper reporters started really criticizing the air force's handling of 
the situation and uh basically said that the air force was calling the population idiots 
uh for believing that these were ufos and that air force were the ones who were idiots 
uh so this was definitely causing all kinds of controversy there were some reports that this 
weren't re flying slashes at all but some sort of cotton or fluff that was flying over the town 
that merely looked like ufos one witness orville ricketts who was the editor of the 
farmington daily news said it was not cotton fluff balls or anything like it that day the 
wind was very still and he collected the names of at least 50 witnesses who observed these objects 
and the vast majority of them believed that these were some sort of craft 
uh and they were putting on some sort of weird display as one farmington resident john bloomfield said they appeared to be coming at each other head on 
and at the last second one would veer it right angles upward the other right angle is downward 
one vehicle would pass another and immediately the one to the rear would take the lead all I know is that I saw something up there in the sky that I never saw before 
another resident was marlo webb and is absolutely convinced that these were strange craft 
another resident said he watched the objects through a theodolite and measured their speed at 
1 000 miles per hour another resident was captain clayton j boddy and he watched this display with a 
group of five businessmen and agreed that they saw more than 100 of these silver colored disc 
shaped objects they contacted the air force who denied anything and said it didn't happen and 
so many many many people saw this uh and they came for a short while maybe in anywhere from 10 
minutes to an hour according to different reports by witnesses uh but many many people saw this 
another was was witnessed was johnny eaton he said i've never seen anything like it in my life 
and uh he was actually approached the next day by military officials who interviewed him and 
told him it was balloons but there were at least two waves of sightings and after these sightings 
occurred the air force was contacted and asked for an explanation and their only explanation was
there's nothing to it and later major edward rupelt also tried to debunk the sighting 
say that it was perhaps a skyhook balloon which had shattered into thousands of little pieces 
which the witnesses don't agree with whatever the explanation this farmington ufo display remains unparalleled in ufo history and it actually took place on what 
some people believe is the one year anniversary of the alleged ufo crash at aztec and that perhaps 
the ETs were acknowledging the date of the aztec crash and we're sort of memorializing it 
at any rate it's a very well known and highly unusual incident which everyone should know 
about and that's why I gave it the number three spot and now we get to the number two case which 
i chose the socorro ufo landing this is one of the most famous well verified ufo landings in all 
of ufo history it occurred outside of the small town of socorro new mexico on april 24th 1964. 
unknown to many there was several sightings immediately prior to this event 
around 5 p.m before this sighting before this landing two witnesses paul keyes and larry kratzer 
were about a mile southwest of socorro when they saw a strange object hovering over 
a uh over the ground it was shiny and reflective and one of the witnesses said it had a strange 
red marking on the right side and he wondered if it was perhaps some sort of secret aircraft and it 
was just a short time later when another witness opel grinder who was a gas station attendant uh at 
the socorro gas station said that he was assisting a customer when the customer explained that he had 
seen a strange egg-shaped craft fly overhead as he was traveling northward on highway 85 
and it disappeared behind a mesa and he saw a speeding police car race by which is probably 
lani zamora because at this exact time socorro police officer lonnie zamora was in pursuit of a 
speeding motorist when he heard a loud roaring sound looked towards the source of the noise 
and saw a bright flaming object land behind a small hill near the location of a dynamite shack 
he thought at first the shack had exploded and he drove to the top of the hill and to a shock 
small this shiny type object landed next to the road and he saw two short figures standing next 
to it and they appeared to be working on the object he first thought perhaps there was an 
auto accident and radioed headquarters that there was in fact an auto accident but as he approached 
within 100 feet he realized that this was no auto accident as he says it looked at first like a car 
upside down I thought some kids might have turned it over I saw two people in white coveralls very 
close to the object one of these persons seemed to turn and looked straight at my car and seemed 
startled seemed to quickly jump somewhat at this time I began moving my car towards them quickly 
with the idea to help the object was like aluminum was whitish against the mesa background not chrome 
seemed oval in shape and I at first glance took it to be an overturned white car the car appeared 
turned up like standing on the radiator or trunk at this first glance the only time I saw these 
two persons was when I had stopped for possibly two seconds or so to glance at this object these 
persons appeared normal in shape but possibly they were small adults or large kids so he drove closer 
he lost sight of the object behind the hill for just a few seconds but as he crested the hill the figures were no longer visible the craft was sitting on landing gear at this point he heard 
loud thumping sounds followed by a loud roar and this craft rose upward emitting a blast of flame 
he jumped behind his car for protection and says that this object rose upward 
went right over the dynamite shack the flame became extinguished a louds whining sound replaced 
the loud roaring sound and the craft flew away in a bobbing motion at low altitude and at this 
point he could see this red colored arrow-like symbol he says it was about two feet wide on the 
side of this object and it was moments later that state police officer sergeant sam chavez 
arrived and both he and lani zamora approached the place where this object had landed and found 
landing traces four deep indentations on the earth and a burnt mesquite bush and charred grass 
furthermore the rock where the craft had sat also appeared to be melted and fused and according to 
and ruffle william moore and other ufo researchers military personnel showed up within 45 minutes and 
uh it turned out that lonnie zamora knew dr lincoln lopez and told him about the sighting 
so the air force showed up as well jan heineck came to the scene he measured the landing marks 
uh he was somewhat skeptical at this point of ufos but after investigating this particular case came 
away uh absolutely baffled and said it was quote one of the air force's major ufo sightings in the 
history of the air force's consideration of this subject this was not far from the local socorro 
airport and heinek was surprised that it did not appear on airport radar though jim and coral 
lorenzen found out later that the socorro airport radar tower was not functioning at this time 
and the air force did show up captain richard t holder was accompanied actually by 
an fbi agent by the name of d arthur burns and together they investigated it uh but uh 
the fbi agent insisted that they get no publicity they interviewed lonnie zamora firsthand 
and lani zamora told him that they he thought it might be a secret government aircraft 
and the air force captain captain richard t holder wondered if lonnie zamaro was the victim of a hoax 
but it's clear from declassified documents on this case that fbi agent d arthur burns took 
this case very seriously researcher william moore used the freedom of information act to obtain 
the written report on this case and the report says that burns examined these landing traces and 
that zamora was quote well-regarded industrious and conscientious and not given to fantasy so 
these landing traces are among the best in ufo history however unknown to many these landing 
traces actually did include metal fragments this craft landed in a volcanic rock and the 
holes made by the craft's landing gear there were metal streaks left by the craft stanton friedman 
and dr james mcdonald interviewed a scientist by the name of mary mays who was at that time 
at the new mexico university studying in radiation biology and she says that she was approached by the university to investigate the landing traces 
she visited the site confirmed the melted sand and the burning vegetation she took samples which she studied in a lab and found no evidence of organic substances
she found no evidence of radiation the plants were scorched and there were also two organic 
substances which she was unable to identify after her investigation she was ordered to turn in her 
report all her samples and to quote keep quiet about the case j allen heineck says 
and I quote the socorro case was basically a single witness sighting although several other more distant witnesses to the object were reported but the witness 
was a policeman whose character and record were unimpeachable physical traces were left on the 
ground and as I personally observed some of the greasewood bushes in the vicinity had been charged 
even major quintanilla then head of project bluebook was convinced that an actual physical 
craft had been present maybe there is a simple explanation for the socorro incident 
but having made a complete study of the events I do not think so it is my opinion that a real 
physical event occurred on the outskirts of socorro that afternoon of april 24 1964. 
later major quintanilla tried to explain away the incident is a test flight of a secret lunar module 
however the socorro incident became the only case involving occupants that blue book officials 
labeled unidentified and became blue book case number eight seven six six and at this time there 
were so many landings in the area that jim and coral lorenzon wondered if the ETs were on some 
kind of agenda as they write the soccorial case had been preceded by some unexplained and in some 
cases terrifying incidents around the white sands proving grounds holloman air force base 
integrated range we hypothesized that this was an intelligence operation of some port 
the military cases the few that we were able to obtain were not naturally publicized we conjectured that if the objects were as we thought 
interplanetary they may have been attempting to find out if military organizations tended 
to withhold information on cases taking place within the confines of military installations
this is walters road your roving reporter at ksrt radio in socorro new mexico 
we have with us this afternoon mr lonnie zamora is the coral patrolman that while chasing a car 
found himself in an area about two miles west of support and one mile east of ksrc radio station at 
which time he reports he came upon an unidentified object resting on four legs that as he drew closer 
the object took off with a loud roar sprouting blue red flame and disappeared in the sky a 
great number of cars and socorro people have gathered here in front of the studios of ksrc to catch a glimpse of mr zamora as he arrived and welcomed him with their car horns mr zamora 
after coming upon this object just what did happen I went up the little road for about 
half a mile I guess uh came up to this little parking deal there on the side of the 
road and I put a glance out the of the window looked to my left so seeing this white object 
on the ground so I thought it might be a car that had turned over so I also 
realized the real I think harry going out there to investigate thought maybe somebody would be hurt 
uh that time I saw this white ache tape hate shaped looking object it looks something like a 
like an egg I mean yeah from the distance I was that looked like a leg to me about the size of 
that car I think uh someone said yeah sorry it looked like the car just turned over um
and uh did any kind of markings or of any kind that you noticed yes it did uh not from that 
that uh far I didn't see the markings when I went up closer to it I did feel marcus 
and uh someone said that uh the markings that you saw it was an an upside down being with three 
lines running through it no sir I couldn't tell you that because they steal them you say doesn't
all right we won't question you on that and if we run into an area that they don't want you to talk about when you just say so and this happened about 5 30 friday afternoon but it happened about 
uh 5 50 about 10 minutes for six about 10 minutes to take and uh you did place a call in to sergeant 
chavez of the state police uh come on out and help you with the investigation as soon as I saw his object I didn't know what it was I placed a call to uh arden challenged me looks faithfully 
told me he would come out there and help me on this he said yes i'll be right there for 
about a few minutes and he arrived just about two or three minutes after the allergy had 
taken off and and left well the obviously was still about a couple of months up there when 
he arrived I was still at that direction it went it was that was over the top of the mountain and we've heard several reports that it flew low or like it was dragging something and we've heard 
some uh it was very low to the ground at the time I was feeling that it was very low to the ground 
up to the pearlite the mill there and then it started getting altitude now I also 
reported to me that when you first drove up into this area and decided this object that the motors 
were running and they were going uh or some such a stretch sound is that is that correct oh not cool 
because this tabs are so fast I started running scared but I don't blame you there's a thought 
something even scared me yet uh now you did say that you saw uh two what appeared to be people 
dressed in white uniforms but uh do they have helmets on like spacemen or anything 
there are people I just I saw something quite quite colorful that's what I could say it looks like there was something in white cover all right 
but you didn't you couldn't identify them as actually being a human being
this quite often turned and told me were they two of them I would say they were two because one was 
from france and the others looking back did you have a chance to to notice what kind of a doorway 
they had to this uh this uh obviously flying out they didn't notice it was overflowing and uh
when that took off uh it made a loud loud growing sound that
and then after it got up in the air about 20 feet while the sound seemed to disappear the sound was disappeared and was very very quiet we could hear a pin drop there and uh now these 
the markings is left on the ground now the reports that i've had and I haven't had a chance to go and 
take a look and the winds yesterday it probably uh spoiled a lot of that anyway was that uh they were 
deep indentations in the ground approximately 10 inches wide and six to eight inches deep 
uh about 15 feet apart that uh is that a correct report ourselves about 19 you feel part of the 
praise and were there any other friends like footprints around the area right after the takeoff 
when you were making the investigation there were some friends but I wouldn't know if there were footprints or anything just prince you couldn't identify them as actually being a footprint 
and the indentations like maybe somebody might have walked there or somebody might walk there somebody walked around there because it was when I got there there was nobody around there yet now 
there was uh according to a report on one of the news uh the television stations in albuquerque 
claimed that they had a call uh just about 5 30 in albuquerque of us are reciting about flying 
objects flying in this direction did you hear anything about that blue surges which uh if 
that be true means that someone in albuquerque saw this object flying in this direction just prior to 
you're signing it and uh which collaborates uh the fact that there was something here 
now it's the feeling I get the feeling at least lonnie as with the people that i've talked to and they were out in the area that they are quite sure that something landed there and something took off 
from this spot because of not only the imprint that is left in the ground but the fires that it 
started and and the method of which uh the fire or the power that it was whatever it was using kind 
of spread itself as it took off is that right right uh no level something out there because I 
feel it and uh uh what was your immediate reaction as soon as you realized that this thing might be 
an object from outer space well I didn't think it would be obviously because I i don't believe in
well uh it was something that you've never seen before and enough to carry it and ran 
in the other direction well what scared me was a loud noise in the flame that the daddy had
this object was a little blow off this one started running back and did you notice whether 
the uh these arms that it was sitting on retracted back into the object as it flew away or you have 
you didn't have time and inside you running in the other driveway at that time I would have been too 
are there any other things about this fighting that you think our listening audience might be interested in or something that you'll be allowed to tell us you know solo 
solos and uh did it disappear where I entered the high sky after that over around the pearlite or 
just a little more to the perlite mine then from there on they just so fast that you could barely
well um do you think we're going to get any more of them around here oh no nothing immediately well 
it was quite an interesting experience i'm sure and it's caused an awful lot of comment 
uh did the investigators that were called in uh make any comments at all in one direction 
or the other with the exception of that they do not have any such object in this area 
oh they are still modeled themselves here and there's been no report on the samplings they took of the area around there from the burning brush and the area that the blast 
hit the ground that might give them a clue as to what kind of power was being used on this you know
well uh I think I just about covered it here uh let's see uh it wasn't dragging anything we had 
a report that uh it was dragging something as it landed all of them there was nothing 
just blown to the zone and uh you can't think of anything else than about deciding of this 
flying object that our existing audience might just be interested in or solo say no 
well ronnie i'm sure you've been getting an awful lot of uh questions and a lot of inquiry and imagine you begin you get a little tired of it actually for so many people calling and asking 
me about it maybe this will be one way to keep too many people from him you have to go through the story over and over again well it's been a real pleasure talking to you mr nani zamora 
this is the gentleman the support patrolmen that get a friday at around 10 minutes to six 
come up on an object a flying object an unidentified fine object as the 
government prefers to call them I don't know excuse me walter i've got some some military 
people that these servers won't talk to me now I believe they're from the ufo uh what you have is 
people are here from the ufo to talk to you right now and to ask you some more questions about this 
and they have not in any way try to indicate that they didn't want us to to uh cover this 
type of benefit so I just don't know we'll come here and talk to you in the registration 
well that's that's fine and we would be interested in knowing uh what they think about it is as if 
they will allow it and after you get through talking to them if you call it back here ksrc 
give us some of the information that they might allow you to let us broadcast to all right 
and uh mr zamora I hope that you don't come up on any more of these objects
and as we find out exactly what they are so it's been a pleasure mr zamora having you in 
our studios and we want to thank you and I know our listeners thank you and this is uh 
expressed by the great number of cars that are out here in front of our studio just to get a glimpse of what we might call a coral celebrity right at the moment it's been very nice studios 
you're just been listening to a fantastic radio special featuring an interview with mr lion zamora 
the patrolman here instagram that's silent i'm identified I reset blew away
uh zamora was overwhelmed with interviews uh and many people tried to interview them by 2003 
he was still being contacted but declined to being interviewed anymore saying simply I just 
don't talk about it anymore but there are still other witnesses coming forth 
recently sally hagler a socorro chamber of commerce volunteer 
told researchers that she saw the same object between her home on lopez road and the m mountain 
and according to her she was interviewed by jay allen heineck who told her that about quote 400 
other witnesses had also seen the same phenomena along the mountain so yeah this is 
an amazing case and probably the single best verified case of a ufo landing in history 
and that's why I gave it the number two spot and now we get to the number one case which i'm sure 
you can already guess what it is and that would be the roswell ufo crash of all the ufo crashes 
in history this is the best verified it's probably the single most famous ufo incident of all times 
and several hundred testimonies now support that something very strange crashed in roswell in 1947 
and the first person to actually investigate this was researcher stanton friedman who interviewed 
one of the witnesses an intelligence officer by the name of jesse marcel who was stationed at 
roswell in 1947 and was a first-hand witness and after receiving marcel's report stanton 
friedman sought out other witnesses he contacted other researchers to assist in the investigation 
in the first book on the case the roswell incident was written by william moore and charles burlest 
based largely on stanton friedman's research this opened the floodgates and since then there have 
been well over 50 5-0 books published on this case many other researchers converged to investigate it 
researchers such as captain kevin randle don schmidt tom carey and many many others uh and before long 
hundreds of additional witnesses were located covering virtually every aspect of this incident 
researchers have interviewed everybody who was involved from the radar operators who first saw the craft on radar the rancher who discovered the wreckage 
people who actually saw this object coming down officers who were called to the scene the 
soldiers who guarded it the pilots who flew the wreckage the people who examined the bodies the 
scientists who attempted to study the craft and so on and today this craft has been so thoroughly 
researched that it has become the granddaddy of all ufo cases even the air force wrote a book on 
it and in their book they dismissed this incident and called the secret mogul weather balloon 
which they said had uh dummies uh attached to it this is a theory that pretty much all researchers 
have dismissed as absurd and inadequate the air force was not using dummies at this time it's an 
absolutely absurd explanation but what makes this crash different from every other crash retrieval 
is that researchers have been able to record the details of this event from start to finish 
most ufo crash retrieval cases rely on a small handful of witnesses or even one witness 
but no this case involves hundreds and we now have a fairly complete picture of what happened 
on that fateful evening in the first week of july 1947. the exact date 
of the crash is a matter of some controversy some say july 2nd some say july 4th some say july 7th 
was clearly in the first week of july at any rate on the evening of this alleged 
crash there was a severe lightning storm over roswell and a large metallic craft 
apparently disc shaped was piloted by four short humanoid beings and this craft somehow became 
disabled whether it was struck by lightning or if radar interfered with it is un unknown for sure 
but this craft was unable to remain aloft it fell downward and crashed onto the ground in a 
ranch north of roswell created a long gouge in the earth took off again traveled a few miles 
and landed on the neighboring sheep ranch owned by mack brazel after a few moments it took off again 
leaving an area of ground burned and fused by high temperatures traveled a short distance 
when it malfunctioned again crashed to the ground violently exploding and disintegrating 
what appears to be the outer shell of the craft it bounced several times digging a shallow gouge into 
the earth and showering considerable debris along a quarter mile brazil heard this explosion and 
decided he was going to check it the next morning the craft apparently took off again flew over the 
nearby capitan mountains another rancher says he actually watched it crash down on the hilltop 
sheared off tops of the trees and scattering more debris before taking off again and other witnesses 
said they watched it fly over the mountains and that it was reportedly being accompanied by two other craft by this time it apparently lost all control and appeared to be on fire 
it lost altitude as it crossed over the mountains and impacted onto the desert floor 
two witnesses were william woody and his father who were driving through roswell when they saw this object fly overhead and crash into the distance 
they tried to drive to it but were turned away by a military cordon blocking the road a roadblock 
and it was at this time that the group of archaeologists or geologists apparently saw this crash and thought it was an aircraft accident 
and when daylight arrived they hiked to the location and saw that this was in fact a ufo 
also another a couple of witnesses who allegedly saw this were jim ragsdale and 
his girlfriend trudy true love who were camping in the area when they came upon this object 
on the desert floor and they also assumed it was a normal aircraft until the military showed up 
sheriff george wilcox received a call about an aircraft accident at his station so he phoned dan 
dwyer at the local fire department and informed him of the location and dan dwyer drove off 
to locate it meanwhile radar operators at roswell had been tracking this object and watched as it 
disappeared off the screen one of them was steve mckenzie and he was part of a small group of 
officers who were dispatched to locate the craft supposedly the archaeologists arrived first um 
one witness who also claimed that he was there is a prospector by the name of barney barnett 
he's a controversial witness but stanton frieden friedman was convinced of his authenticity 
jim ragsdale and trudy true love were hiking to the location and they saw the military arrive so they retreated and uh watched this whole retrieval from a hidden 
vantage and the roswell officers first on the scene acted quickly all non-military personnel 
were ushered off the scene and ordered to remain silent a perimeter was set up roadblocks were put 
up mps were placed around and made to stand guard others were ordered to start picking 
up loose debris fireman dan dwyer arrived around this time and somehow he got past the perimeter 
but it wasn't long before he was also ushered away but not before he saw the craft and the bodies 
and meanwhile photographic experts were being brought in everything was photographed the craft 
in the bodies were taken and recover recovered and taken back to the base 
and the entire area was completely cleaned of any debris it was apparently around this 
time that the local mortician who we now know as glenn dennis received a call from the base 
asking how to preserve bodies and he drove out to the base to see if he could help 
meanwhile rancher mac brazil woke the next morning and was exploring his property when he came upon 
the now famous roswell debris field and he said it was covering a large portion of his land and 
he was pretty upset about it because it was going to take him a long time to clean up 
he said the debris consisted of three main types a thin foil type material apparently metallic 
but it could not be torn or burned and it always resumed its original shape 
the second type of debris was what we now know is the i-beams which were very light like balsa wood 
but had pastel purple hieroglyphic-like symbols on them and uh could not be broken burn or dented 
and also among the debris was strange wire-like filaments like fiber optics 
so he realized this was very unusual he's seen weather balloons before this was nothing like that 
and he brought it to his neighbors the proctors and they talked about the possibility that this 
was from a flying saucer because many of them had been seen in the area recently
and mack brazil tried to get them to go to the debris field but they declined meanwhile another 
rancher mack brazil's neighbor went into his field and found a huge gouge in a flattened area and he 
didn't think much of it not knowing about all the events that were taking place around him 
by this time the bodies had been taken to the base along with the craft and mortician glenn dennis 
he was able to gain access to the base hospital and spoke with a nurse
who was shocked to see him there and told him to leave and that he was in danger 
and at this point military police intercepted him and threatened him with death if he 
revealed anything that he had seen so it was the next morning july 6 allegedly that 
mack brazil collected some of the debris and drove it over to the local roswell sheriff's station 
which was about 75 miles away sheriff george wilcox was impressed by this debris and called 
the base and this is when intelligence officer major jesse marcel was sent to investigate 
and at the same time sheriff wilcox sent two deputies to the ranch to view the wreckage 
they couldn't find it this is a pretty large area but they did come upon a circular area 
on the ranch where it appeared that the sand itself had been melted because of extremely high 
temperatures so around this time the local radio station called and reporter frank joyce 
interviewed mac brazil over the telephone brazil told all about this debris field 
major marcel arrived at the police station and was impressed by what mac brazil had found 
took some of the wreckage back to the base and showed it to his superior colonel blanchard who 
was also impressed and ordered marcel and a counterintelligence agent sheridan cavett 
to go investigate so it was quickly clear to them that this was not a conventional aircraft 
or any weather balloon they collected as much material as they could from the debris field 
and returned back to the base uh marcel stopped quickly at his home showed his wife and his son 
jesse marcel jr the debris which had not yet been classified or identified so technically he 
wasn't breaking any rules and he told his son that he thought this was from a flying saucer 
and the next morning july 8th colonel blanchard examined the wreckage and held a meeting among 
officers he ordered the ranch mack brazil's ranch to be cordoned off the roads blockaded 
and once he got to the actual ranch site he got a group of mps to guard it facing outwards 
and like the other crash site other officers came in and began to gather the debris and 
earlier that day colonel blanchard had actually ordered the base's public information officer 
walter hout to issue the now famous roswell press release telling the entire world that the army 
had done the unbelievable recovered an actual flying saucer and this press release we now know 
is world famous it was subsequently retracted the next day too bad would be a very different world 
a by this point walter how to contact the local radio station gave them the press release it appeared in the roswell daily record and it went 
off like an atom bomb generating interest from across the world meanwhile mac brazil 
was taking refuge in the house of walt whitmore who was a reporter for kgfl in roswell 
and walt whitmore interviewed brazil and was going to air the interview unfortunately before he had 
the opportunity to do so he was contacted by government officials who told him that he was not 
to broadcast the interview however some radio shows were talking about it because according 
to a report by a british officer major huey green he was driving through new mexico at this time and 
was shocked to hear several radio stations talking about this crash of a flying saucer 
and all the decisions were buzzing about it and details of the story were developing as he drove 
along the highway so after leaving walt whitmer's house mack brazil reported to the base where he 
was held in communicado for at least three days where he was questioned by air force officers and 
told not to go public with the story whitmore was contacted and told not to air the interview about 
mac brazil and instead mac brazil came and gave a seriously watered-down version that had no mention 
of any flying saucer the rest of the group debris was gathered and a press conference was held 
saying that it was not a flying saucer at all but was actually a secret weather balloon meanwhile 
the mortician glen dennis contacted the nurse and she described the bodies in detail 
drew sketches for him so that they were very slender beings with oversized heads and she was 
allegedly killed in a plane crash a few weeks later and her identity has never been verified 
but as more wreckage began to come to the base excitement mounted according to researcher 
reuben anaya he and senator joseph montoya who was then new mexico's lieutenant governor 
were both present on the base at the time of the incident and according to anaya the 
lieutenant governor montoya was quote very very scared and said that it had seen 
quote four little men and described them very much like the nurse did said that they were wearing 
tight-fitting one piece jumpsuits and told anaya quote I tell you they are not from this world 
montoya has no made no comment regarding anaya's revelations so more witnesses 
july 7th lydia sleppy who was an administer at the koat radio in albuquerque 
says that local reporter johnny mcboyle called their station to reveal the roswell crash 
and mcboyle said he'd been to the site seen the craft which was all crumpled 
and he was sending his report through the teletype when the machine stopped and uh
he uh returned to the phone or the teletype now said stop communication immediately 
and mcboyle told sleppy forget about it you never heard it you're not supposed to know 
don't talk about it to anyone at this point many of the civilian witnesses 
who were involved in this were threatened to remain silent and as kevin randle says 
quote if nothing extraordinary happened at roswell why the extraordinary efforts to keep it secret 
researcher stanton friedman agrees he says the ufo crashes in new mexico launched the u.s government 
on a long-term elaborate highly sophisticated campaign of concealment and disinformation that 
has yet to be relaxed reportedly one of the ETs did survive this crash and was able to 
communicate with humans and told a history that's very different from what we officially believe 
and then more revelations continue to come for years and years afterwards such as that by colonel 
philip corso who claims that he was charged with reverse engineering wreckage 
from this craft he said that he viewed one of the bodies and he said that he fed 
the roswell debris to various scientists and used it to develop such technologies as night vision 
kevlar the integrated circuit lasers and more and over the next two years uh bill brazzle 
mack brazil's son continued to find bits of wreckage more than a dozen pieces until one 
day the military showed up he had been bragging about it and forced him to hand it over so this 
story is taken decades to unfold it shows no sign of stopping the number of live living witnesses is 
becoming smaller and smaller each day but to close this story off I would like to quote a few of the 
witnesses and what they say about this particular incident here's what loretta proctor said 
she's the one who saw a piece of the wreckage as she says mac brazil did bring a little piece 
a little sliver of wood looking stuff up but you couldn't burn it or you couldn't cut it or anything I guess it was just a little sliver of it about the size of a 
pencil in about three or four inches long was kind of a brownish tan it looked like plastic of course 
there wasn't any plastic then but that was kind of what it looked like 
according to bill brazel the son of mack brazel he handled some of the wreckage and as he says 
it weighed almost nothing these were like balsa wood in weight but a bit darker and 
much harder there were also several bits of metallic-like substance something on the order of tin foil except the stuff wouldn't tear and was actually a bit darker in color than tin foil 
more like lead foil except very thin and extremely light weight the odd thing about this foil was 
that you could wrinkle it and lay it back down and it immediately resumed its original shape 
betsy brazel the daughter of mac brussel was 12 years old she viewed the wreckage and she said that quote so much debris scattered over the pasture land 
there was what appeared to be pieces of heavily waxed paper and a sort of aluminum-like foil some 
of these pieces had something like numbers and lettering on them like pastel flowers or designs 
it was all very light in weight but there sure was a lot of it we were told not to talk about this at 
all back in those days when the military told you not to talk about something it wasn't discussed 
intelligence officer major jesse marcel was the one who viewed the wreckage debris on brazil's 
ranch and he says quote I saw a lot of wreckage but no complete machine was definitely not a 
weather or tracking device nor was it any plane or missile what it was we didn't know we just picked 
up fragments with something I had never seen before or since for that matter I didn't know 
what it was but it certainly wasn't anything built by us and it certainly wasn't any weather balloon 
jesse marcel jr handled the wreckage and he says the material was foil like stuff very 
thin metallic-like but not metal and very tough there was also some structural material too 
beams and so on and printed along the edge of some of the beam remnants there were hieroglyphic 
type characters jim ragsdale who viewed the wreckage from a distance the actual craft said 
quote you could still see where it hit one part was buried in the ground and part of it was sticking out of the ground and he also saw wreckage which looks like foil and as he says 
you could take that stuff and wad it up and it would straighten itself out he saw the aliens and 
he says they looked like bodies they weren't very long four or five feet long at the most 
another witness was sergeant robert robbins he was stationed at the base as an aircraft 
sheet metal repair man and according to his widow and he told her that he was on the second site and 
saw the craft and the bodies and he said this object looked like two saucers put together 
that it had portholes around the perimeter and that the entities had large pear-shaped heads with large black eyes no apparent nose or mouth and brownish skin and one was still alive 
and he told all of this to his wife saying well I guess you might as well know it's going to be 
in all the papers a ufo crash outside of roswell another witness was steve mckenzie who was at the 
radar station and watched this disappear from the scopes and was sent to investigate and as he says 
we were all smoking cigarettes and talking about how the hell we were going to handle this thing 
we were all concerned and a little scared he described the bodies of being slender 
five feet tall with large heads large eyes he saw two dead bodies laying on the ground 
two inside the craft and one was alive sitting nearby as he says that's the one I cannot forget 
it had this damned serene look on its face like it was at peace with the world 
uh and he says the bodies were quickly recovered a special group came in and put all the bodies in 
body bags another witness was easily was a member of the 509th bomb group he was sent to the second 
site where the craft was and he helped set up the perimeter guard around the craft and ordered a 
second group of mps to pick up the loose wreckage and as he says the second group of mps scanned 
quite a large area looking for debris was loaded onto a truck and onto a plane and it took off 
whatever they found was just odds and ends and he saw professional photographers who were recording 
everything so there are photos of this another was frankie rowe who is the daughter of dan dwyer and 
whose father actually was on the site itself and as frankie rose says according to her dad there 
were apparently three people in the craft because he saw two body bags and he saw one live person 
a very small being about the size of a 10 year old child he saw it walking he didn't think it 
suffered any injuries and she says that her entire family was threatened with physical violence and 
was told that they would be quote disappear into the desert if they revealed what they had seen
she was held alone and told by an officer that they were going to take mother away and they were going to take daddy away if she spoke about it 
so she didn't another witness was major lewis rickett and he said 
he was one of a counterintelligence officer who visited both sites apparently of a high uh degree 
of uh secrecy and he said quote there was a slightly curved piece of metal real light is 
about six inches by 12 or 14 inches very light I crouched down and tried to snap it my boss laughed 
and said smart guy he's trying to do what we couldn't do I asked what in the hell is this made 
out of it didn't feel like plastic and I never saw a piece of metal this thin that you couldn't break
another witness was major huey green and he said as I mentioned earlier i'll quote as I 
drove through new mexico from east to west I kept hearing these reports about a downed saucer on 
the local stations as I came within the radius of each one of the radio stations I was listening to 
were so on edge that they couldn't that they kept interrupting the regular broadcasts to 
give the latest developments I am certain that one of the news broadcasts commented on the fact 
that the sheriff and his men were proceeding towards the field of the crash within sight 
of the wreckage glenn dennis says and I quote what I saw reminded me of the front part of a 
canoe about three feet long and lying up against the side there were inscriptions 
on a border around a part of it it reminded me of egyptian trans inscriptions 
robert shirkey who was an assistant group operations officer uh set up the flight plan 
that transported the wreckage and as he says I saw pieces of metal from the craft I saw the i-beam 
with strange markings on it those of us who were involved immediately knew we'd better keep our mouths shut he later wrote a book about it called roswell 1947. I was there another witness was 
captain pappy henderson and according to his wife and his children he was involved in transporting 
the wreckage and he told them that the ETs who parted the craft were little people with exceptionally large heads he told his wife and I quote i've been dying to tell you for years but 
couldn't it was top secret he refused to discuss the wreckage itself saying only it was strange 
so there are many other witnesses colonel thomas jefferson dubose who said 
that uh he saw the container holding the wreckage and uh as he says I only saw the 
container and the container was a plastic bag that I would say weighed 15 to 20 pounds it was sealed the only way to get into it was to cut it another witness was sergeant robert smith 
he was ordered to load the wreckage onto the aircraft to ship it out to other locations and 
he talked to other officers who were on the scene and helped clean it up and actually held some of 
the wreckage brigadier general arthur exxon was stationed at wright patterson and he was there 
when the roswell debris came in and he confirmed that this material was tested and he says quote 
everything from chemical analysis stress test flexing it was brought into our material 
evaluation labs I don't know how it arrived but the boys who tested it said it was very unusual 
parts could be easily ripped or changed there were other parts of it that were very 
thin but awfully strong and couldn't be dented with heavy hammers it was flexible to a degree
and then of course there's colonel corso who his book the day after roswell describes this event in 
detail researcher gray barker said he interviewed a gentleman by the name of nicholas von poppin 
who was taken to photograph the medal of this craft and I mean the number of witnesses goes 
on and on I could be here all day talking to you about it the first book the roswell incident was 
published in 1980 but since then yeah as i've mentioned earlier there have been many many 
books about this craft this story continues to unfold with weird developments such as the 
alien autopsy footage which again was debunked and is very controversial uh representative stephen h 
schiff of new mexico tried to get information on this case in 1993 he was stonewalled at every turn 
and it was just a few years later in 1998 he died of an aggressive skin cancer 
so the case is still unfolding I know it's somewhat of a dead horse but uh this case is not 
going to go away it's the single biggest case in the world and there are stories continuing to come 
out about it to this day and I think at some point we will see this craft in a museum I certainly 
hope so we all deserve to see it uh we all know what happened here it wasn't a mogul balloon 
it was a flying saucer with ETs from elsewhere and we all deserve to see it so that's my list of the 
top 20 cases in new mexico I know this has been a long presentation thank you very much for watching 
i really appreciate it I did cover these cases and many others in my book ufos over new mexico 
a comprehensive history of extraterrestrial encounters in this the land of enchantment 
so yeah if you'd like to learn more about these cases and others please check out my book 
but once again thanks for listening I really appreciate it until next time keep having fun
