TWELVE AMAZING UFO ENCOUNTERS
May 17, 2024

Summary:
May 17, 2024
So many humanoids! Encounters with humanoids and extraterrestrials are far more common than most people believe. Cases come from across the world and have been occurring for a long time. And in almost all cases people describe humanoid figures. In fact, the humanoid form appears to be universal. This video presents twelve amazing humanoid encounters from 1940 to 2009. Some are single-witness cases, but most have multiple witnesses, and a few have compelling physical evidence in support of their case. There are now enough documented cases to conclude that we are not alone on planet Earth. We are being visited.

SOLDIERS OR ALIENS. In July of 1940, a 15-year-old boy from Kongens Tisded, Denmark was going to water his cattle when he came upon three figures wearing jumpsuits and helmets. To his shock, they approached a landed disc-shaped craft which took off silently. He thought they might be German soldiers, but later realized he may have encountered ETs.

THE OLD THIN ALIEN. One day in the summer of 1951, three people went to a play in Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritime, France. Approaching the theater, they saw a small transparent craft low in the sky, and inside it was an old, thin, man with a beard, watching the play. The witnesses tried to alert the audience, but the craft quickly darted away.

THE ARTISTS & THE ALIENS. At 3:30 am on December 28, 1954, seven people drove along Route 143 near Mendoza, Argentina. Suddenly, they came upon a landed craft and two humanoids along the road. They exited their vehicle and got a closer look, as the humanoids scrambled into their craft. The witnesses retreated to their car and left, and the UFO followed!

A CHURCH-GOING ALIEN. On the night of June 26, 1962, the Massolongo family was in their home in Verona, Italy when they saw a UFO hover over the Santa Anastasia Church. It remained there so long, they finally went to bed. Later that night, a glowing green humanoid approached the bedroom window and touched the daughter. All three witnesses watched it leave.

AN APPOINTMENT WITH HUMANOIDS. On October 29, 1965, Sture Johnson received a message that she and her husband Turid (a famous medium) should visit a certain location in Vagarro, Sweden. They went there that evening, and to their amazement encountered black floating humanoids. But were these ETs, or were they something else entirely?

THE ETS BY THE HOSPITAL. At 10:30 am on September 14, 1967, Fabio J Diniz (age 16) was walking by the Baleia Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Brazil when he saw a landed saucer in a nearby field. Two tall humanoids exited and told Fabio to return the next day for another contact. Unfortunately the craft did not return, but it did leave behind landing traces.

THE RECUMBENT ALIENS. One night in September 1973, a couple and their friend were driving near Alijo, Portugal when a glowing disc began to pace their car. Suddenly the car mysteriously broke down. The disc left, then returned. and all three witnesses saw two humanoids lying on their backs alongside the road. The humanoids rose and flew over the car and were gone.

LANDING AND HUMANOIDS IN BOZEMAN. One summer evening in 1978, “Bob” was driving outside of Bozeman, Montana when he saw a bright light alongside the road. Thinking there was a fire, he stopped to investigate. Instead he saw a landed craft and three little humanoids. He hid and watched until the humanoids entered the craft which took off and was gone.

A SUNNY DAY WITH ALIENS. One day in May 1979, a family of four exited their apartment in Toronto, Canada when they saw a huge oval-shaped craft hovering mere feet above their building. To their amazement, about thirty humanoid figures were visible through the portholes. They watched for 10 minutes until the craft zoomed away at high speed.

THE LITTLE BOY IN THE UFO. At 6pm on Sep 1, 1984, six-year-old Nao Nishimoto was amazed to see a flying saucer hovering over the field in front of her home in Takamatsu, Japan. Suddenly a face appeared in one of the portholes. It was a little boy, smiling down at her. As the craft left, the little boy waved goodbye.

THE SMILING ALIENS. One night in July 1992, Reuben Taylor and his mom drove long the 101 Freeway in Echo Park, near Los Angeles, California when a huge craft appeared overhead. The craft moved closer and they were amazed to see several human-looking ETs looking down and smiling at them.

ALIEN TOUR BUS. One night in November 2009, an anonymous man was in his home in Schwindegg, Germany when he noticed an object in the sky only 300 feet away. It looked like a floating bus, and inside he saw several humanoid figures staring back at him. He shouted in fear as the UFO quickly moved away.

These twelve cases are just a small sample of the huge number of documented accounts of humanoids coming from across the world. These cases make it clear that we live in a universe populated by all different kinds of people. We are not alone!

Hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs on the Paranormal I call this episode 12
amazing humanoid encounters and yeah I think they are amazing I find the
humanoid cases endlessly fascinating there's so many of them they're coming
from all over the world it's been happening for a very long time the variation of the humanoids is
mindblowing there's so much I think we can learn from these cases about the ETS about their agenda on our planet and
actually about ourselves as well so I've chosen 12 cases which come from all over
the world and by that I mean Denmark France Argentina Brazil Italy
Sweden Portugal uh Germany uh Japan actually from Canada and from the United
States I've also chosen cases that span quite a long period of time all the way
back to the 1940s up to the 2000s covering Each decade in between I think
this is important because it shows that this is an ongoing phenomenon one that has been occurring for a very long time
a lot of these cases are quite brief some do rest solely on one person's
anecdotal testimony but some are multiple witness cases with some really compelling physical evidence as well and
professionally researched I think all of these cases are important every case
does have something to teach us about what's going on here and these cases I
think you'll find super interesting I've always said that the most I think the
best evidence we have for the veracity of this phenomena is the fact that there are so many
cases so let's just get started because there are quite a few cases I'd like to cover today
and the first case I call soldiers or aliens this is a single witness case so
it's largely resting on one person's anecdotal testimony though apparently there were some Landing traces but it
wasn't professionally investigated uh this case took place back in July or August of
1940 in conans tiad central Jutland
Denmark and it's an important case because this witness really had no idea
about UFOs and actually didn't think he was seeing ETS until much later this
case comes from the Danish magazine UFO neat and the case involves a 15-year-old
boy by the name of soulin it was a Summer Afternoon again
in 1940 and the witnesses was doing chores to collect water for cattle and as he
walked along a dirt road heading towards a place called tiberg Hill he saw three
unusual looking men walking towards him they were unusual because all three were
dressed in dark green shiny silk-like skin tight suits it covered most of
their bodies including the neck and part of the chin and also went right down to their feet including their boots they
also wore tight fitting helmets of the same color that seemed attached to their jumpsuits they had transparent face
plates that looked very much like glass and the witness also noticed the sort of
rope likee or bead-like attachments which went down the front of their jumpsuits from the shoulder all the way
down to the foot otherwise these suits had no markings on them no buttons zippers Pockets or anything they were of
normal proportion for an average person and he honestly thought at first that they were military personnel or
mechanics but he was very surprised to see them there as this area was pretty desolate and
isolated now they seem to be heading directly towards him but suddenly when
they were about 90 ft away from him they turned to the South and started to walk
behind a hill uh he wondered if they had actually turned to avoid them and by this time he was so frightened that he
said his heart was pretty much up in his throat but ever curious to see who they
were and where they were going and what they were doing he rushed up to the top of this little Hill and he could now see them from the
back he saw that their suits were actually very smooth On The Backs side but as he looked to where they were
walking he got another incredible shock because sitting on the ground right near
them was a shiny metallic round dome-shaped object it had no windows or
do doors or any visible landing gear was just sitting there directly on the
ground and it wasn't huge is about as big as a small fighter plane at that
time World War II had begun and the Germans were actually occupying the country so susin wondered if these
figures were German soldiers and the craft was some sort of secret military
craft but it certainly didn't look like the ones he had already seen neither the craft nor the soldiers and as he watched
these figures walked right up to the craft stood next to it for just a few moments and then suddenly disappeared
inside it this was very puzzling to the witness because he didn't see any doors open or
close then seconds later the craft rose vertically and silently upwards very
slowly at first then after about 7 Seconds it turned slightly and its speed
increased dramatically and it darted Upward at an oblique angle disappearing
into the sky in a matter of seconds and during this time he heard a quote violent whoos noise which kind of
reminded him of when someone snaps a fishing line so he was very much
impressed by all of this he ran down to where this craft had landed and did see that the Heather the bushes where this
craft had landed had been crushed down but were already now straightening back
up so he wondered if they really were German soldiers that he saw because he
had seen soldiers before and they craft but this was completely different he was
particularly impressed this craft made almost no noise at all so he went home
told his mother and she told him that it must have been Germans and that he was not allowed to ever speak of it and it
was many years later as an adult that he heard about UFOs and ETS and finally in
1974 reported his experience to researchers can you imagine not talking
about your encounter for 34 years keeping it secret partly because you
were afraid to tell people partly because you didn't understand what you saw I'm so glad this witness did stumble
upon the UFO subject and contact an investigator because he was able to get
his experience documented and that's important because I've said it before the vast majority of
cases go completely unreported and undocumented so any estimates as to how
common this is is probably way too low that's what makes each case important
each case adds to our knowledge of what's going on here now the next case I'd like to cover is also super
fascinating I love this case because it does involve three Witnesses who saw UFO
and humanoids very close up but we're just one witness that's fine but two or
three absolutely adds to The credibility of a case so I call this one the old
thin alien and it took place in the summer of 1951 in bosole this is in the
Alps Maritime in France and I think you'll agree it's a fascinating case
this next case was published in the French magazine lumier Donan lights in
the night and it involves three Witnesses all of who have requested anonymity to are a married couple Mr and
Mrs X age 49 and 40 and their friend Mr y who is actually a police officer and
it was one afternoon in the summer of 1951 that they had gone to see a play located at 21 Ru de martier and as they
got onto the street all three Witnesses were distracted by an object in the sky
and looking up they saw a small oval object only about 180 ft away and it was
quite low about 25 ft up in the sky directly above the theater itself where
they were walking to this object appeared to be completely transparent
and not very large about 12 to 15 ft wide the craft itself was tilted as if
to allow the pilot who was inside this craft a better view of what was going on
below him so all three Witnesses were amazed they moved closer and were even
more shocked to see that there was a pilot a Strang looking man sitting in a
chair inside this craft they were viewing him in profile he sat in this
seat in the front of the vehicle this man appeared to be of normal height but
he was dressed in light colored clothes and while he looked human he appeared to be quote thin and old he had very fair
skin but most odd to the witnesses was they had a long white
beard now this pilot this UFO occupant didn't appear to notice the witnesses
and instead seemed to be absorbed in contemplating and observing the play
that was going on beneath him now nobody else in the theater audience seemed to
notice this object though they did all have their backs to this UFO and were
paying close attention to the play now the witnesses did notice that the man seemed to be actually leaning
forward in his seat to to more closely observe the going on below him and as
the three Witnesses observed more closely and got closer they were amazed to see a second pilot seated alongside
the first though because they were looking at him in profile this second pilot was pretty much behind the first
so they couldn't see him as clearly another odd thing that the witnesses noticed was that they couldn't
see any type of Machinery or controls or anything in the craft it was just the
chair and these two guys and as they got within shouting distance of the audience
at the theater they began to shout out to them in order to alert them of this strange object hovering just behind them
and over their heads but as they did so this object immediately and suddenly
moved off quickly towards the Northeast making a soft Whistling noise and moving
behind the roof of a house and out of view so by the time anyone else looked
this object was already gone and the three Witnesses were unable to convince anyone about what they had seen at the
theater so this was a quick observation lasting about a half minute none of the
witnesses felt any fear nor did they experience anything unusual except the
wife Mrs X said that she did hear what she thought were strange voices quote
like Russian though she can't be sure if this was directly connected to her sighting or just a coincidence but she
thought it was oddd enough to be worth mentioning to the UFO researchers that
they contacted following this encounter what an unusual case that is I'm glad
there were three Witnesses uh it's a shame that the other people who were there didn't believe them but they had
each other they all agree on what they saw this old thin looking alien with a
beard which was apparently watching this play just as they had gone to do it's an
interesting aspect of UFO behavior these craft do sometimes seem to come down and just check out what people are doing and
that looks like what was going on in this case I think it's an important one which is why I included it in this
little collection and now we move to the next case cuz there's always another one and
I call this next one the artists and the aliens this case did get quite a bit of
attention when it occurred but it's virtually known today uh it occurred in
on December 28 1954 near Mendoza Argentina this was
along a lonely remote Highway late at night but it's an important case because
it does involve seven Witnesses all adults all of who agree upon what they
saw involves a landed UFO and humanoids and it's got some really interesting
aspects to it this next case comes from researcher Roberto Banks and was widely
published in a number of magazines and in at least one book it was around 3:30
a.m. again on December 28th 1954 as a group of seven people
including a concert performer a conductor by the name of Mr G and five
artists were all traveling by car along Route 143 to Mendoza
Argentina now suddenly the ahead of them alongside the road they noticed a
brilliant light and as they approached they were amazed to see that this light was actually a landed Flying Saucer
about 500 ft off the side of the road it was a brilliant blue light but not
blinding they were able to see it pretty clearly so amazed they stopped the car
and exited to get a better look in fact they walked right up to it through a little Vineyard stopping less than 150t
F feet away from this craft and they could now see this craft clearly they said it had the shape of two soup bowls
placed end to end the blue light they saw was coming from the edges as was
this weird foggy Mist they noticed no visible windows or doors but they did
immediately notice that standing next to this craft were two strange figures one
was standing straight up while the other was crouching down doing something to the ground they noticed that both of
these figures were dressed in a onepiece dark colored bodysuit with a hood and a
transparent face mask though they couldn't really see their faces as they watched a sort of sliding
door opened in the side of the craft and these two figures entered in a weird way
kind of lifting their feet as if walking on stairs or something though they didn't notice any
stairs so these figures entered into the craft the door closed almost immediately
this object rose up from the ground while the lights on the craft itself began to Blink on and off this really
frightened the witnesses and they rushed back to the road and watched as this craft began to do a series of sort of
choppy zigzag motions stoering stopping hovering moving at right angles so now
back in the car they took off down the road and we're surprised to see that this was actually beginning to pce their
vehicle would follow first on one side and then immediately blink over to the other side and sometimes actually above
the car but it moved so quickly that they didn't actually see it moving it was almost
instantaneous it would be on one side and then instantly on the other and this happened several times and it followed
them for a good 20 minutes until morning arrived all of the witnesses agreed on
these details and all agreed that they had encountered what they believe are ETS and a craft from beyond Earth that
must have been quite an experience driving along seeing this bright light ahead of you stopping the car getting
out and realizing you're looking at a landed Flying Saucer with humanoids right next to it they got a pretty good
view walking right up to it that's a shame that they were so frightened because there might have been
communication but I also find it fascinating fascinating that they got back back into their car and drove off
and what happens this UFO follows them for 20 minutes so this implies that the
ETS were absolutely aware they were being observed uh so I don't know exactly why
the UFO followed him we can only speculate but clearly it had no fear of
being seen and there was some interesting interaction there and that alone I think makes this case super
interesting and Now we move to another case this one's also really interesting
I like this one because of it's a longlasting encounter it involves
physiological reactions the whole family saw it and it really affected them
extremely profoundly I call this one a churchgoing alien and it occurred on
June 26 1962 in a very crowded area of Verona
Italy it's an amazing case with a very warm night on June 26
1962 as the paraza family was in their home located at 5 Via masal Longo in
Verona Italy now the family consisted of the Mother Maria peraga and her two children
Louisa and Roberto age 25 and 20 respectively and they were all sitting
in their living room kind of smoking cigarettes sitting by the open window which looked over the Santa Anastasia
church right across the street you can see it here then suddenly without
warning an enormous silvery disc appeared in the sky zigzagging back and
forth and downwards until it stopped right over the church Roberto saw it
first and shouted out look a flying saucer and all three watched in
amazement as this thing came down and then hovered right over the church and remained there for a long time almost an
hour finally they actually grew tired of watching it so they decided finally they
were just going to go to bed Roberto went to his own room he had a separate room Maria slept in a bed on the far
side of the living room but Louisa slept on a divon which was right next to the window overlooking the
church so it was around 3 3: a.m. that Louisa was suddenly awakened by a sense
of icy cold it actually woke her up making her teeth chatter and then
looking out the window she was confronted by an incredible sight and I'll just let Louisa describe it in her
own words and she says the temperature seemed to have dropped below zero such
cold and then I saw a green fluctuating light invade the whole room before I
could recover from my astonishment I saw up here two paces from my bed and in the
rectangular opening of the window an incorporeal being in human form but with
only the outlines hazily defined the rest of it was transparent it had an
enormous close shaven head although impa and maybe weight weightless I could
nevertheless see it gigantic with its huge legs and its huge hands EX ended
towards me as if it intended to carry me off it was motionless and only its hands
brushed me it had no particular odor so this being's hands actually
touched Louisa's face and this is when naturally she screamed in Terror waking
up both her mother and her brother her mother immediately looked to the window and saw this being and in fact it
shocked her so badly she fell out of bed in a dead faint
Roberto rushed from his room and came out in time to also see this entity glowing with green light and as they
watched this being began to recede it decreased in size finally becoming this
tiny little Green Dot then suddenly it winked out they said just like a TV set
being turned off however they did notice that the freezing cold persisted in the room for
some moments after this encounter now this was very traumatic for them in fact the trauma from it
persisted for months afterward and finally after 3 months the family decided they couldn't take it anymore
they actually moved from their home and into a cottage into the country that
case did get a lot of publicity I really feel for the witnesses because it did
affect them quite profoundly to the point where they actually ended up leaving their home and finding another
residence just goes to show this an encounter can affect you on so many
different levels that's clearly true in that case quite traumatic for the whole
family and now we move to the next case which is super interesting I call this one an appointment with humanoids this
involves an apparent C5 a human initiated encounter and it's so interesting
because the beings that these people saw might not have been ETS at all but something else entirely I think a lot of
stuff gets put under the UFO umbrella that might not necessarily belong there
or be categorized as extraterrestrials meaning biological beings from another planet but you can
make up your own mind about this case it's a multiple witness case certainly
very fascinating it occurred on October 29 1965 near vagaro Sweden and I think
you'll agree this is an important case this unusual humanoid encounter was originally researched by Sven Olaf
senson and it involves a fairly well-known couple by the name of stur and tured Johnson Ted works as a trans
medium and has actually entertained famous people in his home in Sweden such as Shirley mlan and Dennis weer but
before achieving Fame this couple did have a very unusual experience
was again on October 29 1965 when the wife tured received a
psychic message that she and her husband should travel to vagaro this is an area
south of Stockholm Sweden and this voice told her to be there at 10:00 now this
impressed her because this was not the first time she had received this message The Voice also told her to quote be
careful there is a power struggle on Earth but did not elaborate on what that
meant so I'll just let steuart describe in her own words what happened as she
says when we arrived at the place we were told to visit those entities were
already there but we did not observe them until we had parked the car it was not totally dark but Twilight we noticed
them first over the field and then they came very close to the car about 50 cm
we believe there were five or six between 1.25 to 1 .5 M which is 3 3 and 1/2 ft
tall and it store says they had large heads and Shining eyes the eyes were red
phosphorous the entities didn't walk but floated around in straight lines I wish
for all my life that another car would come but no one showed up after some
time the entities disappeared over the field and then it was like a saucer tried to land on the car our whole car
Shook and the r radio screamed in the back seat we took cover below the
dashboard so clearly they were both quite frightened they estimated that all of this lasted about 5 minutes but as
Stuart says it felt like an eternity they weren't able to get a very good look at the entities because they were
so frightened but they could see that they were humanoid in form meaning you know a head arms and legs but after
these beings left and the car stopped shaking the couple sat in the car car for a good while before finally going
home when they finally did reach home they were amazed to see that it was already early morning they both felt
like they had experienced some missing time but neither had any desire to undergo hypnotic regression to discover
what happened during this missing time now researcher hakan Blomquist
interviewed them in person and they discussed the possibility that these were spiritual entities of some kind
perhaps Elemental hakan speculated and in fact under trance store did explore this
possibility and seem to confirm this Theory saying that quote they are created by humans
themselves though so these might not be ETS as we would think of it or something
else entirely a really interesting case for sure given that there are two
witnesses this was a pretty long lasting encounter and they had apparent Miss
missing time which I have a lot of questions about because they had missing time and this was more of a spiritual
entity that they saw I mean that raises all kinds of implications it's an important case I
think in that regard alone now let's move to the next case
which I think is a really important case because although this is a single witness case it does involve some really
profound and undeniable physical evidence in the terms of Landing traces
and the witness does by all accounts seem to be absolutely sincere I call
this one the ETS by the hospital and it took place on September 14
1967 outside of bell Horizon Brazil it's a really interesting and unusual case
this case comes from Brazilian researcher Professor Holio B Al
the witness is a 16-year-old young man by the name of Fabio J denz it was around 1030 a.m. again on
September 14 1967 as Fabio was walking by the blea
hospital in Bella Horizon hoping to sell some metal window shutters now suddenly his attention was
drawn to a strange object shaped somewhat like a mushroom which was sitting in the middle of the field
now this was military recruiting week in the area so Fabio immediately assumed
that the object was associated with the military but he was curious so he walked up to it and became even more puzzled by
what he saw because it did not look military this object was basically Dome
shaped it had little round Port holes all around the circumference and rested on a central pillar which gave it sort
of mushroom appearance now he estim Ates that this was a pretty large craft 60 ft
wide brown in color and the craft itself was emitting flashes of red yellow and
blue lights from the bottom part of the Dome the central pillar was shiny black
about 9 ft wide and 6 feet high so pretty big suddenly Fabio heard this strange
creaking sound and what looked like a weird glass-like screen sort of came
down around the bottom Central section of this Dome and as he watched
immediately a dark door-like opening appeared at the base of the central pillar and out stepped two humanoid
figures this startled Fabio and he stepped back and immediately he heard a voice saying don't run away come back so
Fabio now found himself pretty much fa to face with these two unusual beings he
was about 15 ft away from them and one began to walk around the pillar
as if inspecting it while the other faced him and said in perfect Portuguese appear here tomorrow or we
will take your family so these figures appeared to be
six maybe seven feet tall with strong bodies according to Fabio they were
dressed from head to toe in a tight fitting jumpsuit very much like divers wear they wore a helmet with a dark
section over the mouth and nose no so he couldn't see that part of their face the
only skin visible was on their face and he said they seem to have sort of a greenish tint to their skin to very
large round widely set eyes with no visible whites to them all just black
they had these thick kind of triangular shaped eyebrows again could not see any mouth
or nose he did notice that one of them had an antenna like protrusion on his helmet but the other did not
he also noticed that they had very heavy Footwear which flattened the grass wherever they
stepped so by this time the figure that had was walking around the pillar had rejoined the first one and he was
carrying a device in his hand which Fabio interpreted to be a weapon of some kind the two figures then turned back
towards the door in the central pillar and entered into it the door closed the
glass-like screen that was surrounding the whole perimeter of the craft went back up
inside it making that Str same strange sound the door closed and the object
began to slowly and silently rise straight up at this point Fabio ran away
in fear he did turn around once just in time to see this object flying off at an
angle but still moving quite slowly so he kept running and turned back one more
time and by this time the object was no longer visible so he ran to the bus stop intending to
go straight home and tell his mother but instead decided to go directly to the police the police immediately alerted
UFO investigators and in less than 2 hours after the encounter they arrived
interviewed the witness firsthand and went to the scene of the incident and as
researcher Holio says and I quote searching around for some evidence or
other on the dried ground in the bone dry grass we perceived two small
depressions in the form of an arc of a circle lying a considerable distance from one another near one of them was a
slight depression shaped like the heel of a rather large shoe which Fabio reckoned was a footprint of one of the
individuals now they also did find a small quantity of scorched granular
material which had an unpleasant odor and this was submitted to analysis which
proved to be quite interesting because this granular material turned out to be
comprised of iron aluminum magnesium and
silica so not sure what that means but it's certainly not naturally occurring
in that area Fabio did return to the site the next day as instructed by the alleged
ETS unfortunately the craft did not show up what a bizarre case that is I can
could only imagine seeing a landed UFO and humanoids that close up in an area
that you know is fairly well populated such a shame more people didn't see this though I have to say That's Not Unusual
and UFOs and ETS seem to be able to control who sees them and who
doesn't uh and it's very possible other people did see it but simply didn't report it glad there were Landing traces
because that helps to authenticate the encounter such a shame the UFOs didn't show up the next day like they said they
would but even that's not super unusual all right now we move to the
next case this is another multiple witness case doesn't involve any real
physical evidence but certainly fascinating because it was a series of
events which culminated in a really unusual humanoid encounter um I call this one the rec
aliens it took place on SE in September of 1973 near alio
Portugal and this was another lonely Highway at night
encounter uh with a UFO and humanoids that were quite close to the car and
really unusually described humanoids as well that alone makes this case super
interesting this next astonishing case involves three Witnesses on a road trip near
again Alo Portugal the witnesses include Serge rero Lisboa age 38 his wife Maria
filero Costa Lisboa uh she's also 38 and their friend
marela Santos Costa who was 28 years old it was a clear night they had just
exited the city of Tua when they heard this weird strange buzzing noise coming
from outside their car and at the same time they saw this faint glow off to the
right so they decided to pull over to figure out what was going on and they
can now see that this light was actually a solid object a white glowing disc-shaped object it appeared to have a
transparent Dome on top which was illuminated with a red light it looked
to be metallic they estimate it was about 6 ft in diameter and maybe 1,000
ft High they wondered if it had been drawn to their car by the headlights because this was a pretty remote country
road now a bit nervous by the closeness of this object they got back into the car and continued driving and they had
just reached the town of alio when Serge noticed that the car seemed to be slowing down by itself they
were exiting the town and at the same time they heard and felt this weird
buzzing noise again and this is when this disc-shaped craft reappeared it seemed to be making a
rhythmic modulated buzzing the craft quickly disappeared but a few miles down the road they saw
this strange object ahead of them on the road uh it was kind of hard for Serge to
describe but he says it looks sort of like a cylindrical object bright green moving along at about 20 mph ahead of
them so Serge put on the brakes and while this was happening f and marela
noticed something else they saw two red flashes right alongside the left side of
the road and as they drove up to these red flashing lights they saw that these were
actually two short humanoids about 5T tall lying recumbent on their backs on
the road embankment both these humanoids wore a shiny silver kind of loose fitting
jumpsuit glove and a spherical helmet with a rectangular face plate and a 20in long
antenna on the top of their helmets and the red flashes were actually coming from the tips of these
antenna so they were driving at very low speed at this point and came right up alongside these two humanoids which were
by now only 6 fet away from their car and all three Witnesses saw them and
they were close enough that all three heard this very weird low gurgling
sound so they were pretty frightened Serge pressed on the
accelerator uh the car seemed very sluggish he pressed on the accelerator except it had a delayed effect the car
just wasn't moving in the speed it should be but as it moved forward they
were about to reach this strange cylindrical object ahead of them and this is when something very odd happened
the two humanoids Rose from the ground in a weird rigid vertical manner without
bending their arms or legs they just kind of almost levitated upwards at this
point the flashing red lights on their antenna went out the witnesses could now see that the two humanoids were wearing
strange backpacks which were attached to their jumpsuits and to the witness's amazement
these two figures rose up into the air and literally disappeared right over their
car they continued driving and as they reached the next town they considered stopping to inform the police about
their experience but decided against it as they knew that their story would be hard to
explain what a crazy case that is short little ETS all dressed up in their sort
of aluminum foil suits their helmets a little antenna on top really interesting
pretty much your classic humanoid encounter another very interesting aspect is how that encounter end ended
with the humanoids rising up in that weird way they did and basically just flying over the car and disappearing to
who knows where certainly it was an encounter that really impressed all
three Witnesses Now we move on to the next one this is an important case which
unfortunately wasn't professionally investigated but it's absolutely
interesting because it is a firsthand account this is not here say this comes directly from the witness I call this
one landing and humanoids in Boseman a lot of these encounters occur while
people are driving along a highway and that's what happened here uh this one
took place in summer of 1978 in Boseman monana and I like this case because the
witness describes what happened in his own words in pretty good detail so this
case comes from an anonymous gentleman known only as Bob who did report his experience to the UFOs sentinel.com
website and it's quite an interesting encounter which occurred in a lonely area of Boseman Montana and I'll just
let the witness describe what he experienced in his own words as he says
I was driving late at night in the summer of 1978 a few miles outside of Boseman and I noticed a bright light a
bit away from the road I decided to pull over and check it out thinking that it could be a fire that needed to be put
out back in those days we cared about things and if we saw potential danger we
would step in to take care of it if we could in this Spirit of communal good I
stopped the car and walked towards the light it was a UFO a hat-shaped UFO that
was standing on the ground on three legs around the parked UFO were three small
humanoid creatures they were small like children and had very long arms and big heads and
big black eyes the UFO had big rectangular panels on it and really
looked like a hat with a very thick narrow brim if you look at the picture I've drawn you get a good idea of what
it looked like I hid behind a rock not because I was Brave and wanted to see more but because I was afraid they would
see me I curled up behind the Rock in fear for my life after what felt like an
eternity probably about 10 minutes I I heard a hissing sound I peaked out from
behind the Rock and I saw that the hat-shaped UFO was rising up towards the sky it was completely gone after a few
seconds witnessing this UFO and these aliens was a defining moment for me I
started researching UFOs in my spare time and I've been a UFO Enthusiast ever
since UFOs are real and we are being visited by aliens I know this because I
saw my myself I've talked to many other people who have seen UFOs and they fall
in different categories within the categories they are similar the type of vessel matches
the type of alien there's probably a handful of alien civilizations visiting
us on a regular basis so that that's Tom's story he
posted his experience on the website in 2016 which was a full 38 years after his
encounter in an amazing case I think you'll agree and another example of how profoundly an encounter can affect a
witness uh the fact that it took him 38 years to report this encounter just goes
to show that and again I have to give kudos to the witness for reporting it
because most people don't I can only imagine how many encounters there must
be per very likely you know other people are seeing these things and corroborate
other people's encounters but they're just not reporting it it's such a shame I'm glad that this subject is now moving
into the mainstream and getting some legitimacy because it certainly deserves
it the only real reason I think people are skeptical is because we're all victims of this UFO coverup our
governments our military have spent an enormous amount of time money and energy
your tax dollars to make UFO Witnesses look like idiots Liars s on drugs
hallucinating and it's so unfortunate because there really shouldn't be any skepticism at all surrounding the
subject all the fear and disinformation and confusion uh it's such a shame because
this is a true subject there's no doubt about that there are enough cases that we can say for sure something is going
on you can argue till the cows come home about where these guys come from what
their agenda is and so forth but the fact is we do have enough evidence to
conclusively prove without a doubt in a court of law that UFOs are
real and now let's move to another case I like this one because it involves four
Witnesses very close-up encounter with the UFO and humanoids in a very urban
area uh during daylight hours I mean it's an undeniable case this next encounter took
place at 1441 Lawrence Avenue East in Toronto
onario and involves four Witnesses Elizabeth ngi who was only 11 years old
her mother and her two twin brothers zultan and tore they had just left their
apartment building and it was one of the twin boys who saw it first turning around and looking up he noticed a very
large oval-shaped craft with about 15 windows along one side hovering directly
over their apartment building I mean very low above it and he shouted out and
all four Witnesses turned around looked upward and stared an absolute amazement
at this clearly unusual craft and Elizabeth describes it in her own words
as she said it had Windows which were moving around the ship from right to left a ser of ET Shadows were walking
inside the ship about 30 of them like it was a school ship watching us there was
a red light on the bottom of the ship and a blue and a yellow light just under two windows it was silent suddenly it
shot up diagonally disappeared behind a cloud reappeared then Drew away becoming
smaller and smaller and was gone when it moved upward it looked like a disc the
UFO had sharp EDG it looked solid and was larger than a basketball held at arms length so this
was a pretty big craft and they estimate that they watched it for at least 5 minutes maybe as much as 10 when it
finally moved off the setting deeply impressed all of them and in fact it changed the course of Elizabeth's life
she became a huge believer in UFOs as she says I was very excited it was
unbelievable I told all my schoolmates and teach teachers later as an adult she
joined the Canadian UFO research Network and shared her experience with
investigators and her account was published in the journal it's quite an amazing case so admittedly that is a
very brief case a quick event but it's something that the witness remembered
and inspired her enough to actually join a UFO group and uh I mean I can only
imagine what a surprise it must be for people to look up see a UFO and even
more shocking see someone inside that craft looking down at you such an
amazing case and that's what happened in this next case which is perhaps my favorite in this little collection I
call this one the little boy in the UFO this one occurred on September 1st
in 1984 in Taka Natsu Japan this is a
single witness case but it was professionally investigated shortly after the incident and there is some
peripheral corroboration in terms of the mother of the main witness seeing a UFO
2 days after this initial encounter so that adds a little bit of credibility
and corroboration to it but it's such an amazing case it's really a bit different
than most and I think you'll find it super interesting it was 6:00 p.m. on the evening of September 1st 1984 at
6-year-old na nashimoto as you can see here and her friends were riding bikes
in the front of their apartment building located in takamatsu Japan now had just reached the Ed of the
edge of the yard by the fence when she noticed a large round glowing object
hovering at very low elevation over the rice field right in front of the building so she stopped biking and
stared at this object as it moved down and closer in a strange zigzag fashion
she did not tell her Playmates for whatever reason she was just consumed by looking at this object and as it came
closer it revealed itself to be a very large saucer with a ring of beautiful
colored lights around the circumference there was brilliant red blue yellow
orange and green lights which sh sh down beautifully onto the ground and as it
got close these lights all went out the object itself was now glowing orange and
it moved down until it was only a few meters above the rice field near the kindergarten building of a school in the
area low enough that she could see the plants swaying from the effects of this
object and by this point she was only about 75 ft away from it and she could
see that this object had four port holes the object it turns out had a remarkably
similar appearance to that described and purportedly photographed by contact D
George adamsky that's quite a controversial case but this is what she described it
was a very similar looking craft and as now stared in Fascination at this craft
she was amazed to see what she described as a handsome little boy appearing in
the second port hole from the left looking down and smiling widely at her
and in fact she was close enough to see the white teeth in his mouth and his now
says he had long hair pulled back from his face his hair reached his shoulders
it was golden was a round face was the same color as I now now spoke with researchers shortly
after this incident happened and said that the eyes on this little boy were round and big that he had a smaller than
normal Al nose small ears and a mouth that that was quote small and
Charming now she only saw his upper torso through the port hole but could
see that he was wearing a sort of shiny gray shirt with a v-neck and as this craft started to move
away now wanting to get closer to this craft raced on her bicycle across the
rice field and when she reached the end of this field she could still see this crab ra and the boy was looking out he
smiled down again at her through the port hole and this time raised his hand slowly Palm outward lowered it and
raised it slowly again this did allow now to see that his shirt did have long
sleeves and as she watched this craft began to rotate moving towards Mount
yashima hovering about 900 ft above the ocean it then flashed its light twice
and disappeared now estimates that the whole encounter lasted about 15
minutes and it was gone now she at first kept her en encounter a secret but two
days later on September 3rd her mother yumo announced that she had seen a
glowing red UFO while returning home from shopping this inspired now to tell
her parents what she had seen they were astonished as you might expect
but they believed her not only because of yumiko's sighting moments earlier but
because they knew their daughter to be honest and truthful now later apparently as a
result of this now's father became a student of George adamsky work and
became very interested in his contacts and information the investigator of the case
learned a pretty interesting detail about now the witness it turns out that this little girl was
displaying very unusual and strong psychic abilities she said she could see
oras she was experiencing telepathy and she also said that she recalled a past
life as a famous pacifist in the United States protesting against
Wars so this is a theme we see in a lot of UFO accounts to me one of the most
fascinating things about this case is the fact that the witness describes all these paranormal and psychic experiences
because that seems to be the rule with contactees rather than the exception
it's also interesting and that it does come from Japan we don't hear a whole lot about cases coming from Japan but
they're definitely there I've said it many times I think if you dig deep
enough you'll find that every location on this planet has been visited and has
a long Rich history of UFO encounters again it's because most
people simply don't report it and the witness in this case actually didn't report it and probably wouldn't have had
her mother herself not seen a UFO uh makes me wonder about that if
that was a coincidence or synchronicity or intentional of course impossible to say
but certainly an interesting case and now we move to another real really
interesting case I like this one because this is a daylight encounter it occurred
in a very urban area there are two witnesses I call this one The Smiling
aliens and this occurred in July of 1992 near Los Angeles
California I find this super amazing because actually there was a huge wave
of sightings going on throughout the summer of 1992
uh I investigated 20 30 40 cases in that time period alone so I'm going to add
this one to it and I think that is what brings a new level of corroboration
certainly or credibility to this otherwise unsubstantiated case which as
far as I know wasn't professionally investigated but was reported to the
website UFO evidence. Org the main witness in this case is a young man by
the name of Ruben Taylor and he and his mother were driving along the Hollywood
101 freeway by Echo Park so it was the mother who first saw
the craft and called Ruben's attention to it uh as she kind of dipped her head
and covered her face when she saw this but he immediately looked outside in the direction to the right that she had
pointed and saw what he thought at first was the world's biggest ferris wheel
which was sitting about 100 ft off the ground in a horizontal position he said
it was approximately 300 ft in diameter and beautiful this Golden
Bronze color uh with a glare that stretched out at least 50 to 100 ft
around it and as he watched it began to maneuver around and he realized this was
actually more of a saucer shaped object and he felt a quote great surge of power
and this incredible connection to this object as it began to approach closer
and when it did he was amazed cuz he could now see in detail numerous human
looking figures looking down at him smiling from behind this Center ring of
Windows he also saw what looked to him kind of like writing on the top of the craft which reminded him of perhaps
Hebrew or ancient egyp Ian hieroglyphs now he only saw this for a few moments when suddenly as quickly as
it had appeared this craft went straight up and disappeared into space some
really interesting details to that case the fact that this witness felt this surge of energy I found that fascinating
the fact that it was so close up these ETS looking down and smiling at you can
you imagine but yeah it was during this time that I was investigating a wave of
sightings just a few miles away involving the entire range of UFO
activity from simple sightings from cars being chased on the highway Landings people being pulled on board I ended up
writing a whole book about this called UFOs over to panga Canyon and this case
seems to be a part of this whole complex of UFO encounters that were going on in
that area at that time an amazing case and now we move to the last one of this
dozen cases and this one is a super interesting case which I call the alien
tour bus this occurred in November of 2009 fairly recently in schwind
Germany uh also what's interesting about this case is this witness saw this UFO
very close up of course saw humanoids through the window and it affected him emot Al quite
profoundly it is a brief case but super interesting this case comes from elbron
Van ludger and appeared in the German publication mysterious lights and
objects in the sky the witness is an anonymous gentleman and he was in his
home in schwind Germany one evening in November of
2009 it was around 11:00 p.m. and he looked out his window and he saw this
weird object hovering about one 150 ft high and 300 ft away and it was big he
says it was about the size and shape of a large bus and was remaining stationary in the sky he could see trails of White
Steam kind of running downward from this object as if the air had liquefied from
the extreme temperature of this object this object he said had three large
squarish Port holes running along the side which was visible to the witness more shocking however was that he could
see figures staring back at him from these Port holes now as he watched this
object became briefly invisible and after a few seconds reappeared and this
happened again disappearing and reappearing and then again this repeated a total of about 8 to 10 times this
object blinking in and out from view then suddenly this object flew very
quickly away was at this point that he realized he was seeing something incredibly unusual
and he says he be became hysterical with confusion and fear and he actually
screamed out loud badly scaring his own children who were in the apartment the
whole experience was quite short lasting no more than 3 minutes but was certainly
long enough to convince the witness that he had seen a genuine UFO and its
occupants staring down back at him him some very interesting details in that
case does make me wonder if these were just ETS coming down sort of a to visit
Earth as a tourist attraction hard to say for sure I mean we don't know they could have been coming down and picking
up someone on board and doing whatever it is they do but we have no evidence of
that this just appears to be a close encounter with a UFO involving humanoids
there are some interesting details with the Mist coming off of this craft that is something we see quite a bit which I
think speaks towards the extreme temperatures that are probably surrounding these craft I also found it
interesting how the craft kept blinking out and coming back we do see that quite a bit which speaks to I think how these
craft might operate how they travel Interstellar distances or their
interdimensional so to speak uh but yeah each case adds to our knowledge of
what's going on here and I think it's important that we take these cases
seriously because there are so many of them all right well that's it for today
I really want to thank you for watching this is you know a really important
subject I don't think people realize just how many cases there are it's not
you know in the thousands or even tens of thousands we're approaching honestly if you were to look at all the databases
all over the world close to a million documented reported cases and when you
consider that maybe one in a hundred people report their encounter in any way
well you can see how common this might actually be which just goes to show why there are so many humanoid reports it's
undeniable again you can argue all you want about what these things are or where they come from or why nether here
but the fact is this is happening and that alone is Monumental and I think it's time we pay
attention to this subject at some point this cover up has got to end the truth
will come out because I've said this before truth can be hidden can be
altered you can cover it up or lie about it but you can never destroy it truth
takes care of itself truth is truth and sooner or later it's gonna come out and
I hope it's sooner I really do but we will see I don't think our governments are going to do it it's really up to
us so that's it for today I really want to thank you for watching I truly
appreciate it it's because of you I do this research so thank you thank you thank you and until next time keep
watching those Skies there's stuff up there keep searching for the truth and
we'll find it keep asking those hard questions and most important of all keep having fun and I will see you next week
