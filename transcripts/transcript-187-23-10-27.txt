EXCEPTIONAL EXTRATERRESTRRIAL ENCOUNTERS: TEN TRUE CASES
Oct 27, 2023

Summary:
Oct 27, 2023
Almost all UFO encounters are interesting, but some are exceptionally interesting. This is especially true with cases involving landed UFOs and extensive interactions with humanoids. This video presents ten exceptionally strange cases with bizarre or unique aspects. These ten cases (coming from across the world) contain powerful evidence for the reality of the alien presence on our planet, including landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more.

“IT’S NOT HUMAN!” Around 8:00 pm on Aug 23, 1967, two 15-year-olds (Erik & Inga) were walking near their home in Kolmarden, Sweden, and saw a glowing red craft in the sky, then land near them. Feeling like they were being watched, they fled. Moments later, they came face-to-face with a weird humanoid. It held an odd device in its hand and pointed it at them. The children ran in fear. Afterwards, landing traces were found.

ALIEN CAR MECHANICS? At 3:00 am on Apr 27, 1969, Mr. NN was driving south of Slagelse, Denmark when he had a feeling he was being watched. Suddenly a UFO appeared, zoomed towards his car and landed. His car engine and lights died. Four tiny ETs exited the craft and surrounded his car. Then a tube-like device extruded from the craft and snaked towards his car. After the craft left, landing traces proved the encounter.

UFOS INVADE IOWA FARM. In 1969, researcher Glenn McWayne was contacted by an electrical lineman about strange burned circles of vegetation in Clayton County, Iowa. In the center of the activity was a rural farmhouse. The family reported an ongoing series of sightings, landings, and even face-to-face meetings with humanoids. One of the kids saw a humanoid, and watched it remove its helmet and stare right at him.

THE ET IN THE CAGE. One summer morning in 1971, an anonymous nurse from Iowa City, Iowa was drove to work and saw a cage-like object dangling in the sky. To her shock, a figure in a white, thick, overall stared down at her from the cage. Unknown to her, many people in the area also saw the humanoid. Reports came into the local police station who began an investigation, but were unable to identify it.

THE SILVER-SUITED ALIENS. On the evening of Oct 22, 1973, Debbie Carne drove along a road outside of Hartford, Indiana when she saw two short silver-clad figures cross the road in front of her. Minutes later, Mr. & Mrs. Donathan drove along the same road and came upon the same entities. They reported them to the police. Gary Flatter was at the station and went with another officer to investigate, and saw the ETs himself.

THE ET IN THE GRAVEL PIT. At 2:00 pm on Mar 24, 1977, “Dan” walked by a gravel pit near his home by Wildwood Lake in Ontario, Canada when he felt a blast of heat. Looking down, he saw a strange metallic craft. Shortly later, he saw it again. This time, he approached and knocked on it. Then a strange-looking humanoid exited and stared right at him. When it moved toward him, Dan fled. But his encounters weren’t over yet.

ASSAULTED BY ALIENS. On Nov 24, 1978, Angelo D’Ambrose was collecting firewood near his home in Gallio, Italy when he saw two strange humanoids standing only three feet away. One of them lunged forward and tried to grab his woodcutting tool. After three failed attempts, the ETs fled. Angelo chased them, and was amazed to come upon a flying saucer., and watched as it departed. Nearby, other people also saw the UFO.

A WARNING FOR ALL HUMANITY. In 1979, Mr. DL of Edinburgh, Scotland was distressed to start hearing voices in his head calling his name. A visit to the doctor brought no relief. Later, on the evening of Feb 16, 1980, events came to a climax when Mr. DL saw a UFO hover. Suddenly he was struck by a beam of light, then was approached by three ETs. One approached him and issued a dire warning for all humanity.

THE PEEPING TOM ET. One evening in Mar of 1982, “Mary,” was taking a bath in her home in Hespeler, Canada, and saw a strange humanoid silhouette peer into her bathroom window. Then it happened again. When it happened a third time, there were two of them. Shortly later, she was shocked to see a UFO land in her backyard. Soon she would have another encounter!

“THEY WEREN’T HUMAN.” On the evening of Jul 21, 2001, “Jeff” was playing with his cousins near his grandmother’s home in rural Geneva, Pennsylvania. Suddenly the noticed a blue light in the woods. Going to investigate, he was shocked to come upon a landed UFO and two humanoids, who were picking up things off the ground. One of the ETs looked at him, and then the other.

When a person has an extensive face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial, they are forever changed. With so many cases occurring all over the world, supported by multiple eyewitness testimonies and physical evidence, the ET presence can no longer be denied, ignored, or covered up. The time has come to accept the truth of extraterrestrial visitation.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode is called exceptional extraterrestrial encounters 10 true cases so 
what makes these cases exceptional well several things I think they all involve humanoids they're 
all for the most part except perhaps one quite extensive encounters with a lot of interaction 
between UFOs and the witnesses most of them all but two involve multiple Witnesses over half of 
them involve some pretty compelling physical evidence a wide variety of evidence actually 
the same kind we often hear in UFO cases and by that I mean Landing traces electromagnetic 
effects physiological or medical effects animal reactions these sort of things which is important 
because this gives additional credibility to each case some of these involve really high caliber 
Witnesses police officers nurses this sort of thing these cases have occurred all over the 
world I love covering cases from across the planet because this shows that ETS show no discrimination 
and who they visit they're visiting all over the planet in fact I think location on this 
planet probably has a long and Rich history of UFO encounters if you dig hard enough also these 
cases are taking place over a period of decades in this collection of 10 encounters they begin 
in the 1960s all the way up to the 2000s so that's quite a stretch of time and what I also like about 
these cases is we see a wide variety of humanoid types all humanoid pretty much very much like us 
more like us than different I think but yeah many different types of humanoids certainly not just 
Grays and these cases are somewhat unusual I think each of them have something to contribute to our 
understanding of extraterrestrial visitations which is why I included them in this list so a 
lot of cases let's just get started and the first case I'd like to talk about I call it's not human 
of course this is a direct quote from the main witness this case took place in kardin Sweden 
actually on August 23rd 1967 I like this case for a number of reasons it's got multiple witnesses as 
I said it's quite extensive it actually took place over a period of days and some really 
interesting and unusual physical evidence not to mention a very unusual ual looking ET who is 
holding a very unusual instrument in his hands this case comes from researcher Sven Shin from 
Sweden that involves two 15-year-old teenagers a boy and a girl who were boy and girlfriend other 
names are Eric and Inga though I believe these might be pseudonyms but it was around 8:00 p.m. 
again on August 23rd 1967 when Eric and Inga were walking on a small Road near an industrial lot not 
far from their homes in Karden when they saw a red glowing object drop from the sky and actually land 
near the edge of the woods now this this object was too bright to really make out a shape they did 
notice it was totally silent and realizing that it was quite strange they fled actually getting 
off the road and taking a shortcut towards their home and they were nearly home and decided to 
go back on the road at this point they saw the object again they could see it moving back and 
forth over the nearby woods now they were walking by a little cabin and as they approached it they 
saw that it was empty and padlocked but inside through a window they saw unusual yellow lights 
floating around inside and at the same time they saw this weird cone of light kind of rising up 
from the ground and also heard weird noises which they described as quote short silent thumps on a 
plank so this was starting to get them a little bit frightened because meanwhile this glowing red 
object reappeared and now changed to White moved over a nearby cornfield and landed at this point 
they both got a very creepy sensation and felt like somebody or something was watching them and 
so they ran home turned out nobody was home at the time so they went next door to where their sisters 
lived but as soon as they arrived before they even got inside a shining object dropped down from the 
sky and actually hung in the air in front of them about 10 ft in front of them and only 13 ft high 
they said it was was round and had a very bright light in the center very bright like an electrical 
torch so as soon as that object appeared they heard this high-pitched loud and piercing 
Whistling noise coming from a nearby Brook at the same time they heard footsteps and this was 
when they turned and saw a strange humanoid which made this huge leaping jump out of the bushes next 
to the house in fact Eric said that this humanoid looked like it was actually flying and it came to 
a landing and stopped about 34 ft away and boy was it weird looking this humanoid they said was just 
over 4T tall quite short it wore dark skintight clothing they couldn't really see its face at this 
point as it was bent forward and down and the girl thinking this might be a friend actually walked 
towards the figure but then the figure raised its head and arms moving with this weird sort of jerky 
unsteady trembling movements but at the same time they got a sense that it had a lot of strength and 
this is when they both got a really good look at it they said its head was disproportionately 
large far too large for its body and was covered by something dark they couldn't say whether this 
was hair or some kind of hood but whatever was on its head kind of went down over the forehead sort 
of with a V between the eyes much like a Widow's Peak they did see that it had huge dark eyes which 
seemed to penetrate them it was looking right at them at this point they said it looked humanish 
except where its eyes and nose were all they saw was kind of an X they said its arms and legs were 
really quite thin and its legs looked bowlegged short little legs and they said again it seemed 
to be wearing dark coveralls with a belt around the waist but around its ankles they saw cables 
or tubes or wires something that Shone with an intensely bright white light and so at this point 
Eric shouted out look out it's not human and he grabbed Inga and pulled her back and this is when 
they saw that this figure was actually holding a very strange instrument in its hands they said 
this instrument looked kind of like a short tube but it had a box shape at the rear end and judging 
from the way this being held it with both his hands this object was very heavy they thought 
it might be a weapon because they could see this gleaming quote Arc of light along next to the tube 
section and they became frightened because this figure was pointing this tool right at them so at 
this point they fled to the house rushed inside the girl's sisters and other family me Members 
confirmed that the teenagers were very badly sh Shook Up frightened and they tried to calm him 
down the teenagers explained what happened they had a really difficult time doing that because this encounter really traumatized them but apparently it wasn't over yet because a few days 
later they did find some very interesting physical evidence directly related to this encounter there 
were some apple trees at the location of the humanoid encounter they found some apples that 
were strangely split in half apparently not by a knife one half of an apple had small evenly 
spaced Crescent marks the other was covered with this strange smelling slime now they also found 
small three-toed footprints in the area which were about 6 in long and also out in the field where 
the craft had landed and other strange marks perhaps from the tool itself but more events 
were in progress it was about 2 days following the encounter that a sister of the girl says that she 
saw a very bright light shining into the house at night and heard steps kind of like you know 
footsteps outside the house and other noises and in the morning they heard found that two 
Shutters on the house had been broken loose from the windows so hard to relate that directly to the 
prior encounter but they thought it was strange and yeah again the children were so frightened 
by The Experience they had difficulty relating the details to not only the their family but the 
investigators as well and their family said they were in shock for days following this incident 
and actually refused to go outside at night what a strange case I think it's so interesting how 
profoundly the Witnesses are affected one of the really interesting things in this case again is 
that weird instrument the ET was holding also how it was apparently there for the apple orchard hard 
to say for sure but considering that some of the physical evidence did affect the apples themselves 
it certainly shows that the ET was interested in the apples I will say that there is a large 
Zoo nearby A wilderness preserve so that could could be a factor here there's no direct evidence 
of that but I think it's worth knowing a really interesting case and here's the next one I'd like 
to talk about I call this one alien car mechanic I can't prove that that's why the ETS were here 
but they certainly did seem to be interested in the main Witnesses car this is one of the 
few cases in this collection which does involve a single witness but it's an important case because 
as we shall see it involves some really profound electromagnetic effects as well as some physical 
evidence in terms of Landing traces and the ETS were not only unusual looking they behaved in 
very unusual ways the witness in this case is known only as Mr NN those are his initials he 
wants to be anonymous and it was about 3:00 a.m. on April 27 196 69 in slagel Denmark when he was 
driving between the towns of slagel and nved and he was about 9 miles south of slagel and had just 
driven past a very famous landmark it's called the Gilden home Manor House pictured here so he's 
just driving past that and the woods surrounding this very well-known manor house when he had a 
strange feeling of being watched and this is when he immediately noticed a brilliant white circular 
object which was quite off in the distance but immediately zoomed towards his car in the space 
of about three or 4 seconds next thing he knows it stops right next to him the engine of his car 
promptly shut off the headlights went out he just managed to pull over to the side of the road but 
this object was now less than than 20 ft away from him ahead of him on the road and this is the exact 
spot and he saw instantly at this point that it was a quote Flying Saucer he estimated that it was 
about 27 ft wide 18 ft high and he described it as looking like two bowls placed end to end with 
sort of a flat section around the perimeter a band and on top of this was a small Dome with a bright 
stripe around it he said the bottom Bowl section had three glowing Port holes the craft itself 
looked metallic was sort of gray green in Co color and he said it was hovering about 9 ft above the 
ground and as he watched three Landing legs slid out from underneath towards the ground and as they 
touched the ground as this object actually landed a wide cylindrical tube came down down from the 
very center of the bottom of the object an opening appeared in this tube and out stepped for small 
entities one after the other and all of them began to move towards his car now Mr NN said that he 
felt no fear at this point and he had actually been thinking of leaving his car to investigate more closely but seeing these little men coming towards him he decided it was more prudent to 
stay inside the car and as he watched these little men moved towards his car with movements that he 
described as slow and graceful kind of reminding him of divers walking on the bottom of the ocean 
he said they were all dressed identically in shiny green overalls Each of which had three dark 
vertical stripes on the center of their chests the center stripe was a little bit longer than the two 
on either side but two of these these little men were carrying what looked to him like long slender 
lanterns so these were quite short figures each about 3 feet tall he could see their faces he said 
they looked largely human but their features were sort of flattened against their face and he could 
see their mouths moving but heard no voices what he did hear was a loud humming sort of electrical 
sound so he's watching all of this with absolute amazement when a long thick cable slid out of the 
lower part of the object and moved towards his car and it stopped he said about 6 feet from his car 
but close enough for him to see that this cable had a weird sort of square screen with a round 
glowing White Lens fixed to the end of it the end that was kind of closest to his car so it looks 
like it's some sort of examination device hard to say for sure but these four beings next walked 
towards his car and surrounded it and the two that were carrying these Lantern like devices moved to 
the left side of his car and placed these devices at various spots on the car itself apparently 
inspecting his car so after doing this for just a few moments the four little guys returned to 
the underside of The Craft entered the cylinder which retracted along with the cable and then the 
landing legs the craft then moved quickly upwards and disappeared to the Southwest so afterwards the 
main witness's car Mr NN started right back up the headlights came back on and he noticed that 
his watch would appar had apparently stopped now was running again but was exactly 4 minutes slow 
which apparently indicated that this entire event lasted 4 minutes so now that this craft was gone 
he got out of his car he immediately smelled a strange odor which was not described but he did 
see three holes on the ground which he said were hot and later in an inspection of the area where 
this craft landed showed that the vegetation was very slow to grow so different types of Landing 
traces for me one of the takeaways from that case is if you're driving on a remote Highway 
late at night be prepared for a UFO encounter because there does seem to be a lot of cases that 
fit that category it's certainly an interesting case on a number of levels considering the weird 
electromagnetic effects and the landing traces as well and we move on to the next case which 
I call UFOs invade Iowa farm this occurred over a per per of years actually 1969 1970 probably 
more than that but at least that this is in Clayton County Iowa a pretty remote Farmhouse 
area lots of woods uh streams Fields UFOs do seem to be attracted to Farms that's one of 
the things I like about this case but what's super interesting about this case is it has some really 
extraordinary Landing trace evidence and it's a complicated series of events of course involving 
multiple Witnesses and humanoids as well this case came very close to not being known at all uh but 
was investigated by a professional researcher Mr Glenn mcne and again involves multiple Witnesses 
and a complicated series of events surrounding a rural Iowa Farmhouse now the case first came to 
Glenn's attention when an electrical Cole linan reported that he found a series of burnt circles 
on the ground not far from the power lines near this particular Farmhouse so Glenn MCW inspected 
these circles and then contacted the owner of the farm a Mr sh and found out that he was a former 
military officer who worked with missiles now a farmer and this farmer said that yes quote odd 
thing had been occurring Around The Farmhouse since 1969 up through 1970 uh his family and 
several of their neighbors kept seeing these glowing red objects streaking across the sky 
and stopping on a dime and coming in for a landing sometimes in the forest sometimes in the fields in 
the area and sometimes directly in their own corn fields or whatever crop they were growing and in 
fact it was an early spring of 1969 when Mr sh's children were outside they saw a spherical red 
object hovering over the power lines not far from their barn and livestock pens so one of 
the boys hid behind the corner of the barn and watched from that perspective while another of 
the boys climbed a tree to get a clearer look and while they watched this object which wasn't 
that far away actually emitted a red beam of light striking first one boy and then the other now one 
of the boys fled in fear while the other watched this object rise up move along the power lines and 
land behind a nearby Grove of trees uh he told his father and the next day they went there and found 
a circular burned spot and impressions in the soil so that's just one event I mean this kept 
occurring over the next two years over and over again these objects would appear very low level 
usually bright red and land leaving these big circular burn marks strangely the UFOs almost 
always landed near the farm after about 5:00 p.m. they would always appear at a very low elevation 
and then would lower themselves to the ground and before long there were literally dozens of 
the these burn circles in the area all around this one particular farm so the researcher Glenn MCW 
again went to this farm and observed the circles himself and as he says in his own words and I 
quote I certainly had an eerie feeling as I walked among dozens of burned circular areas on this Farm 
it is almost as if some alien Air Force might be using this Farm as an informal Landing base in my 
opinion if a mysterious someone did not want to be observed by a lot of people the area in which 
the sh Farm is located would be a perfect spot to conduct secret activities it is a heavily wooded 
area and a river runs through the farm there's also a large cave in the area so Glenn interviewed 
the whole family and he learned that the boys had not only seen the UFOs they had seen the actual 
UFO occupants on a number of occasions and on one occasion had a very close encounter with them one 
of the boys was watching as this glowing red spherical craft landed in the pasture near the 
barn and he hid in the barn and watched it and this little humanoid came right out and according 
to the boy this euphona not was quite short about 3 3T tall and I'll just quote the witness directly 
as he told Glenn MCU and again I quote he was dressed from head to toe in a white space suit 
it looked a lot like the suits our astronauts wear he was just wearing this tight fitting 
white suit that covered his hands and feet as well as his body and of course he wore a helmet it was 
yellowish brown colored and it seemed too big for his little body his arms were awfully long they 
hung past his knees so this witness did make a point of saying that the head was quite large and 
per said that to Glenn the investigator perhaps his head is so large because he has all those 
brains which he would need to be able to come from another planet I thought that was a kind of a cute 
observation but the witness did say that this et's hands looked normal he said the feet feet 
were different instead of boots the ET was walking on what looked to him like two prongs but then he 
watched it something really amazing happened and again I will just let the witness describe in his 
own words what he saw as he says the wildest thing was when he took off his helmet and looked at me 
his head was a light real pale green and his head was completely bald no hair at all his eyes were 
real big but his nose and mouth were nothing but little slits he didn't really have any kind of 
expression at all just blank he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand you know like someone 
who has been working hard and sweating then he got back into the shiny ball I suppose it was 
a flying saucer and it took off so that's just one of several humanoid Encounters this family 
had and again the encounters became so numerous that at some point the family became somewhat 
used to them it was kind of their new normal and they just learned to live with it there's a lot 
to learn from that case I think once again we see ETS being very attracted to farmhouses I love this 
case because the family had so many encounters they actually got used to it and kind of took it 
in stride and it's a complicated case in that it was ongoing for such a long time and with so many 
land in traces that alone makes it important but also an important case because it was very well 
researched by a professional investigator so a lot to learn from that case for sure and now we move 
to our next case which I call the ET in the cage Yes you heard me right this is quite a bizarre 
and unusual case however it does involve multiple Witnesses who did not know each other the primary 
witness is a good Observer she's a professional a nurse police got involved in this case as well 
which brings a level of credibility to it this one took place in the summer of 1971 in Iowa City Iowa 
and I think you'll find it quite interesting and unusual this case comes from researcher Brad Steiger very well known the author of many books on UFOs and again this involves multiple 
Witnesses the first witness is an anonymous nurse in her early 50s who worked at a major 
Hospital in Iowa City and she was driving to work around dawn again one Summer Morning in 1971 and 
looking up saw something she couldn't believe a small cage was suspended by a line a rope of some 
kind leading High into the sky now apparently she couldn't see what was holding this cage up but it 
was really the cage that held her attention she said it was egg-shaped with vertical bars quite 
small just enough to hold a full grown person and as she drove closer to it she saw that in fact 
this cage was occupied inside of it was a humanoid figure but not normal it was dressed in a strange 
shining form-fitting one piece suit now it was too high up for her to see see any facial features but 
she could see that whoever this was he was gazing intently downwards she said he had a very thick 
chest very thick arms and legs much thicker than any human being and she said while its suit was 
bright the facial area was quite dark she could see that whoever it was he was moving around and 
she did have the distinct impression that it was looking down right at her so she drove to 
work shared her experiences with her coworker and her later her family and her son-in-law 
hearing this uh actually started talking about it to other people and this led to Brad stiger 
hearing about it and Brad Stager coordinated with one of his correspondents in the area who began an 
investigation and they learned that there were in fact other Witnesses this investigator discovered 
that a newspaper delivery boy in the same area at the same time also saw apparently this same 
dangling cage with this weird humanoid figure inside it provided the same description and so 
did another witness a laundry delivery man who again described the same details all of these 
Witnesses were out early uh due to their jobs and apparently saw the same exact thing so the 
main investigator actually contacted the police and learned that they had in fact received a few 
calls from other people reported the same thing and they made quote extensive efforts to identify 
this man in this cage actually calling airports checking on any local helicopter activity but they 
got no leads they were unable to come up with any explanation as to what this was interestingly the 
nurse herself said that she had previously been not only skeptical of UFOs but had ridiculed the 
subject needless to say she has changed her mind I love it when a skeptic has an introduction to the 
UFO phenomena and is basically forced to change their mind that's kind of what happened to me so 
I feel for the primary witness the nurse in this case but the fact is this is a real phenomenon the 
evidence is over overwhelming and when there's a case involving multiple Witnesses who don't know each other and are all reporting the same thing in the same area at the same time I think it behooves 
us to take a closer look at this and it's hard to explain this way as anything other than what 
it is an amazing case and now we move to the next case I call this one the silver suited aliens this 
case got a lot of attention from UFO researchers actually you may have heard of it I don't know but 
it's certainly worth knowing about this one took place in Hartford Indiana over a period of several 
hours October 22nd through October 23rd and what I like about this case is again it involves multiple 
Witnesses and also some extraordinary physical evidence as well also the ETS are very unusual 
and they behaved in ways that are quite weird this is an amazing series of very well documented 
strange humanoid sightings that were apparently part of the massive wave of humanoid sightings 
that took place in late 1973 which is often called by researchers the year of the humanoids because 
there was a lot of humanoid sightings for whatever reason at the end of 1973 now the first WI was 
Debbie Kar who was driving in the Hartford Indiana area when she saw two silver suited figures each 
about 4 feet tall she said slowly crossing the road in front of her and as she drove by them 
she said they emitted a loud noise and kind of raised their arms which she interpreted as an 
attempt to frighten her I don't think so giving what the next Witnesses described uh which which 
was also involved these figures raising their arms apparently a part of a part of how they were just 
moving because it was only 15 minutes later now it's around 9:45 p.m. when Mr Dwayne Donathan and 
his wife Donna saw apparently these same figures in the same area Highway 9 they gave the same 
sort of description saying that there were these two figures wearing bright silver suits the most 
unusual Fe was that they had these sort of boxlike feet almost as if they were wearing shoe boxes 
they moved in a weird clumsy sort of flopping manner uh apparently in an attempt to avoid uh 
the Donathan car and I'll just quote Mrs Donathan uh the main witness because her husband didn't see 
them that well but as she says and I quote we were coming home from visiting my mother and I 
was driving Dwayne my husband held the baby and we were just about a block from home a I rounded 
a slight curve and a small hill and there in the road we saw what I thought might be a reflection 
from a farm tractor in the road I slowed down and could see what looked like two kids about 4T tall 
moving in the road I stopped the car approximately 30 ft distance and with the headlights shining on 
them I decided it couldn't be kids this time of night in the road with me coming at them in a car 
they looked confused they would hop in the air their feet would come up slowly one at a time 
and their arms would flop funny they moved slower than humans do and their feet and arms would go up 
funny their feet came off the ground easily they were a bright silver the husband also saw them 
briefly not for not as long a time as his wife wife but he said it looked almost like they were 
dancing in the road both of them were impressed by the weird shape of their box-like feet but seeing 
them Mrs Donathan screamed out oh my God and she accelerated the car and swerved around them um she 
was pretty much panicked at this point she drove a few blocks and pulled over to let Dwayne drive 
and he insisted on turning around and going back and making sure that these were not children cuz 
he wanted to give them a scolding if they were so they returned to this area to see if they could see these beings they didn't but they did see some weird lights kind of moving in a snake-like 
pattern over a nearby cornfield they returned home Mrs Donathan was so upset that she was kind of in 
shock and they came very close to calling the doctor but she was able to calm down and they 
called the police and this led to more witnesses because it was later that night technically it's 
now October 23rd because it's just past midnight when truck driver and gas station owner Gary Leroy 
flatter heard about the Donathan sighting because as it turned out his friend was a police officer 
and he was there when the call came in so Gary went to investigate he and the other officer in 
separate cars the other officer was in another area he didn't see anything but Gary did he was 
driving 1 mile south of the above sighting heading south on road 300 and he turned to the East and he 
saw something really unusual he said he saw six or seven rabbits scaring across the road 
as if avoiding something followed immediately by a raccoon and then a posum so a bunch of animals 
running across the road including several cats as well so it was clear to him that something 
was scaring them they were running away from something and looking to where they were running 
from this is when he saw apparently these same two figures that the Donathan saw these figures were 
now standing in this field about 75 ft away from him he said they were glowing brightly in these 
silvery metallic outfits and they turned his their backs to his headlights and his description is the 
same as the other Witnesses he said they were about 4 feet tall wearing tight fitting silver 
suits that looked quote halfway between galvanized sheet metal and a mirror so very bright and in 
fact he turned his Spotlight on them which he said they did not seem to like but the glare from 
their suits was so strong he couldn't get a good look at him they didn't like it so he turned off 
his Spotlight and this is when he s got a really close look at him he probably got a closer look 
than any other Witnesses and he also remarked on the huge square blocks that were on their feet 
he said they had egg-shaped heads and were wearing what looked like gas masks with hoses running down 
to their chests and like the other Witnesses he said they moved very strangely kind of bouncing 
in slow motion in the air with their arms flopping up and down kind of like they were quote skipping 
rope and he said they seemed to float away as if they had engines in their shoes kind of like 
a helicopter is how he described it and it was during this time he did hear a high pitched sound 
but as Gary flatter says in his own words they just flew off in the dark and I couldn't find 
them with my Spotlight I did see some strange strange red Trace like streaks coming down 
and that was all so he returned the next day with Deputy Ed Townson Dwayne Donathan and himself and 
they found a total of seven Footprints and this is weird because these Footprints were each about 34s 
of an inches deep three Ines across with a stride of somewhere between 12 and 18 inches but what was 
so weird and amazing is the ground was hard enough that they themselves the witnesses could were not 
leaving any Footprints or imprints which meant that these beings must have been of considerable 
weight that is such an interesting case I don't know what the ETS were doing in the middle of 
the road over and over again but I like this case because it's got some very weird animal reaction 
evidence Landing traces that are very hard to explain multiple independent Witnesses of High 
Caliber it's a very interesting case and we know exactly where it occurred which also I think makes 
it even more fascinating and here is another case there's always another case I mean you can dismiss 
one but there's another to take its place and this one I call the ET in the Gravel Pit this is 
a really interesting case which took place on May 24 1977 in Canada actually near Wildwood Lake this 
is in St Mary's area fair view of Ontario Canada and while there's only one witness to the actual 
humanoid it does involve multiple Witnesses and it took place in a very unusual area in terms of 
this UFO and humanoid being seen in a gravel pit there's some very interesting aspects to this case 
physical evidence evidence a very unusual humanoid and the main witness was able to get so close to 
this UFO he actually touched it knocked on the door so to speak and this is what caused the ET 
to come out so a really interesting interactive case as well as we shall see the main witness 
in this case is known only as Dan that's either his first name or a pseudonym and he was taking 
a long walk near a gravel pit not far from his home again in Ontario Canada when at around 2:00 
p.m. he felt a blast of heat he's walking right by this Gravel Pit and the heat is coming from this 
gravel pit and I'll just quote Dan directly as he says I turned and looked into the gravel pit and 
there sitting at a 45° angle was an arroe head shaped object I thought it was an airplane at 
first and walked into the pit to get a closer look was very very warm in the pit and I noticed there 
were a couple of sticks and little plants on fire about 15 to 20 ft from it I also noticed that the 
Rocks underneath the object little gravel Stones an inch or so in diameter were actually splitting 
and popping like popcorn from the heat so he's looking at this thing he described this object 
as sort of wedg shaped he says it looked like stainless steel but it did have a greenish tint 
to it and it was resting on three supports one was kind of cylindrical shaped and the other he said 
looked sort of like skis but having just recently read about an air show this was where his mind 
sort of went he thought at first that this had to be some sort of unusual plane and he decided 
he was going to get a closer look so he began to climb down into the pit itself now doing so at 
some point the object itself was obscured by the Rocks around him and when he got the Gravel Pit 
back in View and reached this area he was shocked to see that this object was no longer there it was 
gone he didn't hear anything he didn't see it so he was absolutely mystified by its disappearance 
but at this point still assumed that it must have been some kind of plane though he couldn't see how 
a plane could possibly land there so he exited the pit and continued his walk as it turns out there 
there were or three other gravel pits in this area again this is by Wildwood Lake and as he walked by 
this second one he saw a metallic glint and I'll just let the main witness Dan describe what he saw 
as he says I looked down and sitting at exactly the same angle was the object that had been in 
the first pit there was a hydraulic hum and as it hummed it came down to a 10° angle where the nose 
was 6 to 7 ft off the ground and the tail was about 3 ft off the ground the whole thing was 
about 50 ft long and 25t wide so we actually saw this object coming in for a landing and as soon 
as it landed he said it did this weird sort of unfolding kind of opening like a fan and rested 
there for a few minutes when suddenly it Rose silently upward and headed towards the other 
Gravel Pit the third which was about a half mile away he did notice something very strange as the 
object departed below Treetop level right near him he had the feeling that his own body weight 
practically tripled so he felt this incredible heaviness like the gravity itself had increased 
so at this point he's beginning to think something very strange is going on but he's still sort of 
clinging to this airplane explanation but watching this object heading towards this next Gravel Pit 
he decided to go investigate and as Dan says I reached the third Pit and the object was sitting 
at the 10° angle again on the three skis I watched it for a few minutes and I kept thinking is it an 
airplane I finally went down into the pit and walked up to the nose of the thing I wrapped 
on it I actually banged on it it was very smooth and sounded very solid no boing to it at all it 
was like hitting a concrete wall so he's very much puzzled this is clearly a craft of some kind it's 
solid steel he walked around it and then actually went underneath this thing banging on it again and 
then something truly incredible happened again I will just quote Dan directly as he says in his 
own words I heard a clunk from behind me I turned around to see a three foot wide ramp had dropped 
the noise I heard was it hitting the ground then this little guy came out I took one look at him 
and I knew he wasn't human he was four and a half to 5T tall and looked like the belly of a 
garter snake scaly greenish yellow skin he have a normal mouth but something like a snorkel he 
didn't seem to have any knees he walked straight legged down the ramp shifting his hips forward 
with each step he was wearing a tannish suit that didn't have any seams or zippers visible and his 
boots sounded very heavy like they were weighted and they were a shiny silver in color so this is 
very interesting we see the short humanoid again often people describe these e is not bending their 
knees moving in a kind of clunky fashion and and again he saw this sort of scaly looking skin at 
this point the being stared right at him and they locked gazes for a good five seconds he says which 
is a long time to stare at an and as Dan says and I quote I've never had such a shock in all my life 
he was in full View and walking towards me when I shouted my God I jumped up hitting my head on the 
bottom of the the object and ran just as fast as I could I hid in the bushes by the side of 
the pit and watched the thing take off it flew low over the field by the Gravel Pit it would 
rise up out of sight then it would fall back down again straight up straight down like a yo-yo and 
all this time there was absolutely no sound now at this point he says he kind of felt a sense of 
timelessness he lost sense of time he was watching this object moving back and forth over the field 
and the next thing he knows he's walking back into his father-in-law's house and he's late for dinner 
so this is clearly or certainly very possibly a case of missing time but it was later that same 
evening at around 7:15 p.m. he was driving with his wife's grandmother very close to this area 
near Fair viiew when it was his grandmother who pointed out a strange object at Treetop level 30 
ft high and about 50 ft off to the side of the road and she said to Dan do you see what I see 
up there in the tree and dad said yes that's a flying saucer in fact he recognized it as 
the same thing he had seen earlier that day his grandmother said but they can't be real and Dan 
said well is Is that real and she said yes Dan said well then we are looking at a flying saucer 
so at this point he stops the car and walks closer up to it and he saw the humanoid again as he says 
in his own words I saw this little bulbous head fellow looking out the trap door at me I had the 
feeling that my grandmother wasn't supposed to be with me I thought of this turned and looked at her 
in the car and when I turned back the thing was gone I just got back in the car and we drove home 
so there you go an amazing case of a UFO landing a humanoid coming out interaction between the ET and 
the witness physical evidence as well possibly missing time so this could be more than just a 
simple sighting uh with followup Witnesses seeing UFOs in the area at the same time so a lot to like 
about this case I think one of the takeaways is the fact that this craft did land in a gravel 
pit and not just once but four different gravel pits there are a lot of cases of UFOs hovering 
and landing at mines and sometimes affecting them physically so that could be why the ET was there 
either way it's an amazing case important on a lot of levels and that's why I wanted to include it 
in this collection and now let's move to another case and this one I call assaulted by aliens when 
I say that I don't mean mean physically attacked but apparently they tried to steal something from 
the main witness and he wasn't having it so a very interesting interaction between the very unusual 
humanoids and the quite frightened witness this took place on November 24 1978 in a small town of 
Gallo this is near Venza Italy and it's a really interesting case because while there is only one 
witness to the actual humanoid there's a bunch of witnesses who described seeing UFOs in the sky at 
that time in that area and not only that described the craft with the same details that the witness 
described and he did not know about them also interesting because there's not only Landing trace 
evidence but some other very interesting physical evidence it was a cold but sunny afternoon 
November 24 1978 and it was actually just before noon when Angelo damrose age 61 retired was out 
gathering firewood near his home in the little town of gallo and he had just trapped up a branch 
with his bill hook this is a sawing tool with a curved blade and this is when he noticed two 
very strange humanoids who were very very close to him only about 3T away and they were looking 
right at him and boy were they weird looking he said both were very short about 3et tall though 
one was slightly taller they were both very thin with tight yellow skin long elongated pear-shaped 
heads huge pointed ears sunken white eyes a large protruding nose and wide mouth with what looked 
like fangs on the top of their mouths two fangs he said they had huge hands and feet with what looked 
like claws or nails they were wearing dark skinn tight overalls which covered only their torso and 
part of their arms and legs leaving their hands and feet bare and their head but most amazing is 
they were floating about 1 and 1/2 ft above the ground now when he first first noticed 
them they were side by side but immediately one of them the shorter one began to Glide swiftly 
from side to side this really freaked Angelo out he was absolutely terrified and he shouted out 
for help at the top of his voice and he then began asking them who they were and what they wanted now 
one of the beings did respond but Angelo says he was not able to understand them and this is when 
his attention was suddenly drawn to the one that was slightly taller and was kind of staying still 
because this taller one suddenly lunged forward reached out and tried to grab Angelo's Bill hook 
now Angelo had it in his hand at the time it had a leather handle and he held tightly and refused to 
let the creature have it this being was trying to grab it by the dull end now despite this and that 
Angela was still holding on this figure tried again to grab the bill hook again by the handle 
and when it did this Angelo Felt This Strange electrical discharge assumingly coming from the 
being but he still held tight to his Bell hook and this creature was determined this ET tried a third 
time to take his bill hook this time using both its hands and considerable strength but Angelo 
said he was absolutely terrified his adrenaline was pumping and he held tightly but when this 
being grabbed the bill hook he could really feel this strong electrical discharge not only in his 
hands but running up from his hands all the way up to his arm and seeing that this strange being was 
determined to take his bill hook Angelo wasn't having it he reached down grabbed one of the 
branches he had just cut and made ready to strike this creature now apparently realizing that Angelo 
was not going to give up his possessions willingly and that he now represented a danger to them 
perhaps these creatures fled Angelo recovering from shock and now armed with his stick and knife 
actually took after them as they ran down along this narrow mule path he said they moved very fast 
faster than a human he quickly lost sight of them but he ran after them anyway continuing his search 
and a short while later Came Upon This Strange craft in a field uh at this point it was about 60 
to 65 ft away and appeared to be a classic Flying Saucer he said the object was on the ground itself 
it had four Landing legs he estimates it was about 12 ft wide 6 feet high High clearly metallic with 
a dome on top and it's interesting cuz it the colors of this thing the upper part was bright 
red there was a white band which ran around the circumference and the bottom half was blue so 
red white and blue the legs of The Craft itself looked kind of aluminum gray he said now he no 
sooner sees this thing when he sees that there's a door in it and it's closing and he got a brief 
glimpse one of the arms of these beings uh closing the door from the inside it was seconds later 
that this craft took off in perfect silence at a diagonal angle and it emitted a burst of red flame 
and boom was gone in seconds so he was very much shocked by this encounter he immediately went home 
kept turning over and over the events that just happened skipped his lunch finally decided Ed to 
tell his son-in-law luchano munari so the next day luchano returned to the scene with another person 
and found apparently where this object had landed cuz there was a circular landing spot about 10 to 
11 ft wide of blackened vegetation this vegetation was not only blackened it was also flattened and 
rotated in a counterclockwise pattern inside the circle luchano found two u-shaped depressions less 
than a foot wide uh while the witness Angelo did describe four Landing legs the other side 
of the circle had hard stones on the ground so they didn't find any depressions there but they 
did find that some of the bushes next to this area looked as though they had been uprooted now there 
was more evidence an examination of the Bill hook where the being had grabbed it showed what looked 
like fingerprints or unusual discoloring the blade kind of turned red so this was brought 
in for examination but it turned out to cost too much money and it was never analyzed in any 
professional way but later researchers including the main researcher Antonio shio Mento did find 
other Witnesses and not just one or two a bunch of them one of them was Maria borato kasasa who had 
around 12:15 pretty much exactly when Angelo said that this craft took off she saw a craft departing 
the area and she described it very much as he did as metallic with a dark lower half and the upper 
half being intense orange red same time same area another witness a bus driver by the name of Senor 
Busa said he saw an oval bright red orange object moving around at Treetop level and a passenger 
in his vehicle also saw it finally Giovani perti and his family watched apparently the same object 
moving around and he actually managed to capture it on film meanwhile the local newspaper office 
said that they received several calls from people reporting UFO but they refuse to give their names 
so yeah a lot of witnesses what a weird case that is very unusual looking humanoids also 
very unusual acting humanoids you have to hand it to the witness in that case for not letting 
them take his cutting tool uh but yeah I mean very well verified in terms of it being researched by 
professional investigators with Landing traces other physical evidence multiple Witnesses all 
over the area seeing craft at that time definitely an important case and here's another one this one 
I call a warning for all Humanity when people get messages from ETS it's often some kind of 
warning and that's absolutely true in this very interesting case which occurred on February 16 
19 80 in Edinburg Scotland this is one of only two single witness cases in this collection but 
it's an extensive case because this witness was having some very unusual experiences prior to 
his face-to-face encounter with three humanoids who had a very important message not only for 
him but apparently for all Humanity this case was investigated by researcher Steven Bernett 
and involves a witness known only as DL so he's anonymous he's a 39-year-old truck driver married 
with two children and it was in mid 1979 that he began to have some strange experiences he kept 
hearing voices in his head calling his name and it happened enough times and concerned him enough 
that he finally went to his doctor who tried to treat him but to no effect these voices continued 
so he stopped going to the doctor and was just trying to figure out what was going on and then 
was late on the evening of February 15 1980 that he went to a bar a pub had a few drinks then he 
went to a friend's house and had a few more drinks with his friend and it was around 1:00 a.m. now 
technically February 16th and his friend's father actually drove him home to his flat 
in Edinburg and Mr DL went inside and this is when strange things began to happen for some reason he 
couldn't explain to researchers he felt compelled to go outside and going outside and looking at the 
field next to his building he saw a bright beam of light shining down on the ground and looking 
up he saw it was coming from a dark oval shape and so he's looking at it studying it trying 
to figure out what the heck it is when suddenly he found himself engulfed in a quote light tu he 
said it surrounded him completely and rendered him unable to move he said It felt quite warm cuz it 
was cool outside he felt strangely calm he said he could smell an odor like burning matches and 
then suddenly without warning stepping towards him he saw three strange figures two of these figures 
stayed back but one approached signaling to the other two to remain behind and Mr DL says that 
the these three Figures were about 5 1/2 ft tall of average build but certainly looked strange cuz 
they were wearing a dark metallic silver onepiece suit and this covered their faces as well sort of 
a brown visor said their hands were covered by a material that was darker than the rest of this 
suit he also noticed that the area under their shoulders kind of bulged in an unusual way and 
it was at this point that he heard the quote alien start talking to him in a voice that he described 
as quote like mixed foreign tongues so he didn't understand what they were saying and he's trying 
to listen and this is when he realized that this communication was not actually audible but was 
telepathic or as he says in the mind and this is when he did understand what they were saying uh 
the ET said that he had a message that he wished the witness to communicate to others and this ET 
said and I quote this was our planet before yours and we will not allow you to destroy it if you try 
we will shudder the Earth only the innocent Will Survive so that's a pretty powerful message but 
at this point the figures immediately vanished the tube of light was gone the object was gone 
DL himself felt quite weak and dizzy he rushed back inside and called the police the police did 
not believe him accused him of being drunk uh yeah he was a little tipsy uh but the witness 
insists that this was a real event and eventually contacted researchers uh researcher Steven berck 
did call the police who confirmed that Mr DL did in fact call but the investigation really went 
no further than that so so it's unfortunate that case wasn't further investigated but apparently 
the witness had had enough and didn't want to talk about it anymore which is understandable this is a 
lot for people to deal with he's married with kids you know and dealing with this is probably caused 
a lot of stress but certainly an interesting case and yeah it was investigated by a professional 
researcher who did verify that the police were contacted as well and I think it's important 
because it shows this very common message that ETS keep giving people over and over again hopefully 
one day we will listen and now we move to the next case which is really quite unusual I call this one 
the Peeping Tom ET there are quite a few cases of ETS looking in people's windows this one takes 
that to a whole new level this occurred on March or in March through July of of 1982 in a very 
small town Hespeler Canada we know exactly where this case took place and it's super interesting 
because it does involve multiple Witnesses although only one witness saw the humanoid she 
saw it over and over again and it was behaving as we shall see in a very unusual way but yeah 
multiple witnesses to UFO activity in that area at that time which of course bring more credibility 
to the case the main witness in this case is known only as Mary and again she lived in a little town 
called heser along River Road this is a short little road pictured here it's like less than 
a mile long so we know approximately where this case took place and it was around 11:00 p.m. one 
evening in early March 1982 and Mary was taking a bath and looking up at the window in the bathroom 
which which had frosted glass and no curtains she distinctly saw the shape of a head looking at her 
through the window but it vanished so quickly that she thought perhaps she had imagined it but still 
it scared her and it was two nights later again at 11:00 p.m. the same thing happened she was taking 
her bath as she usually did and she saw the shape of a head right up against the window soon as she 
looked at it it quickly disappeared and again she wondered could she possibly be imagining 
this but if so why now when she had never seen anything like this before why twice so she was 
frightened she closed the shower door continued her bath and it was one week later she was taking 
her bath again at 11:00 p.m. looked up and this time saw two heads and this time they were right 
up against the window apparently trying to look inside through the frosted glass and this time 
she knew she wasn't imagining things she saw them plainly in fact she saw some good detail 
according to Mary the head was normal in size but had a silver helmet on top she couldn't see any 
facial features but she did see that these heads had very pointed chins and the heads themselves 
seemed to be glowing with light now this window is quite High which meant that if these beings were 
standing they would have to be at least 6 and 1/2 ft tall unless they're floating which is certainly 
possible so while this grass was glass was frosted it's still transparent and investigators went to 
the area and sort of reenacted the incident and learned that the shape of a person could be easily 
seen through the frosted glass but after this third incident Mary refused to take her bath until 
midnight when her husband came home from work but events were still in progress it was 3 weeks later 
in March 1982 Mary was having trouble sleeping so around 1:30 a.m. she went to get a glass of 
water and looking out the backyard window she saw a pulsating cone-shaped object hovering and then 
landed apparently on the ground beside a maple tree she said this object was yellow on top orange 
in the center and dark orange on bottom but all the colors were kind of bleeding and morphing into 
each other and it was pretty large she estimates that it was 16 ft High 12 ft wide and about 600 ft 
away which is pretty close so she watches this for a few minutes and decides she's going to go get 
the binoculars and is running around the house trying to find them couldn't find them said at 
this point she wanted to wake up her husband but felt this weird numbness she says it was almost 
as though an invisible force was preventing her from waking up her husband so she's watching this 
object again then made another attempt to find the binoculars she wanted to wake up her son but 
again felt like she couldn't do it almost as if she was compelled not to and when she returned 
to the window the object was gone she watched it she estimates for about 20 minutes she also says 
that during the time of this sighting her dog was quote highly agitated while it was not barking its 
ears were perked up and it apparently sensed that something was going on outside unfortunately she 
did not look to see if there were any markings on the lawn for some time apparently when they 
finally did look there was nothing there but events were still in progress because it was 
about four months later that Mary and her daughter ordered a pizza and it was around 10:30 p.m. and 
they decided to look out the front window to see if the pizza man had arrived and instead they 
saw something else four bright glowing objects zigzagging in the sky so this time they found the 
binoculars and through the binoculars saw that these objects were in fact gray discs with red 
white and blue lights so the pizza man arrived and all of them stood on the front porch and 
watched these UFOs as it turned out just a few miles away Mary's son-in-law was also watching 
these objects so Mary her daughter and the pizza man watched these objects for about a half an hour 
apparently became bored and went back inside while these objects were still out there I think you'll 
agree that's a very unusual case hard to say why the ET was so particularly interested in the main 
witness she doesn't report any other encounters um I don't know if there's been any follow-up or 
not so maybe she did have further encounters I don't know but certainly interesting because the 
UFOs came back and put on a clear display for the witness for her family for the pizza man as well 
which is kind of funny and I can't imagine seeing a UFO for you know a half an hour and then getting 
bored with it and walking back inside though I can tell you I've certainly heard that sort of thing 
from other Witnesses so I don't know and now we get to the final case of this little collection 
and I call this one they weren't human again a direct quote from the main witness although there 
are actually multiple Witnesses in this case it's a pretty unusual and interesting case what I like 
about this one is it does involve a craft Landing humanoids coming out the witness was able to get 
quite close to them and saw them engaging in a behavior which is something we see quite a bit 
with UFO occupants I also like this case because it's fairly recent this occurred on July 21st 2001 
over the very small town of Geneva Pennsylvania so again this case took place in the very small town 
of Geneva which is about 10 m south of meville and as the witness says I wish to remain anonymous at 
the time of this incident July 21st 2001 he was about 11 years old was 11:00 p.m. a warm 
summer night and the witness who I'll call Jeff that's a pseudonym he was at his grandmother's 
house with four of his cousins and they were all playing hide and seek in a 10 acre field next to 
the farm and bordering on on a thick forest they were very near the forest line when the incident 
happened and as Jeff says in his own words the pitch black forest lit up as if it was daytime 
a beautiful blue light bright enough to fill a football stadium it looked like the sun had 
landed in the woods what we first noticed when the light appeared was how it did not dim slowly into 
the darkness it abruptly stopped at each side of the property as if there was a physical wall of 
Darkness so this is very interesting this sort of coherent light unusual lights that are often 
reported in UFO cases now the children were quite spread out at this time and as it turned out Jeff 
was closest to this light and knowing the woods like the back of our hands he says he was curious 
and unafraid and decided to go investigate cuz he he's assuming that some people were 
riding allterrain vehicles in the forest but as he approached he soon realized how wrong he was as he 
says as I ran closer to the object I realized it was not what I had thought so it was very strange 
he could see as he got close and he approached within 100 ft and realized that this was in fact 
a UFO as Jeff says in his own words it was too hard to look at almost like trying to stare at 
the Sun the blue orb was a little larger than a Volkswagen Beetle car and I saw two entities 
that were running around grabbing objects off the ground I saw one of them grab a box sitting 
next to a tree then dive into the orb via a door that lifted vertically not horizontally the second 
being was about to hop into the same door when it stopped it stood there for a few moments and 
looked at me the other entity hopped back out of the orb and began to stare at me as well I 
couldn't make out the details of what they looked like cu the craft was too bright I could see their 
Silhouettes they had abnormally large heads and I could tell they were not wearing clothing or shoes 
so this area is pretty remote it's just Forest out there there's a little bit of a swamp but Jeff had 
the distinct impression that they were taking samples of the vegetation in soil only stopping 
when he they saw that he was approaching them so he had apparently interrupted them in whatever 
they were doing and as Jeff says in his own words at this moment I could hear my cousins screaming 
my name from the field they were begging me to run my self-preservation kicked in I knew they weren't 
human and I was in danger of being abducted so I ran as fast as I could Out of the Woods pass my 
family and straight towards the house to tell the adults to look outside we made it halfway through 
the field when the woods went black again so yeah many cases where UFOs land ETS come out and start 
collecting plants and rocks and vegetation and what have you which just goes to show they're 
pretty interested in all things Earth whether it's the geology or the Flora and Fauna so I 
think that's an interesting and important takeaway from this case which again is quite recent I also 
like it because it does involve multiple Witnesses and it appears to be your standard grads judging 
from the sort of stick figure sketch provided by the witness that's certainly an interesting and 
important case all right well that's our show for today 10 cases coming from all over the 
world all involving pretty extensive interactions between extraterrestrials and humans over quite a 
long period of time decades many involving multiple Witnesses um some who don't know 
each other which always again adds credibility to each of these cases and lots of evidence we 
see some really extraordinary evidence in terms of the electromagnetic effects watches stopping 
cars going up out headlights failing these sort of things but also Landing traces of 
all kinds whether it's apples being partially eaten or burned circles on an Iowa farm or 
asphalt getting dents in it or Footprints in a field that are far deeper than a normal human 
would make interesting Landing Trace cases for sure animal evidence as well medical effects and 
certainly profound psychic and spiritual effects because following these encounters many of these 
Witnesses were afraid to go outside or had other really profound emotional mental spiritual psychic 
effects following their encounters so yeah as I always like to say there's a lot to learn from 
extraterrestrial encounters not only about the ETS but about ourselves and if there's any takeaway 
that I wish people would take from cases like these is that this is actually happening there 
are so many cases I honestly believe that anyone who takes an objective look at the evidence that's 
out there can only come away convinced I think it's time we just simply accept that stop trying 
to prove this phenomenon it's been proven over and over again disclosure has in effect already 
happened the evidence is there the ETS have certainly done their part to provide it so that's 
it for today I hope you learned something hope you found it at least entertaining I really want 
to thank you once again for watching it's always appreciated and until next time keep searching 
for the truth keep asking those questions and most important of all keep having fun bye for now.
