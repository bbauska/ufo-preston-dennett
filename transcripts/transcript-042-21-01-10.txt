IS BIGFOOT AN ALIEN?
Jan 10, 2021

Summary:
Jan 10, 2021
Most UFO encounters don't involve Bigfoot. And most Bigfoot encounters don't involve UFOs. But in 
a growing number of cases, these two seemingly separate phenomena perfectly intersect. There are 
now dozens of cases on record in which people have seen Bigfoot and UFOs at the same time, in the 
same place. In some instances, people report seeing Bigfoot entering or exiting extraterrestrial 
craft. And in a few, people say they have seen Bigfoot onboard a UFO.

As strange as this sounds, this weird confluence is well-known among UFO researchers, many who 
have cases to contribute. But wait, there's more! Some of the cases involve other strange events, 
such as poltergeist activity or telepathic contact with Bigfoot.

What is going on here? Is Bigfoot an alien? What exactly is the connection between Bigfoot and UFOs?

This video presents a wide variety of firsthand cases which illustrate the many strange 
connections between Bigfoot, UFOs and other paranormal phenomenon. 

For those who would like to explore more about these and other cases involving the UFO Bigfoot 
connection, check out my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three."

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. Today's presentation is called "Is Bigfoot 
an alien?". I've been researching ufos for many years but it wasn't long after I started 
researching in 1986 that I ran into my first case involving ufos and bigfoot I wasn't happy about it 
i didn't want to look into bigfoot I was scared it might be real and it would be opening up a can of 
worms and I would have to do a bunch of research into bigfoot which is exactly what happened 
yeah there's an over a melting overwhelming amount of evidence in support of bigfoot I 
know this now i've had my own encounters i've talked to people who have had bigfoot 
encounters i've written a couple of books about it supernatural california it covers bigfoot's 
history in california as well as bigfoot yeti and other eight men which was a book for children 
and uh definitely bigfoot is real uh and that reason I started researching was because I started 
running into these cases in which ufos and bigfoot were occurring at the same time 
now this is not a new idea there's a lot of research into this particular aspect of 
ufo encounters and it's fairly well known uh back then I don't think it was nearly as well known but 
it was certainly not unknown many researchers have uncovered cases like this and one thing 
i can say is that most ufo cases do not involve bigfoot and for that matter most bigfoot cases 
don't involve ufos but in a small handful of cases these two phenomena intersect perfectly 
so there's absolutely undeniably a very real connection between ufos and bigfoot 
but what exactly is it is bigfoot an alien you know is there another explanation 
that's why I wanted to do this video and sort of explore some cases firsthand  and see if we can figure out this mystery and just take a deeper look 
so let's get into some of the cases there's some very interesting cases and a very early one 
comes from 1888 from a rancher a cattle man who is staying with the tribe of native americans 
over the winter and saw a small group of them heading out into the forest with a platter of meat 
and after they had done that a couple of times he became curious and followed them to a cave  inside the cave was a bigfoot-like creature it was much larger than the man the rancher said 
covered from head to toe in thick fur or hair and except for the palms of his hands 
and the native americans told this rancher that this they called him crazy bear they 
called this bigfoot crazy bear and that he had come from a quote a small moon  which had landed and disgorged three of these bigfoot like creatures the native americans said 
that there were also small humanoids piloting this ufo they were dressed in bright silver 
shiny uniforms and that this had happened a number of times before it didn't happen a lot but 
every now and then these ufos would land and let out bigfoot like creatures it's a very 
early case but it's not unique another early case was actually investigated by researcher john keel 
he found in the police reports this was reported to the police on july 31st 1966. this occurred 
in an area known as presque isle park in erie pennsylvania and involved five teenagers there 
were three brothers their sister anita hayfly and another uh lady by the name of betty gene clem
so they were driving along and their car got stuck in the sand and uh one of the hayfly brothers 
decided he's going to hike off and get help and while he's away the four other teenagers are in 
this car when a ufo hovers overhead sends down a beam of light it's not far away suddenly this 
object lands a couple hundred yards away and the teenagers are approached by a very tall 
hairy bigfoot like creature was very menacing it came up and it scratched the car they scared 
it away by flashing the headlights and honking the horn and it moved off 
this was reported to the police the police found the teenagers very credible they were scared to  death furthermore there was a scratch on the hood of the car where they said the 
bigfoot had scratched it and also there were weird three-toed footprints leading to and from the car 
to an area 200 yards away where this object had landed where there was all this crushed vegetation 
so a good case certainly yeah investigated by john keel and another one that sort of 
points towards this ufo bigfoot connection and there are a lot consider this case from william 
bozak which occurred in frederick wisconsin in 1974. william bozek was driving along the highway 
when he saw a ufo hovering overhead and as he approached he could see that there was a porthole 
and looking through the porthole he saw a very large very tall humanoid was covered completely 
in hair and had very long arms and looked very much like we described a bigfoot today this is 
a case that's often cited by researchers who are looking into this area of uh bigfoot and ufos 
another case which ah doesn't come from a great source the weekly world news but it's very 
interesting because they do provide a photograph of the witness they give his name and the drawings 
he did of what he said he saw the witness is oscar zamoro he's an architect who said that he was 
hiking with another friend a judge who has refused to go public but did give his report anonymously 
they came upon a landed ufo while hiking in the andes in chile and it was a 40-foot wide 
metallic saucer they were hiking around it trying to figure out what this thing was  when they came upon a tall hairy humanoid they said it had no neck and uh shortly after they saw 
it this thing walked up to the saucer climbed a ladder and into an opening in the side this ladder 
retracted the object took off slowly upwards then it let out a big flash of light and darted away 
it's definitely another case with this weird bigfoot ufo connection probably the strongest 
proponent of the ufo bigfoot connection is kawani lapsuritis he's a scientist who kind of became 
a bigfoot researcher because he started having encounters himself not only with bigfoot but with 
ufos this sort of came hand in hand for him he ended up writing two books about his experiences 
which he calls the psychic sasquatch and the ufo connection as well as another book the sasquatch 
people and according to kawani there is a very strong connection between psychic events telepathy 
and ufos and that these experiences often come in conjunction with each other he claims to have 
had many many hundreds of encounters with bigfoot and ets both telepathic with both ets and bigfoot 
and face to face and says that he has actually been taken on board a ufo where he was healed 
of a herniated disc in his spine he says he's seen the sasquatch on board the ufo along with 
what we would describe as sort of you know great type ets but but different short walled humanoids 
and uh he makes a number of other startling claims he also claims that there's a base on earth 
underground which contains both bigfoot and ets who are preparing 
to save humanity from upcoming disasters that's a theme that turns up in some of these cases 
uh kawani lapseritis writes in his books about many other people who've  had psychic bigfoot experiences so he's yeah probably I would say the strongest proponent 
and a controversial character but really has spearheaded this idea to some extent
leo sprinkle actually wrote a forward for one of kawani's books and talks leo sprinkle talks about 
his own case in which he interviewed a gentleman who actually came upon a landed ufo and ets 
and a bigfoot all at once and apparently the ets were ordering this bigfoot around and this is not 
the first or I mean the only case involving this sort of thing another there are many um there's 
another really interesting case which comes from tammy chapman she recently came forward 
about her encounter at mount shasta mount shasta is of course known for ufo and bigfoot encounters 
there's a bunch of both of them coming from this area and she had an experience where she was  telepathically communicating with bigfoot while she was visiting mount shasta and she retreated 
to her car and was meditating there she was awake and suddenly the roof to her car turns transparent 
which is something we do see in ufo cases where people's you know their roofs will transparent in  their homes or their walls and suddenly she looks up through her now transparent roof of her car 
and sees a ufo it's at treetop level and so she was amazed she was having a ufo and a bigfoot 
encounter on the same night uh consider the experiences of peter gutilla who is a bigfoot 
researcher he's put out a number of books on this subject he was researching a wave of bigfoot cases 
up in the northern california area and did a his own stakeout he heard loud screaming noises 
the kinds that people were reporting actually recorded them and this was a very remote area 
he says also while he was out there he heard this strange beeping noise he couldn't figure  out where it was coming from and this is a very remote area so this was his first sort of clue 
that perhaps there is a connection between ufos and bigfoot he would later write about a 
crash retrieval case along with a couple of other researchers which took place in the viscano desert 
this is in baja california and according to peter gutilla and the other researchers 
this ufo crashed and it was split into and what was inside but four bigfoot like creatures 
very tall large hairy humanoids he says all of them were dead um they weren't wearing any clothes 
except heads on what appeared to be sandals and these copper-colored belts 
with colored lights on them otherwise they were just these hairy humanoids and
he says that they had no hair on their faces but were otherwise covered with 
hair and broad noses and sharp teeth and that eventually the u.s military actually
took this craft and carried it back to yuma air force base in arizona so it's an interesting case 
uh if you know I don't know how well substantiated it is but certainly an interesting case 
so as you can see there's definitely a strong connection between ufos and bigfoot and sometimes 
it goes beyond that consider what happened to the bowers family of washington state 
this was a case that was investigated by lauren coleman a cryptozoologist and jerome clark 
a ufo researcher and this case occurred on december 4th 1970 when a family had a 
bigfoot encounter outside their home they found weird footprints their dogs had gone crazy 
but what's really interesting about it is three days following this bigfoot encounter they had a 
very close-up sighting of a ufo hovering right over their home and following this they had a 
huge poltergeist outbreak which got so bad they ended up fleeing their house so here we have 
ufos and bigfoot and poltergeists three you know presumably separate phenomena all coming together 
at once so that's a strange confluence for sure and we see this in a number of other cases 
there was another case which occurred during the louisiana monster scare this was in 1972 
in the town of louisiana missouri a bunch of people were seeing a bigfoot like creature 
which became nicknamed momo the monster these were very well authenticated multiple witness sightings 
all across the this town of louisiana and missouri and at the same time there was a number of ufo 
sightings in the area researchers were not able to link these sightings directly with the bigfoot 
encounters but there was a couple of cases that certainly came close one was the rogers family 
who said that in august of 1972 they actually lived in rochedale indiana 
they had an encounters with bigfoot uh around their house that were actually leaving scraps of 
food for it uh it was interesting because it would never leave tracks even in deep mud and so that 
was weird dozens of people in the neighborhood saw it and uh during this wave of sightings there was 
also a ufo scene and a glowing object hovering over a field where this bigfoot had been seen
and again following that the rogers family had a poltergeist like activity appearing in their house 
so there does seem to be a direct connection between ufos poltergeists and bigfoot 
uh it certainly uh can go even deeper than that here's a case which comes from respected and 
pioneering researcher don worley uh who did a lot of research in from the midwest where 
he was stationed here's the cases that i'd like to cite here occurred in 1981 in ohio 
where a farm had this ufo hovering overhead and it was followed by these bigfoot sightings 
and this bigfoot was really harassing and they were having a real hard time with  it was leaving tracks all over the place with stealing their livestock 
and in some cases just uh killing chickens and things like this and that was concerning enough 
but sometimes during these encounters when the bigfoot was outside the home  holland another strange effect happened the one of the younger members of the family their son 
fell into a trance as if he was being possessed by bigfoot and was just running around growling 
and scared the living daylights out of the parents as the father says you didn't see him that night 
i did he was going how would you like your son doing that and this is not the only case where 
a telepathic connection occurs between people and bigfoot even to the point of possessing them one 
of the leading researchers I think into ufos and the bigfoot connection is certainly stan gordon 
he's written a book about this called silent invasion pennsylvania's ufo bigfoot case book 
and has a number of excellent cases in which these two phenomena  intersect perfectly as he says i'm quoting stan gordon here directly during the 1973 pennsylvania 
outbreak and in a number of subsequent cases well-documented incidents occurred where both 
a ufo and a bigfoot were observed in the same place at the same time by more than one witness
he talks about many many cases there was one case where a witness stephen meacham 
was apparently possessed by one of these creatures and uh following this episode 
of possession he experienced other paranormal phenomena such as uh telepathy and precognition 
but stan gordon has some truly remarkable cases that I think really cement 
this connection between ufo and bigfoot one case involved three ladies who were driving 
along a highway and saw a landed ufo and it was disgorging quote several bigfoot 
into which ran off into the forest very much like that very first case from the native americans 
and he cites other cases just like that uh there he sets at least two cases in which people 
approached a ufo and were confronted by bigfoot like creatures so although the correction is sort 
of connection sort of circumstantial in those cases there's enough of them I think to say that 
these bigfoot are running into these ufos or coming out of them in some cases 
here's a very interesting case which I think was reported to mufon this occurred in earlham iowa 
on july 4th 2002 a father and son were watching fireworks from the roof of their house 
when suddenly something very strange happened they heard this very loud whining noise overhead 
they couldn't see its source not at first but at the same time they heard this several other 
strange things happened suddenly their dogs started barking like crazy they had cows the 
cows started mowing as if they were disturbed their porch light dimmed the radio which was 
playing suddenly became filled with static and it was at this point that they saw a big foot run 
through their yard a big tall hairy ape-like creature ran right through their yard and it's no 
sooner it had it ran past them when something else approached it was a ufo a large glowing object
sort of square shaped they said with a window in it came zooming overhead and 
that was what was making the whining noise and it moved off and as it moved off the 
kid had a compass the compass needle actually pointed right towards this object 
so it's a very interesting case which brings these phenomena together perfectly and there are so many 
like it really there are here's another case from rich hills missouri at the four rivers wildlife 
conservation area this occurred on december 2nd 2012 when a young man went out hunting and 
came upon a bigfoot he came home told his father so his dad and the son went out there with some 
other people on sort of a stakeout and what they found was the number of deer carcass 
uh which in the area and footprints and they smelled bad smells uh heard something tromping 
through the forest and at some point also saw these weird glowing orbs a bunch of them dozens 
of them they actually filmed them for a short period of time and find they finally moved off 
uh many cases that are really have a I mean show this very strong connection that point towards 
bigfoot being an alien or at the very least going on ufos on a regular basis 
here's the case which uh was reported to either mufon or new fork coming from brownsville 
california from an elderly couple they want to remain anonymous this occurred on november 25th 
2017 and one evening they were drawn outside their home which is a pretty rural area but 
they saw this uh glowing light in the forest  landed and they thought it might be a emergency vehicle but they were wondering what it was doing 
out there and so they went out there to look and could see this blinking orange red light 
and as they got close they could they realized it looked strange they couldn't hear any sound  they got scared because they had this distinct feeling of being watched 
and they retreated back into the house and this thing takes off it's gone they go to bed 
and shortly after they're start to go to bed they hear something digging around in their dumpster 
and they look outside through the window and they think it's a bear at first and they go out there 
with a flashlight and a bear banger a bear banger is like a sound making device to scare away bears 
and as they get outside they see that this is not a bear at all this thing stands up on two legs and 
runs off into the forest scared them pretty badly and they think that this ufo and this bigfoot are 
somehow connected because they saw it on the same night very close to the same time and there's case 
after case like this uh again yeah we've seen ufo or bigfoot being ordered around by aliens in a 
couple of cases uh well here's a case that speaks towards that and again shows this very strong 
connection this case was actually investigated by leo sprinkle and a number of other prominent 
researchers it occurred in the rocky mountains of colorado in an undisclosed area on a ranch 
this was during the mid-1970s a family had bought a ranch and immediately started to experience 
a number of unexplained phenomena it started out with cattle mutilations and ufo sightings 
and it wasn't long after that they started having bigfoot encounters as well and in fact 
on one occasion while ufo was hovering overhead they saw a bigfoot run across their ranch land 
and finally one evening the father was out hiking on his land when he came upon a landed 
ufo and humanoids human looking actually I said he thought they were human at first until they 
realized they were wearing weird jumpsuits and their eyes were a little strange uh they had 
very pale skin uh were kind of blond-haired and blue-eyed and uh he was talking to them when a 
bigfoot approached and they started ordering this bigfoot around like it was a pet so 
again we have this sort of very strong connection between ufos and bigfoot 
and certainly I have my own cases like this my first case occur occurred in 1978 
i interviewed the witness many years later his name was robert he is a radiologist he lived in 
canyon country when this encounter occurred this is a fairly remote area certainly was at that time 
and lots of canyon lands and it leads off into the uh los angeles national forest 
and he says robert says that one evening he was in his home which overlooks this sort of wilderness 
area and he saw a ufo land in his backyard it was these bright bright blue and white lights 
and he's looking at trying to figure out what it could be he ran to get his glasses because  he's nearsighted and this thing takes off and it's gone he went out there and didn't see any landing 
traces or anything like that but it was the next night that he's in his house when suddenly 
something very strange happens his dogs start going crazy they are barking furiously at 
something in the backyard and then there's this loud moaning roar and roberts freaked out sora's 
dogs and robert's even more freaked out because he feels himself suddenly telepathically linked 
up to this creature he now knows what it is it's a bigfoot and this bigfoot knows that he that robert 
can hear him and this bigfoot is communicating and saying that it's angry at the dogs turns out ufos 
and or I mean bigfoot and dogs do not generally speaking get along this is definitely a thing in 
bigfoot accounts and true in this case I didn't know that bigfoot and telepathy was a thing until 
i ran into this case I didn't know that ufos and bigfoot were a thing until I ran into this case 
and this case had all of those and uh for robert it was a very convincing experience he's sure 
this wasn't a bear or a cougar or anything he says this roar was very hard to describe other 
than it came from a very large barrel chested creature and it was quite frightening actually 
and it was following this event that they had a poltergeist outbreak in their home which was 
pretty bad doors open and closing lights going on and off cold spots footsteps this sort of thing 
and this would later be followed by more ufo sightings so here's this pattern again exerting 
itself where not only ufos and bigfoot intersect but other phenomena telepathy and poltergeists 
so what is going on here uh and ruffle you know I started researching this area when I 
found out when I found out about this encounter i'm like wondering if maybe there's bigfoot 
encounters in this area and sure enough there is and uh researcher ann druffle had 
uncovered cases in this area involving not only bigfoot in ufo but psychic phenomena 
as she writes i'm quoting numerous other types of manifestations seem linked to the ufo phenomenon 
citing locations tend to be infested with poltergeist and other odd paranormal activity 
perhaps strangest of all bigfoot activities sometimes coincides with heavy ufo activity 
all of these unusual phenomena have been reported in the tahunga canyon area 
which is not far from uh canyon country so yeah there is definitely a connection between 
all of these phenomena and a number of researchers feel like perhaps this  phenomena are not only inextricably connected but they're coming from perhaps the same source 
this is sort of the jacques valle john keel school of thought lauren coleman jerome clarke 
believe that many times we're not dealing with extraterrestrials in the classic sense  but with a phenomena that perhaps takes on different guises 
and might not be extraterrestrial at all or bigfoot for that matter  i'm not sure if I subscribe to that theory but it's interesting nevertheless because uh 
of these weird connections uh d scott rogo is another researcher who is a proponent of this sort 
of theory and as he writes when I first theorized that monsters might be psychic projections 
similar in nature to ufos and poltergeists I also predicted to myself that monster appearances 
would be accompanied by odd electric anomalies as I showed earlier poltergeists and ufos 
have an absolute penchant for disrupting everything electrical from cars to tv sets 
and sure enough it wasn't long before he uncovered at least two cases in which 
appearance of a bigfoot caused a car to stall so yeah perhaps there is a connection there that 
we don't fully understand i'm not sure if that dictates that these are the exact same phenomena 
but certainly shows that there's a connection probably the ultimate case of this kind that 
i have and the last one i'd like to talk about in this presentation comes from a lady alcohol wendy 
i met wendy had a crystal skull conference sort of a little meeting and we became friends I found 
out she had had a lifetime of ufo encounters she's an abductee she's been taken on board many times 
it was very scary for her in the beginning she's had a lot of sightings a lot of onboard encounters 
physical examinations by gray type ets the hybrid baby phenomena just very extensive stuff involving 
onboard experiences she's been healed by ets if they removed a cyst from her once killed 
her of injuries in a car accident and she actually showed me a ufo so I know her cases for real and 
was investigating it when one day she calls me up and says you know i'm having a problem  with bigfoot i'm like what do you mean no bigfoot really and she's like yes for real 
it's telepathically in contact with me it seems to like me she says and it's 
i'm going around my house it's causing the dogs to go crazy the horses next door 
are stampeding around she says sometimes it climbs down through the wash near her house this is an 
acton california uh sort of uh near the lancaster palmdale area outside of the national uh national 
forest los angeles national forest a pretty remote area but not far off the five freeway 
and she's like yeah this bigfoot is harassing me um she said she found footprints around her house 
her neighbors were complaining about it sometimes it would scream  bloody murder she said like a woman screaming bloody murderer out in the wash very high pitched 
and other things like this were happening one evening she says it stared at her right through 
the window and scared the daylights out of her and that morning she found out also her roommate 
had seen it staring in through the window as had her son her son said it climbed up in the tree 
he called it the monkey man so other things happened she said one night she heard this 
loud clunking noise on her roof and the next morning there was this boulder on her roof 
this huge rock she had no idea that you bigfoot are well known for throwing rocks 
and it looked as if this one had put it on her roof sort of as a show of force or a
gift perhaps because on another occasion she found this animal spine on her front doorstep and it 
appeared that this bigfoot had given it to her she wonders if it's some can shape-shift as well 
which is something actually other witnesses have reported because she kept seeing this weird  dog kind of circling around her house 
and she was in telepathic contact with this thing and it was telling her that it uh it lived in 
these caves out in the national forest there and that it was waiting and uh preparing for the uh 
times when there would be big disasters and that its job was to help save people from these future 
upcoming disasters just like kawani lapseridis had said this is what this lady was saying 
and it told wendy that she was involved in this as well which was related to her ufo 
encounters certainly who were giving her a very similar message of upcoming disasters 
so here we have all these elements coming together and uh wendy asked me she says 
you know I think it wants to kidnap me i'm afraid it wants to kidnap me has this ever happened and I told her no no bigfoot has never kidnapped anybody I was actually 
uh lying to her inadvertently I didn't know turns out there are a number of cases of ufo 
big uh kidnappings this is why I just started my ufo bigfoot research so I didn't realize 
that there were a number of cases involving people who have been kidnapped by bigfoot
so a very interesting case to say the least I went out there I looked at the tree where this thing had uh stepped on I looked at the footprints they were I couldn't really tell if 
they were footprints or not when I looked at the animal spine that had left on its front porch she showed me all of this and she says I know where it lives you know it's told me so we decided to go 
out there and what we did is we went out there one evening with all of our equipment cameras and uh 
sound recording equipment she says would come out at night mostly but she didn't really want to go 
out there late at night so we went out there around nightfall at dusk and when we arrived 
it was getting pretty dusky and it was just beginning to get dark and she pointed to this 
it was several miles from her home i'm going to say two or three miles out into the wilderness 
into the los angeles forest area outside of acton and we were along a dirt road that led towards 
this mountain in this steep valley and it was very densely packed with brush very treacherous area 
no way you could navigate that the cliffs and mountainsides were far too steep certainly for 
a person to easily do and uh she says that's where it lives I look down in there and it's a very deep 
dark valley at this point it was too dark to really see into it and uh we had pulled over 
i I opened the front door I was driving and I was walking around the front of the car she opened her 
door and and shut her door and opened the back door and was pulling out the sound equipment 
and camera equipment when suddenly we heard this loud roar very loud very prolonged i'm gonna say 
three seconds four seconds maybe a little longer a little less and extremely loud 
now i've heard lions roar I had a lion roar right next to me at the zoo I grew up in an area where we had cougars uh outside our house i've heard then 
uh coyote you know what I know what bear sound like this was none of those this is a very 
loud very resonant deep barrel chested roar which went on for a very long time 
and wendy screamed she was very unhappy she started scrambling to get back in the car I ran 
towards the source of the noise it seemed pretty close couple of hundred yards away but I couldn't 
tell for sure because it echoed all around us I actually looked up wondering if it could be a jet 
and this thing roars again seconds later and that time I knew where it was it was definitely down 
in that dark dark valley there just 100 yards away maybe and wendy's screaming at me to get 
back in the car she does not want to stay any longer I wanted to stay but she was too scared so 
i went back into the car reluctantly and we drove off but yeah I had my own bigfoot encounter 
pretty much convinced it's real because of not only that but certainly because of the research 
i've done i've researched a number of other cases I know of one case where a gentleman came upon a 
bigfoot and was telepathically communicating with it and it told him they have the ability 
to turn invisible and actually demonstrated for him and shortly after that this he saw not only 
the bigfoot but a female bigfoot and a child bigfoot an infant bigfoot and uh all three of 
them disappeared and it was a brief encounter but showed that these are not perhaps normal 
hominids or primates as we might think of them so again there's been a lot of research 
into this area I wrote about it in my book not from here volume 3 in which I covered the ufo 
big foot poltergeist connection and now there are a lot more cases many of which i've presented here
one researcher i'm very impressed his work is jose antonio caravaca he's looked very deeply into this 
and it's clear to me that bigfoot is real but most cases don't involve ufos so i'm thinking 
that bigfoot is probably a intelligent primate that's been coexisting along with humanity for 
millennia but staying out of humanity's way out in mostly the wilderness areas 
and does have what we would term to be supernatural or psychic abilities which 
aren't really supernatural at all they're just connected to it they have the ability to perhaps 
slip into other dimensions and turn invisible which I know how it sounds but this seems to 
be what we're dealing with here and could explain this connection another connection I think that is 
really sort of answers a lot of the mysteries surrounding this is the telepathic connection and that perhaps this is why ufos and bigfoot are so well connected because they can communicate 
telepathically so easily with each other and the fact that there are multiple cases of 
bigfoot in sasquatch exiting or entering or being seen inside ufos I think shows that there 
is a strong connection but I don't think this next necessarily means that they are extraterrestrials 
in the classic sense intelligent beings coming from other planets who are building spaceships 
i think actually my assessment is that most of these cases involving ufo and bigfoot is 
just sort of this telepathic bigfoot and ufos are contacting all kinds of people including bigfoot 
and for that matter they're taking all kinds of animals on board as well so it shouldn't be any surprise that if bigfoot exists and I think they do that they're also being taken on board
so i'm not sure after actually building these craft himself but you know there are a few cases 
where people have reported bigfoot piloting these craft so I am willing to leave open the 
possibility that there are extraterrestrials out there who are eight foot tongue covered with hair 
like the wookie in star wars so perhaps that's what we are dealing with here 
so it's my assessment my conclusion that in some cases yes perhaps bigfoot is an alien 
but in most of the cases we're seeing here no I think we're probably dealing with an intelligent 
and uh very mysterious hominid a primate very much like us who has been coexisting along 
on our with humanity for centuries and is also interacting with extraterrestrials on a regular 
basis that is actually what I think is going on and I think the telepathic connection sort of 
ties into all this perhaps the genetic connection the fact that et seemed to be very interested in 
hybridization that might tie into all of this at any rate it's still a mystery a lot of people are 
interested in it and i've researched my own cases and i'm absolutely convinced there is a connection 
and that's why I wanted to put this video together for you all so many cases that point towards this 
so that's it for now once again thanks for listening and even more important keep having fun
