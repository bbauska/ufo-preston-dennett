EYE DOCTORS FROM OUTER SPACE
Jan 23, 2021

Summary:
Jan 23, 2021
Physiological effects as the result of a UFO encounter are very rare, and yet they do happen. 
Following a close-up UFO encounter, people sometimes experience dry or sore eyes, eye irritation, 
burns or inflammation, after-images on the retina or light sensitivity. Less common, but equally 
consistent, are cases of physiological improvements. Among the most common of both are accounts 
involving the eyes.

This video presents twenty firsthand cases of people who have experienced ocular improvements 
in association with a UFO encounter. Imagine being color blind, and then you have a strange 
visitation and are able to see colors for the first time. Imagine being diagnosed with glaucoma, 
and then finding help greeting you from beyond the stars. What if you lost your vision, and 
afterward, someone unique and unexpected arrived in your time of need? Or what if you were 
visited by ETs, and now suddenly you start having psychic visions?

Could the UFO occupants be here to help us? Sometimes the answer might be, yes! The evidence 
shows that something profound is happening here.

If you'd like to explore more, these cases and many others are detailed in the book, "The 
Healing Power of UFOs."

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and the title of today's presentation  is eye doctors from outer space I know how that sounds but i'm being totally serious 
i've actually documented some 300 cases of people who have received physiological improvements as a 
result of of a ufo encounter and I have to tell you eyes top the list in terms of what part of 
the body is receiving this kind of attention I should also mention that when it comes to 
physiological effects there are many reported cases of injuries as well and eyes top the list 
there too in fact many people report looking at a bright ufo too long and uh they have dry 
eyes as a result or perhaps inflammation or even burns uh also i've heard 
after images persisting on the retina for some time and light sensitivity a number of different 
effects but also healings and let's see if there's some more than 20 cases i'd like to cover in this 
video and just show you how some some of the many incredible cases which people 
report having been healed in their eyes as a result of a ufo encounter
there are many early cases as well as modern cases so i'll just do a kind of chronological rundown 
of these cases and the first one I want to talk about occurred to a missouri farmer by the name of 
buck nelson at the time he was virtually unknown but on july 30th 1954 claims to have had an 
incredible encounter with ufos he was in his farmhouse listening to the radio when suddenly 
the radio began to static up and you heard a strange foreign voice talking over the radio 
at the same time his animals outside began to act strangely and act up his dog his pony so he runs 
to the window and is shocked to see a glowing disc hovering at a low altitude overhead it's 
about 50 feet wide realizing he's seeing a ufo he runs back and get his gets his camera and actually 
manages to photograph uh these things when he returned to the window there was three of them 
he's he snapped a series of photos at least one of which he says captured images of these saucers 
so then he runs outside with his flashlight to sort of communicate with these things  and that's when something really extraordinary happened as he says and i'm quoting the most 
extraordinary and frightening experience during this visit came when I tried to signal with my  flashlight to the disk that had come nearest to me a bright beam of light much hotter and brighter 
than the sun was thrown onto me jolting me with a current that threw me to the ground because I 
suffered from lumbago and neuritis I was afraid to move and get up and of getting another jolt 
when I did get up however I was amazed to find the pains had gone they haven't bothered me since and 
not only that he says his vision was dramatically improved so essentially buck nelson was 
healed of three different conditions as a result of being struck by this beam of light from a ufo 
and that evening ets showed up he said there was a group of men human looking except perhaps 
more muscular than the average person and they proceeded to give him uh what he calls the 12 
laws of god which are essentially the 10 commandments in a slightly altered form and 
they also warned him about nuclear power as they told him and i'm quoting we are here to 
see which way this world will use atomic power for peace or war so this was the first of many 
encounters uh buck nelson says and he in which he was taken into these craft and he says to the 
moon and other planets within our solar system he ended up writing a small book about his encounters 
called my trip to mars the moon and venus and ended up actually becoming pretty popular 
in his area he would hold ufo conventions which would attract many hundreds of people and uh 
at the time his case wasn't really taken seriously by researchers who pointed to the obvious sort of 
ridiculous elements in his account of being like you know taken to planets within our solar system 
however some researchers um did take his case seriously and  still do and one of them is gordon creighton who's actually a very prominent and respected researcher 
was the editor of the flying saucer review for many years that's a leading ufo publication 
and gordon creighton was impressed by the case and as he says I am perfectly aware 
that nowadays virtually nobody wants to put any credence in buck nelson's contact he's story 
nevertheless it is the policy of flying saucer review to look most carefully  and objectively at every claim that comes to us no matter how preposterous it may seem at first sight 
i suggest that in view of all that we have heard and learned if not about ufos at least about the 
ufo reports in the 15 years since buck nelson told his story you will be well advised to approach it 
with an open mind and be prepared to study every detail for if buck nelson invented this affair 
then it seems that many of the features of his account are nothing short of prophetic 
and uh the reason gordon creighton is saying this is because yeah the accounts of being struck by a 
beam of light and healed it's something that we've seen quite a lot in other cases not to 
mention spiritual messages and warnings of nuclear proliferation and this sort of thing at any rate 
uh that's one of the early cases involving a healing of the eyes uh but certainly not the 
only one there's another one very much like it uh which was reported actually by a sign painter by 
the name of howard menger i've talked about howard menger's case before he's from hybrid highbridge 
new jersey and claims to have had contact with human looking ets and there are elements of his 
story that like buck nelson seemed to be very difficult to reconcile with what we know today 
in terms of him being taken to other planets in our solar system and things like this however
howard menger also talks about how he was able to bring his friends to some of these contacts 
and they also saw the ufo and in at least one case the ets as well so he does have outside 
witnesses and again his case has elements we see in others the case is controversial 
for sure but according to howard menger in april of 1945 he was part of world war ii in the army 
and was in the unit that was trying to take over the island of okinawa which at that time was held 
by the japanese but after saturating the island with bombs the united states took over the island 
and established a stronghold and it was here that howard menger says he had a very strange 
experience he was out on the airport runway when a shell from an incoming artillery landed short 
and exploded on the runway he ducked and thought at first he had escaped injury but that turned out 
not to be the case as he says as I got to my feet I felt something stinging in my right eye I put 
my hand to my eye and managed to pick something out with my fingers it was a piece of shrapnel 
so howard was rushed to the hospital the hospital tents on the island and was immediately treated 
for his injury unfortunately his eye became infected  and the infection spread to his other eye and he became totally blind as it was at this point that 
he began to be visited by a nurse who he was never able to identify she was sort of a mystery nurse 
and she approached him and cared for him and told him that his vision would be restored 
and it was I tried to find out who the nurse was but was never successful  in uh finding it out he suspects that she was one of the space people because it was a few weeks 
after that he had another contact and was told by the ets that he was part of a mission with them 
they told him and i'm quoting uh we have been spending a lot of time conditioning 
you and preparing you for your work to come we are contacting people all over the world 
yeah howard manager ended up writing a book about his encounters called from outer space  to you and a controversial story to say the least but one of many people reporting 
eye healings and his case is actually virtually identical to another one 
which occurred around the same time and under very similar circumstances
this next case occurred on july 7th 1944 actually this was during world war ii 
and a soldier by the name of helgay lindros from finland uh was fighting the war when an artillery 
shell exploded right in front of him and sent shrapnel all over his front part of his body 
and blinded him he was sent home and doctors did what they could for him but they were not able 
to restore his sight and his condition they told him was chronic he would never see again however 
that's not what ended up happening it was about a year year and a half later in the autumn of 1945 
that helgay says he was visited in his home by human-like figures um he couldn't see them 
at first of course but they came in and began treating him using lights and weird instruments 
and cured him of his blindness which point he did see what they looked like they were human looking  wearing long white robes they also cured his arm of an injury he had received during the war 
and afterwards left through the wall and uh before they did however they told him that the reason he 
had been healed was because he had been selected to help others so this is a theme that does turn 
up in other cases the ets are healing people who they say have a mission on earth in some capacity 
so those are some really early cases but definitely there's some pretty significant 
cases as time goes on here's a very strange case which i'm including in this list this occurred 
in july of 1952 to a lady by the name of marianne cassio shenafield she's from agawam massachusetts 
and as a very young girl 11 years old had a incredible encounter this was july of 1952 
she was out in her backyard playing when she saw a metallic object just move overhead totally silent 
very low level and next thing she knows she's being approached by what we now know is a gray 
type humanoid she says it was dressed in a crinkly kind of silver suit with a black belt the belt 
itself had a little box on it covered with colored buttons and next thing marianne knows she's 
on board a craft presumably she's being laid out and examined she turns to her right and she can 
see there's an image of the inside of her body all her organs and full living color like a hologram 
um hovering right next to her and it uh shocked her so much that she actually vomited 
at which point the ets put a mask over her face perhaps to give oxygen she thinks and that's all 
she really remembers except being returned to her home following this marianne's vision 
began to deteriorate very quickly and she went to the doctor and the diagnosis was devastating 
she had a condition known as stargardt's disease this causes a degeneration of the macula 
and as a result marianne was unable to see through her central focus of vision and through much of 
her peripheral vision she had only a little bit of peripheral vision left so it was a devastating 
thing and somehow related perhaps to this encounter perhaps they knew it was going to happen 
and were examining her there's no evidence that they actually did anything to cause this 
but there does seem to be a weird connection there at any rate that's how it remained for many years 
it was actually 20 years later in 1972 marianne was in her home when she started hearing strange 
beeps and next thing she knows she's not in her home and she believed she was taken on board again
she did not see the ets but she felt herself being physically examined and 
definitely knew she was not in her home and was returned back to her home at which point  weird things started to happen she started hearing this beeping noise 
in her head very pronounced and she wasn't able to explain that and then on march 15 1974 something 
truly miraculous happened her marianne's vision was completely restored she could see just fine 
stargardt's disease is supposedly chronic and curable so first thing she did was call her doctor 
and told him what happened and he says this is impossible you must be hallucinating 
and because stargardt's disease is not reversible she assured him he she was not hallucinating 
that she could see perfectly just fine and uh unfortunately this condition this reversal 
lasted for only 10 minutes very short period and her stargardt's disease reinserted itself and 
she could no longer see so that was a very strange episode which she has no idea how to explain 
other than she thinks it may have something to do with her ufo contacts and following this is when 
things became very strange while she still suffered from stargardt's disease her psychic 
vision began to improve dramatically she started having incredible psychic visions 
it started out with weird formulas and equations genetic codes colorful geometric shapes 
numbers letters landscapes and more and this was followed by all kinds of weird paranormal 
and poltergeist phenomena she ended up calling the doc doctors and even priests to help her 
but none were able to help her with this condition and she ended up becoming a very powerful psychic 
and could see people's auras and she said just by looking at a person's zara she could tell whether 
or not this person was an experiencer that's something i've heard before so I definitely find 
that interesting it's a very strange case related division and that's why I included it on this list 
next case I want to talk about is also very interesting this occurred to a lady 
who reported her case to mufon anonymously i'll just call her donna and donna was born in 
1947 in a small town in ohio and uh she had some serious health problems uh from birth 
turns out her parents had different blood types and uh had different rh factors in their blood 
so this was caused a difficult pregnancy uh and uh as a result donna was born with 
some problems she had a curvature of the spine and was diagnosed also with p k y 
which is uh the real name is phenylketonuria and that's a metabolic disorder 
and donna had to have a blood transfusion upon birth and this also caused more problems as a 
result of the blood transfusion which did not go as planned she suffered some minor brain damage 
and the vision in her left eye deteriorated dramatically and she also 
uh suffered from epilepsy so yeah from the very beginning poor donna had a number of pretty severe 
health problems but it wasn't long before et's intervened she was actually only four years old 
and in 1950 she was in her bedroom suffering from a toothache and uh suddenly the room filled 
with light she's lying on her stomach and room fills with this beautiful golden light she says 
and somebody approached her it was a figure she couldn't really see what they looked like except 
they touched her shoulder and then she felt that what felt like hands or fingers going up 
and down her spine sort of massaging it and it felt like it was more than one person or 
perhaps even instruments at any rate it was a very pleasant feeling she wasn't scared in the least 
and that's all she really remembers she woke up the next morning in excruciating pain 
her toothache was gone but her back hurt real bad I mean her parents took her to the doctors 
and that was when they got a really incredible  surprise donna's curvature of her spine had been somehow reversed she no longer had 
a spinal curvature so that was uh an amazing cure to say the least her toothache 
was also gone and uh it was three years after that that she had another incredible encounter it's now 
1953 she's six years old she's outside of her home with her family and the number of neighbors 
when a ufo shows up and it's circling around it's pretty low altitude and it starts flashing lights 
at the people and perhaps at donna directly because she had a very strong reaction to 
one of these flashes of light as she says and i'm quoting when the white light came 
on I noticed a burning sensation that went from the base of my spine and to the top of my head 
and centered in my throat after that my defective vision in my left eye was corrected and I never 
had another epileptic seizure after that my intelligence went up after I was healed too 
she was surprised to notice this dramatic uh increase in her intelligence and actually went 
and took an iq test and scored a 150 iq which is well above genius level so this is not the only 
case i've heard of people who've actually you know had their intelligence improved 
so this completely transformed her spiritually mentally and physically she had a couple of other 
ufo sightings following this as a young adult and as an adult and other paranormal experiences 
and yeah says she feels completely spiritually transformed as she says and i'm quoting when i'm 
in a certain set of circumstances I can see auras and I can go into a trance and receive 
messages telepathically so that's another case where we see the ets are improving 
perhaps not only your physical vision but your inner psychic vision 
so I i find these cases fascinating because there's just so many of them here's another 
case which occurred in march of 1968 the main witness is ricardo castillo true hillow 
he's a janitor from valparaiso chile and uh he was outside his home when he saw this glowing object 
overhead and shortly later two figures appeared and uh ricardo wore glasses and they started 
asking him about that and his nearsightedness and told him that they were actually able to 
cure his condition which they did and according to ricardo and i'm quoting I didn't understand them 
too good but the fact is that I can see real good and without glasses uh the beings 
told ricardo that they would return for him though I don't know if that ever happened 
but this case was published in the march 18 1968 issue of la nacion in santiago chile it's 
a pretty interesting case one of my favorite cases of this kind comes from researchers 
ralph and judy bloom they wrote an excellent book called beyond earth man's contact with ufos 
and they talk about an amazing eye healing case which was actually one of the first ufo 
healing cases to be revealed the main witness is an anonymous peruvian customs official 
who was out on his balcony he says when he saw a glowing disc at a pretty high altitude 
and he's looking up at it trying to figure out what it is when it sends down  a violet beam of light it was very thin and it struck him on the face and uh chest and 
dazed him left kind of disoriented for a second this object moves off and instantly this peruvian 
customs official noticed that his vision had been improved at the time he wore very thick 
glasses for his nearsightedness and he was unable to see wearing his glasses and took them off and 
noticed that he could see perfectly his vision had been restored  and not only that he suffered from rheumatism over the days and weeks that followed his rheumatism 
cleared up and never returned and that was a chronic condition so like many people 
who have experienced healing he received a double healing of more than one condition
so that's a really incredible case another case that i'd like to talk about uh actually comes from a brazilian researcher by 
the name of mario ron hell he contacted me after hearing about my research into these 
types of cases he wrote a book called alien abductions which was published in portuguese 
and he wanted to share this case which he had investigated involving a young girl by the name of 
dear say dear say lived in a very rural area in brazil in a small town 
and around age nine she was in school and not doing well and her parents were trying 
to figure out why and they took her to an eye doctor and discovered that she suffered from  extremely poor vision and they had not realized that and so they took her to the eye doctor 
but it turned out her condition was so bad that local eye doctors could not help her 
and finally they decided they were going to order a very specialized pair of eyeglasses from japan 
and they were waiting for these eyeglasses to arrive when something truly miraculous happened 
dear say was in the backyard she had gone out to feed the family dog when suddenly she says she was 
approached by a tall a six foot tall figure when this figure approached her both she and the dog 
became paralyzed temporarily unable to move and this being flashed a beam of light on dear say 
and the beam of light retracted the being departed and dear say ran back inside and 
told her parents what had happened and within a half an hour of being struck by this beam of light 
dear say's vision returns to a normal healthy condition she could see perfectly without 
glasses so again i'm not sure why they're healing a nine-year-old girl from a small town in brazil 
but this is the kind of thing we're seeing all kinds of people are being healed 
here's another very interesting case which also comes from brazil 
and the main witness in this case is a chicken and cattle farmer by the name of jose benedito bogeyo 
in 1964 he was 39 years old this is in the town of pinero brazil and uh jose was having a problem 
with his septum a deviated septum which was causing uh very bad headaches and so he decided 
to have surgery on his septum and it did relieve the headaches except actually the consequences 
were perhaps worse as a result of surgery uh jose went totally deaf and not only that his vision 
deteriorated very badly so the surgery was not a really a huge success by any means and he ended 
up having to wear very thick glasses and could not hear and it was many years later in 1977 
some 13 years later when jose had a very powerful ufo experience he was walking back to his home he 
was outside of his home when suddenly he noticed a 60-foot long v-shaped craft hovering overhead it 
was sending down a beam of light and it appeared to be following him so he had a flashlight with 
him and he turned on his flashlight and shined it at the ufo and the ufo responded by beaming 
a orange beam of light onto jose and it hit him hard it shocked him and knocked him unconscious 
and when he woke up he was no longer outside of his home he was in a strange room he 
was surrounded by human looking figures dressed in gray and brown clothes he said and he was led 
out out of this room outside and that's when he got a real shock he did not appear to be 
on earth anymore there were strange buildings strange plant life and strange ufo like vehicles 
all around him and uh he they led him into one of these other vehicles and 
that's all he really remembers next thing he knows he's waking up alongside the highway 
however where he was was really quite shocking he awakened about eight miles 
west of sao louis which is more than 70 miles from his original location where he was taken 
he was suffering from pretty severe pain in his right side and his back and for about eight days 
he had no energy and no appetite thankfully his energy and his appetite did return 
but for at least two months he was forced to walk with a cane because of these 
injuries he had received from his encounter one thing he didn't notice at first what is was that 
he was no longer wearing his glasses and in fact his glasses were missing turned out however he 
didn't need him as he says it wasn't until I got home the next day that I realized I lost 
them since then I haven't needed to wear glasses anymore and also amazing was that he could hear 
his deafness wasn't entirely improved but he could definitely hear loud noises 
like shouting or car horns or ambi ambulance sirens and things like this 
so that was pretty interesting to say the least uh unfortunately his case 
had a kind of a tragic end 13 years later he had a severe car accident and as a result his deafness 
reinserted itself and also his vision became poor again and deteriorated 
so these cures are not always permanent and unfortunately it wasn't permanent in jose's case 
nevertheless it is a very interesting case and one of many actually which have occurred in brazil 
there's another case which occurred in 1978 this was published in a brazilian ufo magazine the 
witness is anonymous but uh we do know he comes from the town of zhao pessoa in paribas brazil 
and uh this actually wasn't a healing but it could have been it's a very interesting case 
because the witness says he woke up and saw two figures standing next to his bed 
and one of them was holding a vial sort of a crystal vase filled with a weird blue liquid 
and the beings told him that they were there to cure him of a festering eye problem 
unfortunately the witness became terrified and shouted at them to leave which they did 
so he did not get healed but he could have been he just was too frightened apparently in the beings 
left before they were able to affect a healing there are many cases uh one uh 
series of cases i've talked about before uh comes from denise and burt twiggs they were 
a family from oregon hubbard oregon and i've talked about them before it's a very strange 
contact case it started out as a pretty terrifying abduction really but they as they evolved in their 
contact became a very friendly contact d case with a lot of really unusual and bizarre elements 
i think probably these elements are more common than most people think except most people don't  have the courage to talk about them they do report a number of healings each member of the family has 
received healings including their young son christopher in december of 1989 christopher 
had developed a stye in his eye and denise was going to take him to the doctor the next day 
however that night they were taken onto the craft the mother ship as they call it and christopher 
was taken into the medical room and treated for the stye and in the morning it was gone that was 
not christopher's only healing later he would have a healing for his asthma his condition of asthma 
so I won't get into the whole case involving uh denise and burt twiggs  but it's definitely an interesting uh close encounter and as denise twiggs says regarding 
christopher's healing after a trip to the medical room aboard the ship his eye was nearly healed 
the next day uh one of uh my favorite cases are certainly a very interesting case of eye healing 
comes from a lady from virginia beth collings is her name I believe that might be a pseudonym 
at any rate she also wrote a book along with her friend anna jamerson it's an 
excellent book called connections and it talks about their many encounters 
including a miraculous eye healing that they both had for beth it began in december of 1992 when 
she saw this metallic ufo come at a very low level over her car and it sent on a beam of light which 
caused the engine to fail all she really remembers is gripping the steering steering wheel and uh 
being unable to move and next thing she knows this object is gone and she races home and as beth says 
and i'm quoting the first thing that I noticed from that first experience was that my contact 
lenses appeared to be missing from my eyes and I certainly had them in when I was driving 
and turned out she didn't need them her eyesight had dramatically improved she ended up going 
under hypnosis and learned that she was having contact with gray type ets and although they did 
heal her she finds these encounters uh pretty terrifying and she has no control over them and 
she's certainly not happy about them they haven't always been friendly on one occasion they took her 
and when they returned her they didn't put her back in her bedroom where they'd taken her they  left her outside in the cold and as a result she had severe frostbite on the bottoms of her feet 
so yeah this has not always been a good thing for her uh however uh yeah she had her eyes 
healed and so did her friend anna jamerson anna jamerson actually owns a horse farm in virginia 
and beth collins works with her but anna jamerson when beth was healed had a real shock because 
anna had noticed a significant improvement in her own eyesight and didn't know how it had happened 
and after it happened to her friend beth she realized oh my gosh you know maybe this is 
due to et contact and she did have a number of strange experiences in her life and ended 
up going under hypnosis and like beth realized she was having lifelong contact with et's and 
one of these results of her contact was her eyes being healed as anna says 
and i'm quoting my eyes had improved dramatically and I could think of no 
other rational explanation why my eyesight was improving unless I too was being abducted
so yeah she found out she was in fact  an abductee and uh has had a lot of contact with ets she's not particularly happy with them either 
and like beth collins they feel like they're kind of being treated like lab rats at any rate 
the et's do seem to be interested in her health on another occasion they gave her dietary advice 
as she says and i'm quoting I have memories of the gray ones putting a patch on my chest between my 
collarbones and I watched fascinated as it was abso absorbed into my body I remember being told 
that I must not eat fat because my fat muscle ratio is out of balance at that time anna was 
having trouble digesting fatty foods which had been causing her stomach pains and she had lost 
15 pounds as a result so yeah she was not happy being called fat by the grays and being giving 
dietary advice and told not to eat fatty foods at any rate it's one of many cases another case 
which I think is very well verified in fact one of the better verified ufo healing cases in general 
comes from respected researcher john carpenter who has investigated ufo abductions for many years 
the main witness in this case is a gentleman by the name of eddie who is a 21 year old man 
from the midwestern united states john carpenter had been seeing eddie regularly uh because eddie 
was having encounters and it was during one of these many contacts that eddie says he was healed 
as john carpenter says and i'm quoting during a physical examination by the beings eddie's right 
eye was removed he felt it pulled out and replaced afterwards there was a redness a physical 
soreness he did not feel they were implanting anything behind his eye only that they were 
fixing him the side benefit of this operation appears to be enhanced colors 
the procedure was clearly for their purposes not for eddies  but for the partial accidental cure of his life-long color blindness was a side effect 
so i'm not sure how john carpenter uh can make that conclusion that it wasn't for eddie's benefit 
and it was for the et's benefit because in fact it did benefit the witness uh he had had profound 
color blindness and following this operation his vision was improved all the way up to only green 
color blindness green was the only color he couldn't see what I like about this case is 
john carpenter took the extra step of getting a statement from eddie's doctor verifying this 
care so it's absolutely an excellent and very well verified case and I can tell you 
that most major researchers have uncovered ufo healing cases so it doesn't surprise me to hear 
you know john carpenter reporting a healing case another really excellent case uh was published 
in the book beyond ufos which was edited by ray hernandez and comes from the free organization 
which found that up to 50 percent of people have reported healing or healing type 
experiences as a result of a ufo encounter and one of these cases was published in this book 
beyond ufos and the main witness is alberto fernandez and it's really an excellent case 
alberto was originally from santiago cuba but moved to florida where he joined the army and 
then became a police officer and later an agent for the federal drug enforcement administration 
and throughout his life it experienced numerous ufo and alien sightings uh with one particularly 
dramatic encounter with a gray alien however important here was what happened in 2001 
at age 56. alberto suffered a fall uh causing multiple fractures to the orbit of his right eye 
um he rushed off to the emergency room and where he was treated for the injury and they told him 
he would have to visit an ophthalmologist to assess his vision after his injuries healed
at the time alberto and his wife had been planning for a long ocean cruise with their family and uh 
alberto decided he was gonna go on the cruise against the  recommendation of his doctors and his family 
because the swelling had reduced considerably but his vision was still pretty severely impaired
so he went on the cruise and as the crews continued alberto's vision did not improve 
and he went to the ship's doctor to just have the doctor check up  on his eye injuries and the doctor was absolutely shocked by the severity of alberto's injuries 
and actually wanted to evacuate alberto from the ship by helicopter 
alberto refused and they completed the cruise and three weeks later they returned to their 
home in florida and alberto went straight to the eye doctor and the eye doctor says well you know 
now we can see that your uh injuries are healing but your cornea is torn uh there we can treat you 
but there will probably be a permanent loss of vision and you're very likely going to develop 
glaucoma and you would have you'll have to have regular treatment for the rest of your life so 
the diagnosis was pretty devastating and alberto probably should not have gone on that cruise 
but that was where things remained for the moment however five days later 
alberto woke up in his bedroom and uh there was an entity standing next to his bed 
and the entity shown this green laser-like light into the injured eye and the green light flashed 
multiple times and then stopped at which point the entity left and the next morning alberto woke 
up to find that his vision was now perfect in fact there was no sign at all of any injury he returned 
to the eye doctor for an examination the doctor was of course completely shocked by the healing 
and told for or alberto that as far as he could tell his eye was absolutely normal and his vision 
was perfect so it's an incredible case of an eye healing and not only the injuries verified 
by the witness and by his family but by doctors as well and so is the healing and he himself 
is a good witness a trained observer police officer and a agent for the federal government 
so a really incredible case which was actually investigated by a doctor dr joseph burks md who 
wrote about his case in the book beyond ufos
so there are many cases which are much more modern as well another case occurred in january of 2005 
to a lady by the name of allison who had been having regular contact and allison 
said that she woke up one day to see a mantis type being in her bedroom 
at this time she felt a strong energy pulsing through her  and she says the mantis being placed a very bright orb an orb of light in front of her face 
and as alison says i'm quoting the light was going right through my eyes and into my brain 
they said to look at the light and not look away hold there there was a lot of pressure in my eyes 
and a remarkable emotional response that made me nauseous and afterwards they told her make sure 
you look into the light every morning and every night allison woke up that morning feeling like 
she had had surgery she had a headache and there was a soreness in her eyes however ultimately she 
believes this procedure was a healing procedure she says I think this healing was to help me 
physically with my eyes but also to help me with my clairvoyance because you know following this 
she started to have more clairvoyant type visions and again this is the thing we see in other cases
and they contin she continued to have other really remarkable experiences as she says and i'm quoting 
i've had other et experiences where I remember seeing the inside of my bloodstream and even  the insides of my organs and cells magnified and projected in a way that I could see it for myself 
the et doctors would relay with me what they thought was happening in any case I don't mind 
they seem to make themselves available to me too to help me heal  grow learn and to expand my mind so it's a very interesting case and again shows that it's not 
only healing of the physical eyes but of the inner psychic vision and they heal a wide variety 
of eye conditions I mean we've seen blindness in nearsightedness and other conditions 
so there's also a condition known as nyctalopia or night blindness this is the inability to see 
well at night and uh it's not a super common condition but certainly turns up more often in 
elderly people at any rate uh this case occurred on january 10 2008 to a husband and wife they were 
driving from tacopa california to las vegas along highway 160 when they had a very strange encounter 
there was this ufo hovering over the highway it wasn't super low but it wasn't very high up either 
and he tried to point these objects out to his wife but his wife seems strangely uninterested 
but the husband is absolutely convinced he saw a ufo 
but it was following this incident on the drive back from vegas to tacopa that the husband noticed 
a very strange effect in his vision as he says and i'm quoting on the drive back to tacopa I was 
astonished to find my night vision was restored the halos i'd become used to seeing around 
oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as the headlights passed 
it lasted only a week or so but man that was a great thing I don't know for sure that it was 
associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky but I do know that my vision immediate my 
vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before
so another very interesting case which appears to be directly tied to a ufo encounter 
and there are all kinds of very strange effects that people are reporting in their vision 
here's another case involving what appears to be a multiple healing  and also has some other very strange details the main witness in this case is corey who at age 16 
was at boy scout camp when he was visited in his tent by a gray e.t 
uh for him it was a very pleasant experience he was physically examined but it wasn't scary 
at all in fact he wanted to go with the gray the gray said no but we will return for you 
and uh in fact they did in 2009 many years later as an adult corey woke up 
one morning found these strange marks on his back and as soon as he saw them a memory flooded into 
his mind of what happened that night and what he recalled was really very strange he recalled being 
in this strange room a normal kind of building with his wife and a bunch of other people as 
if they're all being herded together and they were all taken into a landed craft 
by these gray et's who were kind of disguised as human looking but corey somehow saw through the 
disguise and realized that these are gray et's and they were taken to this large what appeared to be 
a medical facility and everyone was being laid out on tables and physically examined or operated on 
and corey at one point was able to look around and saw that on the table next to him there was 
a gentleman whose eye was being removed by a gray e.t actually taken out of the eye socket 
this is something we do hear in ufo cases as we heard in the case by john carpenter 
certainly betty andreason reported this as well and that's what this witness  says he saw happening to another person so it was not a super nice encounter uh 
but uh ultimately corey takes a relevant viewpoint towards these et's that's all he really remembers 
except waking up the next morning and noticing some really dramatic physiological improvements 
before this he had poor vision and it was dramatically improved he had recently had an 
operation by earth doctors to improve the joints in his shoulders which uh he had a problem with 
his joints not only in his shoulders but in his knees as well and following this apparent ufo 
experience corey noticed that his knees had been healed as well and he wonders if perhaps the ets 
did an operation very much like the humans did on his shoulders in fact that's what he 
believed happened as he says and i'm quoting I believe the aliens examined my shoulders and 
saw the types of surgeries that were done on them and did something similar with my knees 
i believe that other people that I was with had similar things done to them by the aliens 
i also have noticed that my vision has become better and my sense of smell is better 
so again they seem to be upgrading people and people are receiving multiple cures as 
a result of one single experience uh here's a very bizarre case and i've never heard of 
anything like this before or since this occurred on october 4th 2014 this was reported to mufon as 
were some of the other cases I had just mentioned like the above case and the one before that 
at any rate this occurred on october 4th 2014 in the town of colorado springs colorado 
a gentleman had gone to visit friends and was at their house when he decided to go outside  and look at the stars and it was weird because he smelled a very strong odor of ozone although the 
sky was perfectly clear and that was a little confusing to him until suddenly he saw this 
object very high up in the sky darting around it was a star-like object which was making zigzagging 
emotions appearing and disappearing he called out his friend to look at it and his friend saw it and 
had no idea what it was but as it zigzagged around his friend became frightened and ran back inside 
and the main witness this gentleman watched this object zigzag zag around for a few more minutes 
until it was joined by another object at which point the two objects darted away 
the gentleman went back inside and was surprised to find that more than an  hour had passed he thought maybe it had been about 10 minutes so that certainly confused him 
as he says the whole event seemed to take only about seven or eight  minutes but when they were gone I went in and discovered nearly an hour had passed 
he later found out that other people had seen these apparently the same ufos on the same night 
in the same area but what was really weird was what happened to his vision in the days 
that followed as he says and i'm quoting for several weeks a strange effect on my eyesight 
was very noticeable occasionally I could see for miles with almost binocular like vision 
so that's incredible I mean almost like telescopic vision something we know you know eagles can do 
and i've never heard this reported before since in any other ufo contact case so that alone makes 
this case very interesting here's a really wonderful case and one of the last i'd like 
to talk about there's one after this but this case involves a lady who was cured of glaucoma 
she would not allow me to use her real name but she did provide a very detailed interview about 
her experience which was truly remarkable uh it occurred in 2013 uh this is in a small town in 
the state of maine and uh sometime earlier at around age 46 sonja was diagnosed with glaucoma 
and glaucoma is a condition which kind of results in the deterioration of vision 
and it's caused by a thinning of the optic nerve
sonia was married at the time and her husband has had repeated contact with 
praying mantis type ets and sonja herself has also had ufo contact throughout her life 
so one evening they decided to go camping in the woods behind their home which is very rural 
and they thought perhaps you know let's see if we can
ask the et's to cure them they wondered if they might be able to make a quote mental 
connection and ask them to heal sonja because she was not only dealing with 
the glaucoma but with some chronic pain issues so neither were sure if anything would happen 
however apparently the et's were listening because in fact something did happen as sonja says 
i slept on the ground inside a sleeping bag in the middle of the night I awoke hearing what 
sounded like insect chatter above my head this was like nothing else i've ever heard in my life 
it was as if there were large insects that were talking to one each one another and 
i know that sounds strange but that's the best description I can come up with 
sonia was lying face down when this happened and as this was going on she remained perfectly still 
and without any warning she felt a strong vibrating energy strike her as she says 
what I felt was a rotating force above the back of my head ending in a zap in the center of the 
head seemingly between the two hemispheres of the brain or in the general area of the optic nerve
and it was not an unpleasant experience for her although it was a very powerful feeling she 
felt like uh she they were trying to help her and in fact they were and she noticed 
a dramatic improvement in her vision when she woke up the next morning so she was  super excited about that and her pain issues were also her chronic pain issues had improved as well 
and when she went to the doctor she got really good news and the doctor was amazed as she says 
my left optic nerve grew thicker and I had the best visual field test in years which astonished 
my ophthalmologist after two years of a thinning optic nerve it had grown thicker after the event 
so an amazing cure which was verified by her doctor and not only that she would have other 
healing encounters later on dealing with other health issues and her chronic pain 
and she says it's been a very benevolent encounter from beginning to end she says it's been the 
most wonderful experience in my life i've even told them that they've brought me a lot of joy 
i'm seeking an ongoing relationship with them to understand things better it's a really amazing 
case where she asked for a healing and received it which is actually pretty rare among the documented 
cases of ufo healings but certainly not unique and one of the most recent eye healing cases 
that I could find actually was from the free study by ray hernandez and I don't have a 
whole lot of details on this one I wasn't able to interview the witness directly however the 
a lady who was having regular contact asked if they could heal her husband of detached retina 
which they did that they healed the retina now we can heal this ourselves earth doctors using laser 
surgery however the ets did it for him so it's a really amazing case and shows probably once again 
the et's ability to cure a wide variety of eye problems a lot of these healings do seem to be 
used using light I put together a whole chapter on eye healings in my book the healing power of ufos 
which documents as I said some 300 cases i'm guessing there's a lot more than that because 
most people do not report their ufo encounters especially if it's something very strange like 
a healing however these eye healings are I think really good evidence uh not only of ets themselves 
but of their agenda which I believe is healing humanity with 300 cases I think we can say pretty 
confidently that that is one of their agendas and i'm very encouraged by that to say the least 
and that's why I wanted to put together this video which I hope that you've enjoyed 
and I want to thank you once again for listening and as I love to say 
because I think it's important we've got to keep having fun till next time
