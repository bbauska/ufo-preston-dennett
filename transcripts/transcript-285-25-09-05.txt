SEVEN AMAZING ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
Sep 5. 2025

Summary:
Sep 5, 2025
<p>Onboard UFO encounters are perhaps the most extensive and interesting of all UFO experiences. They are also the most controversial. Skeptics try to explain these reports as the results of hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions or mental illness. But an objective examination of the reports refutes these explanations. The fact is, cases like these have occurred for over 100 years, come from across the planet, and are reported by a wide variety of people. There is a reason these visitors are coming to our planet, and as the onboard cases show, the reason is us! This video presents seven little known onboard UFO encounters, each adding another piece of the puzzle toward solving the UFO mystery.</p>

<p><b>I WAS COMPLETELY PARALYZED</b>. On November 2, 1954, Maurilio Braga Godoi was walking to his home in Santo Amaro, Brazil, and came upon a landed UFO. He wanted to run but felt himself drawn inside it. He saw a glowing map on a weird table. He was met by three short humanoids with dark skin and dark hair, wearing gray jumpsuits, who were interested in examining him. He was taken on a tour over South America and was given a strange liquid to drink before being returned. The case was investigated by the Brazilian military who classified it as unknown.</p>

<p><b>I WAS SO SCARED</b>. Gerardo Scharff had an abusive childhood and was used as a slave by a ruthless dairy farmer in Villa Maria, Argentina. He prayed nightly for help. One night in May 1966, at age 12, a strange craft landed, and tall beings brought him onboard. They asked him about his life and gave him a tour of the craft. He was taken into space and shown the solar system. He was taken to another planet and shown an alien city. He was examined, fed a strange liquid, given prophecies of future events, and then returned. The ETs soon visited him again, providing food and helping to free him from his abusive situation.</p>

<p><b>THEY WERE FRIENDLY</h>. One morning in July 1974, three teenage boys from Fairview, NJ, were walking home after playing basketball when a UFO appeared overhead. Suddenly, they found themselves inside. One of the witnesses saw his two friends being examined by gray aliens, who spoke with him telepathically. He believes they were helping his friends with their heart conditions. He counted about 25 grays. Looking out a porthole, he saw his hometown below him. Suddenly, all three were returned, and he watched the craft depart. His two friends had missing time, and had no memory of being onboard.</p>

<p><b>THEY ONLY WANTED TO HELP ME</b>. On the night of February 28, 1984, Tom Fraser had a horrific motorbike accident in Guildford, England. Moments before hitting the ground, he saw a glowing light in the sky. In the seconds following the accident, he himself badly injured, lying on a table onboard a UFO. Gray ETs promised to heal him and said they had a mission for him. Tom was healed, and given a tour of the craft. His next memory was of waking up in a hospital with only a broken arm, which shocked the doctors as they thought he should be much more severely injured.</p>

<p><b>WEâ€™RE JUST CURIOUS</b>. On the night of October 13, 1994, a college student was asleep in her dorm-room in Buffalo, NY, when she woke up being levitated out of her room. Seconds later, she found herself on a metal table, unable to move, being examined by gray aliens. They communicated with her telepathically, reassuring her that they meant no harm. Suddenly she awoke back in her room. She later found a strange mark on her lower back.</p>

<p><b>I WAS EXTREMELY SCARED</b>. On the night of June 16, 2002, two 9-year-old cousins were taking a walk near their home in Blanchard, OK when they felt a weird vibration, followed by a strange darkness. A loud whooshing sound came next and suddenly they saw a large craft hover and land next to them. Three grays appeared and pulled them onboard the craft and examined them. One of them also saw a human-looking figure onboard. He also saw a tub of black liquid, before being returned. They found out that their parents had been searching for them for over an hour.</p>

<p><b>IT GOT EXTREMELY BIZARRE</b>. One night in October 2010, Frank woke up to find himself on the balcony of his apartment in Harleysville, PA. Directly overhead was a large craft. He felt himself floating upwards. Moments later, he was inside the craft. He was unable to focus his eyes, but recalls being physically examined by humanoid beings, and then suddenly waking up sitting, up in bed. After another later encounter, he decided that it was time to seek help.</p>

<p>These seven cases represent the tip of the iceberg. None of these witnesses needed hypnosis to recall their encounters. None of them are seeking attention. This sort of experience is far more common than most people believe. It represents the very heart of the UFO phenomenon. And it also has the potential to answer the many questions surrounding extraterrestrial contact. For that reason alone, these cases should be taken seriously.</p>

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
Today's episode is called Seven Amazing Onboard UFO Encounters. This is my
favorite aspect of UFO investigations. Not only is it the most interesting, I
think, but really has the most potential to answer the many questions surrounding
this subject, such as who are these visitors to our planet? Where do they come from? Why are they here? There's a
lot of fear and confusion surrounding this subject. I think the only way to overcome that is to really study it.
Turn the unknown into the known. And that I think will eliminate the fear and
confusion surrounding this subject. It's one of the reasons I do this research that because so many people are having
these experiences. You can dismiss 10 cases or a hundred or even a thousand, but there's tens of
thousands. And there's good research indicating that it may number in the millions. That alone makes this subject
of crucial importance because so many people are having this type of encounter. So, the cases I've chosen for
you today are not very wellnown. I'd be shocked if you've heard of all of them. Maybe one or two, but I'm guessing you
probably haven't heard of any of these. I really like finding those more obscure cases, the ones that haven't already
been covered over and over again. I've got seven cases which come from all
across the world, three from outside of the United States, including England,
Argentina, and Brazil, and four from within the United States, including New
York, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. These cases go way back to
1954 all the way up to 2010. So quite a wide
range of time there. And I'm going to cover them chronologically. That's seven decades. So this is really interesting
to me to see how these experiences evolve over time. And really they're
very consistent. These cases do involve a wide variety of
ET types. So, we have short little humanoids with dark skin,
um, light-skinned, grays, uh, humanl looking ETSs. There's really an amazing
variety. Some of these are multiple witness cases as well. There are physiological effects and all the sort
of things that we do see in these types of experiences.
So, let's just go to the first case, which is super fascinating, and I'm guessing you haven't heard it before.
This one I call I was completely paralyzed. This occurred on November
2nd, 1954 in Santo Amaro, Brazil. And
this is one of those cases that was very nearly lost to posterity and was really
only coincidence that brought it out into the public eye. But I think it's an important case. This first case comes
from Colonel Adil Do Alivera. He is the chief of the Brazilian Air Force's UFO
research group and he reports that this case, which he calls quote disturbing,
was actually kept secret for some time. But during a press conference, he released the details to a reporter for
the Brazilian magazine called Reista de Samana. And the story was printed there
along with a verbatim transcript of an interview with the witness. There's just one witness, a taxi driver by the name
of Morelio Braa Godoy. Now, some sources mistakenly print his name as Marcelio,
but no, it's Morelio. It was a half hour after midnight on November 2nd, 1954 as
Morelio left the Santo Amaro street car Terminal in Sto. Amaro. This is a suburb
of Sao Paulo, Brazil. You can see it here. At that hour, the streets were
deserted. And I'll just quote Morelio directly as he says, "When I arrived at
Andaguara Street, I was startled to see a luminous circular object about 90 to
120 ft in diameter or 30 to 40 m surrounded by a strange reddish blue or
violet glow. This light was soft and diffused and seemed to come from the
periphery of the object which was landed on a level place. So curious about the
alien craft, I decided to investigate. But as I approached it, I realized that
the strange thing was greater in size and height than it looked before. And in
fact, it was a very big machine. Then I stopped for a few seconds, a little frightened. The weird machine was unlike
anything I had ever seen. So this craft, which he described as round, sat on an
empty lot between two houses about 60 ft away from him. He really wasn't sure
what to do next. In fact, his first impulse was to run away and contact authorities. But when he tried to do
this, he found that he was rooted to the spot. He couldn't move. He tried to cry out, but also discovered that he
couldn't make a noise. And as he says, the emotion was paralyzing, a strange
feeling that persisted for some time. When the spell was broken, I decided then to make a close examination of the
object, and my caution left me completely. So, I continued walking
towards it. Nearing the ship, I noticed an open door at one side. Not stopping
to think, I came into the ship, but I cannot tell now if I stepped through a staircase or another thing. I entered
into a large circular room illuminated by a diffuse and soft light, but I
couldn't find the lamps. No one was in sight. The craft seemed to be deserted.
At the center of the room there was a strangely shaped table, having behind it some kind of support, which appeared to
be some type of chair. Over the table, I saw some charts and maps. One of them
immediately attracted my attention because it irradiated a phosphorant
glow. It was, I recognized, a map of South America. I approached it to take a
closer look to see if there was something written on it. I only noted the presence of marks or symbols which
appeared to be mushroomshaped. They were scattered through the map with no understandable pattern. Now, suddenly,
Morurelio realized that he was no longer alone in the room, and in fact, three humanoid figures were with him. It
appeared to him that they had almost walked through the walls. He had just finished studying the map when he saw
them. And as he says, I raised my head and froze where I was, scared. I saw
that I wasn't alone in the place anymore. Three persons were standing in front of me. I say persons because they
were like me, but they were smaller than me, less than 1.5 m or about 4 and 1/2
ft tall. He said they had dark brown complexions, and their hair was black,
cut very short. Their clothes were a one-piece garment, like overalls, light
gray in color. I saw no zippers or buttons or anything like that. The three
men were not good-looking. So, Morelio also noticed that they were wearing what looked like a belt around their waist.
Each of them had a weird-l looking object which was attached to the belt, which Morelio suspected might be a
weapon, but he had no proof of this. The men stared at him, and Morelio had the
impression that they were interested in his physical form. As he says, the
expression on their faces and eyes told me clearly that I was being submitted to a careful inspection. I still couldn't
move and was so stunned that my voice had disappeared, too. Then the men started to talk with each other about me
in an alien language. I didn't understand the words, but I noticed a peculiar characteristic of that dialect.
The letter K was repeated many times at the beginning of the words more than any other letter.
So although Morelio didn't understand the language, it was obvious to him that they were talking about him. But
unfortunately, his fear was so overwhelming that he was really unable to react. And as he says, it was a
strange scene. I was completely paralyzed by terror. I had forgotten entirely that I could have asked some
questions and made some signs about my peaceful intent. I didn't realize that time was passing, and I was getting no
information by just looking at them. On the other hand, their only objective seemed to be a study of my body and
nothing more. All the time they stood motionless, just looking at me and
talking to each other at the other side of the table. So, while this next part is not mentioned in Morelio's firsthand
testimony in the newspaper, according to researchers JoseÃ© Escobar Faria and
Richard Hall, at some point, Morelio was given a small cup of unknown liquid to
drink. This, he said, had the effect of removing him from his quote hypnotic
spell. He says the door to the craft closed and the craft took off in silence
and for the next two hours or so, this craft, he said, flew across the South
American continent and then landed back in the same location. The ETSs had not
spoken to him during this entire time, but once again, Morelio found himself immobilized and fearful. And when the
ETSs did talk, it's not clear if this was before the trip or after it. Morelio tried to talk to them, though they did
not seem to understand. And as Morelio says, suddenly, I don't know how or why,
I realized I was backing out, dragging my feet backwards, my eyes still fixed
on the small men. They made no attempt to block my way or to seize me. I came
rapidly through the door, jumped to the ground, and I started to run away as quickly as possible. When I was at a
distance of about 10 m, 30 ft from the ship, I turned my head. Then I saw the
object suspended about 10 m 30 ft from the ground, having at the end some type
of screw without end. Suddenly, the alien craft climbed up at high speed. At
that moment, I observed again the eerie bluish red or violet light at the
periphery of the strange machine. And that's the end of the experience. Now, researcher Olivote Tifantes did speak
with the colonel, Colonel Odil do Alivera and asked him what he thought of the case, but the colonel refused to
comment at any length and said only that it was one of many cases in the Brazilian Air Force files and that the
final verdict on the case by the Air Force UFO experts was never released
other than it was labeled as quote unknown. Now, Olivo Fontes was personally skeptical of the report
because many of the details were identical to the contact reports of George Adamsky and Daniel Fry, which had
recently received a lot of publicity, and he felt this might be more than mere coincidence. But nevertheless, he called
it a quote good report, which he only took seriously because it came directly
from an Air Force colonel. But in further support of the validity of this case, Morurelio was reportedly examined
by several psychiatrists in Sao Paulo who concluded that he showed no signs of
neurosis or psychosis. I do find that case quite credible, not
only because this case was investigated by the Brazilian military, but they took
it absolutely seriously. And this case does have details that turn up again and
again in modern-day accounts and it's a very early case. I understand that
Olivote T Fontes was a little bit skeptical because the details described by Morelio were very much echoing some
of the details described by George Odamsky and other contactees. But if you take a close look at what this witness
is describing, his experience was very different from those described by
contactee George Adamsky and others. So I'm not sure that that's really a good
reason to dismiss it. And Olivo Fontes himself said that he thought this case
was worth reporting that it was quote a good case. And again, we have to remember that this witness was given a
psychiatric evaluation and found to be perfectly sane. So I think yeah, it's a
good case. And let's move to the next one, which I also found super interesting. This by coincidence also
happens to involve a taxi driver. Want to thank one of my viewers, you know who
you are, for alerting me about this case. So interesting. I call this one I
was so scared. This occurred one evening in May 1966
in the small town of Via Maria, Argentina. And this is one of the more extensive cases I've heard in a very
long time. This witness, although he was a child at the time of his encounter,
describes it in incredible detail and had a lot of experiences on board this
craft. And he estimates he was there for days even though he was returned basically only 4 hours uh after his
encounter had basically four hours elapsed uh when he was returned back to his
location. But he feels that the events he experienced took much longer than
that. That's another pattern we see with these onboard cases. But let's just get to this one because it is interesting
for sure. The witness in this case as an adult is a taxi driver by the name of
Gerardo Sharf. His childhood life was extremely difficult and was perhaps the
reason for his encounter which occurred when he was very young. As Gerardo says,
"When I was 7 years old, my parents kicked me out of the house and I ended up working in a field at the end of
Buenes Ares Street. Now left to fend for himself, Gerorado was taken in by a
dairy farmer who employed him to work as a cow herd. Didn't really employ him.
Really, just kind of used him as a slave. Sadly, Gerardo was badly mistreated. He was given very little
food. He was forced to sleep on a mattress made of burlap sacks. He had to gather the pigs and the cows in the
pre-dawn hours. He did use a horse to round them up, but he said it was a miserable life. He received no payments.
He was abused horrendously. And he lived this way for 5 years. And as he says, it
was quote ugly. I'll just quote him directly. As he says, I had a terrible
time. I cried and prayed to the heavens and the stars for someone to help me,
for someone to come and help me because I was living like a dog or maybe worse.
Everything was bad for me. They punished me. They made me sleep far from the house. These people punished me badly.
They made me eat alone. I slept in a little shed. He would beat me up. I was
a slave. So at age 12, Gerard's prayers to the heavens were answered not by
angels, but by apparent extraterrestrials or perhaps celestial beings of some kind. He leaves the
interpretation open. But it was about 1:30 a.m. one evening in May 1966 that
all of this happened. At that time, there was a heavy drizzle. And as Gerardo says, I was preparing the
cattle. A white light, the likes of which I'd never seen before in my life,
filled the field. The whole field lit up, and right away, the cows got up and
headed off on their own towards the milking area. I didn't look up because I
was so scared. Gerardo told the owner of the farm about this, but he did not
believe him. The same thing happened the next night and the night after that and then a fourth time. It was always the
same. A huge bright light appeared overhead, lighting up the ground below. And in fact, on the fourth occasion, the
light was very bright. Gerard, of course, told his boss on each of these occasions, but again, he was not
believed. It was about one week later after these incidents when it happened
again, but this time it was very different. As Gerardo says, I began to
hear a strange sound and an even more powerful, more intense light. It's like
grabbing a flashlight and holding it really close. I heard a buzzing sound like when you hit a beehive and a
spaceship landed in front of me. It was a flying saucer approximately 20 m long
by 8 m wide. at 60 by 25 feet. And as Gerardo says, "Today I call them
spaceships and flying saucers, but at the time I didn't know how to describe it. I was a child who grew up in
poverty, who knew only the radio and had no explanation for it." So immediately,
Gerardo saw a door open in this craft spilling out a bright light. A very tall
being appeared in the doorway. Rotaro noticed that it had four fingers on each
hand and this being began to speak to him telepathically and it said, "Come,
don't be afraid." Gerard said the voice sounded both masculine and feminine. Gerard was
riding his horse at this time and was very frightened by this strange sight. So he started to kick the horse with his
heels to get her to move away, but the horse would not budge. Heard this voice
calling him by name. Gerardo, get down and come here. This did calm him down to
some extent, and he found himself dismounting and approaching the craft.
And this being told him again telepathically, "Come in." Now, Gerardo could see a sort of illuminated ladder
or staircase. It looked very unusual. He had trouble describing it. And he walked up to it to get inside this craft. And
as he says, "I was not abducted. I was invited. I was invited to board the
ship. They invited me to go out for a walk around the universe and to meet them. Now, he did describe these beings.
He said that they had very pale skin, dark black eyes, tiny little nose. He
said that they were quote tall, very thin, and all white. The head was large
compared to ours. He did say he never saw them blink. And as Gerardo says,
upon entering the ship, I saw two more beings, all seated as if they were ready
to fly. They were in seats which I had never seen before and would never see again, with buttons on the armrest. When
I tried to turn around to leave, there was no door. I stayed very still cuz I had no escape. Inside there was a fully
illuminated table. The floor was soft, white, and fluffy, padded like a carpet.
I can't fully describe what's inside the ship. Everything was very advanced. They
were as advanced as 2 million years ahead. Everything they do in the ship is strange. It's very strange. Very, very
advanced. I don't know how to explain it. Everything is very nice inside. It's an inexplicable thing. So, he tried to
describe it, but had a lot of difficulty. He said that once he was inside the ship, objects and furniture
and devices seemed to appear when they were needed and then just disappear back into the walls or the ceiling. He said
pipe-like devices came out of the ceiling and retracted. He actually didn't see any walls. Instead, as he
says, it was like everything was like light. I entered a place of light. He
didn't notice there were no hard edges. He said it looked vast inside, almost infinite. Shortly after he entered, they
used a device which appeared to levitate him and spin him around a little bit. This was very disorienting for him. And
although he was scared, he says the beings were not in the least threatening, but in fact very friendly.
And one by one, they came up and touched his head. They proceeded to show him sort of a hologram of little planets
rising out from the surface of this illuminated table. He also saw what looked to him like TV monitors on a
wall. He had never seen TVs at that point, but they then began to speak with
him about many things, all telepathically in his mind. He did try to speak verbally at first, but this
caused a bad headache and his headache vanished as he started to communicate with them telepathically. As he says,
that's how they spoke to each other and also to me. They asked me about everything about my life, what I was
doing, why I was there, and so on. So they asked him all about his job, about
how he was being mistreated. In fact, they spent quite a long time questioning him on every aspect of his life. And at
this point, they took him on a trip into apparently space. He had the impression that they were steering the ship with
the power of their minds. He said they turned a section of the craft transparent and he could look outside
and he saw stars. He saw the Earth far below him. They showed him what he now believes was the asteroid belt because,
as he says, I saw enormous rocks about the size of a house. They took him to
view the moon and the planet Saturn. He recognized the rings. Later on, at one
point, they landed on a planet, but at that age, with no real education, he
couldn't say where it was. He does remember a brief moment where it was hard for him to breathe, but this
passed. He saw reddish soil beneath him, very fine. He actually picked a little
bit up and let it drop. And eventually they brought him back inside the craft
again. They would turn the side transparent. They showed him other ships, what appeared to be an alien
city, which he said looked almost like glass or crystal towers with very tall buildings. He said there were different
colors, gray, green, and blue. He saw what looked like bridges between some of them. The beings didn't say anything
about where this city was or who lived there. Uh but at this point, more beings
appeared, and Gerardo once again became afraid. They of course told him not to
be afraid. And Gerardo's fear lessened when he was introduced to a much shorter
being. As Gerardo says, "At first, you're scared because you don't know
where you are. You don't know what they're going to do to you. But I calmed down when the little one appeared. They
always walked with their arms straight and their heads moving. They didn't run away or act violently. As soon as I
entered, they immediately controlled my mind, and I made friends in a way. I gained confidence since I was walking
around in a spaceship that had no walls. It was like another dimension." So he remembers at one point suddenly finding
himself unclothed and lying on a floating table. He remembered seeing
alien instruments, medical instruments of some kind that he had a lot of trouble describing. He remembered being
given a physical exam. He says they did something to his arm which left a small
scar on his arm. They did show him what he believes was the engine of the craft,
which again he was not really able to describe in detail other than he did touch it and said it had a very soft
texture. They showed him at one point an al cove where skeletons were being preserved. They told him that they
meaning these ETs or celestial beings have a normal life cycle like humans do
but live much longer. At some point, Gerardo said they also gave him food of
some kind. As he says, it was quote through a huge tube similar to a baby
bottle that had a strawberry flavor. Now, he's not sure how long he stayed
with them, but he believes it may have been as long as 10 days. That's how it felt to him, though he does admit he was
not aware of ever sleeping or going to the bathroom. At one point, he did remember seeing a symbol near some of
the doorways on the craft that resembled, he said, an upside down triangle or pyramid with an L and an
upside down U. They gave him all kinds of information. They told him that they came to Earth to take care of humanity.
They also shared some prophecies of the future. They told him that Earth's technology would develop very quickly,
which turned out, of course, to be true with cell phones and TVs and rocketry and all of this.
They said that the Vatican contained many hidden secrets and that they were not to be trusted, that they were lying.
They also warned him about another world war happening. They said that a time
would come eventually when they would return and show themselves to everybody. So, a lot more went on. It's a very
complicated case. But finally, they told him it was time to return. At this point, Gerardo cried. He begged them to
let him stay and told him that he was going to be punished if he went back. But they told him he had to return. But
they did say that they will be with him and will help him. And as Gerardo says,
suddenly I disappeared and I appeared sitting on the horse. I was riding on horseback towards the corral and it was
almost daylight now. So he estimates that about 4 hours passed. The owner of
the farm confronted him, asked him where he had been. He had been searching for him and couldn't find him and Guerrero
told him that he had been on a ship. The owner didn't believe it and actually struck him. Soon much of the experience
did leave his mind. But the good news is his life changed for the better from
that day forward. A mysterious stranger with long blonde hair and blue eyes
began to visit him regularly and provide him with food. Then this man would mysteriously disappear. Gerorado tried
to see where he was going, but he would just turn around and the man would be gone. The ship came back at one point
and this time the owner also saw it and this stopped the abuse. Gerardo was
never hit again. Wasn't long after that that he left the farm, found another place to live. He of course grew up and
became a taxi driver, but again had little or no memory of all of this experience. was only at age 67, decades
later, that the memories of the encounter spontaneously came back to him. He did undergo hypnotic regression
to see if he could recall more details. He didn't like it. He had to go back to
his very difficult childhood, which he found to be very traumatic. The onboard
encounter itself was very much benevolent. To this day, he wonders
about the nature and origin of these beings. He says that they called him themselves quote celestial beings. He
speculates that they might be extraterrestrials or even beings from the future. But he does feel that his
experience was although scary at times wholly benevolent. He didn't want to
leave them. But they said that he had to return to Earth. He now looks upon them as family. As he says, they were
friendly. They gave me love that I needed at that age. All the love they gave me. They gave me so much love. How
about that? I think we could actually label that case as a close encounter of the fifth kind because this witness was
basically calling out for help nightly, praying that someone could help him out of his situation. And he got help
perhaps not from angels, but from ETSs, though he leaves open the possibility of
who these beings were. He's really honestly not sure about it. But a truly
amazing case. I loved that he was helped so much by the ZTS that he described him
as very much loving that even following this encounter they remained in contact with him. So it's so interesting to me
that the details of this case left his mind and he lived most of his life
really without any memory of it and then suddenly his memory came back spontaneously.
So this case is getting a lot of recent attention. I did my best to get the details um from this case accurate
because most of the reports on this case are in another language. So, please
excuse me if I got a little bit of it out of order perhaps because it was difficult to put together, but I think
it's a really important and certainly a very fascinating case. And now let's
move to the next one. I call this one they were friendly. This one occurred in
July of 1974 in Fairview, New Jersey. This is a
multiple witness case. There aren't a whole lot of details to it, but I like this case not only because it's a
multiple witness case, but that the witness, the primary witness, was interviewed by a MUN field investigator.
I think that adds a level of credibility to it and she certainly felt like this was a legitimate case and it's got some
details to it that I think are really important. This case comes from certified MUON
field investigator and assistant state director for California, Linda Fleckner.
It's a rare multiple witness onboard UFO encounter involving three people.
Although Linda was only able to interview one of the witnesses as the other two are now deceased.
Unfortunately, the case is also somewhat sparse on details, but it still, I think, represents a profound example of
an onboard encounter. I'll call the main witness Corey. That is a pseudonym. It
was a Saturday morning in July of 1974. As the witnesses, three teenage boys,
decided to go play basketball near a fire station again in Fair View, New
Jersey. They had started playing around 6:00 a.m. They continued for about 3
hours and then around 9:00 a.m. began to walk home and they were heading towards one of their homes which was near a
park. Now, normally this park was crowded with lots of cars and anywhere from 50 to 100 people. But strangely,
this area appeared to be totally deserted. That was the first strange thing that happened. But the stranges
was just beginning because at this point they looked up and saw a quote shining
silver metallic saucer with round tinted windows. Cory was the first to see it.
And as the investigator Linda Fleckner says, he alerted his two friends who
also saw the craft. He heard and felt a worring and roaring, and his shirt was
flapping as if in a 50 mph wind, but there was no wind. They were paralyzed
and could not run. So suddenly, without warning, Cory found himself inside a
large room, which he estimates was about 400 ft across. This was, of course, much
larger than the craft had appeared from the outside. Cory was standing up and
about 30 feet away he saw his two friends lying on quote operating tables.
He said there were about 25 gray type ETs in various locations. Each was about
4 feet tall. He said gray skin, large round heads, and large black eyes. He
said 10 or 15 of the grays were kind of around him but the others were around
his two friends. And as Linda the researcher says, the creatures were
touching him all over. They were speaking telepathically and were surprised when they realized that he
could hear them. His impression was that they were friendly and curious and meant no harm. He believed that they were
trying to help his two friends who both had heart problems and he believes that their lives may have been extended by
the aid rendered on the craft. He remembers looking out the window and down onto the basketball court where
they had been playing. He could see other beings moving about in long corridors.
And that's really all he remembers. The next thing Cory recalls is being back where they had been taken and then
watching this craft ascend up into the sky. As Linda says, moved up and to the
right, then left, then up and away, leaving behind a rainbow colored trail
behind. The next thing Cory knew, they were arriving back at his friend's house. Now, neither of his two friends
had any memory whatsoever of being on board the ship. All they could remember was seeing the craft from the outside.
They had no memory of walking home. Only Corey remembered the onboard segment.
Now, upon arriving home, Cory's mother looked at him and immediately noticed that he quote seemed changed. Corey told
his mother, "It's no big deal, Mom." But he never spoke about the incident to her or really to anyone. He did of course
later confide his story to researcher Linda Fleckner that his mother once told
him that there was psychic ability in their family and he wondered if perhaps that was why he was able to hear the
beings speak telepathically. But yeah, he kept his encounter secret for decades because as Linda says, he
did not believe that anyone would believe him. But of course, he did eventually tell his two daughters. And
in 2023, a full 49 years after the encounter, he reported it to Muan and shared his story
with investigator Linda Fleckner. Such an amazing case. And even though I
covered it in what, 10 minutes or so, I suspect the witness could write a whole book about what happened to him. Most
people keep quiet about this. I think it's really interesting that it was his
impression that his friends were being brought on board to assist with their
heart issues. We do see that in a number of cases. Also interesting to me is that
the witness's mother talks about psychic ability. It's another pattern we see among contactees that they do have
psychic ability. Just a lot of interesting details to that case. And here's another one that I found
particularly fascinating. I'm guessing you haven't heard of it before. It's an important case though because well, this
one's a little different. I call this one They Only Wanted to Help Me. This
occurred on February 28, 1984 in Guildford, England. And this is an
interesting case for a number of reasons. One is that it appears to be a one-off. This witness was in the right
place at the right time to have an encounter, or so it would appear. This very interesting case comes from UFO
researcher Captain Gordon Millington. He was the chairman of Saigap, the Suriri
Investigative Group on Aerial Phenomena. This is in England and he was also a consultant for the Flying Saucer Review.
He's the author of the book Alien Encounters. And the information for this case comes
from an article which appeared in the winter 1994 issue of the Flying Saucer
Review. The witness is known only by his pseudonym Tom Frasier. At the time of
his encounter, he was living with his parents in Farnum Suri, England. He was 17 years old, and it was around 8:00
p.m. on February 28, 1984. This was a dark night. There were low
clouds, a gentle drizzle, so no stars were visible. And Tom was driving his
motorcycle near the town of Guildford. And this is when tragedy struck. As Tom
says, I was involved in a road accident. A car struck me and I was thrown off my
motorbike. I was unconscious before I hit the ground. But my last clear memory
was of a bright light in the sky to my right. Now Tom assumed that he would wake up in a hospital, but to his
amazement, that was not what happened. Instead, he found himself inside what
appeared to be an extraterrestrial craft. As Tom says, I came too. I could
see a bright light about me, and as my eyes focused, I saw three beings looking
at me. The first thing I remember about them is their oversized, hairless heads.
They were quite pale complexioned with a sort of off-white, light gray pigmentation.
Their eyes, though quite similar to human eyes, were tilted up slightly. The
pupils were diamond shaped and at about a 45Â° angle. They were about 4 to 4 and
1/2 ft in height and I was lying on a sort of a bed. I could see another like
it to the left of me in the room and there was a body on it, motionless and apparently unconscious. But the strange
thing is that it looked remarkably like myself. I have the impression that there
were only two of these beds in my room. There was a raised control panel in the
center of the room and someone standing at this could look at both the beds. The beings were standing behind this control
console and one appeared to be operating it with the two others standing behind him. I have the impression of a leader
and helpers situation in this room. So it looked to Tom like the man on the other bed that looked like himself was
actually deceased. At this point the beings began to communicate telepathically with Tom. As Tom says, I
could hear words saying that they were going to heal me and that I should not worry, but their mouths were not moving.
I now believe that these beings were communicating telepathically. I could sense no malice or hostility from them
and felt that they only wanted to help me. I laid my head back and fell asleep.
So, an undetermined amount of time later, Tom reawakened. And as he says,
"When I awoke, I was told that my injuries had been extensive, but that they had been able to cure them. They
also said I was lucky that they had been observing the area, that they were able to help me. I was told I would feel
tired for a while, and that I should rest. Then I fell asleep again. When I
reawakened, I saw that the other body had been removed, and I saw no other humans aboard the craft. I found myself
dressed in some clothing similar to that of the beings themselves. It had a metallic sheen to it and was grayish in
color, but there were no buttons or zippers. Perhaps it had some sort of velcro seams. So Tom also remembers
getting a good look at the interior of the craft and describes it in similar ways to what other contactees report. As
Tom says, the corridors had no form of lighting such as we would use, for the
walls in the ceiling emitted light and there were no shadows. I also have an impression of another room with a
control bridge with one or two entrances. One being was working at a raised panel while two others operated
some controls. There was a display panel on one wall. I also have vague memories
of what I think was some sort of maintenance or docking bay, a large area with two or three craft in it. So Tom
does feel that his encounter was totally benevolent, that the purpose for his encounter was all about healing. As he
says, "At no time do my memories indicate any hostile act, maltreatment,
or any intention of acting harmfully towards me. One very strong impression I
retain is of the leader asking for my help in something. I agreed to help, but
I do not now know what I agreed to. One of them said that they would have to break my arm as it would look too
strange if I walked away with no injuries after being hit headon by a car
and thrown off my motorbike into some trees. I agreed to all of this.
So following the accident, Tom was taken directly to Epsom Hospital just a few miles away from the accident site. His
injuries included a severe fracture of the upper third of the right humorous
and some nerve damage. Later he did get a severe infection which resulted in the
loss of most of his right elbow, he said. But it was about five or six hours after the crash that he regained full
consciousness in his hospital room. and he is now convinced that the ETSs not only healed him but that they saved his
life. As Tom says, the staff were puzzled that I had only a broken arm as
my motorbike was very severely damaged. I believe I should have died in that accident, but for some unknown reason, I
did not. How amazing is that? I know of a number of cases where people were
rescued by ETSs certainly healed. That's not at all unusual. But to actually have
your life saved is definitely unusual. But I will say I've got a number of cases of that as well. It's also an
interesting case because he remembers it fully consciously. In fact, we see that
in all of these cases, these people recalled their events without the aid of
hypnosis. Although one of them did use hypnosis to recall some details, he already remembered quite a bit of it. I
think that's an important point, an important distinction because it really lays to rest all skeptics's arguments
that this is all false memory syndrome brought out by regressive hypnosis. That's simply not true. And this case is
so amazing to me because he this witness again appeared to be in the right place at the right time and he was very lucky
to be pulled on board and have his life saved. So interesting. Now let's move to
the next case. I call this one we're just curious. This one occurred on
October 13, 1994 in Buffalo, New York. This case is in
many ways your sort of typical onboard experience where the witness is physically examined, but she describes
it so sincerely and so clearly that I think it's an important case that definitely adds to our knowledge of what
it's like to have an onboard UFO encounter. This case is somewhat brief
and it was reported to the mutual UFO network MUON by the witness about 30
years after it occurred, but it's still an interesting case with some important details, and it really shows how
profoundly an onboard experience can affect a person physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually. The witness is anonymous. I'll call her Natalie. This is, of course, a
pseudonym. At the time of her encounter, Natalie was a freshman in college and
she was living in a dorm room in Buffalo, New York. This was on October
13, 1994. And as Natalie says in her own words, "I
was asleep when I started to feel a pulling, a strong suction on my body. As
it was pulling me, I did not feel as if I could resist or move. I was almost frozen, but without pain, just the
pressure of the suction. And then I had the sense that I was being pulled out of the room, out of my dorm room window.
Then I woke up in a different place. When I came to or woke up again, I was
on a metal table surrounded by beings, but not human beings. I was on some sort
of examining table, and they were all around me. I don't know how many, but approximately six or seven. They were
smaller than humans with bigger eyes, black eyes, and dark gray bodies, almost
the color of shark skin. The most vivid memories from this experience involved being on that table, feeling the metal,
and feeling that I could not leave or move. I was terrified. And my communications with them because the
message or communication was very clear and warm and friendly. But they did not use English words. They talked to me
without words, almost as if they placed the information in my brain with their minds. And what they said was, "Don't be
scared. We won't hurt you. We're just curious." And then my body felt calm,
but it seemed like it came from them, as if they did something to calm me. I don't know how to explain it. And then I
lost time again, and I woke up in my dorm room in my bed. Now, these beings
do appear to be the typical grays. And at first, Natalie told nobody what happened, but it was less than a week
after the encounter that she did discover a strange mark on her body, and this encouraged her to seek another
opinion. As Natalie says, I noticed a weird mark on my top right butt cheek.
It looked like and still looks like this today, like someone took a scoop of skin out of my body. The weirdest part is
that it didn't hurt and it didn't bleed or bruise. It was just there all of a sudden. I told my mom about it and she's
actually the first person who suggested it was an abduction. The weirdest part is that I had not even told her about
the other part of the story where I was sucked out of the room and placed on that metal table. Before I told her any
of that, she told me that she had read a book about UFOs and there were people that had tissue taken, that the marks
that were left on their bodies looked like the mark on my body. So ultimately,
Natalie does feel that this experience was positive, but nevertheless, it is something that she keeps secret from
almost everyone. As she says, "I've never formally reported this to anyone.
I've only shared it with very close friends, my mother and a doctor due to the unexplained skin and tissue removal.
I think about this experience from time to time, but always with fondness because they, the extraterrestrials,
seemed like kind beings and tried to calm me. I don't talk about it very
often because the few times that I have talked about it with people that are not close trusted friends like once in art
school was not a great experience and people remarked that I was making it up or doing it for attention. But the truth
is that it's a lonely thing to experience something so unreal, something you cannot explain and not
have anyone to talk to about it. It's just case after case. Again, you can dismiss one, but there's always another
to take its place. It's really interesting to me that this witness feels that this experience was, although
scary, absolutely benevolent. And really, the hardest part about dealing with it has been trying to share the
experience with other people who are skeptical. That's such a shame. There's still a hostile climate surrounding this
subject. witnesses who come forward find themselves not only being disbelieved
but ridiculed or gaslit. That is really a a darn shame because I think our own
governments know that this is a real subject and very disingenuously they're
putting forth the idea that all of these experiences can be explained away as
hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, and mental illness. All the while knowing fully that it's a completely
real subject. I think all of us have become victims of the UFO cover up and
it's time that it ends because this is a subject that's very important and should absolutely be taken seriously if only
because so many people are having experiences like this. And here's another one which I call I was extremely
scared. This one occurred on June 16, 2002 in Blanchard, Oklahoma. It's
relatively recent. Some of you say, "Oh, where are all the recent cases?" Oh, they're there. And you can see that I
report them in many of my episodes. Uh, this is a case that does involve
multiple witnesses. And you can see that the title of this one is absolutely
accurate because the witnesses did have quite a bit of fear with their encounter and it affected them profoundly for a
very long time and probably still to this day. This case does involve two
witnesses, but only one has stepped forward. The witness is anonymous. I'll just call him Ethan. Again, that's a
pseudonym. His experiences have not been officially investigated, but he does provide his firsthand testimony. He was
9 years old at the time of his encounter and he was having a family get together at his grandmother's house located just
off Highway 78 in the countryside outside of Blanchard, Oklahoma. Her
house had a long driveway, was a large piece of property with lots of trees, almost no houses around, and had many of
wide open areas and a pond. So, after eating and talking and playing, Ethan
and his cousin announced that they were going to take a walk to the pond. At this point, it was 9:45 p.m. on June 16,
2002. So, they left the house and walked about 100 ft from the house. And this is when
things began to get weird. As Ethan says, we both started to feel vibration
in our body, but didn't think too much of it. We walked maybe 15 more feet and
we were completely blind. We both saw nothing but black. We backed up and we
could see normally again. It was dark outside but not pitch black. You could still see some. We looked at each other
and said, "That's weird." and blew it off. We kept walking 5 to 10 more feet
and it goes pitch black. Now, at this point, they can't see, but they both
heard a swishing noise, as if something was moving at super fast speeds. Their
vision immediately returned, and they could now see a quote, huge discshaped
craft, and as Ethan, the witness, says, it was black with a chrome-like finish,
and I want to say windows around it with every color you could think of coming from inside the craft. It was moving
northnortheast to the right of us. We were walking east. It hovered approximately 15 feet away at tree
height for 30 seconds and then descended to an open area of trees and landed. At
this point, we were extremely terrified. We couldn't move. We felt locked in
place and having our thoughts scanned. A door opened up, popping out from the top
and periodically turning inside itself until it touched the ground.
Now, at this point, some strange beings emerged from the craft. As Ethan says,
three beings with big heads and huge eyes stepped out and walked up to me.
They looked like what most people call grays. The next thing I know, I'm inside
the craft on a table with the three beings looking at me. There was a human-looking being standing to my right
side. I'm not sure if it was human or not. Ethan was also able to get a good
look at the room he was in. There wasn't much to it. As he says, the walls looked
metallic, but also looked like if you touched them, you would fall through. There wasn't much in the room besides, I
want to say, a bathtub looking thing with black goo looking stuff inside it.
Now, the next thing Ethan knew, he was being physically examined. as he says,
"While I'm lying on the table, the grays stared at me, getting inches from my face. I blacked out and the next thing I
know, I'm looking up at the sky at it, hovering tree height. It was like I went
back in time or something. I was extremely scared." Me and my cousin ran
frantically back to the back door, running into the house. This took what we thought wasn't 1 minute or 1 minute
and a half. As we ran in, our family were worried, asking us where we have
been, saying that they were looking for us for an hour and a half. So, that was
shocking because it did not seem that long to them. But it was then that Ethan and his cousin noticed some alarming
physiological effects. As Ethan says, I had scars on me and I was bleeding down
my arm and my head. My cousin had bruises and was bleeding on his knee. We
never told them what we had encountered. Now, Ethan does say that this encounter
was the first of several, the most recent being on July 26, 2015, which he
said was a very moving encounter, but he does not provide any details. He says he
reported this childhood encounter because, as he says, I need some support or help. Like many people who have these
experiences, it has taken somewhat of an emotional toll on him. as he says, "This
is really making me feel out of place here on Earth. I would like to tell my other encounters, but I need reassurance
that this isn't going to cause me to lose my life." My heart goes out to this witness. You can see he's still having a
very hard time dealing with this, but I think it's an important case. He describes what it's like inside a craft.
And it's interesting to me because often people will see rooms that are very much sparse. there's not a whole lot in there
and this is exactly what he's reporting or feeling like the walls are different.
Uh it's just so fascinating to me how these details turn up again and again
from cases that are widely separated in time and geographically.
All these incredible commonalities and similarities I think argue for the credibility of these cases. These are
details that you couldn't just make up and people are describing them over and over again. So now let's move to the
final case in this compilation. I call this one it got extremely bizarre. This
one occurred one evening in midocctober of 2010 in Harley'sville, Pennsylvania.
And there's a lot of fascinating aspects to this encounter. For me, one of the most interesting was how this witness
described what we call the Oz effect, an eerie silence surrounding a witness when
they suddenly have an experience like this. And he described it in incredible detail. I think really illustrating what
it's like right prior to being taken on board, but also described the interior
of this craft and all the things that happened to him. It's a fascinating case. This case is also a single witness
case. The witness is anonymous. I'll call him Frank. That's a pseudonym. At the time of his encounter, Frank was 19
years old, almost 20. And he lived in a house located in Harley'sville, Pennsylvania.
The house used to be an old office building, and Frank's bedroom had a fire escape exit complete with a metal
platform, railing, and metal stairs leading down to the ground. And Frank would often use the fire escape when he
wanted to smoke a cigarette as his landlord forbade any smoking in the house. Now, the door to this fire escape
had an old-fashioned push bar with no doororknob on the outside. So, if he went out there, he had to prop the door
open or he would be locked outside. This is an important detail given what happened next. was one evening in
midocctober 2010. He stayed up late playing video games and around 1:00 am
went to sleep dressed only in his boxers. He was tired and fell asleep quickly. And the next thing he knew,
Frank woke up suddenly to find himself standing outside his bedroom on this
metal railing of the fire escape. He was very groggy, somewhat confused, and he
started looking around to orient himself because he had no memory of how he had gone outside. And furthermore, the door
leading back into his bedroom was now closed, leaving him locked outside. He
considered the possibility that he had been sleepwalking like he used to when he was a young kid, but that hadn't
happened since he was 8 years old, and now he was totally awake. And as Frank
says, I almost immediately noticed something very, very large above me. After this initial confusion, I felt the
urge to look up at this large object hovering above me. I noticed it was sort of rounded in shape, but had many, many
lights on the underside of it. It was directly above me, so I had no view of the sides of the object. The lights were
a very, very bright white, nothing like any fluorescent bulb I have ever seen.
These lights were flashing without any pattern, it seemed, and were located all over the underside of the object in
rectangular and trapezoidal shapes. Now, this object, he estimates, was at
least 250 ft in diameter, possibly larger. The bottom had what looked like
weird protrusions, but they were very hard to make out or identify as the
lights were so blindingly bright that he had to actually shield his eyes. The
surface looked like a very dark gray black color. Another thing he noticed was that the object made absolutely no
sound, but it was more than that. The area around him was also eerily silent.
And as Frank says, it was as if it, the object, was making everything around it
completely quiet. There were no sounds made after I noticed the object above me. This was extremely strange since my
home is on a main road and relatively close to the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
Hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. The silence was almost
suffocating. It felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup.
There was no wind. It was as if time had stopped in its tracks. Though Frank estimates that this craft was hovering
maybe 20 to 40 feet overhead and was so large that it stretched out over the
tree next to his house and out over the neighbor's roof so that he could really only see a portion of it. And as Frank
says, I observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before I became very
disoriented. I forgot what I was doing, where I was, and who I was. It was
almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. The last thing
I can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. I had
never experienced this before, but it was as if I was suddenly weightless. My
feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform, and I was no longer shielding my eyes. As soon as I was
blinded by the flashing lights, I seemed to lose consciousness. Unless the lights caused me to forget everything, leaving
me with no memory of anything afterwards. Now, the next thing Frank knew, he was waking up someplace else.
As he says, "After I lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. I remember
waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. I was
lying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. My eyes were not working correctly, though.
It was as if I had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. Everything was
very blurry and distorted. I remember very little, but I do remember everything was a green, brown, gray
color around me. I also remember seeing strange objects above me that appear to
be tools or examination equipment, none of which seemed to be created by humans.
It was very blurry, though, so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was. I then remember a figure moved into
view above me. I was unable to move at all. My vision was very poor, so I could
discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than I am, and it had appendages like a human
being, arms, torso, head, legs, etc. Now, it was at this point that the being
began to communicate with Frank telepathically. As Frank says, it did
not speak to me. However, I seemed to hear a voice in my head. It was much less a voice than it was a feeling or
emotion being conveyed. The very last thing I can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to
help me in some sort of way. The trying to help you feeling was much less about
me in particular, but more of a you as in your race. I then saw one of the
objects above me move slightly, and I lost consciousness again. The next thing
Frank knew, he was back in his bedroom. As he says, "When I came too, I was
sitting on the edge of my bed. My bed was made very neatly, as if I had never laid down at all that night. When I
looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45 a.m. I tried to remember how
I got there, but nothing came to mind. I tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than I could even keep up
with. I could not sleep that night no matter how hard I tried. The only thing I kept asking myself was why wasn't I
scared or afraid throughout this entire experience. So, this encounter left Frank with more questions than answers.
But to this day, he still thinks about it. As Frank says, "I always thought the
UFO phenomenon was a bunch of crap before this experience. Since this
experience, I have been haunted and have wanted to tell somebody, but I've always been too afraid of being called a
crackpot. The only person I ever told this story to is my best friend, and he
is probably the only person who will ever know who I am and what I witnessed. I am not trying to garner attention in
any way, shape, or form. This is why I am choosing to remain anonymous. I just
hope that maybe this can help somebody understand things a little better, even if I cannot understand any of this
myself. There you go, another onboard encounter. It's funny to me that
skeptics will say, "Oh, people are just trying to get attention." No, they're not. They don't want attention and they
almost always request anonymity, particularly when it's when it's an onboard UFO encounter. These are people
who are just searching for answers. people who had an experience that they know is important and feel that people
deserve to know the truth about it. They're not asking for money or fame. Exactly the opposite. So any arguments
of that people are just seeking attention is ridiculous. They're not. So
there you go. Seven cases of people who've been taken on board a craft coming from all over the world. all
different kinds of people, different types of ETSs, and yet the commonalities
with all of these experiences, I think, argue for their credibility. And as we
see, each case has their own unique elements, little details that perhaps
have never been heard before or are only rarely reported. This is why each case
is important. each adds to our knowledge of who these visitors are, where they come from, why they're here, and most
importantly turn, like I said in the beginning, the unknown into the known. I think it's the
fear of the unknown that is largely the cause of all the confusion and fear
surrounding this subject. Once we know what to expect, it's not as scary. At least, I hope so.
At any rate, I think that these onboard cases show pretty clearly that they're
not here to hurt, harm, scare, or take over or anything like that. While it can
be very scary, as we've seen in this this compilation here, some of these people are apparently being healed. So,
I think that argues for the benevolence of the ETSs. And remember, they've been around here since recorded history and
very likely a lot longer than that. I think that's an important detail. So, I
just don't buy our government's fear-based narrative that they're coming
here to take over or hurt anybody or anything like that. I do know people who
have had what they feel is an absolutely negative encounter. And it's their encounter. So, they absolutely have the
right to interpret it the way they want it. But having interviewed hundreds of people and having exempt case after case
after case, I'm very encouraged about ET contact and I think it's good news for humanity. But again, I'm just reporting
the cases in a factual, unbiased way. I'm trying to choose cases
that I think are lesser known, cases that are well vetted, cases that have something to add to our knowledge of
what's going on here. And again, you can make up your own mind about it, but I do thank you for watching. I truly
appreciate it. Again, this is a very important subject and I think it deserves a lot more attention than it's
getting. So, thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions,
keep searching for the truth, and most important of all, keep having fun. I'll see you next week. Bye for now.
