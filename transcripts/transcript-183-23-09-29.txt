IF YOU CALL THEM, THEY WILL COME: THREE TRUE CE5 CASES WITH HUMANOIDS
Sep 29, 2023

Summary:
Sep 29, 2023
There are many different kinds of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences, and more. Cases can be broken down into categories such as close encounters of the first, second, third and fourth kind. Then there are close encounters of the fifth kind, or human-initiated encounters. This unique category can contain all the other types of encounters, but is differentiated from them because the encounters themselves are the result of humans reaching out to ETs. Cases like these are important because they show that humans can develop an interactive relationship with the UFO phenomenon and the ETs. This video presents three extensive true cases of CE-5 contact that go beyond simple sightings and resulted in actual face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.

SOMETHING NOT OF THIS EARTH. In Jun of 1996, Jeneva Sterling drove to a remote location in the mountains of Santa Clarita, CA to seek answers about the many issues in her life. Depressed, she screamed out to the skies, “Why is life so crappy?! Why am I here?!” At that moment, a brilliant light appeared behind and moved towards her. Soon it was close enough to see it wasn’t any conventional craft. In fact, it was almost totally silent. Then it hovered directly overhead and beamed her with light. Thinking she was about to be abducted, Jeneva collapsed to the ground and trembled with fear. The beam retracted, but the strange light stayed overhead, making a low buzzing noise. Jeneva had never been so scared in her life, but soon her fear began to pass, and the object moved closer. Jeneva began to speak to it. Before long, her fear left and she realized that the UFO was not going to hurt her. In fact, the whole experience became deeply moving and spiritually transformative. The object remained there all night long, communing with Jeneva and totally lifting her out of her depression. When sunrise came, the UFO zoomed off. Jeneva, however, was forever changed. She became interested in UFOs and remote viewing, and began having vivid dreams of being onboard a UFO. And then, one day, the UFO returned.

A LOVE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. Hector Sawiak had never seen a UFO. But in Mar 2015, he heard about sightings near his home in San Juan, Argentina. He decided to go out hiking and try to have an encounter. Unfortunately, nothing showed up. But that night, after going to bed, he woke up to hear his name being called in his head. He jumped up and went to the window in time to see a brilliant UFO streak across the sky. He was amazed. Had the UFO occupants woken him up to show their craft? A few months later, Hector was asleep in bed when the room filled with light. Waking up, he was terrified to see two tall ETs standing in the doorway. They were slender, with dark eyes and large bald heads, and wore olive-green jumpsuits. “Don’t be afraid,” they said. “We are not going to hurt you.” Hector’s fear evaporated and instead, he felt “a love like never before.” One of the ETs approached his bedside and said, “I have come to heal you.” Hector cried with intense joy and gratitude as the ETs gave him a tiny pill and told him to swallow it. The next thing he knew, it was morning. Hector knew his life would never be the same.

IN THE COMPANY OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS. In Apr 2015, 14-year-old Abdiel saw the TV show, Hangar One, all about UFOs. The subject immediately intrigued him. UFOs were real? He could hardly believe it. If they were real, he thought, he wanted to see one. One week later, he was in his backyard in Puerto Rico, when a bright light caught his eye, a golden-yellow object was moving across the sky. It was a UFO! Abdiel was amazed. He had expressed a desire to see a UFO one week earlier, and then one had appeared. That couldn’t be a coincidence. Before long he had another sighting. This was followed by weird knocks on the window of his home. Shortly later, he was amazed to see a strange circle in his backyard, just as if a UFO had landed there. Later he found another strange mark in the grass that looked like an ET head. Could the ETs be trying to contact with him? A few days later, Abdiel got his answer. Going into his backyard to inspect the marks on his lawn, he was shocked to observe a strange humanoid run across his yard. It was short, brown in color, with a large triangular-shaped bald head and big, dark, round eyes. It was an ET. Soon, more sightings would follow, and this time, his camera was ready.

These three cases all qualify as close encounters of the 5th kind. In each case, people reached out to the ETs and received a dramatic unmistakable response. These cases show just how closely ETs are watching over all of us, and that if a person asks for contact, they can initiate their own encounter and experience the UFO phenomenon firsthand. These three cases are covered in detail in my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
the title of this episode is if you call them they will come three true ce5 cases with humanoids 
there are of course many different categories of UFO encounters we have SIMPLE sightings Landings 
face-to-face encounters and of course onboard UFO experiences Jay Allen heineck often called 
the father of modern ufology broke down UFO cases into a few main categories including 
Close Encounters of the first kind second third and even The Fourth Kind there is also a newer 
category Close Encounters of the fifth kind and these are human initiated encounters and 
that's what I want to talk about today I've got three cases in which people initiated encounters 
and these are quite profound they have a lot to say I think about the ETS and how responsive 
they are and about ourselves too and these are not just simple sightings each of these cases that I'm 
going to be talking about today involve humanoids and or in one of them in on board UFO encounter 
so this goes to show that yeah if you reach out to et's they can and will respond certainly in a 
lot of cases I have many cases of this this kind these three are particularly profound all three of 
them come from my brand new book humanoids and Phi strangeness these cases are fairly recent 
one is from 1996. the other two are from 2015 and all three are widespread geographically speaking 
one is from California the other is from San Juan Argentina and the third is from Puerto Rico 
so these cases are super interesting and I think you'll find them to be not only fascinating but 
having some profound insights into what it's like to have UFO contact and again they show that if 
you reach out to et's they do respond often in the first case I'd like to talk about took place in 
Santa Clarita California this took place actually over a number of years starting in 1992 but the 
main experience took place in 1996 and I call this one something not of this Earth it was 1988 
when Geneva Sterling had just graduated from high school and she joined a group of about 15 friends 
to have an informal graduation party up in the mountains of Santa Clarita this is in California 
that discovered this cement helicopter landing pad which was part of an old abandoned Nike missile 
base way up in the wilderness this was accessible from the 14th freeway but far enough away to not 
be harassed by the police their parents or any other people and as Geneva says it was 
the perfect place to camp out and it was large enough for all of us to have plenty of room to sleep on a real remote area you basically can't see anything but mountains and stars 
so it was late in the evening and everyone was having a good time when Geneva heard someone cry out oh my god did you see that someone else said what was that someone else like said 
what the hell was that thing so Geneva of course Whirled around to see if everyone was looking at 
and as she says of course I just happened to be looking the other way at the time and I missed 
it but about 10 of my friends saw something that looked like a shooting star flying through the 
sky and it abruptly stopped on a dime turned and started flying in the opposite direction and then 
it stopped again shot back across the sky going back the way it came from then darting back again 
so this was clearly not a shooting star those who had seen it were jumping up and down 
the word UFO came up several times but Geneva was mad because she says I was pretty upset 
that I missed this event especially since all my friends talked about it for years to come 
at that time I had no idea what my future had in store for me so she didn't get to see the UFO and 
she just went on with her life she grew up got a job got a boyfriend moved with him into an 
apartment in Studio City California now Geneva loved to go camping and often she would go out 
with her friends or even alone and just camp out for the weekend enjoying nature in the wilderness 
and many times she went up to that same helicopter pad and spent the night there 
sleeping under the stars and then one day in late June of 1996 Geneva who was then 25 years old 
and her boyfriend got into a heated argument at that time her life wasn't going that well 
she was already stressed out and somewhat depressed and his argument became a Tipping Point 
and as Geneva says in her own words I was emotionally not doing that great 
I was so depressed and I was so upset that at that point I had to get out of the house 
I grabbed my sleeping bag and pillow and I was just going to find a place to camp and I remember 
that helicopter landing pad so I decided in my depressed upset state that I was going to drive 
up there and spend the night this was just an impulsive decision Geneva didn't know it but this 
decision would have profound consequences that would affect her for the rest of her life she had 
her snacks water warm clothes and sleeping gear all packed up and drove off to this destination 
now this was not super close to where she lived and by the time she arrived it was getting close to midnight it was a warm clear night there were no lights around so the Stars shone brilliantly 
but this drive had done little to soothe her nerves she was still upset and crying but she 
remembered that A co-worker of hers had talked about something called Primal scream therapy 
so Geneva decided she would try to give it a try and as she says so I stood up and I just started 
screaming at the top of my lungs and then it turned into this uncontrollable sobbing and 
screaming I was just out there bearing it all to the universe and really intentionally trying to 
just let go of all the emotion that I was holding inside I was just screaming until I was losing 
my breath it was just me and the Universe I was having a conversation with the universe 
so she was screaming out to whoever was listening why are we here why is life so crappy 
what the f am I doing here so she was giving out a lot of swear words as well I'm toning it down a 
little bit but yeah Geneva yelled vented and threw an honest to God tantrum for a full 20 minutes 
and this is Primal screen therapy and she's says that it actually worked and she says it 
did feel really good it felt like such a huge release like a big catharsis 
unknown to her she wasn't expecting this but apparently someone heard her because it was at 
this moment that she saw a quick flash of bright light coming from behind a mountain to the east 
and she says it made me look in that direction but flashed strangely and it caught my eye and 
then I saw a bright light pop up really fast from behind the mountain and then it went down again 
so this caught her attention she stared at it puzzled watched as this light popped up again 
and Rose quickly upward she says it was odd it was unusually bright I watched it as it started flying 
in my direction now at this point it was still pretty far away she estimates at least a few miles 
but it was slowly moving in a straight line directly towards her and as it got closer she 
could see it was sending down This brilliant beam of white light right onto the mountain they're 
being kind of spread out like a cone Illuminating the ground below and she's thinking to herself is 
this a helicopter what is it doing out here this time of night what is it looking for so she was 
totally distracted by it and focused her intention on this object because it was so intensely bright 
and it certainly looked as if it was looking for something then she thought to herself kind 
of with embarrassment what if somebody heard her screaming what if somebody called the police and 
they'd sent out a helicopter looking for her so that kind of was her thought process at this time 
she was also thinking you know would the place even send out a helicopter this late at night 
and how would they even know where to look who could possibly have heard her no but it was coming 
closer and closer and she thought to herself well it looks like a place helicopter and it 
might be landing right on this exact landing pad because this object was continuing its approach 
and it soon became close enough that she could see the colors of the plants and the 
terrain as the beam scanned the Mountainside back and forth again a really remote area 
and as it got closer and closer it became clear to her that this object was targeting her that a 
must know that it's but she was there so when it got to within a half mile and then a quarter mile 
she started to get a little nervous soon it was no more than a few thousand feet away still shining 
down its spotlight and this is when she noticed something very strange there was no noise no 
helicopter noise whatsoever she realized this could not be a helicopter but what could it be 
and it still moved closer and as Geneva says in her own words 
here is where I started to panic like really Panic it's getting closer and closer and I don't know 
if I've ever been that scared in my life I was very scared and then it gets right in front of 
me and it finds me the Searchlight shines right on me blinding me and at that point I was just 
completely terrified I felt my knees Buckle under me and I went into kind of a kneeling position 
I dropped onto my knees and covered myself I just sat there staring up into the sky my whole body 
was trembling I couldn't fathom what was going on so Geneva was absolutely paralyzed with fear crazy 
thoughts raced through her head she's wondering you know could this be an angel is this a spirit 
is it a being of some kind an alien is she about to be abducted is she going to die I mean she was 
absolutely out of her mind one thing she knew that that this was not something of this Earth 
but she didn't know what it was she had no preparation for this then after what seemed like forever but was probably only a few minutes she says this 
Spotlight retracted but this object hung right in front of her very close only about 500 feet away 
at this point she noticed it wasn't perfectly still it had a kind of rocking motion like 
a ship on the waves and she could now hear a soft thrumming or humming noise 
kind of like a hive of bees she says but a little bit deeper with kind of a low vibration 
so she's staring at this object trying to figure out what it is and as she says it looked like a 
bright silvery white light it was very close close enough and bright enough that it was 
Illuminating the hills around me I just sat there staring at it scared out of my mind wondering what 
the hell it was my mind was just racing and it just stayed there definitely watching me 
it felt like I was being observed my body was just trembling and trembling so this object 
wasn't going away she had nowhere to go she's just staring upwards barely daring to breathe 
watching it as it watched her her whole body still trembled and this object stayed there and after 
about a half an hour the fear just sort of swept through her and her Panic began to slowly subside 
and she did her best to accept the fact that something very unusual was happening to her and it 
wasn't the darn thing she could do about it and as she says I sat there with it for a long time not 
saying anything I started to calm down have more rational thoughts and stopped feeling so scared 
finally I just went into surrender mode like if I die I die I'm in this experience right now and I 
don't know why but there's nothing I can do about it I'm too scared to move so I'm just going to 
sit here and see what happens and if I die I die so finally I just decided to start talking to it 
so at this point Geneva took a few deep breaths tried to stop herself from shaking and said hello 
what are you doing here what do you want from me I don't understand what's going on 
are you going to take me away are you going to kill me what is going on and when she did this 
something very interesting happened this object moved Closer by a few hundred feet she could 
hear the whirring sound kind of increase in Pitch and when it did this her fear came rushing back 
at which point the object immediately receded again to its former position but it still remained 
there hovering in place bobbing slightly up and down side to side it wasn't going away 
for whatever reason it seemed to be very interested in her so when it backed off Geneva's fear lessened and this object began to inch a Little Closer 
as Geneva says since it stayed there and kind of hovered in front of me for a long period of time 
I decided that maybe it wasn't going to hurt me or kill me and I started talking to it some more 
so she asked this object this being this entity what are you 
what do you want I don't understand what's going on why are you here now she didn't receive any 
clear answer telepathic or otherwise but she did feel her fear leaving her and whatever 
this thing was it became really clear to her that it wasn't there to hurt her or scare her 
she says I started to feel less afraid that's the interesting part when I felt a little less 
afraid it would inch forward just a little bit I would feel fear and it would move back it was 
definitely in tune with me and my feelings we were communicating in some way shape or form 
because whenever I was afraid it would pull back not too far and it would come forward but not too 
close and it just hovered there for literally hours it just kept hovering at a safe distance 
so Geneva got a really good look at this thing and she says one thing I noticed when it moved 
slightly to the right or to the left it looked like there were these little spokes of light 
coming out of it when it moved the little spokes moved too like it was rotating I also noticed 
that in the center of it it seemed like it was shaded a little bit more than the outer areas 
there seemed like a bit of a shadow in the center I was thinking is that a person is that a spirit 
is there something in the center there I really got the sense that this was a singular being 
and I swore that I could almost see the outline of a person or it being standing in the middle 
of the light I couldn't tell for sure but we interacted for hours and hours it was so unreal 
it stayed there with me for hours in that same spot floating above me but keeping a safe distance 
I had zero doubt in my mind that it was there for me and we were interacting 
so she never took her eyes off of this thing she just watched it and allowed this experience to 
unfold and the hours passed kind of slowly there was a weird timelessness to the whole experience 
and yet at the same time it also passed quickly and she watched it and began to really 
appreciate how beautiful this thing was and what a special experience she was having the light was 
extraordinarily beautiful she said and she says the light almost had like a rainbow a very light 
rainbow aura was very light but you could see colors I stayed there with it watching it sitting 
for hours just having this conversation back and forth back and forth then as morning approached I 
started to feel this kind of Joy because this was a miraculous experience and here I was 
sitting there exhausted amazed I really felt so honored I felt like I wasn't alone in my deep pain 
this came to me in one of my darkest moments in my life and brought me a little light 
I started feeling like oh my God this is a magical experience I was crying I 
went through so many emotions that night it went from complete fear to almost like Joy 
this is like a true Miracle whatever is going on and it went on for hours 
so at some point the sky in the East began to show the first glimmerings of dawn the subject 
still remained she still watched it and when the sky really began to brighten up she said 
are you going to stay with me it was at that moment this object darted away in a split second she said it was amazing just how quickly it went off 
and at that point she meditated for a little while longer wondered if it would come back it didn't 
so she after about an hour she packed up her things and went home she told her boyfriend he 
was amazed and told her it did sound like a very spiritual experience and Geneva of course agreed 
but she wasn't sure how to interpret this you know was this a UFO was it an angel all she knew 
was that it had affected her profoundly lifting her depression and changing her whole world view 
and she says it honestly still brings tears to my eyes if I think about it The Experience definitely 
changed me forever my left took on a new Direction after that of course I suddenly became obsessed 
with UFOs I started reading books watching movies listening to Coast to Coast with art Mel every 
single night I went to some UFO conventions it kind of made me question a lot of things about 
life about other things that are out there and I talked to all sorts of people just speculating 
on what it could have been I talked to a Native American Elder than the Algonquin tribe in Canada 
and he told me that it was a spirit of one of my ancestors watching over me 
she asked another person and they told her it might have been a merkabah experience she 
looked that up merkaba means Light Spirit body uh Divine Light vehicle allegedly 
used by ascended masters to connect with and reach those in tune with the higher realms 
so she kind of resonated with that but remained undecided but it was a big part of her life and 
as she says for years after my encounter I was constantly stargazing looking and hoping 
I went back up to that Landing Pad so many times I dragged so many of my friends up there just hoping 
and praying that it would come back we would even try to Primal scream I just wanted a witness but 
I never had an experience like that again now one weird detail did shock her because once when 
she returned to that exact location she saw some graffiti there as Geneva says somebody had spray 
painted three gray looking aliens surrounded by flames on the top of the landing pad I couldn't 
believe my eyes so maybe someone else there had an encounter it's certainly intriguing 
also this area is pretty close to tahonga Canyon a well-known hot spot of UFO activity 
so there was another really important after effect to this encounter because it was 
immediately afterwards that Geneva started having repetitive dreams about being on board a UFO 
they started right after the encounter and continued for a long time as Geneva says I had so many dreams so many they were non-stop I actually wrote A lot of 
them down because they were so detailed the thing I remember is in some of these dreams it was like 
these UFOs were literally coming to pick me up and they would pick me up in my backyard 
now one particular dream that came right after this sighting Geneva found herself being taken 
on board a craft and she saw the bottom of the ship was actually transparent which allowed her 
to see the landscape Below in fact she could see her home and her street as this craft 
moved off through the neighborhood sped down the California coast to what appeared to be Mexico 
she saw a river with two big waterfalls and this craft actually deposited her in this small Mexican 
Town and she remembers wandering around but nobody seemed to see her she wasn't sure if 
this was a dream or something more I mean she just doesn't know but the dreams continued she 
often found herself in this craft almost always the bottom of the craft would become transparent 
she doesn't remember seeing any ETS but she did sense that somebody was there the weird thing was 
she remembers coming home she says would always bring me back home and the way it would lay me 
back down in my bed I would always be face up it would literally gently float me down into 
the bed and then I would land and wake up it was all the time I was having these kinds of dreams 
so these are definitely not normal dreams she feels this is absolutely related in some way 
to her encounter and I agree I think this is probably memories of actual encounters 
But as time passed this experience began to fade to the back of her mind 
she searched her past for Clues she did have a prior UFO sighting as a teenager 
she saw a silver sphere while driving with her parents through the San Fernando Valley 
was this shiny nearer like object hovering over a nearby Factory 
but that's it that's the only prior encounter she can remember but then she had something 
else happen was one day 2007. this is 14 years after her encounter in the mountains 
she was living in Ojai with her daughter and son and had stepped outside late one evening 
to take out the garbage and as Geneva says in her own words right after I threw it away I 
heard that noise that same humming noise and I recognized it instantly because it was burned 
on my brain I was thinking oh my God that sounds just like the UFO that's crazy and walking back 
to the house I stood in the driveway and I looked up to see if I saw anything I didn't but I thought 
that is so weird that's that same noise that low hum vibration I never forgot what it sounded like 
so she recognized this from the as being the same sound of the UFO up in The Landing Pad in Santa 
Clarita so on impulse she threw up her arms and said out loud okay if there's anybody there show 
me a sign and guess what she got an instant answer as Geneva says I swear on my life a bright beam 
of light Shone directly on me A total Spotlight for about three seconds right on me right in the 
middle of the driveway I was like holy crap I was absolutely blown away once again here I thought 
this light was gone and that I was never going to see it again but what if it's been with me this 
whole time so at that point I knew that something else was out there and of course I stood out there 
as long as I could but nothing else happened but it was another interesting and amazing experience 
so another interesting after effect is Geneva became very interested in remote viewing 
uh this is where you can view distant locations using only the power of your mind so she 
took classes um honestly because she wanted to figure out what this thing that she had seen was 
and what was really cool is in this class there were other students there and they would give 
each other remote viewing tests to ensure that there was no cheating or contamination 
of information it would provide a Target and assign it a random number 
so Geneva decided to use this as an opportunity to have someone else remote view her experience 
and she wrote down her Target Geneva UFO citing June 2006 assigned it a random number 
and gave it to one of the remote viewers to see what they would see and as Geneva 
found out this remote viewer apparently got a direct hit because the remote viewer told her 
what I saw was a bright light and she actually wrote down the word abducted and told her that 
she saw this light moving towards Mexico drew a map of California and lines moving towards Mexico 
so this really made Geneva think she began to wonder if perhaps she was taken that night 
she can't be sure she doesn't have any memory of missing time but it was there for a long time and it's certainly possible 
she didn't notice other interesting effects she had many precognitive dreams these were usually 
involving minor or insignificant events but she also reported an incredible connection to animals 
and she says my friends call me Snow White a lot of times animals are not afraid of me 
so this whole encounter encounters had a huge effect on her in many ways and to sum it up Geneva 
says I feel like why did this happen to me I want to know more I wish I knew more but I really don't 
I wish I had more concrete memories or experiences where I could say for certain what it was 
because sometimes it drives me crazy like why did this happen to me twice but I'm 
still always watching the skies and waiting and I always hope that I'll have more contact 
and something tells me I will probably see it again I think you'll agree that's a truly 
profound encounter I have many cases where people had extraordinary event happen in their lives 
a recent breakup or a graduation or some big event and that's when their encounter occurs 
and in Geneva's case she went out there in the wilderness and was screaming out to the universe 
and who should respond but the ETS it's a really amazing encounter Geneva reached out to me after 
hearing me speak at a mufon meeting and it took her many many years to actually contact me but she 
finally felt it was time to share her story and I'm so glad she did because it's such a profound 
and really special encounter and as we see in this these cases it led to a spiritual awakening it's 
one of the reasons I wanted to present this case in particular because she started having all these 
experiences with remote viewing which actually led to confirmation to a certain degree in her case 
she also shows some of the other markers we see with contact ease and matches had a very close relationship with animals and just an amazing encounter all around 
and now we move to the second story today and I call this one a love like never before 
this one took place on March 14 2015 in San Juan Argentina I love this case for a number of reasons 
this witness had zero prior UFO encounters had only a kind of passing interest in the subject 
but decided that he wanted to find out if UFOs were real and this ended up leading to not only 
a sighting but a amazing healing encounter with humanoids and he's such a good witness a pilot 
and as we'll see a bank manager and his case has a lot to say about the UFO phenomenon and the 
ETS themselves the main witness in this case is Hector sawyak he was born in 1972 in Argentina 
and ambitiously pursued his education he went to college became a professor of philosophy and 
educational Sciences he later became a manager for the Banco Central Del nacion Argentina 
which is the Central Bank of the country and in 2012 he became an FAA approved commercial pilot 
so this is a very intelligent man who was living a very comfortable life in 
his apartment in the city of San Juan did a great job a beautiful family enjoyed his 
interests in flying and astronomy Sports and More but in March of 2015 March 14th more specifically 
his whole outlook on life became completely and profoundly transformed it always had a 
passing interest in UFOs but that's it he kind of wondered if they were real and what kind of 
Technology they might have to be able to travel to different star systems and visit our planet 
and then he heard about some recent UFO sightings in the area of San Juan 
and he thought you know what I'm going to go out and see if I can see some UFOs it was around 9 00 pm on Saturday March 14 he got a camera pair of binoculars 
and drove alone to the area of high de Palo this is about 40 kilometers outside of San Juan 
and he arrived at his destination and watched the skies for about two hours to his great 
disappointment clouds came roaring in covered up the sky so he was just really disappointed drove 
home and went to bed about 11 30 pm or actually he went to bed at 12 30 just after midnight 
and he slept fine until about 3 20 a.m when something very strange happened 
as Hector says I woke up with his start because I heard someone call me in a low voice by my name 
Hector imagine the shock I felt the strange thing is that I mechanically ran to my bedroom window 
and raised the blind I lived on the fourth floor in the heart of San Juan I still can't understand 
the reason for that reaction I could have remained sitting in bed startled as I was however I jumped 
up and opened the Blind and what I saw next overwhelmed me from the southwest and crossing 
my view of the city diagonally a yellowish bolide with enormous speed headed to the northwest 
the object moved below the cloud layer and almost on the edge of it so as a pilot in astronomer 
Hector was very familiar with objects in the sky and he estimated this object was moving at well in 
excess of 2 000 miles per hour Which is far faster than any plane and yet way too slow to be a meteor 
and it was so fiery bright that it left this distinct after image on his retina 
and it was clear to Hector that this was more than a simple sighting because something had 
called his name and he connects it to this object as he says the sighting seemed wonderful to me 
although the most striking thing was that apparent interaction and he thought that 
was the end of it but of course it wasn't life moved on he never forgot about the sighting but 
stopped thinking about it for about six months and it was mid August of 2015. when an event 
occurred which brought that memory roaring brat back and gave it much more significance 
so as Hector says after having gone to bed quietly I woke up unable to move there was a 
yellowish light in my room and I observed two beings standing under the door frame 
Hector stared in amazement and disbelief these two figures were clearly not human 
they were both tall and thin one stood about five feet nine inches the other one was well over six 
feet tall six and a half feet he estimates and they looked somewhat like gray type ETS they had 
large bald heads enormous almond shaped dark eyes a small upturned nose a very thin lipless mouth 
their skin looked sort of a blotchy gray green he said their hands were also long and thin with 
unusually long slender fingers but most unusual were their outfits the two figures were tight 
fitting jumpsuits a light olive green in color with red colors and cuffs and a red 
belt around the waist because they didn't he didn't see any buttons or markings of any kind 
and they almost looked a little more human looking than your standard grays but as Hector says my 
first reaction was fright I wanted to scream and I couldn't I wanted to shake myself and I couldn't 
either but it was very brief the paralysis lasted only an instant perhaps two seconds 
could at that point the beings began to speak to Hector telepathically 
and they said don't be afraid Palm down we are not going to hurt you and this changed everything for 
Hector as he says my emotional condition changed radically an Indescribable feeling of deep peace 
and Tranquility ensued I felt completely confident the sharp contrast was remarkable 
so as fear evaporated the paralysis lifted and Hector sort of looked at these et's with great 
expectation to see what was going to happen next and as Hector says they came to the foot of my bed 
then the shorter one came up to my side took my head with his left hand and lifted me up 
at this point the ET spoke and said telepathically I have come to heal you 
so Hector describes what happened next he says he showed me a very small brown triangular pill 
it was an equilateral equilateral triangle about one-fifth of an inch wide he put it in my mouth 
the ET repeated it is to heal you know Hector was a little bit puzzled by this because as far as he 
knew he was healthy but he swallowed the spill and as he says the taste of the pill was bitter after 
swallowing the pill he leaned my head against his chest and I cried telling him that I always wanted 
to meet them I tell you the truth I experienced love like never before contentment security peace 
after this I don't remember anything else except that when I woke up it was just Dawn 
my body was shaking involuntarily and I felt the already dry tears on my face 
so Hector composed his himself and then he told his wife and children about the encounter they 
were very supportive but somewhat shocked and there were a few weird after effects for the 
next three days Hector says he was very sick to his stomach which was quite unusual because he's 
very careful with his diet thankfully this nausea did pass the only other effect was the profound 
shift in his worldview as he says I know the story sounds implausible from conventional logic 
I'm just trying to understand a little more what happened to me the event had such an impact on 
my life that I have devoted myself to researching it as much as I can and with increasing interest 
so he's decided he would go back to school get a master's degree earn a diploma in bioethics 
and organizational emotional management this whole encounter completely changed everything 
and he decided to go public with his story as he says I think it is very important that those of 
us who have experienced similar situations can make contact between us and serve as 
a reference for future cases in addition to providing accurate references for researchers 
so that is the case of Hector saliak wow what an amazing encounter I love it for a number of 
reasons it really shows that if you reach out to et's they do respond certainly they did for 
him and in fact he got an apparent healing I think my favorite aspect of this case is how 
he describes this amazing all-encompassing almost overwhelming feeling of love coming directly from 
the ETS it's an incredibly benevolent encounter Hector reached out to me after finding out that 
I'd done a lot of research into UFO healing cases and he was shocked to find out that 
his case wasn't particularly unique that a lot of other people have had healing encounters I think 
this is one of the main E.T agendas honestly and that there are a lot more cases out there so I'm 
really glad he reached out to me he thought it was important to share his case and help others 
even allowed me to use his real name and just an amazing Witness and another really interesting 
aspect to his case not only all the interaction he had with ETS by reaching out to them but the 
fact that it transformed him he decided to go back to school he became very interesting in studying 
Consciousness and these sort of things so that's another important aspect and again it shows that 
ETS have a goal of trying to wake people up boost their psychic awareness it's an amazing case and 
here's another one the third and final case I'd like to present to you today also occurred in 2015 
this involves a young man from Puerto Rico an undisclosed location but I call this case in the 
company of extraterrestrials and it shows this same pattern someone who became interested in 
UFOs reached out to them and got a tremendous response with not only a series of sightings 
but an actual face-to-face encounter with a very unusual humanoid witness in this case is abdiel 
he was 14 years old in 2015 living in Puerto Rico and did not believe in UFOs he really had no idea 
that Puerto Rico is actually a pretty active area for UFOs but it didn't really care at that point 
of course all of this changed on April 26 2015. so the one week earlier he was watching television 
When the UFO program Hangar One came on of course this is featuring the subject of UFOs and he found 
himself intrigued by the idea that we are being visited by extraterrestrials and he wondered could 
UFOs be real and he went online on the internet and was amazed to find a ton of information 
and he became quite interested and he thought to himself it sure would be interesting to see one 
now little did he know he was about to get his wish it was just this simple thought 
which completely changed his life it was 7 10 pm April 26th was already dark outside abdiel 
was amusing himself by just playing with the soccer ball against the wall in his backyard 
and this is when he saw movement in his peripheral vision and looking upward he saw a UFO as Abdul 
says I stopped and Stood Still was a golden yellow UFO light in the distance moved slowly across the 
sky in a straight line this ball of golden yellow light moved from the north towards the southeast 
going through a cloud didn't pulsate or blink it was a constant unchanging color I couldn't 
believe it I never thought I was going to see one I was so excited and there was no doubt in my mind 
that I just witnessed a UFO but what occurred next proved to me its authenticity even more 
so this whole setting lasted no longer than a minute it was far brighter than any Star it 
looked to him to be pretty low but he couldn't be sure and abdiel wondering if it was going to come 
back ran upstairs grabbed his father's camera came outside and within one minute of seeing this UFO 
he saw a black helicopter move quickly across the sky in the same direction of the UFO and he 
wondered if perhaps it was pursuing it of course he couldn't be certain but it sure looked like it 
in any case he was thrilled he had just been thinking about seeing a UFO and boom he did 
it's not that can't be a coincidence he wondered how did this object shown itself to him on purpose 
this really got him thinking he knew now UFOs were real he had seen one so he became even 
more interested in this subject and began to read about them and he really wanted to see them again 
But as time passed you didn't have any further sightings at least not right away 
his interest in UFOs began to diminish a little bit and instead it became much more interested 
in psychic subjects interestingly enough and things like telekinesis but it was on April 
2nd of 2019 that events escalated abdiel was now 18 years old he was upstairs in his home 
looked out the window and was amazed to see this yellow light off in the distance 
and it seemed to almost react to him and come closer he actually grabbed a camera 
and managed to capture a few seconds of it on video and as he says I looked through one 
of the windows and in the distance I could see this yellow stationary planet-like appearance 
so I decided to zoom in with my camera and that is when I realized that I was seeing a UFO I 
started filming it hovering and after a couple of seconds I could see that the lights began tilting 
hinting of a turnaround at this point I understood that they noticed me and decided to come closer 
so he felt like it was reacting to him it was clear that this wasn't a star or planet or anything like this and this object came close enough that he could see 
multiple colorful pulsating lights which really excited him because this was the closest he had 
ever been to something like this and he felt like it was showing itself to him on purpose 
so he did film this any rate events were still in progress because that night he was entering 
his room or about to when he heard a loud noise like a slam against what he thought was perhaps 
the floor of his room so he didn't enter his room his parents heard it and said what was that 
and abdiel said well it wasn't me so his father came upstairs and inspected the room but there 
was nothing out of order abdiel did have the sense that there had been something in there and he went 
to bed and had an urge to roll up the curtains to one of the windows something he never does 
and he says something weird happened as he says in his own words something did happen 
when I entered the dream state it didn't go as expected because ultimately I remember saying no 
after saying that word mentally I don't remember anything else so he thinks these UFO entities may 
have been reaching out to him but he didn't feel emotionally ready and basically said no 
so this is an interesting escalation of events and as he said I started researching UFOs at a 
young age they are now interested in me this is what he was thinking and it was just one month 
later May 15 when events escalated even more he had gone visiting the local park with his sister 
and returning late that night he noticed the kitchen light was on his mother was there 
he sat down on the couch right behind a big picture window and as he says at that moment 
I heard what I believed to be two knocks coming from outside on the left window at the same time 
the kitchen light blinked immediately after I stared out the window but couldn't see anything 
so he asked his mother did you hear that someone knocked on the window she said no it was just a few seconds later he heard another two knocks and 
again the light blinked he asked his mom did you see the light blink she said no 
so he got a little bit spooked moved away from the window he wondered if perhaps someone was trying 
to get in which shouldn't make any sense at all because who would knock before trying to break in 
so he told his mom you know I think someone's outside so she went out to investigate 
he followed her and they saw that the front metal gate was slightly ajar he thought they had closed 
it couldn't be sure but they closed it checked the backyard and there was nothing in there 
and they went to bed but he felt it was strange because it felt like something was out there 
and two days later they went outside and this is when abdiel discovered a near perfect ring 
imprinted into the grass of his backyard with six feet in diameter it was a dark 
ring several inches wide as you can see here because he did take pictures of it 
uh he wishes he had you know paid more attention to what was going on outside 
but as he was measuring the circle his sister said look there's something in there 
and he didn't pay attention to her at first but later looked and found this weird metal object 
and he looked at it more closely it was a small steel gray metallic object kind of like a pendant 
as you can see he took a picture of it but on the reverse side of it imprinted on the surface 
were the words Bond and Company this is just a few inches across now it does appear to be of Earthly 
Origins but what the heck was it doing there right in the middle of this circle how did it get there 
because it hadn't been there before and he had the distinct feeling that this could be a message from 
the ETS like did they want to bond with him were they reaching out to him to have company with him 
he says I guess that's what they wanted he wondered if he was reading too much into this 
could it be a coincidence but it seemed strange and intuitively he felt like it was a message 
but he wanted to be certain so he was really kind of reaching out to them again at this point 
it was about three weeks later on June 7 2019 he felt a strong impulse to go out into his backyard 
he grabbed his camera and saw another strange marking as he says they're in front of me I saw 
what appeared to be an extraterrestrial imprint on the lawn it was perfectly made and it seemed like 
a portrait so again he took photos of it and it looks kind of like a head a triangular head with 
medium-sized eyes a small nose and it was strange because it wasn't there before it was very close 
to where this ring had been this ring of grass so again he was left with more questions than answers 
what was this E.T was this a coincidence where did it come from if the et's really wanted to you know show themselves why didn't they just show themselves 
but it was just 10 days later when he had a really profound encounter with an actual 
humanoid June 17 2019 around 10 pm he went outside to take some more pictures of that weird imprint 
and was just kind of staring at it wondering what it could mean and how it got there when he 
noticed movement in his peripheral vision and turning his head he was amazed at what he saw 
and I will just quote up deal directly as he says approximately 75 feet from where I was standing I 
saw a brown figure it didn't appear to have any clothes I estimate its height to be between four 
and a half to five feet it had arms that appeared to be long and certainly had two legs its face 
was triangular smooth cornered bald-headed with vertical medium-sized eyes and elongated non-human 
nose and no visible mouth it ran faster than any human it went from the neighbor's house patio wall 
to where there was a pool and it was as fast as the wind leaning forward with both arms extended 
backwards when running the arms were Loose as a ragdoll it was like seeing a cartoon it was 
funny how it ran with its arms facing backwards so this figures strange manner of running really 
was confusing to him it kind of reminded him of this animated ninja character 
by the name of Naruto azumaki this is from a popular Japanese manga series 
and he says I only saw it for like two seconds that was funny it was like seeing a cartoon 
I estimated it ran a distance of 36 feet and approximately two seconds 
so this was a very close-up sighting almost no chance of misperceiving that's how close it was 
this figure he said was clearly alien in appearance he felt no fear though he was surprised 
he did react in a way that surprised him because he watched this figure run to his neighbor's pool 
area and he had full access to that location he could have just walked over and looked but he 
didn't do that even though he was very curious he didn't go to investigate not this kind of 
surprised him also weird is he heard this strange sound coming from that area where this figure had 
run to it was kind of a humming sound and he thought I mean he really thinks he should have 
and would have walked to this area but for some reason he didn't he now regrets it but no he 
wasn't afraid he was excited and calm through the whole thing and his 100 percent convinced 
that this was not human but in fact it looked very much like that weird imprint on his lawn 
so he didn't see any UFO on that particular night but he did see this the alien looking creature 
running right through the yard and he felt like it was a demonstration meant just for him 
he felt like the ETS had made an effort to fulfill their promise to bond with him just like the 
message on that strange metal pendant had said so he did continue to have a few sightings after this 
on September 20th 2019 he saw a glowing red object 
and he says it was about at the rooftop level of his neighbor's house and it looked very much 
like a glowing red flare but there was no smoke or anything and weird events continued to occur 
he saw a black helicopter circling the area he filmed it and upon reviewing the video he saw a 
tiny little white sort of tic tac shaped object zooming around behind and Beyond the helicopter 
and further UFO sightings the last one occurred in December of 2020 he saw an 
orange yellow object moving right overhead just above the rooftop from left to right and there 
was also a weird red light next to it and it was it really impressed him as being quite unusual 
and that was it pretty much except for one other real brief possible sighting 
so he feels like he reached out to these UFOs and they responded in a big way 
and it really changed the way he looked upon not only his place in the world but himself 
and as he says Looking Back Now a sudden interest was sparked in me in electromagnetics 
the electrical engineering metaphysics psychokinesis self-mastery and spiritual evolution 
I wonder so that is abdiel's case from Puerto Rico and what an amazing series of events there's a lot 
that is super interesting in this case involving Landing traces this weird artifact that he found 
in the middle of the landing traces which does seem to be Earthly certainly but had a message 
which could be connected I was talking to Whitley streamer about this and he's like yeah this is 
exactly how et's sometimes operate they leave little puddles and clues and messages and very 
odd and interesting ways and that's certainly true in this case and his case is ongoing in fact when 
I wrote his chapter I sent it to him and he said you know I've had another sighting I'd like you to 
add that which of course I did an amazing guy and again we see that same pattern of someone becoming 
extremely interested in psychic abilities so he's talking about Clairvoyance and telepathy and all 
these interesting subjects which some people consider paranormal I don't really I think these 
are actually natural normal subjects this is the way we're supposed to be with a profound psychic 
awareness and again I think this is one of the E.T agendas they're really trying to wake us up 
so these three cases show that if you call them they will come seriously ETS are responsive they 
are watching over us these are just three of many cases like this that I've investigated 
again all three of these cases are covered in my book humanoids and high strangeness 
I've left out a little bit of each of these stories just as a teaser so if you want to 
know the whole story you'll have to check out the book but I hope you found these 
cases interesting and perhaps even learned something about the nature of UFO contact 
and until next time I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it 
and like I always like to say keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth 
and most important of all keep having fun until next time bye.
