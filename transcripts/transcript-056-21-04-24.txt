TOP TWENTY CASES OF HUMAN LEVITATION: PART II
Apr 24, 2021

Summary:
Apr 24, 2021
Humans can fly! In part one of this video, we explored ten outstanding cases of human levitation. In part two, we now explore the very best documented cases of people who have flown. These are not flying dreams or out of body experiences. These are cases in which people have physically levitated off the ground. Every single one of these top ten cases involves multiple outside witnesses (sometimes hundreds or even thousands) who viewed the levitations firsthand. In four of the cases, the levitations were actually photographed. Several of the levitators provided detailed descriptions of their own experience, including how they levitated, and what it feels like to rise up from the ground and fly. 

These cases show that human levitation is not a matter of speculation; it is a proven and demonstrated fact. The evidence speaks for itself. As amazing and fantastic as it may seem, humans can actually fly up into the air without the aid of any mechanical device. Instead, levitation appears to be a natural human ability, one that manifests under very rare conditions. 

These case are only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, there are more than 330 documented cases of levitation, stretching back thousands of years and coming from many cultures all across our planet.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  welcome to another episode of ufos and the  
paranormal today's episode is actually part two  of the episode top 20 cases of human levitation  
in part one we covered cases 20 through 11 and  now we are going to do a countdown of the top  
10. so let's just get started 10 this is when  things really get exciting for case number 10  
i chose the case of maha yogini raja lakshmi  this case is well verified in many respects this  
took place in india the main witness is still  living i believe and is of high credibility  
at the time she held a position as a professor and  a leader of a yoga institute her levitations have  
been witnessed by numerous people and were also  allegedly photographed this is a really compelling  
case which occurred in the  1900s the exact date isn't given   but it was investigated by well-respected  researcher doug boyd who is a native american  
civil rights leader and the founder of the  cross cultural studies program in tucson arizona  
in the 1980's he was funded by the menger  foundation to travel across the world to interview  
a variety of yogi adepts and study their  ability to control states of consciousness  
and psychophysiological states or in other words  the mind-body connection and one of their subjects  
was this extraordinary woman by the name of  maha yogini raja lakshmi she lived in tirupati  
india and at the time she was the professor of  biochemistry at the university of sri padmavati  
doug boyd couldn't help but notice that raja  lakshmi was different from the many other  
yogi's he had met first of all she was young  she was female she drove a fancy sports card  
she dressed with expensive jewelry and was  according to doug boyd strikingly beautiful  
however doug boyd was assured by those around her  that she was a genuine yogi and as a child she had  
actually created a local sensation in her village  because of her ability to levitate as doug boyd  
writes raja lakshmi had been somewhat of a legend  in her own hometown during her childhood we were  
told as a child she had begun to meditate and  had experienced many occurrences of transcending  
gravity at times she would levitate and at times  she would turn upside down and levitate on her  
head she was so often and so long in levitation  that people came from near and far to see her  
these things occurred spontaneously and were not  entirely in her own control it created a problem  
for the wealthy family and they had  to hire guards because of the crowds  
during his meeting with her doug boyd was actually  shown photographic evidence of her levitations  
as he says and i quote among the snapshots of  raja lakshmi were several photographs taken by  
a newspaper journalist showing her sitting in  a lotus position and levitating about a foot  
off the floor on one of these in particular it  looked as though some external force almost like  
a great wind or perhaps a vacuum were acting  upon her and lifting her into the air her hair  
and clothing seemed to be blowing in several  directions while her expression and her posture   appeared still and calm dough boyd was amazed  by these photos and learned that raja lakshmi  
had given demonstrations of her abilities on  numerous occasions including once for a group of  
students and faculty at the university where she  taught he finally asked her about this ability and  
she replied and i quote it does not happen  nowadays well not spontaneously as before and  
it was never an objective of mine not something i  was seeking it was like an automatic sort of thing  
and it gave me problems at times in college i had  to stay alone because i had several times alarmed  
my roommates this is a surprising thing you see  when it is so unusual for them and unexpected  
as a young girl when this happened i was amazed i  can say but i was not frightened that it startled  
my parents to them it appeared in emergencies  something dangerous happening to their daughter  
so they were quite upset enough to seek help not  the first time the third or fourth time perhaps  
you see i went straight up from my bed which was  against the wall we have these high windows with  
inside shutters and i hit the shutter normally  i would not reach the shutter and it made such a   loud sound in the night my parents came rushing in  and seeing me suspended in the air in that manner  
they were startled and my father shouted at me  perhaps that in itself brought me down and i  
became fully conscious raja lakshmi knows exactly  what caused her ability to start levitating  
she says i was in meditation and even though i  was not fully conscious of my body i knew what  
happened and why you see my teacher chose for  me this wonderful book the gospel of ramakrishna  
so i would read this book and it was so so  inspirational for me it opened me to something  
i used to meditate on this though i had  not been doing meditation i would read  
some pages and become so moved and i would  meditate on this emotion i read it in the   evening instead of my homework i had not much  worry for homework as as i was excelling in my  
classwork and i read this book instead when my  parents thought i was doing homework so this  
thing did it it put me into levitation this  book was the cause of it in the beginning  
i have this book it's more than one thousand pages  long and it details the life of a spiritual master  
ramakrishna who is himself a levitator so to  stop these levitations raja lakshmi's parents  
forbade her from reading this book and sought  help from the leading sage in their village  
he advised them that their daughter was a yogi and  that they should seek a guru the guru instructed  
the parents to have no fears  that levitation was natural   and to allow her to read the book the parents  agreed but they weren't happy about it  
as raja lakshmi says so then it went down for some  time i went on reading my book and remained long  
hours in meditation and long hours and levitation  so the villagers learned of this and they came  
others began to arrive from here and there my  father would not let them see me and at last there  
were crowds of people men women children sleeping  and washing and preparing meals in our property  
the police were called at this point and  they said that they were unable to order   the people away and the best solution would  be some sort of compromise just allow them to  
view the girl levitating for short periods and  roger lakshmi's parents reluctantly agreed as she  
says so the days of the weeks and the hours were  set and the people could come in a few at a time  
in one door and out the other there were ropes  put up between so they could not touch me  
after a few months of this raja lakshmi was  advised by her guru to stop the levitations  
as she was becoming quote lost in bliss and  becoming quote useless in your lifetime so she  
stopped the levitating trances today raja lakshmi  is focusing her energy on more practical pursuits  
including running a yoga institute and teaching  at the university and working at a health clinic  
one of her students credits her with  helping her to cure his diabetes  
so how about that what an incredible case and  that's just case number 10. i've got many other  
cases and i want to move on quickly because  this is a quite a long episode next case i want  
to talk about is the case of alphonse ligouri  this case occurred uh extremely long time ago  
but there are a huge huge number of credible  witnesses who left written testimonies under  
oath testifying to the veracity of the guri's  levitations saint alphonse marie de la guari  
was born in 1696 and although he's not really  well known among the many many levitating saints  
his remains one of the strongest cases on  record for the veracity of this phenomenon   he experienced numerous levitations  at least two of which were witnessed  
by extremely large numbers of people several of  whom left very convincing written testimonials  
saint laguari grew up with little interest in  religion instead he was a student of the law  
by age 16 was a very successful lawyer eight years  later he was still practicing law he had a perfect  
record he won every single case he represented  until 1720 when he lost a very important case  
because he made a simple stupid mistake and this  upset him a lot it made him think deeply about  
a course his life was taking and what he  wanted to do with his life and as a result  
he left law practice against his father's  wishes and instead became deeply religious  
he became ordained as a priest at the age of  30 and soon became a very popular confessor  
and preacher and he eventually founded  numerous missions throughout naples italy  
today he is credited with many many miracles  including visions and prophecies which were later  
verified as accurate and of course levitations  his most famous levitation is undoubtedly the one  
that took place in december 1745 while preaching  before more than 2 000 people alphonse leguire  
fell into an ecstasy and rose several  feet above the platform on which he stood  
the crowd fell into stone silence and  then began to cry out miracle miracle  
during ligori's trial for beautification multiple  witnesses testified to this event and uh it wasn't  
his only levitation in 1756 again while preaching  before a crowd of more than a thousand people  
he experienced another levitation and  again the crowd became very emotional   one witness father casanova wrote and i  quote we saw his body glow his eyes fixed  
ravished in ecstasy to rise two palms above the  chair appearing as though an angel was flying  
him to heaven this ravishment lasted for more than  five minutes during which erupted an indescribable  
emotion the sobbing of the audience mingling with  cries from all sides of miracle miracle miracle  
another witness was fraught father chriscolli  who says i am knowledgeable enough to know this  
happened i particularly remember the complete  transformation of two quarters of the town  
uh father criscoli elaborated and reported  that many of the prostitutes and drunks changed  
their ways and improved their moral standing as a  direct result of witnessing the guru's levitation  
another witness was francois de stefano who said  and i quote all the people saw him as i myself  
saw him that he experienced a state of ecstasy his  eyes were turned to the sky and his body raised up  
more than two palms the quality and the  number of testimonies available to labor's  
levitations leave little doubt that they were  true another witness was brother verdeska who  
says and i quote at the beginning of 1762 i went  one morning in order to recite as is the custom  
the office with him upon entering his room i saw  him elevated two or three palms above his chair  
half kneeling half sitting he had his arms  extended his eyes opened and raised towards  
the sky his face glowing brightly as though  transfigured i entered quietly into the room  
and kneeled between the armchair and the bed  in a way which allowed me in turning my head   to watch his figure the ravishment lasted about  a quarter of an hour but for me this seemed only  
an instant and all the while my eyes streamed  tears i considered the spectacle very heavenly  
he expressed a gra a profound gasp and cried  out my god my god he recovered at this moment  
and found himself on his chair in his normal  state i burst out sobbing at which he noticed  
my presence and became confused turning towards  me he said with a gentle but reproachful tone  
unfortunate you were there above all tell no  one what you have seen according to the witness  
laguardia seemed very disoriented  as a result of the levitation   another firsthand witness was father magella  who apparently prevented the levitation  
as he says in march of 1770 i attended his  mass that morning i saw more excited than  
usual and as though on a kind of fear he recited  the prayers of the holy mass up to the canon with  
an ineffable devotion i knelt to celebrate the  holy sacrifice and i stopped a moment to observe  
as soon as i saw it the consecration didn't  happen i raised my eyes and i saw him leaning on  
his elbows on the altar holding the host in his  hand without saying the words of the sacrament  
and raising my head a little i was able to see  his face his eyes were opened hugely and fixed  
on the cross all of this revealing  an animation which made me shudder  
then i discovered that he was touching the ground  only by his toes as if he was going to take flight  
completely beside myself and not knowing what to  do i went to call brother romito or the servant  
alex and not finding them returned to the altar  the servant of god was still in the same position  
i then took him as i had under similar  circumstances and shook him strongly   pulling him by his cassock this movement made him  recover and leaving his ecstasy he heaped a great  
gasp of love and pronounced the consecration he  finished the mass with the fervor of an angel  
father bob volpaselli reported that he once  accidentally provoked laguardia into a levitation  
by speaking to him of the love of god and in 1984  father tenoha observed laguari now severely ill  
with rheumatism levitating and he left a detailed  account as father tanoha says alphonse was before  
the altar of the very holy sacrament i heard him  move his feet as if he slid across the pavement  
the sound began a few moments later and suspecting  that something supernatural was happening to him i  
glanced to the side and i saw him elevated in the  air above his chair i noticed the same levitations  
several times in order to assure myself of this  in a more thorough manner i placed myself in the  
same location for several days and after careful  consideration i saw the same transports in the air  
which recurred with the speed and the ease of  a light feather shortly before he died alphonse  
liguori had a levitation on his deathbed this  occurred after he was told that the chapels were  
so crowded with visitors the drivers themselves  deserved to be called the real saints it was  
only one year after his death a trial was held to  consider leguire's canonization and a total of 92  
witnesses testified to having seen laguar in  levitation he was canonized as a saint in 1839  
so there you go another amazing case witnessed by  thousands of people in this instance and yes it  
happened a long time but i think testimonies are  compelling enough to prove that it really happened  
another amazing case uh involves someone  who's actually photographed during levitation  
this involved a medium by the name of amede  zuccarini of italy this case is reputable because  
it involved several scientists who were able to  photograph the levitations on multiple condition  
occasions under controlled conditions this exact  event happened in 1908 when zuccarini who was a  
state employee in bologna italy attracted the  attention of scientists with his ability to  
levitate and his case was very closely studied  by dr el patrizi a professor of physiology at  
the university of modena and by professor oreste  marani of the milan polytechnic institute in italy  
they were able to take photographs of  zuccarini during his levitation episodes  
zuckerini was only able to levitate in complete  or near complete darkness so to overcome this  
obstacle the scientists used magnesium flash  photography they would conduct a seance  
and at the moment of levitation they took the  photographs and using this method the scientists  
took numerous photographs of zuccarini  in levitation and the most famous photo  
shows the circle of five people at the sands  with zuccarini floating about five about three  
feet above the floor in a perpendicular  position still holding hands in the circle  
his limitations were invariably brief lasting  maybe 12 to 14 seconds however the stringent  
laboratory conditions and the photographs make  his case particularly reputable and that's why i  
included it as case number eight because it was  a modern case viewed by trained observers under  
laboratory conditions and photographed it's truly  an astonishing case and now we're getting to one  
of my favorite cases uh case number seven i chose  a gentleman by the name of yogi masahuru narus  
this is an outstanding modern  case which occurred in japan   at age 12 yogi narus began to practice yoga with  the hopes of freeing himself from all bondage  
and reaching nirvana throughout the 1970s he  visited many yoga masters throughout india  
in 1976 he began teaching yoga himself years  later in 1982 he began to levitate by this  
time he had mastered many other supernatural  phenomena levitation being only one of them  
in april of 1983 a series of eight photographs  were taken of naruts while in levitation five  
years later in 1988 he levitated more than one  meter high and was again photographed in 1990  
he allowed himself to be photographed in  levitation for one final time but never again  
in 1992 he wrote the book which is published  in japanese levitation by the method of yoga  
in 2001 yogi narus was conferred the title of yogi  raj and today he is still living and is considered  
one of the highest practitioners of kundalini yoga  he currently heads the nerus yoga group in tokyo  
yoga classes are open monday through saturday  from 10 30 in the morning to eight in the evening  
and open to anyone who is willing to visit  what's interesting about yogi narus's case is  
not only is he a living practitioner of  yoga and that it has also been photographed  
but he provides detailed explanations on how he  levitates according to yogi narus and i'm quoting  
it is to use instantaneously trauma or  vital energy permeating in the universe  
place once cons place one's consciousness on  the destination point for floating according  
to the amount of consciousness increasing  existential reversal takes place and the  
physical self becomes evacuated then the  physical body gets attracted towards the  
consciousness which has already been shifted  to the destination one can thus levitate  
in other words he's saying that he is able to have  an out-of-body experience focus his consciousness  
on a point directly above him and once  he's fully conscious in an astral state  
the physical body is drawn up towards him i love  this case because the photographs are very clear  
uh this gentleman is still living uh there are  there's a video of him on youtube in which he  
talks about uh spirituality it's truly an  astonishing and very well verified case  
and now we get to case number six which i call  the case of carmine mirabelli he's one of the most  
remarkable levitators of the 1800s he was born  in 1889 and quickly became the undisputed leader  
of brazil's spiritualism movement he is without  a doubt brazil's most famous physical medium  
uh carmine displayed countless psycabili  psychic abilities from a very young age and  
had numerous credible witnesses vouching for his  reputation including his entire extended family  
and his friends and before long he had conducted  thousands of seances producing virtually the  
entire range of mediumistic phenomena under  a trance he was able to speak in no less than  
28 languages three of which were dead languages  including seven dialects important here however  
is his ability of physical levitation  which he performed on numerous occasions  
during one seance he was handcuffed to prevent  trickery he rose up in full view of several  
witnesses and then disappeared the handcuffs  falling to the floor later he appeared in  
another room in the same home two doors had to  be unlocked to retrieve him so apparently he not  
only levitated he teleported at sal vicente  mirabelli was tied to a chair by several  
scientists skeptical scientists from the academy  cesar lombroso after he had been securely fastened  
carmine and his chair rose from the ground and  remained suspended in the air for two minutes  
at a height of more than six feet during  which time the witnesses were allowed to pass   to and fro underneath him carmine's feats  continued he could often produce full-color  
apparitions and according to mr bo cuera  while driving through santos brazil he  
observed carmine to levitate six feet above  his automobile for a period of three minutes  
on one occasion a levitation was actually  photographed this photograph shows maribelli  
carmine mirabelli hovering about three feet off  the ground in a standing position his face is  
turned upwards with an expression of awe and peace  as if he is beholding something of intense beauty  
his arms are outspread in front of him in a  posture reminiscent of the levitating saints  
there have been some people who claimed apparently  without any evidence to back it up that mirabelli  
is standing on a ladder that had been airbrushed  out of the photo whatever the case there's more  
evidence toward pointing toward the validity  of carmine's case english researcher guy lion  
playfair performed extensive follow-up research  on carmine mirabelli and came away absolutely  
convinced of the genuineness of his case as he  writes one eminent south paolo surgeon assured  
me that his father had seen mirabelli leave the  floor while sitting in his chair uh playfair also  
interviewed mirabelli's son regine mirabelli  who was a firsthand witness to a levitation  
one day his son peaked into his father's room and  observed him sitting on the bed in a position of  
meditation and as regine says as i watched him  his body began to rise up in the air without  
changing position then he just stayed there in  midair about a meter off the bed his legs and  
arms still crossed that was enough for me and  i ran off to tell my mother as fast as i could  
so there you go another really  well verified levitation   and now we get to the top five cases and for case  number five i chose the case of stington moses  
in 1870 staten moses was a professor at  cambridge university an author a minister  
a religious scholar and the founding member of  the british society of psychical research his  
sterling reputation for honesty and integrity  was vouched for by many many prominent citizens  
william moses william stinton moses was also a  medium he started out very skeptical but after  
attending a few seances he became absolutely  convinced and he then began to exhibit his own  
media mystic talent he later levitated on at least  10 occasions in front of many influential citizens  
well-known pioneering paranormal investigator  andrew lang investigated stington's case and  
concluded that his levitations were quote a  miracle these levitations occurred exclusively  
during darkened senses and as satan moses  writes in his own words one day on june 30th  
1870 i felt my chair moved away from the table and  turned towards the corner where i had been seated  
so that i turned my back towards the circle  and faced at an angle towards the wall   immediately the chair was elevated from the  ground to a height which after i was able to judge  
came to be 30 to 40 centimeters the chair stayed  suspended for some instance and then i felt myself  
leave it and climb still higher then higher  the movement very gentle and slow i never had  
any apprehension and i never felt uneasy i was  perfectly conscious of what was happening and  
described the progress of the phenomena to  those around the table the movement was very  
regular and it seemed to us rather a long time to  complete he was actually able to take a pencil and  
make several marks high up on the wall near the  ceiling verifying that he had actually levitated  
and he also left a vivid account of what  it feels like to levitate as he writes  
my sensation was that of being lighter than  air no pressure on any part of the body no  
unconsciousness or entrancement from the position  of the mark on the wall it is clear that my head  
must have been close to the ceiling the ascent of  which i was perfectly conscious was very gradual  
and steady not unlike that of being in an elevator  but without any perceptible sensation of moment  
other than that of feeling lighter than  the atmosphere of being completely free  
he did also report a slight feeling of tightness  and in his chest and difficulty in breathing  
uh as is the case with several saints uh stington  moses was on was seen on occasion to actually emit  
visible light from his body and also a flowery  perfume scent and other unusual but pleasant odors  
were emitted from his body echoing the a the  saints and their quote odor of sanctity so  
uh moses successfully levitated on at least  10 occasions in front of multiple witnesses  
under very carefully monitored conditions  making his levitations among the best verified  
in history and now we move on to case number four  and case number four i chose joseph cupertino  
or as uh his italian name is giuseppe  calpertino uh giuseppe desa of copertino  
so although this case occurred many hundreds of  years ago the enormous number of witnesses well  
into the many hundreds and their credibility  which includes popes dukes uh priests nuns  
uh people of very high standing in society  makes make his case very hard to dismiss  
and you have to remember many of the people who  gave testimonies were under oath when they gave  
their testimonies about joseph of copertino this  is in italy and uh is probably the most famous  
of all the levitating saints joseph was born  in 1603 and at first he seemed a very unlikely  
candidate for sainthood he was born into poverty  his father was a carpenter sold their home to pay  
for debts and died soon after joseph was born  joseph himself was reportedly very withdrawn  
excitable not very smart sort of dim-witted and  uh had a club foot one of his feet was deformed  
as a child uh people nicknamed him the gaper  because of his vacant slack-jawed expression but  
even from an early age joseph showed a very strong  interest in religion and experienced his first  
quote ecstatic flight static trance rather at age  eight at age 17 he was apprenticed to a shoemaker  
but was fired for incompetence he was rejected  twice by the franciscans because he couldn't even  
perform simple tasks he would drop the dishes let  the fire go out and often fell into these ecstatic  
fits when during which he was unable to work but  his transformation finally occurred after being  
hired as a stable boy by the franciscan friars at  cupertino he became devoutly religious and spent  
much of his free time in prayer he lived very  aesthetically wearing a scratchy hair shirt often  
ate only twice a week and would flagellate himself  so that his entire body became covered with wounds  
they nicknamed him the human scab at age 22 he  was admitted by a stroke of luck to the novitiate  
and it was then that his levitations really began  his limitations were so numerous and witnessed by  
so many people of high credibility that  they are very difficult to deny or debunk  
and usually joseph would levitate when he was  exposed to anything of any type of religious  
nature the mere sight of a religious statue or  a painting could send him flying up into the sky  
as even could the sound of a prayer or  religious music and on each occasion  
joseph would let out a very characteristic  shriek and he would float quickly upwards  
during several of his levitations he was so  overcome with ecstasy that he would embrace heavy  
stone statues that are much too heavy for a single  person to lift and carry them up into the air with  
him you would sometimes mistake fellow monks for  famous religious figures and grabbed the monk and  
carried them into the air with him during several  of his levitations he was so overcome with ecstasy
his first recorded levitation that we know  of occurred while saying mass at a monastery  
in naples mass had just begun when he fell  into a trance and levitated from the corner  
of the church flew across the room to the  altar and the event was viewed by several  
stunned witnesses after this the levitations  came fast and furious while visiting assisi  
in italy he entered a monastery to pray when  he saw a painting of the virgin mary and he  
instantly floated into the air 15 feet  over a group of more than a dozen witnesses  
he also levitated outside in the open air on  at least one reported occasion while walking  
outside he observed a baby lamb and that was  enough to send him into an ecstatic trance  
and a a fellow brother seeing joseph's reaction  handed him the little lamb and joseph grabbed the  
lamb placed it on his shoulder and ran into the  garden the other priests followed him eager to see  
if this ecstasy would result in a levitation and  sure enough it did joseph rose into the air with  
the lamb and hovered in a kneeling position among  the trees for a period of no less than two hours  
so joseph's levitations were very easily provoked  on one occasion a priest antonio ciarello  
uttered the words oh how beautiful has god  made heaven and that was enough for joseph  
to rise up and levitate where he and he perched  on the thin top of the branches of an olive tree  
uh very thin branches which could not hold  his weight and he remained there again for   about two hours until finally antonio cirello the  priest had to fetch a ladder to get joseph down  
uh one christmas eve shepherds in the church  were playing religious music on their pipes  
and that launched joseph desa an estimated 40 feet  across the church to the high altar there's one  
witness a shepherd testified we then saw brother  joseph he was so joyous starting to dance to the  
sound of the music but all of a sudden he gasped  and uttered a loud cry at the same time he rose  
up in space in the middle of the church flying  like a bird to the main altar a good 25 meters  
but the most most amazing part of the affair  was that the altar was covered with lit candles  
brother joseph flew set himself among the candles  and disturbed neither candle nor candlestick  
he stayed thus so kneeling above the altar hugging  the altar in his arms for about 15 minutes then he  
descended from the altar disturbing nothing  he went away from us his eyes pouring tears  
all of us were saying my brothers that was  enough to be blessed by the love of god we were  
all afraid and astonished from this devotion  i said to myself it certainly is a miracle  
several of the nuns observed this incident  and began screaming he will catch on fire   but they were assured by brother lodovicio  who had observed joseph flights before  
that he would not be burned joseph desa  apparently had the ability which we now  
know is called immunity to fire uh so he  exhibited numerous supernatural abilities  
and uh on the feast of saint francis joseph  was seen levitating while holding a lit candle  
passing 14 paces through the air in front of our  large group of monks and once upon seeing a cross  
he levitated 15 feet up into the air and  remained suspended on the edge of the pulpit   hugging the cross it's clear that he was able to  exert some control over his flight path because  
on one occasion he flew around several lamps  and ornaments that were obstructing his way  
to the altar and upon seeing this levitation in  progress joseph besa's superior ordered him back  
and joseph promptly reversed his path and  landed in the exact place he had just vacated  
in one of his episodes some of his fellow brothers  would try to wake him up by sticking needles  
or burning his flesh with candles joseph took  no notice he didn't feel it and the candles had  
no effect on him and afterwards he would wake  up and humbly and laughingly apologize for his  
state what he called his giddiness on  july 15 1657 he experienced a well-known  
recorded levitation upon seeing the cupola  of the notre dame de lauretta he cried out  
raised six feet above the ground and  flew nearly 100 feet into an almond tree  
the site of an altar often sent him into a trance  and this occurred on at least 15 known occasions  
one alter induced levitation was particularly  memorable because at that time he hadn't levitated  
for almost two years his ecstasies and his  levitations had stopped after a hostile superior  
repeatedly humiliated and persecuted him and  after visiting assisi the site of the image of  
the virgin mary stopped this dry spell and  sent him sailing 15 yards to embrace her  
on another occasion uh officials were guarding  the holy relics of saint francis and they saw  
joseph approach and as soon as he saw  the relics he uttered his characteristic   cry flew up backwards over their heads  landing behind them on the stone tiles  
so often joseph appeared to be unaware of his  surroundings during these levitation trances  
and on one occasion a priest observed  joseph levitating and a slipper fell off  
joseph's foot and joseph took no notice of this  one levitation was particularly memorable and this  
levitation pro displayed another supernatural  ability of supernatural strength at that time  
there was a 36 foot cross had been constructed but  due to its immense size and weight ten men were  
unable to lift it and put it in the stand that had  been built along the roadside outside of cupertino  
joseph desa happened to be passing by and as he  observed the cross from the doorway of his church  
as soon as he saw it he quote rose like a bird  into the air at this point he flew 70 yards  
grabbed the cross and lifted it up as if  it were a piece of straw and quickly put it  
in its place on another occasion he saw the  statue of jesus he let out a yell fell into  
a trance and floated eight feet off the floor  grasped the heavy stone statue which he lifted up  
still holding the statue and floated down the  hallway and carried the statue to his room  
sometimes he would grab other people  and carry them up into the air on one  
occasion he heard religious music this  provoked a levitation attack and joseph  
rushed up to his confessor grabbed his hands and  they blow both flew up to the center of the room  
once he saw a wax statue of the baby jesus above  the altar he cried out flew up to the statue and  
clutched it to his chest floated about the room  for several minutes in numerous different postures  
another very similar event occurred at  the church of santa chiara in cupertino  
several novitiates were being honored with  a festival when joseph besa heard the words  
the latin words vena sponza christi which means  come bride of christ and at this point he felt  
a love levitation coming on uh as one of  the witnesses said giving his accustomed cry  
he ran towards the convent's father confessor  rafael palma who was attending the service  
and seizing him grasped him by the hand and  finally both rose into the air in an ecstasy  
the one born aloft by joseph the other by god  himself one being beside himself with fear  
but the other with sanctity so reportedly this  event happened on many different occasions  
joseph desa has also been credited with curing  people on one occasion he cured balthazar rossi  
a local madman someone who had gone insane he had  formerly been a very prominent citizen but somehow  
lost his mind and had to be physically bound to  present himself from hurting himself and others  
one day joseph approached him untied this  man balthazar and told him to have no fear  
he grabbed balthazar and levitated with  him for a period of about 15 minutes  
after which the man was cured of his insanity so  very quickly joseph's reputation grew and he was  
often called to pray for the sick on one occasion  while praying for a patient he rose up into the  
air and came back down on a table crowded with  dishes in may of 1649 while attending a patient's  
deathbed joseph was seen to levitate while in  prayer and once while praying in the church  
of saint gregoire in naples italy he uttered  a loud cry startling all the people present  
and flew up to the altar he was seen to levitate  before the images of the virgin on many occasions  
and one of these levitations reached a height  of at least 30 feet according to father juniper  
a firsthand witness he saw joseph levitating  after a while listening to the boy's choir  
as they sang joseph approached and floated a few  inches above the ground the boys stopped singing  
and surrounded joseph to pass their hands beneath  his feet often when joseph said mass he was seen  
to balance on the tips of his toes in apparent  ecstasy so joseph's levitations became famous all  
across europe he became known as the flying friar  of europe and enormous crowds gathered to witness  
the miracle of the flying friar this fame caused  many people a very high social standing to come  
and view these levitations and they were reviewed  by numerous officials including several cardinals  
the duke of medina de rio and the daughter of  charles emmanuel first the great the duke of savoy  
catherine of austria and many others  perhaps the most significant and  
highest official witness was none other than pope  urban viii during a visit with joseph desa joseph  
desa knelt down and kissed the pontiff's feet at  which point joseph rose into a levitating trance  
pope urban viii was so impressed that he declared  that he had witnessed quote a true miracle  
another uh official of high standing  was johan frederick the lutheran duke  
of brunswick who traveled to assisi for  the purpose of seeing joseph in levitation  
uh joseph or the duke of brunswick was not  catholic so he had to be sneaked into the church  
and as he watched joseph gave out his customary  cry floated into the air moved backwards and then  
towards the altar where he returned to the ground  uh johan frederick lutheran duke of brunswick  
uh was so overcome with the emotion he began  to cry he returned the next day to observe  
joseph levitating again for a period of  about 15 minutes and he was so impressed  
by what he witnessed that he converted  his religion from lutheran to catholicism  
another very memorable levitation occurred in 1645  uh when the spanish ambassador to the papal court  
had heard about the levitating  saint and called for a meeting   and according to a researcher by the name of gezi  in 1645 the spanish ambassador to the papal court  
the high admiral of castile passed through assisi  to see joseph and after speaking with the saint  
in his cell he returned to the church and told  his wife i've spoken with another saint francis  
upon hearing this his wife also wanted  to meet joseph and at her request his   superior commanded him to go to the church  and speak with her i will obey joseph said  
but i don't know whether i'll be able  to speak and he hastened to comply   scarcely had he entered the church when looking  upon a statue of mary immaculate on the altar  
he flew about 12 paces over the heads of  those present to the foot of the statue  
after remaining there sometime in prayer he flew  back with his customary cry and returned to his  
cell the occurrence amazed the admiral and his  wife and their retinue and according to some  
accounts the admiral's wife actually fainted  and needed strong smelling salts to recover
so many many people observed his uh levitations  according to one account and this is a firsthand  
witness talking several religious whom he  helped fold a habit worn by saint francis  
saw him hover in the air above their heads him  suspended on a cornice in the chapel of saint  
francis about eight inches from the floor one day  while a priest was preaching the chapel of saint  
ursula joseph flew from a balcony that jutted out  in front of the altar he remained suspended in  
the kneeling physician before the tabernacle until  his superiors command he flew back to the balcony  
so there are many many witnesses another  was the bishop of martelly of spoletto
each of who testified under oath to having seen  joseph in flight in fact the bishop of spoleto  
wrote the ecstasies of which he was favored  are known by all the world i have seen him and  
several of the people of my house have seen him as  have i raised up four fingers up from the ground  
so joseph was very very famous and his case caused  a lot of controversy a true church superiors  
feared that he was becoming a cult figure and  the growing crowds of people flooded into the  
area and followed him everywhere he went so many  people came that they had to erect temporary  
house housing to contain the increasing throngs  of spectators and it was around this time that  
joseph was accused by his superiors of seeking  publicity and trying to create false miracles  
he was investigated by the inquisition and the  decision was made to put him in isolation and  
for more than 35 years joseph was forbidden  to say mass to take part in any processions  
choir practice or anything that might cause one  of his levitation episodes he was shielded from  
all religious icons of any kind and was moved  from one friary to another to avoid spectators  
but was eventually returned to his original friary  where he remained in almost total seclusions but  
even all these precautions weren't enough to stop  the crowds of followers or to stop his levitations  
and uh saint joseph of cupertino his  levitations are definitely among the most  
numerous of all levitators there  are at least 70 recorded episodes  
and although he left no written impression of what  it felt like to have one of these levitations he  
always called it my giddiness and would apologize  afterwards uh he once told one witness i'm very  
sorry my body is out of order was 100 years  following joseph's death that pope benedict the  
14th examined the eyewitness accounts  of the levitations of which there were  
hundreds now the report of joseph desa in the  acta santorum sanctorum was in excess of 1 000  
pages and listed 70 separate flights and although  normally skeptical of such miraculous events  
the pope wrote and i quote eyewitnesses  of unchallengeable integrity gave  
evidence of the famous uplifting and prolonged  flights of saint joseph when wrapped in ecstasy  
prosper lambertini was one of the investigators at  joseph's trial for canada's canonization to make  
him a saint and he also came away convinced as he  says and i quote at the time when i exercised the  
functions of the promoter of the faith in the  sacred congregation of the rights they examined  
the cause of the venerable servant of god and  examined his virtues there and following that  
i resigned from the functions of the promoter  the question resolved in a favorable manner  
in this cause the eyewitnesses whose integrities  above suspicion deposed on the subject of the very  
famous elevations from the ground the grand  aerial flights of the ecstatic servant  
of god so joseph's levitations continued until his  death at age 60 joseph's doctor francesco pierpali  
testified to church officials that  he also witnessed several levitations  
during one examination with several doctors joseph  spontaneously levitated three feet above the chair  
uh dr pier paulie attempted to pull him  down but did not have the strength to do so  
and this happened at least three times as pure  paulie testified before church officials i noticed  
that he was raised about a palm over the said  chair in the same position as before the rapture  
i tried to lower his legs down but i  could not it remained stretched out  
so joseph's case is definitely among the  strongest on record and as olivier leroy  
the author of the first book on levitation writes  if there is a cluster of cases on levitation which  
appear from the outset compact and varied enough  in order to resist the testing of the proposed  
rules it is manifestly that which we find in  the life of joseph of cupertino the existence of  
joseph of cupertino appears to have been organized  in order to prove the existence of levitation  
because of the number and the variety of the  phenomena and the diversity of the places where   they were produced joined with an intellectual  quality social and moral of the witnesses  
who verified them in order to reject these  witnesses it is necessary to admit to an organized  
hoax or a collective hallucination of unbelievable  power aldon butler who wrote a multi-volume series  
called butler's lives of the saints was also  similarly convinced and writes saint joseph's life  
was one long succession of ecstasies miracles of  healing and supernatural happenings on a scale not  
paralyzed in the reasonably authenticated lives  of any other saint saint joseph cupertino in both  
the extended number of these experiences provides  the classical examples of levitation for if many  
of the early incidents are doubtful some of those  recorded in his later years are very well attested  
uh pioneering researcher herbert thurston agrees  and said it is very difficult to believe that they  
the witnesses to cupertino's levitations  could have been deceived as to the broad   fact that the saints did in fact float in the  air as they were convinced they had seen him do  
under every possible variety of conditions  and in many different surroundings
so yeah joseph was definitely the most famous  levitating saint i think of all times and his  
case uh is absolutely authenticated uh joseph  was canonized in 1767 and is now suitably the  
patron saint of air travelers pilots and students  and many biographies have been published about  
his life and now we get to the top three cases of  levitation for case number three i choose eusepio  
palladino lucepio is a medium who became world  famous for her levitations she was born in 1854  
in naples italy and her levitations are perhaps  the most uh studied in history she traveled  
across europe for more than a decade visiting  and convincing one scientist after another  
displaying her incredible mediumistic abilities  in their very strict laboratory settings
eusepio palladino rose from his obscurity and she  became one of the most famous spiritual mediums in  
history she did senses for years when she finally  began to attract widespread attention and in 1889  
an italian scientist by the name of the le  chavalier cheya and a spanish profess professor  
don manuel otero acevedo began conducting seances  with uh usapia and as dr shia writes mr tara  
uh was the closest to the medium and perceived the  first unexpected ascension because they felt her  
arms to rise very gently and not wanting to let  go of the hands of the medium they held on to her  
during her ascension this splendid case of  levitation was even more deserving of attention  
as it took place under the most rigorous  surveillance and with the lightness of   the feather usafia paladino was then observed  to perch lightly on a table in a trance state  
and the scientists were amazed and asked out loud  if it was possible for usapia to levitate again  
and as dr chia chaya writes immediately eusepia  was lifted 10 to 15 centimeters over the table  
and each of us were able to pass our  hands under the feet of the magician   suspended in the air and the next event also  astonished the scientists lucepia's head was  
resting on the edge of the table while the  rest of her body extended horizontally in   the air without any visible support as dr shaya  writes although this was produced in darkness  
this important feat was observed scrupulously  with the greatest care by all and in a manner  
that rendered it most evident as if it had taken  place in broad daylight while many of these uh  
levitations did occur in darkness uh dr shea  later did observe usapia to levitate in full light  
as he says i had the occasion to be a witness to  a thing even more extraordinarily one evening i  
saw the medium extended in the state of the most  complete cadillac holding herself in a horizontal  
position with only the head supported by the  edge of the table for five minutes under the  
light of gas lamps in the presence of professor  desintist and the well-known writer dr capueno  
mr frederick verdunois and others so this  is when usapia began to be intensely studied  
three years later in 1892 more than a half dozen  eminent european scientists studied eusebius  
abilities including giavano chaparrali the  director of the astronomical observing observatory  
of milan and carl duprell the doctor of philosophy  in munich and angelo brotherio the professor of  
philosophy and giuseppe garroso the professor of  physics and other prominent scientists one very  
prominent scientist was cesar lombroso who was a  psych uh psychologist at the university of turin  
and the founder of modern criminology another  prominent scientist was charles richet  
a physiologist at the faculty do medicine  in paris and a soon-to-be nobel prize winner  
all of them observed usapia under controlled  conditions to levitate in the air with her chair  
after she would be set gently down on the table as  cesar lambroso writes the chair with usapia in it  
was not violently dashed but lifted without  hitting anything on the table and mr richet  
and i are sure that we did not  even assist levitation by our force  
so they got a scale which measured her  weight and they were able to repeatedly  
record a reduction in usapia's weight under fully  controlled conditions on two occasions uh richey  
and nebroso held her hands eusebio levitated  completely off the ground and was set on a table  
ayusapiya voluntarily allowed herself  to be studied like a lab rat and many  
scientists of various disciplines uh studied her  abilities uh the well-known researcher hear word  
carrington who conducted his own levitation  experiments was one scientist who observed her  
but there were many others all of whom observed  her to levitate fully or partially or produce a  
wide variety of mediumistic phenomena and all of  them came away convinced so she is definitely one  
of the most studied and best authenticated  levitators in history as one witness writes  
i became a witness to the levitation of the medium  into the air in the middle of the room without any   support she was then in a trance state and was  lifted up gradually slowly and lightly into the  
air all the while staying erect and came back  down just as slowly and lightly on the floor  
another scientist uh mr ochorowicz  witnessed another levitation as he says  
another feat more surprising and more rare was  the complete levitation of the medium's person  
held at all times by the handsome feet levitated  from the ground and carried with her in a state  
of catalepsy onto the table and passing my hands  under her ankle boots i was able to establish that  
between her and the table there was a distance of  four to five feet so many many scientists wanted  
to have a chance to study usapia and she always  agreed to be studied and uh she in 1895 uh she  
was studied by a specially selected commission of  european scientists uh very high level scientists  
uh including colonel de rochas administrator of  the cold depolar technique the baron de watteville  
a master of physical scientists and many  others and these experiments were successful so
eusapia was able to prove over and over and over  again under controlled laboratory conditions  
that she had this ability to levitate and not  only levitate she had other strange abilities  
like some of the state saints eusapia was able to  actually change her height a phenomenon known as  
elongation like many other mediums she was  able to speak in many different languages  
and would occasionally emit light or perfume from  her body scientists often put her body on a scale  
to measure her weight and this showed that she  actually lost weight not only during the sense but  
afterwards on a few occasions in her very later  years there were a few accusations of trickery  
but nevertheless scientists were  unable to account for most of the   phenomena she produced and as the well-known  psychical researcher nander foder writes  
the levitations of usapia palladino  are among the best observed cases  
and now we get to case number two this is exciting  for case number two i chose saint teresa of avila  
of the more than 330 known cases i think saint  teresa's case rises well above the breast  
although she lived nearly 500 years ago her feet  are still remembered today probably because she  
was a prolific author and an incredible mystic  her works are still uh considered classics of  
mystical literature today and are still in print  she was born in 1515 and although she tried to  
hide her strange abilities large numbers of people  witnessed her levitations many who left recorded  
statements saint teresa became a nun at a very  early age but she didn't take it really seriously  
it wasn't until she turned age 40  that uh she saw some of the other nuns  
who appeared to her to be sort of shallow  and taking the whole religious vocation  
not very seriously this is when she decided  to become serious in her religious studies  
but she was very dedicated to spirituality and  despite suffering from very ill health she left  
her convent and traveled across spain and founded  the reformed communities of carmelites which was  
a very strict and devout religious institution  uh saint teresa spent much of her time in prayer  
it was during these very long prayer sessions that  she first began to experience levitations and she  
didn't like them she found them very frightening  very awkward and distracting and she prayed that  
her episodes would stop as she once wrote do you  think is a small disturbance for a person to be  
very much in his senses and see his soul carried  off and even the body without knowing where that  
soul is going what or who does this or how so  this started with out-of-body experiences for  
her but soon transformed into full-on levitations  and to her annoyance these episodes continued  
on several occasions when she started to  levitate she would call her fellow sisters   to hold her down so that she could continue doing  services on other occasions when this happened  
she ordered everyone out of her convent and only  when she felt an approaching episode when saint  
teresa received the holy communion she did this  thousands of times of course but on rare occasions  
during this she would sometimes rise into the air  and hover uh one person who viewed the levitation  
was bishop yeps and this occurred when she  was about to receive the holy host from the  
don alvaro of mendoza who was then the bishop  of avila she reached out and grasped the grill  
and the bishop quickly administered the  sacrament several of the witnesses there watched   the levitation and theresa quickly realized her  predicament and threw herself bodily to the ground  
many people who observed her levitations  uh talked about it under oath during  
a church inquiry into saint teresa's life  one witness was sister anne who testified  
on one occasion between one and two o'clock in  the day time i was in the choir waiting for the  
belt to ring when our holy mother saint teresa  entered and knelt down for perhaps the half of  
a quarter of an hour as i was looking on she was  raised about half a yard from the ground without  
her feet touching it at this i was terrified and  she for her part was trembling all over so i moved  
to where she was and i put my hands under her feet  where i remained weeping for something like a half  
an hour while the ecstasy lasted then suddenly  she sank down and rested on her feet and turning  
to me she asked who i was and if i was there for a  long time i responded yes and she ordered me under  
obedience to say nothing of what i had seen i  have in fact said nothing until the present moment  
at least nine other first-hand witnesses testified  to teresa's levitations during this church inquiry  
and some reported that teresa's body would  was actually luminous giving off visible light  
these episodes were common enough that teresa was  often seen clutching the ground in a vain attempt  
to keep from levitating and one priest reported  that teresa levitated while standing in acquire  
with the other nuns as she watched she  grabbed at the floor mats to hold herself  
but still rose up into the air still holding  the mats on another occasion saint teresa  
was listening to saint john of the cross he was  speaking of the trinity when suddenly he levitated  
and saint teresa caught up in the rapture  floated up in the kneeling position to meet him  
at that moment sister beatrice walked in  and saw both of these saints hovering in an  
ecstatic trance this incredible event was later  memorialized in a painting hung in the church  
so what's interesting about saint teresa's case  is that she was actually able to give a first-hand  
account of what it was like to levitate as  she wrote in her 1565 autobiography which  
her superiors ordered her to write she didn't  want to do it but she was under orders to do so  
theresa described exactly what it feels like as  she says i quote when i tried to resist these  
raptures it seemed that i was being lifted up by  a force beneath my feet so powerful that i know  
nothing to which i can compare it for it came  with a much greater vehemence than any other  
spiritual experience and i felt as if i were being  ground to powder it is a terrible struggle and to  
continue it against the lord's will avails very  little for no power can do anything against his  
if we resist out of humility the same effects  follow as if we had given it our entire consent  
these effects are very striking and one of them  is the manifestation of the lord's mighty power  
as we are unable to resist his majesty's  will either in soul or in body and are not  
our own masters we realize that however this  irksome truth may be there is one stronger than  
ourselves that these favors are bestowed by him  that we ourselves can do absolutely nothing this  
imprints in us a great humility i confess that in  me it produces great fear at first a terrible fear  
one sees one body being lifted up from the ground  and although the spirit draws it after itself  
and if no resistance is offered does so very  gently with great sweetness one does not lose  
consciousness at least i myself had sufficient  to enable me to realize i was being lifted up  
the majesty of him who can do this is manifested  in such a way that the hair stands on end teresa  
tried very hard to resist these but she just  found it impossible to do so she writes no  
means of resistance is possible with rapture  as a rule there is no such possibility often  
it comes like a strong swift impulse before your  thought can forewarn you of it you can do nothing  
and anything to help yourself you see and feel  this cloud or this powerful eagle rising and  
bearing you up with it on its wings you realize i  repeat indeed see that you are being carried away  
you know not wither for though rapture brings us  delight the weakness of our nature makes us afraid  
of it and we need to be resolute and courageous in  soul much more so for than what has been described  
occasionally i have been able to make some  resistant but at the cost of great exhaustion  
for i would feel very weary afterwards as  though i had been fighting with a powerful giant  
at other times resistance has been impossible  and my soul has been born away and as a rule  
my head also without being able to prevent it  sometimes my whole body has been affected to  
the point of being raised up from the ground so  teresa did her best to stop it but she couldn't  
and she also wrote of what it felt like uh these  weird physiological and mental effects as she says  
i can testify that after a rapture my body seems  as light and buoyant as if all weight had left it  
sometimes this is so noticeable that i could  hardly tell when my feet were touching the ground   for while the rapture lasts the body often  remains deaf and unable to do anything it  
continues all the time as it was when the  rapture came upon it in a sitting position  
for example with the hands open or shut the  subject rarely loses consciousness is undeserved  
and though incapable of action with respect  to outward things the subject can still hear   and understand but only dimly as though  from a long way off so all those saint  
chariza's case occurred many many years ago  it's particularly reputable not only because  
they were outside witnesses because because  she gave very long and detailed explanations  
of what it was like to levitate as olivier leroy  the author of the first book on levitation writes  
we can leave our prejudice aside and clearly  admit this case herbert thurston was also a  
pioneering researcher into levitation and says of  saint teresa to my thinking the most satisfactory  
example of this phenomenon is to be found in  the case of saint teresa the importance of her  
case lies in the fact that she was seen by others  raised in the air that she herself bore witness  
to the reality of these levitations at the same  time no one who has studied her life and writings  
will be disposed to question either her good faith  or common sense so that's the case of saint teresa  
which is so astonishing and well verified with  her own written account that i had to give her  
the number two spot on the case of the top 20  levitations and now we get to case number one  
drum roll the case for number one  i chose the case of daniel dungles  
this is arguably the best recorded levitation of  all times in all of human history and it comes  
from this remarkable man daniel holm he was born  in 1833 as a child he had many psychic experiences  
which culminated him becoming the single most  influential spiritual medium medium of his time  
his fame i think rose from the simple fact that he  was able to produce a wide variety of inexplicable  
paranormal events virtually on demand he started  holding seances as a teenager and by his early 20s  
he was already a highly celebrated figure  traveling across the united states and the world  
keeping audiences with numerous heads of states  kings queens dukes leaders in art and literature  
religion science and politics he met with  elizabeth barrett browning the famous poet  
he met with mark twain he even met with the pope  he met with tolstoy who witnessed a levitation  
as tolstoy wrote in a letter to his wife  home was levitated in his chair i held his  
feet while he floated over our heads so  holmes case is astonishing and not once  
was he ever caught in any kind of trickery  though his case was certainly controversial  
while many people during his time were able to  produce physical spiritualistic phenomena such  
as table lifting or apparitions none were able to  equal daniel holm's abilities he not only produced  
all of the above phenomena but many more including  miraculous healings glowing lights coming from  
his body superhuman strength incompetability uh  elongation and most importantly here levitation  
uh he was a normal child by all accounts though a  very delicate health and his career as a medium uh  
was pretty much assured at a very young age when  poltergeist-like activity broke out in his home  
in connecticut so he was already holding stances  and giving readings for people in his neighborhood  
and it was during these uh early senses that  the spiritualistic phenomena was produced  
and it happened so quickly for him that it became  very clear that this was going to be his life's  
work but he himself was surprised when he  began levitating at age 19. this occurred  
in 1852 during a seance at the home of a  mr cheney in south manchester connecticut  
as many of the expected manifestations were  produced one of the sitters suddenly shouted out  
as she says suddenly and without any expectation  expectations on the part of the company  
mr holm was taken up in the air i had a hold of  his hand at the time and i and others felt his  
feet they were listed a foot from the floor he  palpitated from head to foot apparently with the  
contended emotions of joy and fear which choked  his utterance and again and again he was taken  
from the floor the third time he was carried to  the ceiling of the apartment from which his hand  
and head came into gentle contact i omitted  to state these later demonstrations were made  
in response to a request of mine that that the  spirits give us something that would satisfy  
everyone in the room of their presence the medium  was much astonished and more alarmed than the rest  
so this was his first levitation experience and  he had no reason to expect a repeat performance  
however it did happen over and over again in front  of countless witnesses making him definitely the  
most famous levitators of all times in 1857 daniel  visited the home of account and countess in france  
and during a seance there he levitated home wrote  about this in his 1864 biography incidents in my  
life as he says and i quote the lady of  the house turned to me and said abruptly  
why are you sitting in the air and i'm looking  we found that the chair remained in its place  
but that i was elevated two or three inches  above it and my feet were not touching the floor   this may show how utterly unconscious i am  at times to the sensation of levitation as  
is usual when i have not got above the level  of the heads of those about me and when they   change their position much as they frequently do  and looking wistfully at such a phenomena it can  
i came down again but not until i had remained  so raised about a half minute from the time  
of its first being seen in 1859 daniel visited  bayswater in england where he conducted a seance  
and one of them people president present was  j g crawford who was then a very vocal skeptic  
after this sans however uh j.g  crawford changed his tune and wrote  
and i quote a very curious affair took place an  explanation of which i cannot hazard a conjecture  
mr home remarked i feel as if i'm going to rise  the room was quite dark he said i am getting up  
and as i was only a few feet from him i put  my hand to him and i indulinbly felt the soles  
of both of his boots right some three feet  above the level of the floor and on doing so  
he said don't touch me or i shall come down of  course i instantly desisted but down he came  
in less than five minutes after this he remarked  i am again ascending and from the sound of his   voice we could not we could but not infer that  he was actually rising towards the ceiling of  
the anteroom he then appeared to float in the  archway meant to rise to the corners of the  
room where we were sitting and we heard him quite  distinctly make three marks on the ceiling then he  
came softly down and lay stretched out with his  back on the table in which position we found him  
when the gas was lighted and we distinctly saw the  marks on the ceiling where we had heard him make
in 1860 daniel went to london and gave a  remarkable demonstration of his levitation  
abilities as one witness says after  a pause mr holmes said he felt as if  
he was about to be lifted up and he moved  from the table and shortly said i am rising  
but we could not see him they  have put me on my back he said  
i ask will you kindly bring him as much as  possible towards the window so that we may see him   and at once he was floated with his feet  horizontally into the light of the window  
so that we all saw his feet and a part of  his legs resting or floating in the air  
like a feather about six feet from the ground  and three feet above the height of the table  
he was then floated into the dark and he exclaimed  they have turned me around i am coming towards you  
and i saw his head and face the same height as  before as if floating on water instead of air  
he then floated back and came down so while he often floated in darkness or near  complete darkness uh many times people did see him  
in uh rooms that were light enough to verify his  levitations and it was not always the case that  
he levitated in darkness in many cases the light  was more than sufficient for people to see him  
rise upwards in july of 1860 daniel held  the a seance at the home of a prominent  
englishman in london and uh one of the attendees  was a prominent this citizen by the names of  
james watson was a very wealthy man from  liverpool england and as james watson writes  
mr holm stated that he was being lifted up in the  air and he crossed the table over the heads of the   parties sitting around it i asked him to make a  mark with his pencil on the ceiling and he said  
he had no pencil i rose up and said i would lent  him mine and by standing and stretching upwards  
i was unable to reach his hand about seven feet  distance from the floor and i placed there in a  
pencil and laying hold and keeping hold of his  hand i moved along with him five or six paces  
as he floated above me in the air and i only let  go of his hand when i stumbled against the stool  
mr home as he floated along kept ringing the  small handbell to indicate the locality in the  
room which was probably 40 by 30 feet and i saw  his body eclipse two lines of light issuing from  
between the top of the door and its architrave mr  home was replaced as he stated with the greatest  
care and gentleness in the chair from which he  rose but this i could not see so daniel was fully  
booked at all times to give senses in 1861 he  was giving a sense with seven sitters when again  
he was levitated one of the witnesses jon jones uh  writes two of the three gaslights were now put out  
and the fire burning brightly gave a subdued light  in the room mr holm then became cataleptic in his  
hands and arms and he was raised from his seat  till he stood upright then he rose vertically till  
he was a foot above the floor his head level  with this chandelier this was repeated twice  
so many people saw him levitate in  conditions that were light enough to view him  
but what often happened is when he was viewed  too closely or people stared at him this caused  
the energy that was levitating him to be broken  and he would slowly float to the ground so this  
was very strange so he attracted the attention  of a lot of researchers one was william howitt  
a spiritual investigator who attended several  of holmes levitations and as he says mr holm was  
lifted about a foot from the ground but did not  float as he frequently does in the strongest light
once he was staying in england at the home of  a witness who witnessed at least five separate  
levitations as she writes in her diary mr holm's  arms were raised and he walked to the end of the  
room where he was lifted off the ground and  raised until his feet were on a level with   the top of the chiffonier between four and five  feet off the ground i distinctly saw his body  
carried along erect in the air it then returned to  its former place where it remained for some time  
at length that floated forwards in the air passed  behind the gas chandelier which was suspended in   the center of the apartment and he then descended  gently onto the floor close to the chair in which  
a lady was sitting when he descended his arms  were paralyzed in a short time they returned  
to their natural state she also witnessed a rare  levitation in which light was emitted from his  
body she says mr holm was now led to the end of  the room which was very dark he was raised from  
the ground and a beautiful star was visible and  also one like a small comet he said a star was on  
his forehead and one in each hand and we saw the  three very bright and many others glancing about  
he was fixed against the wall the luminous  appearance was so distinct as to render the  
papering of the wall perfectly distinct and he  floated along the room and was placed on his knees  
on the sofa again he was carried  up and floated along the room  
so many high level citizens saw him levitating  among them was lord adair a young british nobleman  
who accompanied daniel on many of his adventures  and observed many outstanding levitations from  
1867 to 1869. in fact lord adair wrote a privately  published book about his experiences with home  
but he soon withdrew it from publication  because it was generating intense controversy  
it was on december 13 1868 that daniel had  his most famous levitation uh in this case  
his levitation took place in london and he was  levitated outside the window of a five-story  
building and back in through another window this  event was witnessed by lord adair lord lindsay  
and charles wayne all very uh highly regarded uh  citizens and the levitation was so spectacular uh  
it was widely criticized as being impossible yet  all three witnesses and home himself have never  
retracted their statements that this took place  on december 20th 1868 lord adair reports that  
he and several other witnesses saw home rise out  of his seat and float to the ceiling in full view  
and on still another occasion lord adair  witnessed a very rare outside levitation  
as he writes presently we all saw him approaching  and eventually he rose off the ground he floated  
by in front of us at a height which carried him  over the broken wall which is about two feet high  
there could not be a better test of being  off the ground for as he crossed the wall   his form was not in the least bit raised but the  movement was quite horizontal and uniform the  
distance that we saw him thus carried must have  been at least 10 or 12 guards by this time many  
scientists were converging to study daniel  holm one of these was a russian scientist  
alexander von butlero and using a weighing  device he discovered that home could change  
his weight or change the weight of a hundred  pound table to fluctuate from seventy pounds  
to a hundred and fifty pounds by simply resting  his fingers lightly on the table another scientist  
who came away absolutely convinced was professor  robert hare of the university of pennsylvania who  
was best known for his invention of the blowtorch  a very prominent supporter of daniel holm  
was alfred russell wallace who is independently of  charles darwin developed the theory of evolution  
so homes supporters continued to grow and  uh lord lindsay testified that he once saw  
home when quoting in full light standing  in the air 17 inches from the ground  
probably daniel's leading supporter was sir  william crooks a leading british scientist who  
decided that he was going to expose the fakery of  spiritualistic phenomena in 1871 he studied holmes  
abilities and observed a first-hand levitation  under carefully controlled laboratory conditions  
and quickly became home's biggest  supporter as william crooks writes  
there are at least 100 recorded instances of  mr home rising from the ground in the presence  
of as many separate persons this has occurred  in my presence on four occasions in darkness  
but i will mention only those occasions in which  the deductions of region were confirmed by the  
sense of sight on three separate occasions i  have seen him raise completely from the floor  
of the room and on each occasion i had the full  opportunity of watching the occurrence as it was  
taking place on one occasion he went to a clear  part of the room and after standing quietly for  
a minute told us he was rising i saw him slowly  rise up with a continuous gliding movement  
and remained about six inches off the ground  for several seconds when he slowly descended  
on another occasion i was invited to come to him  when he rose 18 inches off the ground and i passed  
my hands under his feet around him and over his  head when he was in the air on several occasions  
home and the chair on which he was sitting at the  table rose off the ground this was generally done  
very deliberately and home sometimes tucked his  feet on the seat of the chair and held up his  
hands in full view of all of us on such occasions  i have gone down and seen and felt all four legs  
were off the ground at the same time homes feet  being on the chair less frequently the levitating  
extended to those sitting around him once my  wife was thus raised off the ground in her chair  
so crooks was of course totally convinced  although he wasn't happy about it because he  
you know believed in science and he could not  explain what was happening here and this he writes   the phenomenon i am prepared to attest to are so  extraordinary and so directly opposed the most  
firmly rooted articles of scientific belief  the ubiquity and invariable actions of the  
force of gravitation but even now on  recalling the details of what i witnessed   there is an antagonism in my mind between reason  which pronounces it to be scientifically possible  
and the consciousness of my senses both of touch  and sight are not lying witnesses he is absolutely  
convinced that holmes did levitate because  he sought himself and he says to reject the  
recorded evidence on this subject is to reject all  human testimony whatsoever for no fact in sacred  
or profane history is supported by any stronger  array of proofs another very prominent scientist  
who became a convert was dr hoxley a well-known  english physician a home came to dr huxley's home  
and hoxley witnessed him to levitate on a table at  least eight inches high and was able to verify the  
levitation by passing his hands underneath the  table legs as huxley writes that which i have  
known of holmes life and his abilities leaves me  absolutely convinced of his veracity his honesty  
his good vigilance and of the no bless of  his character so as you can see there's no  
shortage of witnesses to homes levitations  on one occasion he was standing under a tree  
uh when he had what is known as a crisis  levitation it saved his life as holm wrote in  
his biography suddenly i was seized by the collar  of my coat and vest and lifted off the ground  
he was deposited a few feet uh to the side  at which moment a large branch fell from the  
tree and landed where he had been only moments  earlier on several occasions uh he experienced  
partial levitations while bedridden with severe  illness uh his head would be lifted up and his  
bedspread or his pillow would be adjusted and  there were many other levitations of this kind um  
often said that there's a peculiar  effect that the human touch or even light  
can disturb his levitations which  ideally occurred during low light levels  
what does it feel like to levitate  well he did give a firsthand account   and his descriptions are among the most detailed  recorded as he says and i quote during these  
elevations or levitations i usually experience in  my body no particular sensations other than what  
i can only describe as an electrical fullness  about the feet i feel no hand supporting me and  
since the first time above described i have never  felt any fear though i should have fallen from  
the ceiling of some rooms in which i had been  raised i could not have escaped serious injury  
i am generally lifted up perpendicularly my i am  my arms frequently become rigid and drawn above my  
head as if i were grasping the unseen power which  slowly raises me from the floor at times when i  
reach the ceiling my feet are brought on a low  with my face and i am as it were in a reclining  
position i have frequently been so suspended  for four or five minutes on some occasions the  
rigidity of my arm relaxes and i have with the  pencil made letters and signs on the ceiling  
some of which now exist in london so as can be  seen daniel holmes levitations are so numerous so  
widely documented so widely observed by multiple  independent highly reputable witnesses it's very  
difficult to account for them unless they are  true as olivier leroy writes with daniel holm  
is particularly difficult to dismiss and doubt  the totality of the testimonies which establish  
the reality of this phenomenon and while holm's  reputation was occasionally attacked by skeptics  
anyone who came to him to test his abilities came  away convinced one of the worst criticisms came  
from count spada who after witnessing home  levitate couldn't explain it and said that  
he thought home exercises on the people present  an entrancing fascination which makes them see  
something that isn't there so that's why i  gave home the number one spot because he's  
levitated so many times under very rigorous  conditions in front of scientists over and  
over and over again and it was never once  caught in trickery uh danielle douglas home  
died in 1886 at the age of 53 years old  so that's my top 20 list of the best  
human levitation cases in all of recorded  history i'm sure other people might have  
come up with a different list because there are  many other fantastic cases there are some 330  
recorded cases i've interviewed at least a half  dozen people who have experienced this firsthand  
and uh so i am absolutely personally convinced  levitation is a real phenomena i wrote about  
these cases and many hundreds of others in my book  human levitation and i really think it's important  
people understand that we have the ability to fly  and we have many other super super human abilities  
we have really only begun to learn how truly  powerful and wonderful it is to be a human being  
i think it's very important that we all start to  wake up to our own natural abilities humans have  
the ability to fly it's absolutely amazing and  that's why i wanted to do this video i hope you've  
enjoyed it i know it's been a long program but  i thought it was very important that people know  
this so thanks once again for watching i really  appreciate it and until next time keep having fun
