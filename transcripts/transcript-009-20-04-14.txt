Do extraterrestrials intervene in the case of natural disasters? Yes! They do. Cases of ETs 
helping people are not rare. But cases involving a large-scale disaster are rare. This video 
presents the case of "Pat," a lady from Florida who experienced one of the most unusual 
encounters I've ever heard. She was taken from her home to assist in the rescue of thousands 
of people from a horrific natural disaster.

This case comes from chapter two of my book, ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS, now available at Amazon.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and today I'd like to talk to you about one of the most 
interesting UFO cases I think that I've ever investigated a question I'm often asked is do you 
think ETS would intervene if there were a large-scale disaster like a nuclear war I'll have to 
say I wouldn't count on it we've had a lot of conflict we've had a lot of disasters and there's 
not a whole lot of evidence of ET intervention at least I'm not on a mass scale but I'm not 
gonna rule it out either because of this one really interesting case and others in fact in my 
book the healing power of UFOs I devoted a chapter to cases of where people have been rescued 
there's about two or three cases of people have been saved from drowning a couple of cases of 
people they've saved from shipwrecks people who have been saved from car accidents severe weather 
even assault so yes it does happen in this next case I think is a really good example of ET 
intervention it involves a lady by the name of Pat she was born in 1943 in Key West Florida and 
has had encounters her whole life they began around age five when she one day came home from the 
circus and went to bed that evening on the second-story bedroom and saw a face looking in the 
window a face that she now recognizes a typical gray but at the time she thought perhaps some 
something had followed her home from the circus it was about a year later she was diagnosed with 
leukemia was about to go under undergo treatment when the disease miraculously disappeared really 
baffled the doctors so yeah a lot of unusual experiences from a very young age only a few years 
later she was out in the woods behind her house when they filled up with the brilliant bright 
white light so bright she couldn't see it she'd probably had missing time she not sure at the 
time she thought perhaps she had had a mystical experience now she relates it to her UFO encounters 
because as she grew up she'd often have missing time just couldn't see where the time went how this 
happened a number of times and was not particularly unusual she'd also have sort of UFO dreams 
where she'd find herself on board a UFO and there would be great i p-- ETS she also had a number 
of psychic experiences precognition there was one incident which occurred in 1969 June 1969 she 
was 26 years old and she had a vision of a plane crashing right in the on the street in downtown 
Miami she worked as a cocktail waitress at the time her friends her co-workers kind of just 
laughed at her teased her mercilessly until it actually happened and eleven people were killed 
she predicted it she's predicted a number of events the death of President Eisenhower and a number 
of disasters and things like this I also get psychic impressions on people so yeah a lot of 
psychic stuff one evening she came home from a psychic class where she was learning about 
spiritual matters and had a face-to-face fully conscious encounter with great ITT's they were 
in her living room one of them was dressed in a pin truck pinstripe suit she believes so that it 
wouldn't scare her so a lot of encounters but probably her most amazing the one I really wanted 
to talk about today occurred on November 13th 1985 she woke up and she was not inside you know 
she agonda been is normal woke up she usually wakes up on board a UFO this time she woke up 
standing next to one there was a human looking figure in a blue jumpsuit with dark skin standing 
next to her he about five feet tall there was a very large craft maybe a hundred feet wide 
metallic had a ramp coming down it there were grays and human looking figures surrounding it 
walking around it there was another very large craft a few hundred yards away and Pat was led by 
this figure that she was standing next to into this small town she said it looked like it was 
maybe Mexico Peru South America somewhere it wasn't the US there was lots of lush lush foliage 
and it was a pretty large town but not super well developed and they went into this town and 
started collecting people and bringing in them back into the UFO first it was just a couple but 
they did it for a couple of hours at least and brought in several hundred people into this object 
she says she was very obedient doesn't know why she was doing this everyone who they took from 
this town was also very obedient asked no questions and just followed them into the UFO like 
sheep and after they had collected she's estimating somewhere between a thousand and two 
thousand people between the two objects there was a massive explosion off in the distance shortly 
later a huge wave of mud and debris swept over the town destroying everything in its path killing 
a lot of people she says it was horrific terrible it was very scary this is UFOs came down and 
scooped people up out of the mud flows as many as they could and took them into the craft and 
that's about all she remembers she does remember wandering around inside the craft she went to 
the upper level there was a huge central column there was all types of greys and human looking 
ETS of different races there and lots of people from this town next thing she knows she's being 
deposited back in her driveway back at her home in the US and wakes up the next morning freaking 
out she calls her best friend she says I had it another one of my UFO dreams and describes what 
happened and her friend said you better turn on the news right now so Pat hung up turned on the 
TV and there was her dream being played out on pretty much every channel turned out the Nevada 
del Ruiz volcano had just exploded it sent a huge wave of mud and debris into the town of Armero in
Colombia and killed an estimated 23,000 people this whole experience left her very traumatized she 
feels like these people were rescued from the object a lot weren't but at least a couple of 
thousand and presumably they're not being returned she does not know where they went or what 
happened to them but feels pretty confident that the ETS rescued them not on purpose it was a very 
traumatizing incident barb because it gave her a level of validation she's never had before she 
ended up going to therapy about it so yeah following that she's had further encounters she had 
one encounter where she was taken to an underground base she believes in Egypt she saw pyramids 
she had another encounter where they took her over New York City and then back to her over to Los 
Angeles across the entire United States did it two or three times and explain to her how they are 
able to fly their craft like this how they do it they said is they don't actually move what they're 
doing is they're expanding and contracting the space around them a lot of it went over her head but 
they tried to explain it to her so she's had a number of encounters following that one of her last 
encounters occurred in her mid nineteen orner mid 50s she said she was taken on board there were 
greys there and they did this procedure to her where she fell they took all her memories and 
basically recorded her entire mind all her thoughts so much so that she felt like she was being 
carbon copied in a way and that turned out to be her last encounter she kind of jokes that she 
doesn't need to be abducted anymore because they have a copy of her on board this craft so yeah 
it's a very strange encounter definitely has some unique elements but also fits the pattern I've 
seen in other encounters so yeah this is one case out of 15 in my from my book onboard UFO 
encounters all about people who have been taken on board UFO craft thank you for listening
