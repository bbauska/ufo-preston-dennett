UFO ENCOUNTER AT BLACKJACK CAMPGROUND
Feb 12, 2021

Summary:
Feb 12, 2021
In July of 1982, eleven friends went camping at Blackjack Campground in a remote area on Catalina Island, off the coast of southern California. Around sunset a thick fog rolled in. Shortly later, the UFOs arrived. Three unidentified glowing objects approached silently and hovered in front of the witnesses. As the eleven friends struggled to understand what they were seeing, the temperature dropped dramatically. Somebody noticed that their watches had all stopped. Someone else discovered that their flashlights weren't working. Nor were their cameras.

Then the show began. Beams of brilliant light flashed between the objects. Before long, one of the objects released other craft, which soon approached the witnesses.

So begins an encounter which would change the lives of eleven people forever. It's a multiple witness UFO encounter involving multiple strange effects both electromagnetic and physiological.

Catalina Island is located in a UFO hotspot. Many other encounters have occurred on the Island and in the surrounding area. The UFO encounter at Blackjack Campground is one of nearly 150 cases involving UFO and "USOs," unidentified submersible objects.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And today's episode is called, "UFO Contact At Blackjack 
Campground". This is a really incredible encounter which occurred in July of 1982 on Catalina Island 
located off the Southern California coast. Catalina is today known as a very active area for UFOs 
and USOs, unidentified submersible objects. I've documented more than 150 cases in this area I've 
investigated many of them personally many of these cases have taken place on catalina island itself 
including the encounter I'd like to talk about today before I get into the 1982 encounter I'd 
like to discuss another encounter which occurred 16 years earlier in 1966. it was during the day 
and a navy helicopter was flying by catalina island when the crew saw a metallic object 
hovering over blackjack peak one of them a navy photographer by the name of leland hansen 
quickly grabbed his movie camera and managed to capture almost a minute of footage as 
this object moved over blackjack peak over catalina island and off into the distance 
it's very famous footage some of the best we have up until that time and has never been explained 
and it took place at the same exact location of the encounter I'd like to talk about today
in on the 4th of july weekend of 1982 a group of 11 young actors writers photographers people 
working within the entertainment industry decided they were going to have a camp out at blackjack 
campgrounds on catalina island this was something that they had done annually for a number of years 
it became something of a tradition and each year they would pick a theme for their little party 
and this uh year the person who got to choose the theme was jonathan fox 
jonathan fox was a young actor who had done bit parts on three's company in the jeffersons and 
actually had a recurring role on the television show fame and it was his turn to pick a theme 
and he decided to choose e.t the extraterrestrial the movie had just come out one month earlier 
actually and uh was a huge sensation so this was the theme he chose uh he told everyone to pick a 
little prop you know a fun item uh that they could build like a communicator and phone home to e.t so 
all 11 friends showed up four arrived on july 2nd while the rest arrived on saturday july 3rd 
one of jonathan's friends I'll call him oscar that's a pseudonym he brought a bunch of flat 
cadmium batteries with strobes to sort of like call e.t they're visible for about two miles 
and are designed to be put on highways during emergencies so everyone brought something one guy 
brought a landline flip phone to you know phone home to e.t uh they dressed up in fun clothes 
someone else brought the sound track to the movie star wars so they were just having fun with 
the theme like they did every year and around 5 p.m they had all arrived there and 
set up their camps lit a fire they got some drinks together and some appetizers 
and just sort of spread out and explored the campsite the campsite itself is at a lower level 
and if you go upwards this little hill there's a large flat area to explore which is located just a 
few hundred feet above the campsite itself and this is where everyone had wandered to 
and they were both on sort of opposite sides this is a fairly large area blackjack campground is 
located on mount orizaba which is the highest location on catalina island it rises 2097 feet 
above sea level the camp site itself blackjack campsite is located at about 1600 feet elevation 
but still gives a great view of both the ocean side and the land side of the water so they 
were just all enjoying their view they set up the little batteries uh the strobe lights jonathan had 
found this weird circle on the campsite where no grass grew he joked a number uh earlier a couple 
of years earlier that maybe a ufo had landed there or this would be a great place for ufo to land 
and so in a little uh idea of inspiration he decided to take the strobe lights that one of 
them had brought and he set them up in a circle to sort of call down e.t so everyone was just having 
fun with the theme and the first weird thing they noticed was a weird fog started to roll in
uh it rolled in hard and fast and completely obliterated their view of the ocean itself 
of the mainland and most of catalina island there were a few peaks that rose above this fog but it 
was kind of eerie and sort of fit this star wars music and uh they were talking about it and just 
still wandering around and having fun when one of them lisa again that's not her real name 
she started shouting out she says look they're here here they come they're coming look 
and at this point the group was scattered across this top plateau and jonathan himself 
was looking towards the ocean side and was looking at everyone else as they turned and 
looked towards lisa who was on the landward side so jonathan's looking out towards the ocean when 
suddenly there's this huge flash of pinkish light that lights up the whole fog that's below them and 
uh that kind of freaked him out and that he whirls around to see what everyone else is looking at 
and lisa's still shouting here they come they're coming and he runs with everyone else to the 
landward side of the island where they see these lights and uh someone's like look they're all look 
what is it what is it and they couldn't figure out what it was so here's this group of 11 people 
all clustered together staring at three star-like lights as they come moving slowly in 
from the south towards the island over the sort of santa catalina san pedro channel 
and at this point they look like very bright stars but clearly are not stars because they're moving 
and they didn't look like planes so everyone's trying to figure out what these things are and this 
is when they start offering up a bunch of different theories could it possibly be about 
poking out through the fog well they discarded that pretty immediately because the fog was very 
thick and well above the ocean itself they thought you know maybe a reflection from 
headlights off the island they were trying to find various theories to explain this 
because it was obviously wasn't a plane or a helicopter and it became particularly obvious 
when these objects moved even closer and became much brighter and uh at this point it was around 
9 00 p.m it had just gotten dark so these objects are becoming now very visible and uh 
it's becoming apparent to jonathan that these might be actual ufos and uh he's he tells his 
friends I can't believe this is really happening none of them could believe it um some of them were 
starting to get a little nervous and uh this is when something else weird happened so they've 
got this weird fog these three lights in a row one slightly higher than the other two and the 
center one and it appears to be slightly brighter than the other two and uh looks like there might 
even be something behind it like a saucer shape uh they can't quite tell but it's very bright 
and at this point something else weird happens the temperature around them plummets not just 
a little bit but a lot and all of them in fact started shivering and their teeth were shattering 
and uh it was very obvious to everyone that the temperature had dropped 
as jonathan says my legs started to shake at the same time five or six people standing 
near me started to shake and shiver and our teeth started chattering audibly I fell down 
two or three times but continued to stand up again each time another witness I'll call her maddie
she had joined this weekend camp out with her husband who was also there and as she's looking 
at this light she could see what looked like a saucer shape behind it she couldn't be sure but 
it was this big white gold light and there was clearly a solid object behind it she thought 
and the two smaller ones she said looked sort of reddish pink and were flanking either side 
of this main object and at this point she felt no fear and she says it wasn't scary 
no actually it was a very loving feeling I think the scary part was we didn't know 
what it was and you know being the people that we are we live in a fear-based society 
something might look wonderful and pretty but you don't know what's behind that door and that's kind 
of like the philosophy that happened with me that night but she was sure at this point that she was 
looking at an actual ufo and she says absolutely there was absolutely no doubt in my mind 
we don't know what it is but I definitely felt there were people out there that showed up really we 
set this up we did she also noticed the severe drop in temperature 
as she says I remember my body completely trembling it was freezing and every organ 
in my body was shaking her husband also reported quote severe cold and shaking 
so now we have the entire group of 11 friends sort of bunched together and they're talking 
excitedly and watching these strange lights which still seem to be approaching and getting closer 
and when the group will get nervous they would back off a little bit and then they would start 
talking again excitedly and the lights would come closer 
and as they got closer everyone realized that they were perfectly silent they were very still 
in the sky they almost felt like something was watching them and they started to get nervous 
again uh the music was still playing the star wars music and uh it was almost surreal jonathan said 
and as he says this was when quote a little bit of discomfort began to seep into the group one of the 
people there d she started to become really upset and she turned to jonathan accused him and said 
this is your fault this is your fault this is happening and he's like what are you talking about 
and she said you're the one who planned this party you're the one who did this and now look what's 
happened so some of the uh people 
in this group were not happy they were beginning to get a little uncomfortable and uh
as dee said it just wasn't fun anymore and everyone kept asking what are they what are they and 
another person would 
say oh you know just let's just wait let's look let's find out what this thing is 
uh one of the witnesses was very upset he kept saying this can't be ufos this just can't be ufos 
and everyone would turn to him and say well what do you think it is do you think it's a plane and 
he would say no and they go through the list and as he realized it was a ufo he became very upset 
and as they're watching these three lights trying to figure out what's going on and getting starting 
to get really nervous suddenly this bright pink light flashes and illuminates the entire 
fog bank for miles around them and it reminded jonathan of the light he had seen earlier when 
this whole incident began at some point someone remembered that they all had brought flashlights 
so he had his with him and tried to turn it on and it didn't work a couple of people pulled out their 
flashlights and their flashlights didn't work other people had brought flashlights so they ran down 
to the campsite and got their flashlights and came back and their flashlights didn't work 
either every single one of their flashlights failed so that kind of freaked them out 
and people are going like what the f is going on here and as jonathan says it really got freaky 
from that point on it was so surreal we knew we couldn't identify what was going on 
they were trying to explain this thing as maybe boats or planes but clearly wasn't and 
the sort of anxiety level and excitement level just continued to ramp up and up and then one of the 
guys who was a photographer
got his camera and said he could not get it to work it just wouldn't work well a couple of other 
people had brought cameras too so they got their cameras at least 
four people um had cameras and not one of them would work and so that freaked them out 
and at this point someone looked at their watch and realized it said 8 15. well they had been 
watching these objects since sunset and now it was completely dark it had to be at least nine o'clock 
so he knew his watch had stopped and everyone else looked at their watches who had them and every 
single one of their watches all had stopped at 8 15 p.m exactly so here we have 
multiple electromagnetic effects and other weird effects the temperature dropping 
and so the group was really freaked out at this point and uh they were getting really afraid
and the show really had only just begun suddenly a bright beam of red light blazed out from the 
center object and struck one of 
the objects on the side it was only visible for an instant and they all shouted out did you see 
that and an instant later the smaller object to the side flashed back to the larger one 
and everyone gasped in amazement and this is when it really began the three objects began to flash 
beams of light back and forth and what everyone thought was an obvious display everyone was just 
a gog and flabbergasted with amazement they couldn't believe what they were looking at 
and they were shouting out you know what's going on and jonathan's like this is like being in close 
encounters of the third kind this is the real thing guys something is going on here 
as jonathan says we became mesmerized we don't know how long that all went on but 
we were sitting on the ground shivering freaking out watching these lights dance back and forth 
between these three objects whatever they were these three points of light
maddie she remembers this part vividly as she says we had this little light show happen when 
this one light dropped out two other light things and they actually started blinking back and forth 
with each other was like oh my god what is this we believe they were communicating with each other 
another witness felt that it was a show that was put on quote as if for our benefit 
now maddie she was becoming increasingly emotional and this whole encounter was just 
starting to bring up weird feelings within her and she started to find find herself becoming 
very very emotional and she says at one point I looked at my ex-husband and I saw my life 
kind of flash before me he was a mess and I saw at that exact moment that this was not the man for me 
i just knew that there was something else to be done so she's having you know a life-changing 
moment while she's watching this thing 
and they had been watching these objects for at least an hour possibly two and at some point as 
they were watching these objects the guy who douglas I'll call him who had brought the 
flip phone the mobile landline he held up the phone and started pressing the buttons 
and held it up saying phone home et phone home and none of them could believe what happened next 
to everyone's shock the phone itself began beeping making beeps and it can't do that it had no power 
it wasn't plugged in as jonathan says every single one of us heard that phone go beep beep beep 
it made those electronic sounds you hear when you dial a push button phone and we all literally 
looked at the phone looked at each other and said did you hear 
that it made electronic sounds back at us that was part of the whole freak out
and there were still these weird flashes of pink light that were going on beneath the fog bank 
itself and it became more and more clear that the center object was actually a solid object 
because now they could see a shape behind it or within the light and it looked to all of them 
like it was rotating in place and uh jonathan at this point he was convinced that they were about 
to be taken on board a ufo and he told he turns to the group and says all right guys this is it 
if the chance comes are you guys prepared to board a spacecraft and he was only half joking but even 
so a number of the people in the group did not appreciate his comment and looked at him with fear 
but jonathan was you know half serious as well and he says pack your bags we're going and this 
is when a division started to appear within the group and someone shouted out are you crazy 
i am not going and maddie said no there's no way I'm not going anywhere 
and uh someone else said well what if this is all real what if this is really going on 
and they're aliens from another world and they want to put us in a zoo on some other planet 
and jonathan says I'm willing to take that gamble well at this point maddie was done 
she found herself consumed with fear she began crying and she turns to her husband and says I 
can't handle this anymore take me back to camp and jonathan looked at her in amazement and 
said are you out of your mind you're going to walk away from this while it's going on what are 
you thinking and she told him I'm too afraid I'm sorry I'm just too afraid 
and at this point the objects did seem to back off a little bit as maddie says they started 
backing off I think he jonathan will never forgive me for that but when it comes down to 
it self-preservation is the first thing I think I was so emotionally shaken by it all after a while 
i couldn't handle it and now looking back at it I don't know why I walked down the hill I said I 
was too cold and I had to go by the fire and I and my ex-husband and I think the photographer 
we actually walked down the hill and sat by the fire trying to warm up in retrospect I just 
couldn't believe that I actually walked away from it but it was definitely a lot to handle 
so as they were walking down to the campsite maddie's husband says he looked up and was shocked 
to see that the stars overhead were disappearing as if some very large object we're moving overhead 
and he became freaked out at this point and he didn't want to tell maddie because she was already 
crying and at this point he started to feel some real fear and he said that the ufo 
seemed to emit quote a dominating presence that I did not particularly enjoy so while he and maddie 
stayed by the fire oscar went back up to the top and got his wife and a couple of other people 
came down they were too upset and at this point it was probably near midnight 
and there were five people down by the campsite itself or and six people up on the plateau 
watching these three objects uh just hovering there and flashing beams of light and
suddenly something else strange happened suddenly without any warning these quote tiny glitterly 
glittery sparkling objects uh came out 
of the center object uh some of the people have been sitting down everyone jumped up at this point 
and watched these objects as they started to move around as john and jonathan says I described them 
as diamond-shaped mirrors that literally just fell out of this thing all three fell out at the 
same time but instead of falling and disappearing from view they arced and soared up into the air 
they were they appeared to be diamond-shaped they were very bright very sparkly 
and very brilliant and appeared to be rotating and moving around and everyone's screaming look look 
do you see it do you see this and this is when things just went crazy these three smaller objects 
swooped down and began to circle around the entire blackjack campsite and chaos reigned panic 
took hold and everyone completely freaked out one of the witnesses just screamed out what's 
happening what's happening what's happening over and over again and as jonathan says we became 
extremely animated and started racing around like lunatics because now it was much much closer to us 
those three lights were still off in the distance but whatever the three little other things were 
I have no idea but they were obviously much closer to us and were zipping around us in the sky
some of the people who were up on the top plateau ran down towards the campsite and meanwhile down 
by the campsite at the campfire maddie and her husband and the others looked down in complete 
shock as maddie says I remember watching it and watching it and not thinking anything and 
then I turned around and I was aghast there were two or three more surrounding us they were very 
very bright at this point I was more in shock than anything because I couldn't believe this was 
really happening here we said this will be great and they showed up 
at that time to be honest with you I went into awe and terror at the same time 
i couldn't believe what I was seeing and yet I said if I'm seeing with my eyes it's happening 
there were people running around kind of screaming everybody was going through their own thing
at this point everyone's just in a complete panic some are on the ground crying others are running 
towards the camp site uh others are trying to keep 
their eyes on these objects that they're splitting around and every now and then one of them would 
turn to jonathan and accuse him him again of having caused all this saying it's his fault that 
this happened and jonathan was just absolutely entrenched he thought these were very beautiful 
objects uh he felt no fear at any point and I was just utterly amazed and he says he got a good view 
at these objects as they came close he thinks that they were at least 20 feet long and looked kind of 
triangular shaped and were studded with these round gold white lights and every now and then 
they sent down what appeared to be beams of light down to the ground and 
everyone was just going insane running around like chickens with their heads cut off when things got 
even stranger suddenly there was a very very loud vibration noise and everyone's looking around 
trying to figure out where it's coming from and it got louder and louder until the ground itself 
seemed almost to shake and everyone's just cowering and looking up trying to figure out where could 
this vibration this huge roar be coming from so this thunderous 
vibration is just really intense as jonathan says that's when the vibrating started in a thunderous 
sound the ground actually started vibrating too you could hear this tremendous thrumming sound we 
couldn't see where the source was and jonathan starts shouting at the group and says 
all right this is it I guess this is the ultimate encounter get ready because here comes the mother 
ship and so everyone's just completely freaking out at this point and uh as jonathan says the 
sound and vibration were so intense that we were electrified by it looking everywhere to 
see the source of this sound we didn't have to look long because over the horizon of the 
island came these two u.s aircraft they were flying so low to the ground that we could read 
u-s-a-f on it it felt like we could reach up and touch them they were that close directly above us 
these were two jets and they were swooping towards the three hovering objects the instant these 
jets appeared the objects that were swirling around the campsite 
took off and disappeared and the three objects that were hovering in a row slowly sank down 
into the fog bank and disappeared and the jets moved off into the distance 
everyone stood there in complete shock and instantly the temperature raised back up to 
normal and it was a warm july evening again as jonathan says the atmosphere changed instantly 
and he turned everyone and said it's over he just knew intuitively that the encounter was over 
and everyone's like no no they'll come back they'll come back and uh 
no jonathan's like nope it's over can't you tell the energy was just completely different 
temperature was normal no one was shivering anymore and the group just stood there in shock 
for about 20 minutes uh and finally just left the plateau and walked back down to the campsite and 
everyone was still in a complete daze they were in the excitement of the sighting they realized 
they had completely forgotten to cook dinner they were planning to have a big chicken dinner but now 
it must have been around midnight they weren't sure their watches weren't working but they tried 
to cook up a quick dinner anyway no one really ate everyone had lost their appetite 
maddie had retired to her tent with her husband she was still weeping and really upset uh 
some people were wandering around singly or in groups trying to figure out what happened 
and finally they wandered off into their tent jonathan and two others stayed around 
the campfire and stayed up all night looking at the stars trying to process this amazing event 
so all of them were completely freaked out and there were more after effects 
the next morning all three of the ladies there there were eight men and three women all three 
women began their monthly menstrual cycles at the same time they thought that was weird and uh that 
evening on the day after the encounter they decided they were going to hike up to the peak to 
watch the sunset and as they were watching the sunset they looked down at 
their campsite and saw that there were people there rifling through it with uh flashlights 
and that concerned them and so they went down to their campsite and uh couldn't find anybody and 
were cooking dinner and uh turned out a lot of people just did not want to talk 
about what they had seen and they refused to talk about it they just 
wouldn't discuss it jonathan couldn't understand that he thought it was an incredible encounter but 
some people were just too upset and wanted to put it behind them and it was now two days the next 
day jonathan's like well you know we're leaving soon I want to go up and see the location of our 
sighting besides I think we left some stuff up there and so they go up there and we're shocked 
to see that there were some people up there and what looked like an elderly couple with white 
hair who were taking pictures of their belongings they thought that was kind of weird because they 
had not seen anyone else and had didn't know how they got there without you know getting by them 
and they wondered if perhaps they were something more than just innocent tourists but uh the couple 
moved off and jonathan and the others talked a little bit about the sighting gathered their stuff 
and uh returned to the campsite and back at the campsite they um jonathan got them all together 
and said they had to talk about it and everyone agreed that they would keep this secret that they 
would not discuss it publicly with anybody and uh would never tell anyone what happened 
this was to be their secret um several of them were working actors within the entertainment 
industry who were doing quite well and they didn't want to threaten their reputation as an actor and 
so they all kind of decided um on mass that this was going to be a secret 
and they started to notice other after effects in the days and weeks that followed as jonathan says 
we all felt in some way that we had been changed by the experience I don't think that anyone had any 
idea to what extent until time continued to pass 
it was jonathan and his friend uh shared an apartment and when they got home 
jonathan was packing his belongings and suddenly just broke into this fit of crying 
and he turned over to look at his friend and saw that his friend had collapsed and was also just 
weeping and so that was strange and there were other weird after effects
as jonathan says since then while trying to there were other weird after effects four day four days following the 
encounter jonathan wrote a little note about what was happening to him as he said as he wrote down 
actually since then since the encounter while trying to not let my imagination run wild I've 
experienced nausea sensitivity to light headaches stomach cramps and intense waves of emotion 
crying jags usually only a minute or so four or five times a day and a confusion with time
so people within the group started calling each other and noticing these same weird after effects 
it was as if everyone was traumatized by what happened 
uh some said that they couldn't stop crying when whenever they thought about the sighting and 
uh maddie noticed some very pronounced effects that she says and I quote 
i felt like I was walking four or five feet above the ground it was a weird feeling it 
was like my feet weren't touching the ground I was fearful that they would come land on the 
roof of my house or show up at the end of my bed I was very afraid of the government 
so they all started comparing notes and realized that they were having some really strange after 
effects from them finally one guy made a comment which sort of freaked everyone out 
uh he said that his bowel movements following the encounter had come out bright green 
and everyone else had noticed the same thing but didn't want to say anything 
so that was weird and after they noticed all these weird after effects uh jonathan called a meeting 
said we all need to get together and talk about this and talk about what happened so they all came 
over to jonathan's house and they had a meeting and they discussed the incident in detail and 
most of the group were pretty upset they wanted to put the whole encounter behind them but jonathan 
wanted to report it or at least get some more information if he could so he ended up calling 
the nearby griffith observatory in griffith park california and he asked them for information 
they had really no information to offer and referred him to the mutual ufo network mufam 
and mufan put them in touch with the very well-known southern california-based 
ufo researcher and uh jonathan shared his account uh with this researcher and uh it was 
but made her swear to keep it quiet and uh not let anyone know and not publicize this because 
of the agreement all the other witnesses had made the researcher agreed but it was a couple 
of weeks later jonathan was looking through the tv guide and saw that this there was an advertisement 
for dancing lights over catalina island ufos he called the researcher and she confirmed 
that it was about his encounter which really upset him because she had broken his trust 
and they ended up pulling the show it was not aired and the encounter remained a secret 
though jonathan and a few of the others did report this to mufon some of the others did not 
they refused to talk about it so everyone's lives ended up being dramatically altered by this event 
as jonathan says it changed each and every one of us in profound ways jonathan himself became 
obsessed with ufos he started buying all kinds of ufo memorabilia and gifts and mementos he started 
making ufo lamps which he constructed and gave to various members of the group and uh he personally 
uh he personalized his license plate to a ufo theme uh his email uh now expresses a ufo 
uh theme and he would watch conferences and watch any tv shows he could get on ufos 
he started to get really obsessed with it and realized this and start and started to step 
back because it was beginning to take over his life and he managed to keep it all on the level 
but at one point did decide he was going to seek out hypnotic regression and 
he met with a hypnotist and went under trance and recalled everything in detail 
um it was amazing he said how much detail he was able to recall entire conversations 
from that night but at one point during the regression he saw the campsite from above as if he 
was looking down on it and that kind of freaked him out and what had been a joyous experience 
for him while he started to feel a little bit of fear associated with it and he didn't want that 
so he ended the sessions and still thinks of this as probably just a sighting 
none of them have any direct evidence of missing time but do admit that the possibility does 
exist that this was a more extensive encounter than just a sighting 
definitely they do all agree that it affected them very deeply and in different ways 
maddie it caused a huge change in her life she quit her job in the entertainment field and she 
left her husband and she decided to pursue alternative healing and astrology and she 
became very good at it as she says it did blow open my psychic and spiritual doors it changed 
my life it set me on a whole different path there were other effects she noticed she used to suffer 
from eczema prior to the encounter following the encounter her eczema cleared up completely 
i went I talked to maddie and uh actually had a healing session with her 
and it was amazing as I was laying down on the table and she's doing her energy work I could see 
pastel lights coming from her hands and at first I thought it was my eyes I 
i really did but no I could see these sort of pink and green pastel lights flowing from her hands 
and sort of in the periphery of my vision and when I looked directly at it would disappear but I 
could definitely see it and I could feel the energy as she sort of pulsed it into the 
soles of my feet so yeah she's a very effective energy healer and I think that probably comes from 
this encounter and other people were affected very deeply maddie's ex-husband he also kind 
of freaked out after this encounter he found it very frightening and didn't want to discuss it 
but afterwards did become sort of obsessed with ufos like some of the other witnesses 
uh he would go around putting graffiti on buildings little images of ufos he started 
growing his hair long he attended ufo conferences he became more and more obsessed with the event 
and eventually wrote a 600 page sort of manifesto and just was never quite the same again oscar 
the guy who had been so skeptical that this was a ufo uh he ended up dying at a pretty 
young age he became a loner and ended up dying of a heart attack so that was kind of tragic another 
tragic event two years following the encounter one of the witnesses developed lymphatic cancer 
and he died within two years of this encounter and before he died he told jonathan that 
he believed that the ufo encounter might be involved with his illness might have caused it 
and he requested that his ashes be buried at the site of their ufo encounter 
so yeah they were all affected very deeply one witness said he went up there every year for 
decades afterwards to sort of memorialize this event that stopped their annual campsites at 
the uh blackjack campgrounds they never did another one together after that and they all 
started moving on to their separate ways one of the witnesses lisa again that's a pseudonym 
landed a very successful part in a movie and became a very well-known actress in the film 
industry another one of the witnesses uh dee she became a very famous sitcom actress and so they 
have never talked about this encounter and many of the witnesses have never talked about it uh
john jonathan has always been very forthcoming uh is he who is really responsible for 
getting this account recorded and uh he has been very supportive of my investigations of this 
encounter and put me in touch with maddie and at least one other witness as well so 
he uh it deserves credit definitely for getting this information out there and uh 
when the television show for the history channel called me and asked for a witness 
i thought of jonathan and eventually he did appear on the television show
ufo hunters uh and uh his encounter unfortunately ended up on the cutting room floor though they did 
do a sort of a webisode of his encounter but I was able to go up to the site of the encounter 
with jonathan and talk about it firsthand and he showed me exactly what happened 
it's a truly incredible event and really changed the lives of all the witnesses forever 
one of the other witnesses uh once called in during a radio show that I was doing with 
jonathan and so that was a real treat we got to hear from another witness and this 
he says uh he he verified everything jonathan had explained over the radio and said I remember 
how cold we got shivering I was more excited than frightened I was just a kid from nebraska what did 
i know and here was this happening it was like this can't be real this just doesn't happen in 
the real world but it does and I hope that I get to have that experience again someday in my life 
so this is something that affected all of them for the rest of their lives uh 
i wrote about this encounter in my book undersea ufo base an in-depth 
investigation into usos in the santa catalina channel and uh I presented this encounter in depth 
and along with the testimony of the other witnesses that I was able to contact 
it's a really incredible encounter involving physiological effects electromagnetic effects 
and can show just how profound an effect an encounter can have on a person emotionally 
it affects them for the rest of their lives and it's a very important counter it's one of 
many that have occurred in this area and that's really why I wanted to put together this video 
for you today I hope you've enjoyed it thanks once again for listening and keep having fun!
