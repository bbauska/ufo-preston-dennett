CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FOURTH KIND: FIVE TRUE CASES
Jan 26, 2024

Summary:
Jan 26, 2024
It represents the heart of the UFO phenomenon and is the most extensive and interesting of all encounters: close encounters of the fourth kind, cases of people who have been taken onboard a craft. Experiencers like these are far more common than most people realize. They occur all over the world, and can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Cases like these contain the most information about the many different types of extraterrestrials visiting our planet, and answer the many questions surrounding this subject. This video presents five little-known cases of close encounters of the fourth kind, each of which provides a tantalizing glimpse into the high strangeness of UFO contact.

“I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.” On the night of May 15, 1951, “John,” an army officer was walking to his home north of Salzburg, Austria when a strange man wearing a glass helmet approached him. John found himself paralyzed as the man strapped an odd device to John’s chest and floated him into a craft landed nearby. Suddenly, the craft zoomed upwards. John was shocked to watch the Earth recede into the distance. Moments later, a beautiful landscape appeared before him, filled with lush red fields, blue canals, and tall spires. The craft landed at a saucer-port, the being exited, and John saw many other craft around him, some with other humans inside. Moments later, the ET returned. They took off and John was returned to Earth. For decades he told no one. But growing older, he finally decided it was time to talk.

EXAMINED BY ROBOTS. In the early morning hours of Sep 29, 1974, bus-driver Antonio La Rubia was walking to his place of employment in Paciencia, Brazil and came upon a massive craft sitting in a field. Suddenly unable to move, he was dragged onboard the craft by two robotic figures. Onboard, he was surrounded by dozens of the strange beings, who placed him in a glass-like, bell-jar shaped container. They proceeded to show him a series of bizarre images, some involving apparent future events. They took a blood sample and then dropped him off two miles from the original location. Following the encounter, Antonio suffered fever, extreme thirst, loss of appetite, rash, swelling, body pain, nausea, diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. Later it was discovered that another person in the area saw a UFO on the same night.

“I DID NOT DARE TALK ABOUT IT.” At 1:30 am, on Jun 11, 1976, Helene Giuliana was driving home near Bourg-de-Peage, France when her car began to slow down by itself, the engine faltered, then the headlights went out and the car rolled to a stop. Helene was alarmed to see a brilliant glowing object landed on the road ahead. She locked her car-doors and covered her eyes. Suddenly the object was gone. She drove home, only to discover she had arrived two hours later than she should have. Later, she agreed to undergo hypnotic regression, and recalled being taken from her car by short dwarf-like beings who pulled her into the craft, put her on a steel table and examined her. She was returned to her car with no memory of the event.

WHAT WOULD YOU WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BEFORE YOU DIE? In Jun of 1976, Rick A. Hale’s life changed forever. He was 21 years old, and decided to mentally call out for UFO contact. A few days later, while driving along the I-90 Freeway near Indian John Hill, Washington that he pulled off the freeway onto a rural road and saw three strange beings in white suits and helmets. Even though he had been hoping for contact, he panicked and drove off. However, that night he realized he was missing two hours. Years later, under hypnosis, he recalled being taken onboard a craft where he encountered human-looking ETs, grays, and a wolf-like humanoid. He held a long conversation with them which changed the way he viewed everything.

THEY ARE REAL NICE. “Peter,” a 10-year-old from Georgia reports having contact with gray-like beings since age 4 or 5, starting in the mid-1980s. When onboard, Peter reports that he is almost always taken to a library where the ETs have a bunch of books about Earth, the environment and nature. On a few occasions, he’s given weird ET puzzle-games and the ETs watch while he tries to solve them. Peter’s onboard encounters usually last for an hour or two, but he is almost always returned only minutes after being taken. Peter says his contacts are benevolent and the ETs are very friendly, though his mother, who is also an experiencer, is frightened by her own encounters. Peter believes the ET agenda is all about trying to save the planet from destruction.

These five close encounters of the fourth kind provide a small cross-section of what appears to be hundreds of thousands if not millions of similar encounters taking place all over the world. These cases have both amazing similarities and puzzling, unique elements. But most importantly, they show that we are not alone in this universe, and that ETs show a great interest in the people of Earth and in the planet itself.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is called Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind and by that I mean of course
onboard UFO encounters these are my favorite of all UFO encounters they're
so fascinating they're the most extensive of all UFO encounters really they contain they
Encompass all the different types of UFO encounters that we have SIMPLE sightings
Landings face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials and when someone is taken on board there's virtually no
chance of misperception you're enveloped by the UFO phenomena you're right in the heart of it feeling it seeing it tasting
it hearing it the whole deal so yeah these cases really have a lot to
contribute to our understanding of what it's like to have ET contact and answer
many of the questions surrounding it like who are they and why are they here
so these five cases I've chosen for you today are pretty obscure cases I'd be
very surprised if you've heard of them before but they're also super
interesting uh these cases come from all over the world I have a case from Austria one from France one from Brazil
and two from the United States one from Washington and the other from Georgia
these involve a wide variety of ETS and also contains some very compelling
physical evidence so some very interesting cases to say the least and the first case I
want to talk about today took place quite some time ago I call this one I
thought I was dead and this is a firsthand case which took place way back
in May 15 1951 in salsburg
Austria this case was not officially investigated and it was Kept Secret by
the witness for many years he finally decided to come forward because it had
been weighing on his mind and he was afraid that he would pass away without anyone knowing what had happened to him
it's a really compelling encounter that was recalled fully consciously without
the aid of hypnosis and it's got some really in Elements which at the time were
certainly not well known but over the years have been verified over and over
again this case has never been officially investigated and it's not super welln but it's certainly
interesting and a very early account it first appeared in the Prince George Citizen newspaper and it involves an
anonymous gentleman an army officer who was interviewed by editor and reporter
Ron Powell so I'll just call him John and John told the editor of the Prince
George Citizen newspaper quote I have a story I would very much like to tell you
but I'm afraid you might think me completely crazy or else laugh at me and it was an amazing story he had to
share it was late on the evening of May 15 and John was about 5 miles north of
salsburg again in Austria and he was taking a twm long walk back to his place
of residence suddenly he was approached by a man wearing a helmet and John found
himself inexplicably paralyzed and he could only watch as the man strapped
this weird black square-shaped device to his chest and then started to walk away
and John found himself seemingly floating after the man he was led to a
round object about 150 ft in diameter which was landed in a field and he was
taken inside John found himself in this strange room with a transparent ceiling
at this point the paralysis released when this man stopped pointing a weird
little handheld device at John John sank to the floor and he first thought he had
been captured by spies but then the ship began to rise upwards and looking
through the transparent section he could see first only stars and then the moon
but soon began to see daylight and he now looked over and he could see this person who had captured him standing on
the other side of the room operating strange levers and as John says in his
own words he looked like a person like we are a little bit shorter than me he
had no hair at all I could see through the sort of glass helmet his head was
sort of a cylinder form a very high forehead with big eyes you could see
lots of little eyes in the two big eyes it seemed to me it looked like the eyes of a fly no nose at all just two holes
he had a very small slit for a mouth it looked like he had skin it was sort of
white there were two holes for ears his skull was very large he had no eyebrows
or any hair at all the Torso was round kind of like a tin can his hand seemed
to have three long fingers I couldn't see any neck but he was dressed in a
material that was like silver but it wasn't shiny this covered all of him except the head part which had on the
helmet he didn't look at me at all so this is clearly not an average
human now the room was also quite weird it kind of had glass-like walls but
looked opaque parts of it parts of it were transparent and as the sun Shone
down John could feel the heat and this strange man who had taken on board this
craft pulled a lever and a bluish tint protected both of them from the Sun and
John was really amazed at what was happening and he had a great difficulty
processing the whole experience as he says in his own words my first thought
was that I was dreaming then my second thought was that I was dead and my soul
was rising up so he watched in amazement as the craft approached the Moon close
enough that he could see the craters and rocks in great detail at this point the
craft stopped for just a moment it moved to the right at which point John could
now see the Earth far below him and the next thing he knew both the Moon and the
Earth were receding very quickly so it became clear to him he was in outer
space and moving off to another destination and as John says then I
began to think that this was from another planet and moments later John saw that
they were in fact approaching another planet in fact it came so fast he thought that they were going to crash on
it but instead the craft suddenly leveled out and they were skimming across the surface of this strange
Planet he had no idea where they were but as he says in his own words I looked
out over the land and it looked like a paradise on one side there were red fields on the other side there were what
looked like gray green fields some places in the fields were what looked like big chimneys rising from the ground
with bright daylight and the Sun was shining with no clouds in the sky we were approaching the red fields and I
could see rivers with blue water in them then we glided up to a field that was filled with the saucers like I was in
the there appeared to be hundreds of them so the craft he saw were different
colors gray gold and silver and the pilot of the he was on parked the craft
on this weird platform and quickly exited and looking around him John saw
others of the same type of beings that had taken him and he would looking out
at some of the other craft and he was really surprised to see normal humans inside them one craft had a woman with
two kids in it another held a man and a woman and looking around him at the
landscape he saw what looked like a herd of cows in the distance couldn't really
tell they were quite far away but on the ground he saw big red flowers below him
and he wondered you know could this be Mars he really had no idea he did see tall Bridges and also noticed that these
rivers or canals were basically straight so this was just a short moment
and suddenly the strange man returned to the craft and they took
off and very quickly they passed what looked like a small Silvery Moon which was totally smooth no craters and after
about 10 minutes John saw the Earth's Moon approaching Earth was in the distance and in a matter of seconds
Earth zoomed up so quickly that Jon once again feared a
collision but they didn't Collide and in fact they came down towards the ground very quickly John at this point was
filled with fear in fact he wondered if this ET was going to actually kill him
in order to keep this experience a secret but instead the man did nothing
like that all he did was point this weird pencil-like device at John who
again found himself unable to move and floating along back to where he had been
taken this point the man took off the weird plate-like device that he had placed on John returned back to the
craft which promptly took off needless to say this left JN quite amazed and
fearful he was about a quarter mile from home at this point he ran home excited
astonished and his wife immediately noticed that he was absolutely going crazy with
excitement and she asked him what happened and he told her nothing I'm
just sick and as John says I couldn't tell her about the experience because
she would have thought I was completely crazy I noticed the time when I got home and it was 12:20 a.m. the whole trip had
taken about an hour so John told nobody not even his wife for a long time simply because he
feared that nobody would believe him and he was also afraid that the ETS might come back if he talked about what
happened but as he became an older man and began suffering from ill health he
decided it was time to tell his story and as John says in his own words I'm
telling this now in order to help people to know what is going on in space my
heart is bothering me now and I feel I won't be living much longer so I have nothing to fear from those people from
this experience I have had I feel those people's culture and scientific knowledge is much ahead of
ours they seem to power their ships with Rays maybe light rays but it's not with
motors like ours my experience and seeing those other Earth people on that
planet show me that these people have a great knowledge of the people here and
are much ahead of us this creature treated me as only an
animal so he really wondered where he had gone was it Mars he didn't know but
the whole experience left him quite afraid it wasn't long after the experience that John and his wife moved
to Canada and years later as he says I have finally felt I want to make this
story public I have told you it just as I remember it happening and it is just
as clear as yesterday so again this case has not been widely reported and there are some
researchers who feel that it might be a hoax but of course none have been able to prove any any evidence of this the
reporter who interviewed John says he did his best to disprove the story and
catch the witness and contradictions but he was unable to do so and as he says I
tried to look for loopholes in his story and tried to catch him up on many of the smaller details he couldn't be
caught but what's interesting about Jon's case is that he describes details that we often see in today's modern
accounts so who knows knows you can make up your own mind about it while there are those who are skeptical of that case
I find it very compelling the witness clearly seems sincere and the
descriptions he gives of these short humanoids being paralyzed during the
encounter the description of the craft and so forth are all very reminiscent of
other encounters I wish we could talk to this witness today I suspect he's passed on
but it's certainly a compelling encounter that I wish was thoroughly investigated but you can make up your
own minds about it I do think it's worth knowing about and here is another case
of the five I'm presenting today this is probably the most well-known it has some really compelling
evidence to it in terms of physiological effects there is apparently an outside
witness as well and I call this case examined by robots
this took place on September 29 1974 in Pensa
Brazil this case caused quite a sensation when it became publicized the
witness initially wanted to keep it secret but was unable to do so because he needed to seek treatment following
the uh medical effects he had as a result of his encounter it's a really
interesting and very unusual case but also contains some elements we often do
see in onboard UFO Encounters this very unusual case was investigated in depth
by experienced researcher Irene granchi the witness in this case is
Antonio La ruia he's a bus driver and each morning he has to get up very early
for his job not on September 29
1974 he was up at around 2:15 a.m. and was walking across the field near near
his home when he saw a strange craft landed in the field he thought for just
a second it might be a company bus but it clearly couldn't be because this was out in the middle of a field and it
looked quite different and as Antonio says there in the middle of it stood
this huge thing so large it went beyond the boundaries of the football field
which is more than 70 M across I had not believed in flying saucers but this was
one no doubt was shaped like a hat a dull leaden color it looked like an
enormous hat so Antonio at this point became afraid and he was about to turn and run
but then a blue light lit up everything around him and he found himself unable
to move as he says I only took two steps back for then I was nailed to the ground
and saw two little men grabbing me I cannot recall how I entered the disc but
suddenly there I was floating between two rows of a dozen Little Men on each
side they were small but had large shoulders their heads were like those
American footballs there was total silence so these beings were very
unusual looking they were not very tall about 5 1/2 ft tall very close to his
height he said they looked almost robotic with metallic oval-shaped heads
shaped like a football but set on end and on the top where there was what looked like a kind of antenna and where
the eyes would be there was instead a row of small blue pulsating
lights these beings had two long arms with no apparent hands that he could see
on the end they reminded him a little bit of an elephant's trunk and for legs
they had what looked like a sort of pedestal he said the surface of their body was rough and scaly and the color
of aluminum so they looked very much like robots but he was confused because
he could hear what sounded like breathing and they seemed to move freely not in a robotic
way but there were a lot of them now the first thing he did see when he entered this craft was a long white Corridor he
was immediately taken into a Sur circular room which was brilliantly lit with blue and white light and it was
then that he noticed the walls were transparent and he could actually see outside which was amazing to him because
looking at the craft he couldn't see inside it from the outside but from the inside looking out he could see
everything but mostly his attention was occupied by these strange beings and
there were so many of them as Antonio says there were only those Str strange
little men around about 50 of them I felt as if I were in a crystal Bell jar
and felt that they were communicating among themselves as their heads turned around when they were saying something
they kept still and watched me with fiery eyes so he's saying that he found
himself in this little sort of transparent container he was able to move his body but couldn't get out of
this sort of glass-like bell jar type container and the beings were all around
them and he got a good look at them you could see that they each had belts or what looked like belts around their
waist with little kind of syringe likee devices hanging from them they weren't
syringes it was something else he saw a weird sort of piano like instrument in
the room but otherwise it was completely empty and as he watched these beings
began to take these little devices hanging from their waist and put them
into the piano like instrument and it was then that this screen appeared on
the wall which drew his attention and it began to flash various
images and it seemed like each time one of these beings placed one of these devices from their waist onto this
machine it caused a different image to appear and as Antonio says they showed
me a horse drawing a cart a dog barking and a sudden flash that killed the animal on the screen I was also shown a
countryman in a straw hat I do not know what all that meant but I was all the
more surprised when I watched myself on that screen I was naked and they were studying me so these images continued to
flash they showed all kinds of images one of one of these beings themselves
being killed they showed him being examined by human looking doctors
something which later actually happened they showed him all kinds of things
um a few which he at first refused to describe but later he was interviewed
and he said to the best of his memory he was shown about 10 or 15
images and he tried to put them in order but he said this was difficult because all of this happened quite quickly and
he was of course very much surprised by what was happening to him but he says
the first thing he believes he saw on this screen was himself undressed in
being examined by these ETS with blue lights he saw himself standing alone
still with no clothes on the third image he saw himself dressed up to go shopping
actually carrying a shopping bag and look looking nervous uh and the fourth image was a
peasant with ragged clothes in a straw hat with a horse drawn heartart on a
dirt road so so then the next one after that or joined to this one he shown
himself being examined by doctors saw himself vomiting soiling his pants now
this later happened and he felt like this was kind of a warning or sort of a
message that this would be happening to him he saw himself standing next to a
bright orange globe of light next he saw one of the beings standing next to a
bright blue globe of light so these were all very strange images a lot of which
didn't make sense to him he next saw one of the beings
standing next to a barking dog which was trying to bite him and this being began to melt another being appeared pointed a
device at the dog which caused it to melt this is what he remembered next he saw something quite
strange what looked like a ET Factor iory showing rows of disk-shaped craft
being built these craft were at all stages of construction with countless of
these same beings around them hard at work next he saw a metallic train with
no windows entering a tunnel and this was followed by an image of one of the beings taking a blood sample now he's a
little confused here because he says this did actually happen uh his arm lifted up by itself
and one of the ETS took a blood sample so some of these were images of things that were actually happening to him or
did later happen but next he saw a street filled with cars really crowded
so that none of the cars were moving so there also felt like a warning of some
kind but yeah he said they took a blood sample they showed him images of this
blood sample which showed three circles with lines through each one so it took a lot of strength for him
to talk and finally he shouted out to them who are you what do you want from
me he's shouting at the top of his Bo voice and as if in response to his shout
the beings all lifted their arms up to the tip of their antenna which seemed to be rotating and fell to the floor just
tumbled to the floor in fact Antonio had the impression that it was his loud shout which caused this but immediately
after this as again in response Antonio found himself struck by a beam of Light
which rendered him unable to move and he could actually feel the heat coming from this light so this beam of light slowly
began to dim and Antonio started to feel himself losing Consciousness and the next thing he
knows he says they almost kind of tossed him out of the craft but he found himself on the road in a different
location next to the bus station where he worked this was more than 2 miles away from where he he had been taken at
this point the craft and the beings were gone it was now 2:55 a.m. which meant
that the entire experience had lasted about 40 minutes so he rushed to the bus station
which was very close and his co-workers could see that he was sweating uh very
very hot so they kind of hosed him down and rushed him to the hospital Antonio
didn't want to go but he really needed to and when he got to the hospital his temperature was about
107° the doctors could not believe that he was alive his temperature quickly
went down but this fever kept returning his temperature began to fluctuate up
and down uncontrollably for a little while and over the next few days he suffered some pretty alarming symptoms
including nausea and diarrhea body aches headaches and itchy rash over much of
his body hematomas and swelling at the joints shortness of breath extreme
thirst loss of appetite and of course emotional distress weirdly the doctors did not
test him for radiation they did give him a psychological test when he started talking about his encounters which he
passed showing himself to be an intelligent well balanced individual
though clearly traumatized by his encounter his medical symptoms persisted
for a couple of weeks even a month later he says he felt strangely
dissociated he had never planned on telling anyone what happened but it was because of his symptoms that he
basically had to tell the doctors the truth and that was when his encounter became pretty well
known so again he was interviewed by Irene GR Chief and later it was
discovered that there was another Witness by the name of celo who was walking in the area around 2 a.m. on the
evening Antonio was taken CSO heard a loud humming noise and saw a classic
Flying Saucer described much like Antonio did this was near Monte Carlos
Street and pra Ponto Sheik Chic which is very near where this encounter
happened so this case did get a lot of publicity and with the medical evidence
it's a pretty well verified case and has certainly never been proven to be a hoax
as can be seen the medical effects in that case leave little doubt that something really profound happened to
the witness it's very hard to fake something like that certainly those who
know the witness vouch for his sincerity his credibility uh it's an alarming case
given that his symptoms were quite severe it's also very interesting all the messages he was given the ETS he
describes are unlike any I really remember hearing about anywhere so that
in itself I think makes the case very important it's a very unusual case
they're all unusual seems that these variety of ETS is just
endless and now we move to the next case and this one I call I did not dare talk
about it this case occurred in bourge de
France it occurred on June 11 1976 this was pretty early on in terms
of onboard experiences it wasn't super well known at the time this case was
recalled through the use of regressive hypnosis Al the witness did have
absolute conscious call of her UFO and Connor which involved missing time
there's a lot of controversy surrounding hypnosis but the details that she
recalls match up very well with other cases involving fully conscious
recall so I think it's a legitimate case it didn't get a whole lot of attention
certainly not in the United States it was a brief sensation in France when it had occurred but it's a very compelling
case this case got a lot of attention in the French press the main witness is
Helen Juliana age 20 it was around 1:30 a.m. on June 11
1976 when helain had just visited the movies in valent and she was driving
home along the 531 National Road this is now been renamed the 532 Road but she
was driving over the martinet bridge just after Pang Kong this is near
shange when her car mysteriously began to slow down she at first wondered if
she had run out of gas but quickly looking at the gas gauge she saw that
there was still plenty of fuel but her engine continued to give her trouble when suddenly the headlights went out as
did the entire electrical system this point the engine stalled and she rolled
to a stop and she was frantically trying to restart the car when she saw
something in front of her something amazing it was a bright bright light blocking the road and it seemed to be
sitting on the road itself as helain says in her own words it is then that I
saw at about 15 m in front of my car a luminous mass of orange color I was very
afraid and I locked the doors of my immobilized car and put my hands in front of my eyes at the end of a moment
withdrawing my hands from my eyes I noted that the Luminous Mass had
disappeared so helain isn't sure how long she was looking at this light it
seemed only moments but there was a weird sort of timelessness to all of this she does remember locking the car
doors shielding her eyes from the light and then the light was just
gone at this point as helain says I actuated the starter and the car started
up without problems I returned at home so upset that I missed the most direct
Road and made a too long trip by bom delone which is not my usual Road when I
arrived at home it was 4: in the morning so her sister was at home and it
was she who pointed out the time to hen Helen was absolutely shocked because
this trip took took her about 2 hours longer than it should have weirdly the
road she was on the 531 road is a pretty busy highway even at night so it made no
sense that she could have been 2 hours late and Helen didn't want to talk about
the encounter as she says I did not dare talk about it I was afraid of being
ridiculed but she did and before long Helen's case received considerable
attention and was published in several newspapers and this was when she was
contacted by researchers who asked her if she would go under hypnosis which she
agreed to do and it was professional hypnotist Andre rayol who put her under
a trance and led her back to the incident and this was done in the presence of
reporters under hypnosis elain did recall her car failing coming to A a
stop and then seeing this dazzling light blocking the road in front of her the
next thing she recalled was two small beings
approaching this she had not remembered before she saw these two small beings approach they took her out of her car
and she says that they were very short so short that the top of their heads came up to her chest she said they were
dressed in a black onepiece jumpsuit with a kind of hood and she described
them as quote very ugly dwarves she said that they had large round dark eyes a
sort of flattened nose a very small mouth which never opened she didn't
notice any ears or hair but she says they placed kind of a quote towel on her
face and they started to carry her towards this lighted object standing in the
road and next thing she knows she's ins inside a room a small room with a
rounded ceiling she saw what looked like strange buttons on the wall white red
and yellow lights everything in the room seemed to be made of metal she was
placed on a metal table where she was restrained and one of these dwarf-like
beings she says held a flashlight like object in his hands and proceeded to
shine it down on her upper torso in kind of a weird ser series of circles she
felt like this was some sort of examination which seemed to be brief but she couldn't really be
sure she said that they spoke at her with gestures and seemed to become
frustrated with her uh inability to understand as she says they were trying
to make me understand something what it was she doesn't know but the next thing
she knew she was being led back to her car with which quote reappeared in front
of her as if it were invisible before so she was placed inside her car
the small figures walked back to the light which rose quickly in the sky and was
gone now when helain was brought out of hypnosis she still had no memory of the
missing time or what she had actually said under trance so they played the
tape for her they recorded it and he hearing all these details this really
surprised her because she had no memory of this and in fact she had some difficulty believing what she had
recalled under hypnosis however the conscious part is
absolutely uh something she says did happen and those who know her say that
she's a very honest and sincere person and is absolutely telling the truth her
family backs her up at that time Helen was employed by the mayor of the nearby
town of hoston and he also vouched for honesty and integrity I can only imagine what it
must be like for the witness to go through something like that and to me the fact that she is somewhat skeptical
of what she recalled under hypnosis just brings a new level of credibility to the
case because she's certainly not seeking fame or fortune or anything like this
like most Witnesses she did not want to talk about it and she didn't initially for some time it's a a truly incredible
case and here is another one which I'm again pretty sure you haven't heard of
before this one is a very unusual case involving different types of humanoids
it was recalled fully consciously as well uh for at least initially uh he did
go under hypnosis and recalled additional details but absolutely an
astonishing case I call this one what would you want more than anything in the
world before you die so this is a direct quote from the case itself as we shall
see it occurred in June of 1976 in Indian John Hill
Washington it's an excellent case of be careful what you ask for because this
involves a gentleman who asked for an encounter and he received it and boy did
he ever receive it and it had a profound effect on the rest of his life the main
witness in this case is Rick a hail and he was only 21 years old when his life
changed forever and his encounters started in a very interesting way because this was
something he actually asked for he was trying to make contact one evening in
June 1976 he was out camping in the Forks Washington area when on a lark he began
wondering about ESP and if quote alien beings might be able to pick up on his
thoughts so he's not sure why he did this but he started reaching out to
extraterrestrials as Rick says in his own words so I decided I would try to
contact a UFO by dirting my thoughts to space and try to convince or entice a
UFO to land and let me come aboard and I would drive around going to
different places where I thought they would like me to wait for their craft I realized this would sound kind of crazy
to most people but at the time it seemed quite logical to me so he was doing all of this sort of
what we call C5 work it was only a few days later that that one evening in
still June of 1976 he was driving along the I90 he took the tanum Creek exit and
spontaneously started heading down this little road towards Eagle Valley this
road passed over the I90 and he it veered to the right and
this is when he saw them three strange beings as Rick says they appeared to be
about 6 ft tall dressed in white suits and white helmets with dark visors the
beings seemed to be about 10 to 20 yards away walking slowly in a grassy field
towards the road I was on so he instantly knew what was happening he
instantly concluded that these were in fact ETS and that his efforts to make
contact had succeeded but instead of being happy about it he says a visceral fear swept
wept over him and he literally began to panic as he says the feeling of being
alone with these beings was too much for me to handle I wanted to get back to
civilization as soon as possible but unfortunately the road was
very narrow so he had no choice but to drive towards these beings who were
walking towards the road so he sort of drove down the road drove past the beings who were still walking quite
slowly so he felt he would definitely have time to turn around he drove about
a quarter mile ahead on the road pulled a quick three-point U-turn and headed
back and as Rick says that quarter of a mile drive back was the longest drive of
my life so having turned around he could still see these beings walking towards
the road and as he drove by them he saw a strange beam of light in the sky
heading in his Direction but by this point he saw the highway up ahead of him with traffic on
it and he says he very quickly reached it went straight to a Holiday Inn in
Ellensburg which was just off the I90 freeway but as he checked in he was
shocked to discover that it was now 2 a.m. he was missing about an hour and a
half of time at the time he didn't think much of it he hadn't really heard of missing time but afterwards he began to
feel a lot of trauma he felt great that he had actually made
contact but when he started telling people about it they didn't believe him
and he didn't know how to handle all of this he became very depressed he turned to drugs he suffered a lot of mental
anguish had a near mental breakdown even to the point of thinking he was The Reincarnation of Jesus this is what he
said he was also having dreams of meeting ETS and being in contact with them
eventually he did he did recover he went on with his life he found work he
married he had children but then 12 years later after hearing about other
people's UFO encounters and missing time he contacted eileene garut Edwards of
the UFO contact center UFO CCI who agreed to put him under
hypnosis now this did take several sessions because each time he began to remember this encounter he would begin
to cry uncontrollably but finally he did remember what happened he says that
instead of driving by the ETS after turning around uh he thought he had gone on to
the freeway without any Interruption but that's not what happened his car actually stalled these ETS approached
his car he he got out of the car and was desperately trying to control his fear
and he found himself saying saying and acting in ways that really surprised him
he says to control his fear he found himself telling them I might be The Reincarnation of Christ he doesn't know
why he said that but that's what he said at this point he was too afraid to even look at these beings and one of the ETS
spoke to him in a deep male voice and said okay follow me and he found himself
following them dutifully into a field Where They Came Upon a small
craft and as he was led inside this small craft the ET said something very strange it said if you were Christ you
would be more afraid than you are now so at this point Rick was still too
scared to look around he kept his eyes down as he walked into the craft but
very quickly this smaller craft took off and went immediately to a larger craft
not far away still on the ground uh this larger craft was ol of
green he says with a sort of oblong triangular shape the smaller craft had
landed Rick got out and walked up to this larger craft up a small ramp which
he said kind of had the texture of dark polished marble once inside the larger craft he
says it was cold inside had kind of a musty smell now he saw a young teenage
woman uh they hugged and she told him that the doctor was waiting in the other room to give him an
examination and he went into this other room or found himself in it it was a circular room next to a curved hallway
he could now see a row of tinted windows that went around the room and in the
center of the room was a five foot long sort of translucent Blue Table supported
by a single pedestal now he's looking out through the windows and he could see three 4ft
tall bald figures wearing white overcoats he says they look like typical
Grays but were too far away to make out much detail but the next thing he knew
he's recalling this under hypnosis he was lying on the table undressed with a
sort of blanket over him and a human male Stood Beside him wearing a doctor's
uniform and this man introduced himself as
Carl according to the witness this man Carl had short black hair and a
beard but also he saw another figure standing at the foot of the table Rick
says it was a sort of hairy creature that looked like a dog man complete with teeth and Claws and it was this doglike
creature Who removed the the blanket and began to examine Rick and as Rick says
in his own words I believe it was examining a skin condition kind of a
rash that I had developed when I was about 13 years old the wolbe grabbed my
knees and I became very scared of it then I Heard a Voice say don't be scared
he won't hurt you that calmed me down and the Wolf beinging finished his
examination of my body and left then a voice told me it was okay to get up and
get dressed the next thing Rick knew he was in another room talking to a human
looking male who asked him what would you want more than anything else in the
world before you die and I'll just let Rick describe what
happened next because it's quite interesting as Rick says this question kind of stunned me because I felt this
person may have the power to grant me my reply plus the thought of maybe he was
going to kill me also entered my mind my mind started to race with thoughts like
millions of dollars a wife and kids live forever become the president of the
USA then a thought of Christ dying on the cross came to me and I looked up at
the leader and said peace on Earth at this point the leader smiled
but didn't reply and instead Rick found himself being led to another room which was kind
of a sunken room with pillars all around the perimeter and this was quite a few feet
down and someone next to Rick asked him would you be able to get down to the
floor and Rick said sure and he dutifully hopped down into the sunken room and this is where he saw another
examination table and although he was fearful he decided it was best to
cooperate and decided to just lay down and submit to what they he thought they wanted which was another possible
exam and at this point he saw bright flashing lights he heard his humming
sound he could feel the table vibrating he became frightened again closed his
eyes and opening them he saw some strange instruments around him so
apparently he was being examined again this went on for about a minute when suddenly everything became still the
sound stopped Rick opened his eyes and saw that he was now alone he hopped off
the table he saw a staircase leading upward so he went up the stairs and this
was when he saw a blond-haired human male who told Rick that it was time for
him to go for a ride and the next thing Rick knew he was flying through the air
watching The Craft recede behind him and realized he was heading back towards his
car as this is going on he starts chanting to himself I won't forget I
won't forget I won't forget next thing he knows he's being placed in his car he
feels his head going down and resting on the steering wheel and he kind of fell
asleep and when he woke up he had completely forgotten the entire
experience so this is what he we called under hypnosis Rick does remain a bit
ambivalent about the hypnotic recall but he does say that some of it did match
the dreams he was having following his encounter I think you'll agree that's an
absolutely astonishing case one with an enormous amount of detail to it I loved
that the witness was able to provide drawings of some of what he experienced because that definitely helps bring the
case to life and it's just so unusual how the ETS communicated with him
um all of it is unusual particularly the types of ETS he saw and now we move to the last case of
this little collection I call this one they are real nice and this I don't have
the exact date of this it was probably late 1980s early
1990s and the location is not listed precisely either but apparently is
somewhere in the state of Georgia this one is a really profound
case this one is fully consciously recalled and the main witness is a very
young boy who's been having regular contacts with ETS and what happens to
him when he's taken on board is so interesting the details he describes I
have heard before but he describes them in real amazing detail and he also
describes some really kind of interesting and unusual incidents that occurred to him while he interacted with
these ETS who appear to be the typical Grays this last case is probably my
favorite of this little collection because it's so interesting it comes from researcher C Lee Culver and it
involves a 10-year-old boy who is given the pseudonym Peter and although the
exact date and location of this case is unknown Peter's case is of particular
interest because of the experiences he described now Peter says that around age four or
five he started to be contacted by ETS who he describes as having very large
heads yellowish eyes no visible ears and a very small mouth he said that they
have dark almost bluish skin very short neck long arms and he says that they are
quote skinny and bony about the ribs at the hips you can see where the bones
connect he says quote the aliens kind of look like
lizards say that they all look identical to each other except one is a little bit
taller than the others and as Peter says he's the one that tells me where to go
he's a leader or something uh Peter said that he doesn't think that they wear clothes uh he says
that they are both male and female uh but you can't really tell by looking at them as he says you couldn't
tell by looking at them you just know he said that they communicated with
strange sounds that he can't understand but as he says they talk weird but they
are real nice friendly and curious they usually tap my shoulder and point to
something or somewhere I just know what they want me to do so perhaps he's
getting telepathic communication here though he didn't say that specifically now Peter's experiences are
fully conscious he says they usually occur about once a month he's usually
taken from inside his home though sometimes he has been outside and he knows to go inside so that the ETS can
pick him up he just gets a feeling and on most occasions the purpose of these
onboard experiences is to be taken to what he calls quote the
library and as Peter says in his own words it's oval-shaped with books every
where with a bench in the middle he says this Library room is blue
gray in color and as he says there is always enough light to see but you can't
tell where the light is coming from he says there's a shelf on one side
of the room with books on it all written apparently in English but on the other
side of the room is a shelf filled with books which are apparently written in different languages now he's not sure
what languages as he doesn't go to that side of the room instead he's told by
the ETS to read the English books which he says are all non-fiction and all
about quote the Earth our planet nature and
people and when asked by C Le Culver the researcher if he could recall any of the
titles of these books Peter said yes he says one of the books is called earth
and its environment another is called Mars does it have any plants and a third
was called Earth the living something he doesn't remember but all of these books
according to Peter are about nature the ozone layer the environment these kinds of subjects and he says the ETS bring
him there just to read the books while they watch and observe him now he does say that this room had
two other doorways to what appeared to be other rooms he called one quote the
yellow room and the other quote the white room because he says whenever the ETS went in there these other rooms are
lit with either a yellow light or a white light he has no idea what's in those other rooms as he has never been
taken in there and while these onboard experiences are usually all about
reading books he says sometimes he's taken into this same room not to read books but to play with different types
of weird ET toys or instruments one he specifically
remembers it reminds him sort of of a Rubik's Cube except it is round in shape
it's sort of a puzzle with different shapes and colors that has to be put together in a certain way and as Peter
says they would sit and watch me like they're trying to figure out if you're smart enough to do
this so Peter's story which was reported in an article for UFO encounters
magazine has some other interesting aspects to it because as Peter says when he is taken
the ETS scoop him up and he spends an hour or two or maybe more on some occasions with the ETS and then they
return him home but he finds that no time has passed so several times he said he was
outside playing when he felt the ETS calling him he went inside they scooped
him up he stayed there for as long as the experience took and then would be returned so while hours passed for him
almost no time passed here on Earth and as Peter says my friends would think I
had gone inside to get a drink of water or gone to the bathroom so he wasn't really talking
about this to anybody but Peter does recall one kind of interesting and somewhat amusing
instant uh he and his friends from next door we having a water gun fight a
squirt gun fight and suddenly Peter saw this strange light flashing he
recognized it knew it was the ETS calling him and the next thing he knew
he was on board but he still had a squirt gun in his pocket and being a
mischievous little kid he quickly pulled it out and as he says squirted the tall
one he screeched and started shaking and then he ran back to the yellow room they
started talking again and then they came out and they started saying stuff and told me to sit down now Peter could see
that they were upset that he had pulled out the squirt gun and squirted him and he tried to explain that he was just
playing and there that there was nothing in the squirt gun but water but the next thing he knew he was being returned back
home and this is one of very few times that he wasn't returned to the same time
it was considerably later Peter remembers this vividly because he was pretty unhappy that he couldn't go back
outside and continue playing squirt guns with his friends it was much later now Peter is not alone with his
experiences his mother also has experiences she never talked to Peter
about it but he did seem to know on his own because once after she was returned
from an onboard encounter Peter came into her room to console her and make sure that she was okay as it turns out
his mother doesn't really like her experiences she feels that the ETS are
using her as quote a baby Factory now when Peter asked why the ETS
are here and what their purpose is Peter had a very interesting answer for the
investigator as he says I don't know what their purpose is except they only
think the only thing I can think of is to maybe save the Earth and other
planets from the harmful things that are happening happening to them because they have these books about the environment
and the bad things that are happening now the investigator C Le
Culver he says that he has many other cases where people are given quote alien
ecology lessons and he also has other cases where children are shown books that show
extinct animals on Earth or animals that have become extinct on other
worlds we really like that case it's not often that you get to hear from very young children while they're still
having their experiences and as that case shows he's certainly not alone with
them given that these encounters are also happening to his mother and that is
actually more the rule than the exception it's a really remarkable case
with a lot I think to teach us about UFO contact so those are the five cases I
wanted to present to you today I think you agree they're all very unusual and have some very interesting things to say
about what it's like to have contact the type of ETS people see they're the ET
agenda on our planet um given that these people are often being physically
examined and that sort of thing and it's just darn interesting to me the onboard
experiences again are the most interesting of all UFO cases and again
they have the most to tell tell us about ETS themselves so that's it for today I
really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it I hope perhaps you
learned a little bit and were at the very least entertained and until next time keep
asking those difficult questions keep searching for the truth because it's out
there most important of all keep having fun till next time I will see you later.
