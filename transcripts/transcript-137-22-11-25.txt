BIGFOOT IN CALIFORNIA

Summary:
Nov 25, 2022
Bigfoot is real! While mainstream science has refused to accept the existence of the hair hominin, reports of the creature are now in the tens of thousands or more. Cases reach back hundreds of years and continue to the present day. While Bigfoot is reported all over the planet, the leading producer of cases is the state of California.

Native Americans have oral traditions about Sasquatch reaching back many hundreds of years. But it wasn’t until the mid-1850s that written reports began to be recorded. Initially reports came from prospectors, miners, hunters, and others. But as the population of California began to grow, so did the number of Bigfoot encounters.

While reports were coming in for more than 100 years, it wasn’t until a series of events occurred in 1967 in the small then unknown town of Bluff Creek in northern California that interest in the creature exploded. For the first time, the term “Bigfoot” came into use, and for the first time people began to scientifically study the creature.

While some people still remain skeptical of the creature’s existence, those who study the evidence usually come to the conclusion that Bigfoot is real. Even the famous anthropologist Jane Goodall has stated her belief that Bigfoot is real. The evidence comes in many forms including eyewitness testimony, footprints, handprints, hair samples, fecal and urine samples, animal reaction cases, sound recordings, Bigfoot nests, and of course, photographs and films.

California has produced cases involving the entire range of Bigfoot cases, both friendly and hostile. Perhaps the most common type of encounter is seeing a Bigfoot cross the road in front of a vehicle while traveling late at night along a remote highway. But many other reports exist of face-to-face Bigfoot encounters, Bigfoot chases, hunters shooting at Bigfoot, Bigfoot confronting hikers, campers, fisherman and more. Some people report being viciously attacked by Bigfoot, even including kidnappings. But some also report remarkably friendly encounters. A few testify that Bigfoot has even saved their life. Even stranger are accounts in which Bigfoot and UFOs are seen at the same time.

California has all these kinds of cases and more. People come from all over the world to visit such hotspots as Willow Creek, Bluff Creek and more. But what many people don’t know is that Bigfoot is seen all across the state, from the Sequoia and Redwood forests in the north, to the fertile central valley in the middle, the high deserts of Acton, Lancaster and Palmdale, the massive Angeles National Forest area, all the way south to the remote mountains surrounding San Diego. There is virtually no place in California that hasn’t produced solid Bigfoot reports.

This video presents more than 100 cases of Bigfoot in California. And while these are enough reports to gain a full understanding of Bigfoot behaviors and habitats, the truth is that this is only the tip of the iceberg. The number of reports in California alone is in the several thousands. And most people never even report their Bigfoot encounters. So any estimate of the number of the cases is probably far lower than the actual number. What we know about is just the tip of the iceberg.

The cases presented here show that California is very active with the mysterious creature known as Bigfoot and Sasquatch.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I've got something different for you today today I'd like to talk about cryptozoology more specifically Bigfoot Bigfoot goes by many different names Bigfoot Sasquatch Wildman 
Yeti I mean you name it there's different names for every culture across our planet 
today I'd like to talk about specifically Bigfoot in California and that's the title 
of today's episode Bigfoot in California I've collected well over a few hundred cases but 
I'm going to pick out just the best ones that I think are the most credible the ones that have 
something interesting to say about the nature of Bigfoot the ones that are unusual in some way 
and I can tell you that the evidence for bigfoot is outstanding it's not just eyewitness 
testimonies though there are a lot of that there is physical evidence there are many many cases 
involving Bigfoot tracks Footprints many cases involving hair samples many cases involving 
dunk samples and urine samples and blood samples many cases involving animal reactions cases in 
which Bigfoot has been recorded in terms of sound recordings also of course films and photographs 
so the evidence is really quite conclusive I think there are many theories as to what 
this is and we'll get into that in a bit I am absolutely convinced it's real because I did 
have my own encounter which I would like to talk about at some point during this episode 
but these cases stretch back hundreds of years Bigfoot has appeared all over California from the 
Redwoods and the Sequoias in the northern part of the state down to the Central Valley all the way 
to the deserts of Palmdale and Acton and Lancaster and Mojave down to as far south as San Diego 
so California is actually one of the leading producers of Bigfoot in fact 
according to researchers California probably does have the highest population of Bigfoot of 
all the other states and in fact Lauren Coleman writes and I quote it has been 
estimated that the population of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest is between two thousand and 
four thousand individuals with the greatest concentration around Bluff Creek California 
but again these cases come from all across the state I've got about a hundred that I'd like 
to share with you today 100 of what I think are the best cases so let's just get started 
as it turns out some of the earliest records of Bigfoot's existence come from California 
Native Americans in the state have long reported the creature and have given it many names 
they have a long oral tradition talking about Bigfoot but starting in the 1850s 
gold prospectors and miners reported sightings in such areas as Antioch Round Valley and San Joaquin 
one early report was made by a gold prospector in the Mount Shasta area who claimed that a Bigfoot 
smashed his slew sway against a tree it was around this time that a series of alleged murders outside 
the Southern California City of San Marcos were actually blamed on Bigfoot the actual location 
was a remote Valley called Deadman's hole and in 1858 an unidentified man was found beaten to death 
in this area and in 1870 a French man said that he was attacked in his cabin by a tall hairy creature 
in 1888 two more badly crushed bodies were discovered in this area and on that same 
year two Hunters Came Upon a cave filled with human bones and they said that as they were 
examining these bones they were attacked by a tall Hairy man-like Ape creature with a human 
looking face they shouted the creature and then ran away in a panic and there were two 
additional unexplained deaths which occurred as late as 1922 and later more Hunters again 
claimed that they confronted a hostile Bigfoot which ran away when they opened fire on it 
now these cases are quite controversial as far as I can tell there are no other cases like 
this so I am not sure how much Credence to put towards them since then no further deaths have 
been reported and I just not sure that we should be worried about Bigfoot you know doing this kind 
of behavior so those cases remain unique in the literature but I mentioned them for what they're 
worth but meanwhile the early sightings in the mid to late 1980s began to grow quickly in number 
in the Autumn of 1869 a hunter was hunting along orestimba Creek when he saw a Bigfoot 
approach his campfire grabbed some of the burning sticks and start swinging them around 
and it was the next year 1870 when numerous residents of the Mount Diablo area reported a quote wild man in the area which left 13 inch tracks 
one really dramatic encounter occurred in 1882 in the Owens Valley this is more Central California 
several people had reported seeing a large hairy bipedal creature in the area and several men 
decided to go hunting for it and Incredibly they found the creature lying down asleep 
in a field and attempted to capture it one of the gentlemen his name was John Clark and he 
reports that he tried to lasso the creature but it woke up and ran away screaming his associate 
Paul Merton green fainted unconscious when the creature turned and charged him 
Hunter John Farrell followed the creature and a few days later Came Upon it while it was beating 
he says he fired five bullets into this creature but the shots seemed to have no effect uh at this 
point it charged him causing his horse to panic and Gallop away the horse ended up breaking 
both its front legs Farrell himself was badly bruised and not surprisingly the Bigfoot got away 
so there were scattered accounts occurring throughout the Northern California area at this time but few people seemed to really believe or pay attention to these accounts 
the local Native Americans however were well aware of Bigfoot and began to reveal 
some of their encounters too for example in the summer of 1897 a Native American 
who lived in Thule Lake reported that he was approached by a Bigfoot while he was fishing 
he offered Bigfoot one of the fish which it accepted and in fact the Native Americans do 
report other friendly Bigfoot encounters in their early 1900s a native of Mount Shasta reports that 
he was hiking in the wilderness when he was bitten by a poisonous State snake and to his surprise 
he was approached by a Bigfoot which actually lifted him up and carried him back to his camp 
so in the 1900s these accounts really began to grow in number in 1938 a gentleman from Los 
Angeles went camping outside of Anza Borrego in Southern California this is a desert 
area and he says he was approached by several hostile white-haired Bigfoot with reddish eyes 
he says he was able to keep the creatures at a distance by building up his campfire and holding up the burning brands so while Bigfoot encounters can be scary they rarely harm humans 
there are not a lot of cases of that people do get scared but they generally do not hurt 
people some cases however definitely push the limits of this during World War II two 
friends or Edwards and Bill Cole say that they were hunting in The Siskiyou mountains when 
they had an unforgettable encounter with the Bigfoot now today there are several accounts 
of people being actually kidnapped by Bigfoot and this one is one of the earliest on record 
the two Hunters that walked around some bushes when they suddenly saw the head of an ape-like 
creature dart out of the woods and look at them it darted back in and in a matter of seconds 
they heard this Bigfoot running towards them and Cole says he was attacked as Edward says I 
heard the pad pad pad of running feet and the wump and grunt as their bodies came together 
dashing back to the end of the Bush I saw a large man-like creature covered with brown hair 
it was about seven feet tall and it was carrying in its arms what seemed like a man I could only 
see legs and shoes Edward looks to his side and saw that his friend Cole was gone and that's 
when he realized this Bigfoot had just kidnapped his friend and Cole himself reports that he had 
no warning whatsoever but suddenly found himself being carried through the forest by the creature 
which held him tightly for a short time and then dropped him and sent him rolling down the hill 
he jumped up and grabbed his rifle and as he says and I quote I stood there sometime and 
looked and listened I had a feeling I was being watched and hunted so these two gentlemen kept 
this encounter secret for many years because as Edwards says I would not believe what I 
had seen and as Cole says it was funny neither of us had the guts to say what happened to us 
it's not the only case of a Bigfoot kidnapping but it's one of few that occurred in California 
But as time went on accounts of Bigfoot really began to increase in number in 1947 Mr and Mrs 
Russ Tribble say said that they observed two Bigfoot outside the city of round Mountain they 
said that the Bigfoot actually crossed the road in front of him and one of them stopped and looked in 
the car window and after these creatures left they explored the area and discovered large footprints 
in 1952 just a short time later an anonymous gentleman was driving along a dirt road through 
the forest outside of Orleans this is near Bear Valley California and he saw a Bigfoot walking 
alongside the road although it was rainy and dark he got out of his car to observe closer 
and this Bigfoot turned towards him and what he perceived to be a threatening way but the creature 
then walked back into the forest he thought the encounter was over at this point but it wasn't 
he got back in his car and started to drive when the Bigfoot leapt out of the forest and attacked his car he accelerated away but he says that the Bigfoot held onto his car for 
about 200 yards before finally letting go so yeah they can be quite aggressive at times one of the 
most common types of Bigfoot encounters occurs when Witnesses are driving late at night and in 
1956 Mrs pomeray was driving along Interstate 5 near Mount Shasta when she saw Bigfoot run across 
the road and disappear into the forest Mount Shasta has a lot of Bigfoot accounts but the 
first encounter to really gain any widespread media attention and really bring Bigfoot 
permanently into the public awareness occurred in August of 1958 in the town of Bluff Creek 
this is in Northern California and what happened was a large construction crew was building the 
Bluff Creek Road when strange things began to occur on the job site on August 3rd 1958 the four 
man Wilbur Wallace was puzzled to find that a 700 pound Tire had been thrown away from the work site 
uh he couldn't explain it but didn't think much of it until a few weeks later on August 22nd 
when one of the crew workers Jerry crew was leaving the work site when he discovered dozens 
of giant man-like footprints around his tractor he told Wilbur Wallace and the news of the footprints 
spread like wildfire the news was soon leaked to the Press by the wife of one of the workers 
and then on October 1st and 2nd Jerry crew discovered more tracks and this time he made 
plaster casts and this was enough to make this story an instant media sensation in the attention 
of the world was focused on the then little-known town of Bluff Creek and the encounters were still 
in progress on October 12 two workers Ray Kerr and Bob brazel were driving at night near Bluff Creek 
when they saw an eight foot tall figure run across the road in full view of their headlights uh this 
figure they said was very hairy and actually traversed the entire Road in only two strides 
uh just a few days or weeks later on November 1st 1958 more Footprints were discovered 
later there would be allegations that Wilbur Wallace had either hoaxed the footprints or tried to take financial advantage of the situation though this was never proven in any way 
in either case Bluff Creek became firmly established as the Bigfoot capital of the world and as a result hundreds of people began to share their own accounts 
reporting Bigfoot had finally become somewhat respectable or credible at least 
and Bigfoot Hunters Converge on Bluff Creek and began what turned out to be a never-ending search 
for The elusive creature and since then Bigfoot was reported pretty much every year 
in 1958 a woman and her daughter were outside in the Hoopa Valley area this is near Bluff 
Creek when they said they saw two Bigfoot one large and one small as they were hiking along 
the hillside and at the same time in nearby Weaverville two doctors were driving along 
Highway 299 late at night when they have the most common type of Bigfoot encounter they 
observed the creature through the car headlights as it bounded across the road in front of them 
one year later June of 1959 an anonymous gentleman became sleepy after driving for several hours he 
decided to pull over late at night outside of the town of Weed California and while 
resting he was alerted to the noise of somebody walking through the forest in front of his car 
he turned on the headlights and observed a Bigfoot which quickly disappeared into the forest 
that same year 1959 A Private Pilot and his wife were flying over Bluff Creek when they spotted 
a trail of huge footprints on the ground so they followed the tracks from above and further ahead 
were amazed to see the Bigfoot that was making these tracks so while all these sightings were 
occurring dozens of other Witnesses were reporting Bigfoot tracks all over the area 
in some of these cases I mean they counted the tracks and they numbered well over a thousand 
so the Bluff Creek sightings would continue for decades and even today this area continues to produce the largest number of reports in California 
but meanwhile sightings continued all across the state in 1960 two men in Quartz Hill this 
is located at the West End of the Antelope Valley in Southern California they observed 
what appeared to be a giant bipedal figure silhouetted against the sky on a nearby Hill 
Mount Shasta as I mentioned is one of the many layers of Bigfoot a lot of cases come from there 
in 1962 a unique encounter occurred when a local Woman by the name of Bonnie Feldman claimed to 
have observed a pregnant female Bigfoot give birth to a baby Bigfoot on the Mountainside 
she says she watched the event from the Porsche of her trailer on the Eastern slopes of the mountain 
so I think that case may be unique but there are so many cases in June of 1962 Robert Hadfield was 
in his home in Fort Bragg when his dogs began barking outside looking outside he saw the head 
and shoulders of the Bigfoot as it walked behind a six foot tall fence so this is well over six feet 
tall he ran inside to get his friend Bud Jensen they both returned outside but by then the Bigfoot 
appeared to be gone it wasn't Jensen returned it back inside but Hatfield kept looking if you've 
been walked around the house and right smack into the Bigfoot the creature actually knocked 
him to the ground and terrified he scrambled back into the house meanwhile Jensen looked out the 
window and observed the Bigfoot approaching the front door that Hatfield had left open 
he ran up to close it but the Bigfoot also ran forward and actually held it open the two men got 
ready to shoot the Creature if it entered but at this point it suddenly left they found a handprint 
on the door which they said measured 11 and a half inches long and they also found several Footprints 
outside which upon measuring they found were 16 inches in length so far bigger than any human 
and the sightings continued it was just two months later August 10 1962 when Joseph wattenberger was 
hiking east of McLeod this is near Lava Beds National Monument when he observed a Bigfoot 
off in the distance and while some accounts of Bigfoot do have a menacing aspect to them some 
are absolutely benevolent here's an interesting case which occurred one year later in 1963 
a man says he was deer hunting and the slopes of Mount Shasta when he slipped and fell badly 
injuring himself and he says that a nine foot tall very smelly white-haired Bigfoot appeared scooped 
him up in its massive arms and carried him about three miles back to the safety of his campsite 
another weird and friendly account of a Bigfoot occurred on Mount Shasta 
when two men said a Bigfoot approached their campsite came right up to them with no fear and actually handed them a quartz crystal and then bounded off into the forest 
so there are weird accounts of sort of Trades going on between Bigfoot and people 
many Bigfoot encounters do involve multiple Witnesses of high credibility 
on January 27 1963 the police department in Sonora California received a call from 
an anonymous gentleman who said that he saw Bigfoot while driving along the Sonora Highway 
a sheriff and a deputy went to investigate and they became Witnesses themselves they didn't 
actually see the Bigfoot but they could hear it screaming in the woods one month later February 
28th 1963 private Pilots Leonard Strand and Alden Hoover were flying through this same area 
when they came upon what they believed to be a 10 foot tall brown-haired Bigfoot wandering through 
a remote area of the wilderness they were able to actually take photos of this being this uh Bigfoot 
but the photos didn't turn out very well they were too blurry to be conclusive 
but the sightings continued it was just one month later March 1963. 
Mr and Miss Campbell were honeymooning at a ski lodge in Strawberry California 
known to them the owners of the ski lodge had recently had several run-ins with Bigfoot 
and as the Campbells were hiking along the many remote trails in this area they were amazed to 
see a tall hairy figure which they estimate was about nine feet tall in the nearby fields 
after reporting it they later learned that they were not the only witness to what appears to be the same Bigfoot so despite its enormous size Bigfoot is incredibly agile 
on August 3rd 1963 a father and his son from Hoopa California observed a Bigfoot running 
through the field and it easily leapt over a five-foot high fence and ran off into the forest 
one year later September 13 1964 Benjamin Wilder was driving near Blue Lake this is in Northern 
California and he became sleepy and pulled over his car to rest and he woke up to find 
a Bigfoot shaking his car shortly later the Bigfoot ran off and he immediately drove away 
but one month later in the Southern California City of Fillmore several youngsters were playing 
in an abandoned Dairy when they said that they observed a quote hairy Animal Man 
so Bigfoot does seem to approach people purposefully and sometimes they seem to be attracted to people's campsites a typical encounter like this occurred in the summer of 
1965 when Jin and Jan goral were barbecuing at the Bowens Ranch campgrounds on San Gorgonio mountain 
when they were approached by a 10 foot tall Bigfoot which calmly observed them from a distance 
the girls became very nervous too nervous to remain there and quickly packed up everything 
and left and while reports of people being harmed by Bigfoot are exceedingly rare there's something 
about the appearance of this creature that often makes people react with fear 
it was 2 A.M in January of 1966 when Bob Kelly and Archie Bradshaw who were good friends were 
in their cabin in Wildwood they had no warning when a Bigfoot suddenly appeared and stared at 
them through the window Kelly grabbed his shotgun and fired at the creature and although he was sure 
he hit it it ran away they went outside and measured its tracks at 18 inches in length 
in July and August of 1966 several Bigfoot reports came from the Southern California 
city of Fontana this was a huge wave of sightings one family reported that a tall 
red-haired Bigfoot actually ransacked their car while they were picnicking around that time two 
teenage boys were hiking outside Fontana when they said a Bigfoot actually attacked them the Bigfoot grabbed one of the boys who suffered scratches and torn clothing as a result 
another rare Bigfoot attack occurred in the same area this was on August 27 the witness was Jerry 
mendahall and a friend they said they saw Bigfoot from their car to their shock the Bigfoot quickly 
approached reached through the car window and grabbed the arm of one of the witnesses causing 
painful scratches both the witnesses report that the bigfoot was covered with slimy mud and emitted 
a foul putrid odor corroborating all these above encounters around the same time two young men were 
hiking in nearby Quartz Hill when they observed a Bigfoot standing still on a distant Hilltop 
so by this time it was becoming clear to researchers that Not only was Northern California a Bigfoot Hot Spot Southern California was also producing a large number of cases 
still the vast forests in Northern California with the Towering Sequoias and Redwood Trees 
seems to be the preferred Bigfoot habitat in 1966 Richard sides was hiking near Bluff Creek 
when he saw a Bigfoot squatting down drinking water with its cupped hands 
in 1966 same year Larry Browning was camping in the Trinity Alps outside of Weaverville when he 
said he saw a Bigfoot walk by his campsite the Trinity Alps do produce a large number of cases 
but Larry Browning was so amazed that he returned to his campsite several times in the hopes of 
having another sighting and his patience was finally rewarded however he learned the hard 
way that it's not always a good idea to get too close to Bigfoot because it was two years later 
on April 6 1968 he observed a Bigfoot wading across the Salmon River he returned the next 
day and saw a female Bigfoot but on this occasion the Bigfoot also saw him and began to chase him 
and he says that this Bigfoot actually followed him for a half hour and at one point charged him 
menacingly before finally going away there are quite a few reports like that in the Bigfoot 
literature of these creatures charging people and trying to basically chase them out of the area 
in the early 1967 Russell Somerville was again on Highway 299 this is just west 
of Willow Creek when he observed a nine foot tall Bigfoot walking right along the highway 
he says this creature stayed parallel to the highway for about 50 feet before dashing back into 
the undergrowth and he says afterwards there was a terrible odor which lingered for several minutes 
what's interesting about Bigfoot is yes there's often this vowel or odor associated with them but it's not always there and some Bigfoot researchers think 
that they might have a gland in which they can release this odor much in the manner of a skunk 
whether that's true or not is unknown but certainly a lot of speculation about this 
of course many Bigfoot Hunters have mounted various Expeditions in search of Bigfoot and 
many of these are concentrated around the Bluff Creek area and one of these included a man by 
the name of Roger Patterson he had heard about new Bigfoot prints in the area of Bluff Creek 
and in October of 1967 he went to Bluff Creek to make a film documentary about Bigfoot 
and this began one of the most influential and controversial events in Bigfoot history 
was October 18 1967 Roger Patterson and his associate Robert gimlin were riding through 
the area where Footprints had been reported occasionally taking film footage of the surroundings to use as background material for their film and with early in the afternoon when 
they came around a corner on the trail and saw a tall hairy figure just a few hundred yards away 
Roger Patterson quickly retrieved his movie camera and filmed 952 frames of 
moving film of this creature as it walked away into the forest 
and this film became a media sensation and still is today controversy surrounds the 
film there have been claims of hoaxes however the primary Witnesses never recounted their stories 
um most experts I think believe that the film is authentic not all some believe this is a man in a 
uh basically a gorilla suit if you will nevertheless it is only one of many cases the 
story of Bigfoot does not rest on the Patterson film and Bluff Creek still continues to produce 
a constant parade of solid reports for example in June of 1968 Steve Marlin and Bruce Cornwall 
were hiking in the Bluff Creek area when they saw and smelled a Bigfoot in a clearing in the forest 
one month later July 11 1968 a family was camping along the Trinity River 
when they said they saw Bigfoot walk right by their campsite and back into the forest 
that same month in July of 68 Harold Lancaster was hiking through the Southern California 
desert outside of Borrego Springs it was late at night when he says he saw a quote giant ape 
man walking towards him it then bounded away and disappeared and although rare there are a 
few accounts on record where people have seen Bigfoot from the air while flying in January of 1969 for example private Pilots Robert James Jr and Larry larwick were flying 
a small plane over just over the north area of Yosemite Park when they saw a long line of what 
looked like Bigfoot tracks and they were intrigued so they followed the tracks in their plane 
to their amazement these tracks appeared to be fresh and led them directly to the Bigfoot himself 
and they buzzed the creature with their plane getting as close they said is 50 feet to it 
they also tried to take photographs and manage to capture blurry photographs of this creature 
and they estimated it was about 12 feet tall and that these Footprints were about 20 inches long 
so many witnesses have made very close-up observations of Bigfoot and have provided really 
detailed descriptions of their appearance and a perfect example of this occurred on April 16 1969 
in the town of Paradise California which was very much forested it's occurred on uh two Mr 
and Mrs Robert beam and they encountered a Bigfoot crossing the road in front of them 
and according to Mr Robert beam he says and I quote as we started a long curve our headlights 
lit what seemed to be a man infer crossing the road our impression was that it was more than 
six feet high completely covered with short black hairs which seemed to be marked either 
of white spots or mud its face was white the head was small and finished at a Peak at the top 
was heavily built with particularly heavy legs so that's a typical description but it was around the 
same time and in the nearby city of Oroville that Ed Seville and Eldon Butler were rabbit hunting 
and to their shock their rabbit calls actually attracted an eight foot tall green eyed Bigfoot 
which apparently came to investigate the noise they were making so that's one way to do a ce5 
with the Bigfoot in June of 1969 Ben Foster Bob Kelly and his family and several others 
were at the Wildwood Inn in Wildwood and they were drawn outside by the sound of barking dogs 
this large group of witnesses observed a six foot tall dark brown Bigfoot which 
was fighting with the dogs that had surrounded it Bigfoot and dogs generally do not get along 
but when these people arrived the creature ran off into the surrounding Forest 
but there was a cluster of sightings in this area at that time it was one month later on July 4 1969 
Eldon Brackett was hiking north of Wildwood when he observed a seven foot tall Bigfoot and after 
it left he examined the tracks which measured 16 and a half inches and they had a four foot stride 
so clearly not human uh it's just two weeks later July 17 two brothers Charles and Kevin 
Jackson were burning rabbit and trails in their backyard in a rural Oroville when they observed an 
eight foot tall female Bigfoot walk by the nearby outhouse that same month Don Ballard and a friend 
of his were horseback riding through the Trinity Alps when they had a rare daylight sighting of 
the creature most of the sightings are at night it does appear to be nocturnal but that's not 
always the case but Don Ballard reports that this creature appeared to have no real neck but it did 
leave several 16 inch tracks most of the witnesses say that Bigfoot has no real neck to speak of very 
wide shoulders extremely muscular the reports about Bigfoot particularly in California are very 
similar and consistent it was around this same time July of 1969 in the same general area that 
Homer Stickley observed a Bigfoot walk through his backyard he lived on the outskirts of Oroville and 
in the months that followed he investigated and he found several tracks measuring about 11 inches 
so July of 1969 was a major Bigfoot wave in the city of Twain three teenagers were driving 
home from the movie when they observed a Bigfoot crouching in the middle of the road in front of 
him they actually had to Swerve to avoid it they came to a screeching stop and when they turned 
around to examine the creature was gone there are people who have interacted with Bigfoot one such 
case occurred to an anonymous female prospector who was working outside of Orleans California 
and she reported that during the summer of 1969 she observed a male and female Bigfoot on several occasions and after seeing them a 
number of times she left out apples and grapes for the creatures which they apparently took 
in the fall of 1969 again the same year Oroville again showed itself to be a Bigfoot hot spot 
Ron Sanders was hiking along the French Creek in Oroville when he saw two Bigfoot crossing the 
reservoir the Bigfoot were actually turning over large rocks and appeared to be eating something 
and was around that same time when Charles Maudlin was hiking along the nearby Feather River 
when he saw a Bigfoot running along an abandoned dirt road I mean there's so many cases October 
31st Wes strong was in his home in Oroville when he saw a Bigfoot squatting in his yard 
he says the Bigfoot stared right back at him and was obviously aware that it was being observed 
many people have tried to shoot a Bigfoot Mike Scott and a friend were in Calaveras in the Big 
Trees National Monument when they saw a Bigfoot above 30 yards away Mike Scott fired he says 
three rounds of ammunition at the creature did not appear to affect it it quickly escaped apparently 
unharmed so sightings continued throughout the 1970s in April of 1970 Buzz McLaughlin and several 
others of hayampum California observed a nine foot tall Bigfoot outside the Manzanita Ranch School 
and they said the creature looked very much like a giant gorilla on May 14 1970 Archie Buckley 
was hiking at Stuart GAP South of Wildwood when he observed a seven foot tall Bigfoot 
after it left he measured its tracks at 15 inches and he was so awestruck by his experience that he 
did begin researching accounts and conducting his own Bigfoot stakeouts and one month after 
this encounter on June 18 he returned hoping to have another encounter and he was successful he 
was actually able to attract a Bigfoot to his Camp by laying out freshly caught fish as an offering 
this is one of a number of cases in which people have been able to initiate a Bigfoot encounter 
also in 1970 two Hunters were in Cooper canyon near Quartz Hill again this is in Southern 
California there are other cases at Quartz Hill they were out hunting in the forest when they 
encountered what they thought at first was a very large unidentified animal however when it stood 
up they could see it through their gun scopes and it looked like a large human looking figure 
they weren't sure if this might be a person or an animal so they didn't shoot and shortly later this figure ran off into the forest on two legs so it was definitely bipedal on September 1 1971 
an anonymous Lieutenant Sheriff was driving southeast of Mammoth Mountain this is a very 
popular ski resort when he observed an eight foot tall hairy Bigfoot standing alongside the 
roadside with its arms outstretched it was around that same time but much farther south in Palmdale 
that an anonymous young man says that he encountered Bigfoot and like other Witnesses he says he shot at it he fired four shots at it with a 30-30 rifle and as in virtually all 
the cases where people shoot at this creature the bigfoot was apparently unharmed and fled the area 
in late 1971 and early 1972 many reports came in from the High Sierras for example campers 
Warren Johnson Larry Johnson and Bill McDowell and others reported several incidents where Bigfoot 
would prowl around their campsite often howling in the distance and they were actually able to 
capture some of the vocalizations on audio tape so there is little doubt that Bigfoot is real 
and that California is a hot spot here's a pretty well-known case which occurred in January of 1972 
to two to four teenage boys from balls Ferry this is an extremely rare type of Bigfoot UFO encounter 
because the boys were driving when they saw a UFO a large glowing object swooped down over their car 
they continued driving and parked along Battle Creek and it was there that they heard a blood 
curdling scream they trained their flashlights on the sound and saw a seven foot tall creature 
covered with brown hair they became overwhelmed with fear and immediately left the area but 
returned shortly later with an adult and again all of them heard the creature howling loudly 
and again it scared them off the scene as the adultliness dean Rich says it sounded like a real 
deep growl it was a real weird type of sensation it was nothing I've ever experienced before 
so there are a number of cases where Bigfoot and UFOs do appear at the same time 
there are actually quite a few cases like this across the United States and the world I did 
cover those types of cases in a previous episode but I think it's important to note 
that there does appear to be in some cases a connection between Bigfoot and UFOs but most no 
another UFO or rather another Bigfoot hot spot is the Angelus National Forest this is just North of 
Los Angeles it has about 650 000 Acres so it's a vast remote Wilderness and a Haven 
for all kinds of large Wildlife including Bearer deer cougar and apparently Bigfoot 
so while Northern California Bigfoot settings are well known many people are not aware that Southern California has hundreds upon hundreds of reports and when you take into account that most 
people never report their encounters it's likely these accounts are probably in the thousands 
and if you just visit the vast mountains of the Angeles Forest covered with thick pine 
trees it's enough to convince you that a Bigfoot could definitely live there and in the mid 1970s 
the Southern California sightings increased and produced a huge flood of reports for example in 
February of 1972 four teenagers were hiking the Lake Isabella area of Southern California 
when they said they saw a Bigfoot prowling around their Campsite in the late moonlight 
that same year October 8 Randy Norton and Steve Gillespie were in the city of Redding when they 
observed a Bigfoot Traverse Clear Creek at the Placer Street Bridge which you can see right 
here the next day they saw what appeared to be the same Bigfoot in the same area running away 
the year of 1973 brought a huge flood of reports in the Lancaster Palmdale area 
on March 14 of that year three U.S Marines observed what they described as a quote large 
bipedal hairy creature this was right on the outskirts of Lancaster and according to the 
witnesses they were driving along when this creature actually leapt in front of their car 
it was that same month another one from Lancaster went outside to see why her dogs were whimpering 
and she was shocked to see a tall hairy ape-like figure stand up from the tall grass and run off 
uh on April 22nd 1973 a multiple witness case occurred in the Sycamore Flats campground in 
Big Rock Canyon this is near Lancaster again the three Witnesses were all from the San Fernando 
Valley their names are William romerman Brian goldeljarb and Richard Engels they were exploring 
the area together when each of them observed a hairy man-like creature it was towering at least 
11 feet tall possibly 12 feet they got a really good look at it and according to the witnesses 
this creature actually paced their pickup truck along the road for about 20 seconds they know 
how tall it was because they saw its head actually sweep right under this overhanging branch and they 
were later later able to measure the height up to this branch and it was between 11 and 12 feet 
so that's a really well verified case one month later Ron Bailey observed an eight foot tall 
Bigfoot standing right next to a telephone pole alongside the road in Palmdale and after it left 
he approached the site and found large footprints so this area Palmdale Lancaster Acton is quite 
active for bigfoot it's one month later in June of 1973 siblings Brett and Stephanie Baylor were 
playing outside their home in Lancaster when they saw Bigfoot observing them from behind a boulder 
it was one month later in July an anonymous naturalist was researching in the castle Crag 
Mountain area and he says he observed an eight foot tall Bigfoot it had a very human looking 
face he said and he watched it for a long time about 45 minutes it's interesting because many 
people do report that although Bigfoot is hairy it the face itself looks remarkably human like 
in August of 1973 Margaret and Joyce Baylor of Lancaster again observed a Bigfoot which 
they estimate was 12 feet tall again alongside the road after left they found its footprints 
and it was around this same time that a gentleman by the name of Mike Pence was driving his motorcycle through the desert area north of Lancaster 
when a Bigfoot appeared and he said through rocks at his motorcycle if you studied the Bigfoot 
accounts in the literature you will see that rock throwing is definitely one of their behaviors 
and interestingly this is a well-known type of primate primate Behavior 
meanwhile back in Northern California things were heating up specifically in the Shasta Trinity 
National Forest and as Lauren Coleman who's a world famous cryptozoologist writes and I quote 
in August 1973 during a fishing trip and other visits several Bay Area based bigfooters 
including Sharon Gordon Richard Foster Ben E Foster Jr and Archie Buckley had multiple 
sightings there including seeing a Bigfoot thrower Rock one prowling around a campfire 
another flipping a car aerial some communicating by gesture and another being attracted nearby 
so they did find tracks They found a dead Fawn feces and it was a very active area 
meanwhile the Bigfoot wave in Southern California continued September 1973 two people were in their driveway one evening in Quartz Hill 
they turned on the headlights to their car and were amazed to see this Bigfoot with long tangled 
hair standing at the end of their driveway and after it left they did find large footprints 
in October of that same year March 21 inch Footprints were discovered at the nearby 
South Fork Campground measurements taken of the distance between the footprints registered get 
this a 12 foot stride so this Bigfoot was apparently running and certainly there's no 
human being on Earth that can have a stride that wide that same year December 27 two siblings were 
hiking near their home in Palmdale when they saw a Bigfoot which they estimate was about 12 feet tall 
as they wash it bounded away at very high speeds and disappeared into the desert 
in 1973 a team of researchers set up a Bigfoot Stakeout in the Mojave Desert area near a place 
called The Buttes one of them was Kent Lacy and the other researchers actually achieved their goal 
of having a Bigfoot encounter when they all observed a large hairy Bigfoot standing off in 
the distance they not only saw it they smelled it and described it as a powerful rank odor 
in 1974 a family from Quartz Hill was startled by the appearance of Bigfoot in their backyard 
so they they will come right up to people's homes many cases of that and of them looking in people's 
windows and that same year in nearby Big Rock Canyon Campground a number of reports came in 
most of the people who were encountering these this creature were Campers or hikers or Hunters 
was a very famous case in August of 1974 which occurred to Bruce Morgan he was at the big rock 
area when he saw a Shaggy white-haired Bigfoot sitting down on the ground and in a sitting 
position its height was about six feet so you can see how big these creatures really are it was 
around that same time that a gentleman by the name of Terry Albright was driving through the big rock 
area along the mountain roads when he nearly hit a seven foot tall black-haired Bigfoot with his car 
uh he went public with his case which became quite well known September of 1974 Neil Fern 
and Rich Engels were hiking at night in Antelope Valley when they said they saw a seven foot tall 
black-haired Bigfoot standing on a Hilltop and after it left they searched the area 
and found 15 inch Footprints what was really interesting about these Footprints is they did 
not have five toes instead they had three toes and that does turn up in a number of these cases 
it was just a few months later when a group of children were walking near the Canyon High 
School in New Hall Saugus and this has forested area right around it and they 
saw a nine foot tall dark colored Bigfoot raise its arms and then jump off into the wilderness 
so this wave continued strong into 1975 on August 14th Irene Rambo observed a 10 foot 
tall Bigfoot appear over her backyard fence in Corona and it was three days later that four 
Witnesses including James michalko and Ernest palmeira were near their home in Corona when 
they saw what appears to be the same 10 foot tall Bigfoot wandering through a Citrus Grove 
further north in Sequoia National Park but around the same time John Clark was camping 
when he saw nine foot tall Bigfoot which he said looked like it had blonde hair or he says could 
have been covered in vegetation he's not sure but most Bigfoot are described as being dark colored 
occasionally you do hear red hairs blonde hairs and rarely White on September 3rd 1975 
Mark Carr was driving outside the very big hot spot for bigfoot Oroville and in the 
early morning he saw a seven foot tall Bigfoot right along the roadside he was so amazed he 
actually lost control of his car and smashed into a tree and when he looked up the bigfoot was gone 
in 1975 an anonymous witness was driving outside of Saugus when he saw a Bigfoot and he said that 
it was holding a small animal in his hands as it stood in the light of a flashing road sign there 
are a number of cases of that of people seeing Bigfoot holding rabbits deer and other animals 
meanwhile back up in Northern California near the town of Pine Grove two teenagers Rick 
vandelli and Joe Coughlin saw a Bigfoot twice over a period of just a few weeks 
on March 23rd 1976 Ed Johnson and a police patrolman by the name of Dan Murphy 
observed a Bigfoot leap over an eight foot tall wall this was in rural Mill Valley 
and they investigated the area and found the corpse of a freshly killed deer
so there's so many cases I'm really just touching the tip of the iceberg here but I want to continue 
up to pretty much the present day in the summer of 1976. two brothers were fishing late at night at 
Mars Dam when they observed a very tall human-like creature walking along a Deer Path and it was 
just a few months later that a hunter reported his sighting of the creature along the West Fork River 
and in his case he also heard the Bigfoot scream in a weird mixture of he said howling and roaring 
one year later 1977 a man was camping in the woods outside of Mendocino 
this is Central to Northern California and he says he was woken up by this bipedal creature 
running through the woods right outside his tent as he says and I quote I was more effing afraid 
than I could ever remember praying that what I was listening to wouldn't start moving towards my tent 
the noise sounded like a two-legged monster crashing through the woods hastily 
so he didn't see anything however he says that the reports that he says that in the area where he was 
camping many disemboweled animals had recently been found so Bigfoot usually occurs at night 
and again the most common type of encounter is a road crossing as in this following case 
was late one evening in 1978 a truck driver was driving near Lake Hughes when he observed 
a very tall hairy man-like creature bound across the road in front of his headlights 
it was throughout the 1980s and 1990s that Southern California researcher Ann 
druffle investigated numerous Bigfoot cases throughout the Tujunga Canyon area so this 
is also an area that's very active with UFOs in fact andruffel mostly investigated UFOs 
but started investigating Bigfoot because again there appears to be a connection here 
and I investigated a case personally involving a radiologist by the name of Robert Murphy his home 
is located on the outskirts of Canyon Country this is immediately north of the sprawling megalopolis 
of Los Angeles but a very rural area and one summer evening in 1978 Robert Murphy was startled 
to see an object flashing extremely bright red and white lights Landing in its backyard he first 
thought it was a helicopter because there's no roads or structures behind his house but he realized it was totally silent and he jumped up to go outside and these lights disappeared 
he was very puzzled but it was the next night that he got a real scare because as he says and I quote 
this is the one that gets me I have three dogs and they were terrified out of their minds they were 
huddling together on my patio all three of them they were huddled together and they were obviously 
terrified out of their minds and they were looking at the same spot where that thing with all the 
lights was the night before right in the corner of my yard they were barking at something up there 
and they were barking furiously like they've never done before in their lives they were all 
huddled together and then I heard this thing this creature and this thing moaned and it moaned in an 
unearthly fashion that's a very hard to describe other than it had a very low long toned Eerie 
moan that sounded like it was resonating in a very large creature like a big barrel-chested kind of 
creature you could just hear the Resonance of this thing and it moaned really long like 10 seconds 
and at this point Robert Murphy mentioned something that is familiar to Bigfoot researchers 
but I don't think most people know about is that Bigfoot is actually telepathic as Robert says it 
seemed like I was reading its mind and it was irritated with the dogs that's what I thought 
and it moaned again a second time same thing as before about the same duration and then the third 
time it moaned again but this time it was really really loud and it moaned for a real long time 
and I was so scared I was afraid to go look he retreated into his house and stayed there until 
the next morning and he went out to investigate and did find what appeared to be footprints 
so meanwhile sightings continued May 30th 1979 bill iftiger was driving along U.S Highway 395 
outside of Yosemite when he saw an eight foot tall Bigfoot Dash across the road in front of his car 
in 1979 June Shirley DeWolf and her family observed an eight foot tall Bigfoot walking right 
down 140th Street East not far from their home in Lancaster so there are times Bigfoot will approach 
Suburban or even urban areas though that's quite rare and I will say again Lancaster while it 
is a very populated area Lancaster Quartz Hill Antelope Valley Acton it's surrounded 
by large deserts and forests so 1970s were was a very active decade for bigfoot but the next 
three decades brought more reports they're around Mount St Helens has long been a Bigfoot hot spot 
and the days following the eruption of Mount St Helens in May of 1980 Betty Ann Almo and her 
friend observed a Bigfoot there on three separate occasions and each time they said they saw this 
creature wandering through a walnut tree Grove located along the Feather River Bigfoot does 
appear to be omnivore omnivorous and will eat both animals and fruits and whatever it can find 
it was a few months later on June 9 1980 Two Gentlemen from Scott's Valley Dave Wilhelm and 
Ben Larson noticed a horrible garbage-like smell near their campsite and going to investigate they 
drove around the area slowly at one point they heard loud footsteps and heavy breathing and 
suddenly a 12 foot tall Bigfoot appeared in their headlights the next day they returned and observed 
large footprints so that so that seems to be the outer limit of how tall these Bigfoot get um you 
don't hear really any reports of anything over 12 feet tall they are it's an outlier for sure 
on September 3rd 1980 Clyde Williams was driving through the Lake Hughes area late at night when 
he said a Bigfoot leapt right in front of his car and bounded quickly up a very steep Mountainside 
January 6 1981 an anonymous witness says he was hiking through the Angelus Forest 
looking for bigfoot tracks when he had an incredible encounter as he searched he suddenly heard this loud almost metallic noise he said at the same time all the 
animal sounds stopped and looking around he observed a large metallic saucer landed nearby 
and looking to his left he saw two tall bigfoot-type creatures in the distance 
both of these creatures were making long loping strides directly towards him he quickly snapped a 
photograph and ran away in a panic unfortunately the photograph didn't really come out 
and it was inconclusive but again another rare case of this weird Bigfoot UFO connection 
in 1982 Marcy Hanstead was in her home in Eureka and she looked out her window and saw the head 
and shoulders of a Bigfoot it quickly moved away however she was convinced forever that 
Bigfoot is real and again there are many accounts on record in which Bigfoot has approached densely 
populated urban areas one such case occurred on the northwest end of the heavily populated San 
Fernando Valley the Santa Susana mountains this is a little bit off from the homes in the valley 
but I mean this is very populated well over a million people live in the San Fernando Valley 
and with one evening in January of 1984 when two men were driving along the curvy Mountain 
Road of Santa Susanna pass when they said they encountered an eight foot tall hairy creature 
standing in the road like other Witnesses they had to Swerve to avoid the creature 
and actually crashed their all-terrain vehicle at which point the creature quickly ran away 
however one month later three hunters in the same general area said that they witnessed another or 
perhaps the same eight foot tall hairy man-like creature just walk right by their campsite 
there's so many cases in 1987 a group of retired firefighters were enjoying a volleyball game in 
the O'Brien campgrounds this is near Mount Shasta Lake when a Bigfoot walked through 
the nearby Field apparently oblivious to the human activity going around it 
here is a very interesting case and it exhibits many of the details that are typical 
of Bigfoot Behavior and it's a very extensive encounter actually it occurred in June of 1988 
the awareness was Sean fries who was camping alone in an isolated area 
along the feather river in northern California and he says he had a pretty terrifying encounter 
he was alone in his tent his dogs were sleeping outside and he woke up to find his dogs running 
into his tent trembling in fear meanwhile all the animal sounds The Crickets and so 
forth had stopped he grabbed his rifle and overcoming his fear he went outside of his 
tent to put more wood on the fire and he said he had the sensation of being watched 
and then as Sean fry says and I quote I heard some very heavy footsteps right behind me in the trees 
there was also a very strange odor almost like a cross between a skunk and something dead 
so he spun around but whatever it was stayed out of his view in the thick forest however 
the encounter was not over yet as Sean Price says this thing circled my Camp all night long 
so he stayed awake until it became light but by the time morning arrived he had had enough 
he decided to leave immediately but little did he know this he was about to be chased by this 
creature as Sean says at first light I packed up and started out and this thing followed me almost 
the entire day I could smell it and even saw it through the woods about 75 yards from me taking an 
almost parallel Trail to me as if to make sure I left its territory so it does appear that Bigfoot 
can be territorial it was just a few months later in August of 1988 when Todd wilheim was driving 
through the eastern Sierras and he says he saw two Bigfoot crossed the road in front of his vehicle 
and uh 1995 there was a case which got a quite a bit of press attention because this involved 
a filmmaker by the name of Craig Miller who was filming a movie scene in the scenic Jedediah 
Smith Redwoods State Park this is outside of Crescent City in Northern California 
and he and his associate Colin Goddard were filming Colin Goddard was the husband of a very 
well-known model a Playboy model as a matter of fact when they all noticed a Bigfoot and 
actually filmed it Goddard was driving the crew in a large RV when he saw this eight foot tall 
hairy human-like form walking across the road in front of their vehicle he shouted to Miller 
to look and was Miller who grabbed his video camera and managed to capture five seconds of 
video of the creature as it crossed the road and disappeared Into the Wilderness This Is Not Great 
footage but with the eyewitness testimony that comes along with it it's a pretty darn good case 
so while most Witnesses do catch only fleeting glimpses of Bigfoot at night some do involve 
daylight sightings and this following case may be unique in the Bigfoot literature it occurred in 
August 1995 an anonymous couple from Pennsylvania had traveled to Northern California for a vacation 
they rented a car drove to various locations and little did they know they were about to 
have a pretty dramatic Bigfoot encounter with very early one morning they were 
driving outside of Crescent City which has many Bigfoot encounters as we have seen 
they were driving along the coast when they spotted a beautiful beach they stopped the 
car and were starting to get out and take a walk one with no warning whatsoever a Bigfoot showed up 
as one of the witnesses says and I quote I turned to see this big thing standing right in front of 
my car at first I thought it was a bear until our eyes met I couldn't move or speak we just 
locked Eyes For What seemed to be forever it stood about six and a half to seven feet 
dark brown matted hair and was holding what looked to be seaweed which used both its hands to carry 
it didn't seem startled in fact I felt it was looking at me with anger in its eyes 
it let go a snort and a glob of snot hit the windshield right in front of my face 
it then took three or four steps and completely crossed the highway while still looking at me 
so yeah Bigfoot boogers I don't know if that material was ever collected and studied there 
was no follow-up on this case as far as I know but I haven't heard of a case quite like it 
at this point uh another driver actually drove up and they all watched this creature quickly bound 
off into the forest and the main Witnesses have all insisted upon complete anonymity 
so while there are many reports of late night drivers probably the majority comes from campers 
and hikers and other people who are exploring their local Wilderness Area such as in this 
next case this occurred on August 4th 1996 and this is a daylight sighting 10 a.m when several 
campers in the Inyo National Forest observed a Bigfoot from a distance of about 300 yards 
they estimated it was about eight or nine feet tall and it moved quickly along a nearby Ridge 
often these creatures are seeing walking along Ridge tops or along rivers or long deer trails 
in September of 1997 several reports came in from the lake Crowley area 
the first setting was made by several campers who observed this creature while they were cooking their Camp breakfast but it was a few weeks later when several fishermen were 
fishing around dusk when they observed a Bigfoot looking back at them from the banks of the lake 
as we have seen the Mammoth Mountain ski resort area has produced a number of reports 
one occurred in July of 1998 when several mountain bikers were biking along the base of 
Mammoth Mountain and observed a Bigfoot walking near the ski tram at the base of the mountain 
on October 17 that same year 1998 several campers in the Plumas National Forest Area were woken up 
by the sound of a large bi-peel creature walking around their campsite and the next evening they 
heard a strange howling noise about two miles away and all were convinced it was Bigfoot 
a more recent case occurred in the town of Acton I was able to interview the witness personally she 
does not want her name used but she reports that she had several encounters with a bigfoot-like 
creature outside her home in Acton this was in the summer of 2001 she wasn't the only witness 
several members of the home also observed the creature looking in through the window her 
roommate saw it she did and her young son saw it uh one morning she woke up to find chewed 
up animal bones on her doorstep she thought that perhaps the Bigfoot had left it as a gift 
they found freshly skinned animals they found Footprints they've smelled odors which they 
associate with the creature's presence on one occasion they heard a loud noise on the roof and 
the next morning they went up to investigate and there was an enormous Boulder perched on the top 
of the roof Wendy had to get two full-grown men to move the boulder off of her house and she says 
that on occasion she felt that this creature was actually in telepathic contact with her she asked 
me if there were any cases of Bigfoot kidnapping people and I told her no at the time I was not 
really familiar with the Bigfoot literature I did not know that there were that many cases of 
you know people being grabbed by Bigfoot turns out there are and she was worried about that 
on another occasion Wendy's Son observed the Bigfoot climbed the tree next to their home there 
was a loud cracking sound as it broke several of the branches and in fact I saw this myself 
and Wendy confirmed that several thick branches in the tree were snapped off as did I and there 
were large footprints I conducted a long interview with Wendy I talked to her son as well and briefly 
with the other Witnesses and she said this went on for almost three years she felt it was friendly 
and she felt that it was kind of excited because it had found someone who could communicate telepathically with it but by late 2003 she called to say that this Bigfoot was 
still around and did I want to see it for myself because she thought she knew pretty 
much where it lived my answer of course was yes I had no idea that this would be successful 
but I shouldn't have been surprised because she had taken my sister-in-law out Bigfoot hunting 
a few months earlier and they both heard what they believed to be a bipedal creature bounding 
through the darkened Forest towards them but they became quite frightened and left 
so at this time I was still new to Bigfoot uh and uh was a little bit skeptical 
at any rate it was clear to me after talking to Wendy that it was real and in October 2003 
uh Wendy and uh I hiked to a Wilderness Area a few miles from our home off the Angelus Crest Highway 
we had just pulled off this road a little dirt road and we're getting out cameras and 
recording equipment and uh Wendy pointed to this Ravine and said that this is where she believed 
the Bigfoot lived and suddenly there was a very loud continuous growling noise off in the 
distance coming directly from this deep forested valley directly to our East we all Stood Still 
and looked at each other with wide eyes and you know saying did you hear that what was that I 
mean this was loud I honestly thought it might be a jet coming overhead but it clearly wasn't 
we all listened and it was just a few seconds later when we heard it again a long continuous 
loud growling sound it lasted for a good five seconds I mean this was loud and by this time 
I could pretty much triangulate where it was coming from it sounded almost like a chainsaw 
but it was different it wasn't a bear it wasn't a lion uh Wendy screamed she's like we're leaving 
now I want to go away uh Wendy's not a real name by the way that's a pseudonym but she 
was quite frightened and insisted upon leaving I was running towards it uh but yeah that's my 
Bigfoot encounter we definitely heard something I'm absolutely convinced it wasn't a mountain lion or a coyote or a bear or anything like that I mean this thing resonated in your chest 
so and I later found out that there was in fact a long history of sightings in that area 
so this is a great place for any Bigfoot Hunters to explore there are more than 80 campgrounds 
located in the Angelus Forest National Park plenty of places to look for Bigfoot 
and Lauren Coleman actually lists this area as one of the top spots in the world to contact Bigfoot 
as he says this area sees a lot of unusual Bigfoot actor activity but 
it does not get much publicity even though it is so close to Los Angeles
so it turns out that three of the Bigfoot cases I've personally investigated they 
all had a telepathic aspect to it this is one of the reasons I do think Bigfoot is probably sentient and is psychically developed or advanced
so probably uh the best place to see a Bigfoot if you're really interested in hunting then is the 
town of Willow Creek in Northern California this is surrounded by huge Redwood forests 
and it's easy to see why it's a Bigfoot hot spot this is very much close to Bluff Creek 
and each Labor Day they have a big annual Bigfoot celebration I mean I could go on and on with 
further accounts all the way up to the present day but I think it's getting a little bit repetitive 
so I'm just going to wrap it up here but as you can see Bigfoot is all across California 
there you go that's the history of Bigfoot in California I did write about this in my book 
Supernatural California I also wrote an entire book about Bigfoot this was actually written 
for children it's called Bigfoot Yeti and other eight men and that's a more General book covering 
the entire planet but in Supernatural California I presented the California history of Bigfoot and uh 
yeah I'm absolutely convinced this is real that there is a Harry hominin wandering through the 
forests of our State here in California but across the United States and the world it's my opinion 
that we're probably dealing with ancestors of the Neanderthals who have been with us all along but 
have remained largely undetected I do believe they're intelligent I think there are psychic 
aspects to these beings who have very developed psychic abilities this is just my opinion based 
on some of the more paranormal type encounters that people have described to me personally 
but you've seen the evidence for yourself you can make up your own mind I hope you've enjoyed 
this episode I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it until next time 
keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun.
