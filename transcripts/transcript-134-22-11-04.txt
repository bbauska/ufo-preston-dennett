THE ET FERTILIZER CONNECTION

Summary:
Nov 4, 2022
On September 19, 1961, a momentous event occurred which generated headlines across the world and forever changed the way humanity viewed the UFO phenomenon. While driving through the remote White Mountains of New Hampshire, a married couple by the name of Barney and Betty Hill encountered a UFO. The object descended low enough that Barney was able to see occupants looking down at him from the craft. As they sped away, the craft pursued them. The couple experienced about two hours of missing time, then returned to their home.

This incredible case introduced the world to the idea of UFO abductions. And before long, hundreds and then thousands of similar cases started pouring in from all over the world. The case is perhaps the most famous in UFO history. But what many people don’t know about is the fertilizer connection.

During their encounter, the Hills had a bag of fertilizer stored in their trunk. And when researchers began to look into their case, they asked the Hills if they had any nitrates of any kind in the vehicle when they were taken onboard. The investigators told them that they had researched other cases where there was a connection. The Hills were initially puzzled by the question, and they didn't understand what the researchers were getting at. Only then did they realize that yes, they did in fact have a bag of fertilizer in their car. Was there a connection?

The answer might be, yes! On April 24, 1964, dairy farmer, Gary T. Wilcox encountered a landed UFO and occupants on his farm in Newark Valley, outside of Tioga City, New York. He held a nearly two-hours-long conversation with the beings, during which the ETs explained that they were interested in studying agriculture and the use of fertilizer in his fields. They actually asked him for a bag of fertilizer, which Wilcox provided. The case drew the attention of UFO researchers. It's a strange case, but Wilcox's family and friends vouched for his honesty and integrity.

In this video, we explore these two cases and several others which point towards the ETs' interest in fertilizer. For example, there is the bizarre case of Mexican farmer, Jose Carmen Garcia, who became internationally famous for his ability to grow super-sized produce and vegetables. He grew ten-pound onions, sixty-pound cabbages and collard greens more than five feet long. Scientists and agricultural experts were amazed. When they asked what his secret was, Garcia shocked them by revealing that he had been given a "secret formula" from extraterrestrials. As strange as this sounded, people had no choice but to believe him, because Garcia was able to provide the gargantuan vegetables as proof.

More cases exist, such as an anonymous gentleman who reported his sighting of a UFO moving over the Agrium Fertilizer Plant in Borger, Texas in 1988.

Another case is that of a young girl from Winsted, Connecticut who woke up one evening to watch a UFO land outside her home and disgorge several short humanoids who proceeded to investigate the building across the street. It turned out that this building was being used to store large amounts of fertilizer. 

There's also the case of an anonymous gentleman from Lee's Summit, Missouri who, after having several sightings in the area, decided to investigate. He discovered that the sightings seemed to be correlated to the use of fertilizer. Says the witness, "“One of the commonalities is that they appear in areas which are rich in phosphorus such as certain coast water, and other waterways which have runoff from fertilizer."

These are just a few of the many cases pointing toward a strange ET-fertilizer connection. This is an area of UFO contact that has never been explored in depth, and provides some interesting insights into the behavior of UFOs and their occupants.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
you've got a very interesting and unusual episode view today I call this one the ET fertilizer 
connection this is a very unusual and bizarre aspect of UFO research that I don't believe has 
ever been explored before yet there are some cases where there does seem to be a connection between 
ETS and fertilizer a few of these cases are well known but some are virtually unheard 
of and I definitely found out some interesting things and because this hasn't received really 
any attention I thought this would be a great topic for an episode on this show 
so let's just get started in the first case I want to talk about is probably one you've 
heard before it's the first reported UFO Abduction ever and this is the case of Betty 
and Barney Hill who had a UFO contact experience in 1961 in the White Mountains of New Hampshire 
and there is this really strange connection with fertilizer that is not well known 
so that's why I wanted to really dig deeper into this because this was the first case 
that really reported this bizarre connection on September 19 1961 a momentous event occurred which 
generated headlines across the world and forever changed the way Humanity viewed the UFO phenomena 
and this is of course the case of Betty and Barney Hill who experienced two hours 
of missing time while driving through the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the days and weeks that followed they became increasingly concerned about the missing time 
aspect of their encounter Betty was having dreams about being taken on board and Barney himself 
was suffering from anxiety and his condition of hypertension and his stomach ulcers both worsened 
and there was various bits of evidence that proved that they had had more than just a sighting there 
was Barney's scuffed shoes that is torn dress unexplained shiny spots on their car and more 
so after seeking Health they've decided to undergo hypnotic regression and the now world famous case 
was revealed so this case introduced the world to the idea of onboard UFO encounters 
and before long hundreds and then thousands of similar cases started coming in from all 
over the world but again what many people don't know about is this weird fertilizer connection 
and his best-selling book The interrupted Journey John G Fuller wrote that the trip 
through the mountains had been an impulsive idea and it was a largely unplanned adventure to fill 
the short vacation that the hills were enjoying from their place of employment and on the morning 
of the trip the hills loaded up their trunk with supplies and as John Fuller writes and I quote 
as he loaded the trunk Barney shoved a bag of bone meal fertilizer to one side and packed the luggage 
around it that he had bought the fertilizer to work on the garden during the vacation 
it was just as easy to let it stay in the trunk as to take it out later they 
were to find this comfortable homey material creating an unusual inquiry and speculation 
so following this encounter Betty and Barney Hill actually went to visit Betty's sister to talk 
about the encounter and Betty's niece Kathleen Martin remembers the event vividly Kathleen Martin 
has written extensively on her aunt's case she's now a prominent UFO researcher in her own right 
and in a 2001 interview Kathleen described what happened when Betty came over shortly after this 
encounter as Kathleen Martin says Betty compass in hand led us to the street where her 1957 blue 
and white Chevy Bel Air was parked my mother brother Glenn and I peered curiously at several 
highly polished half dollar sized circles while we took turns lifting my youngest brother Tommy high 
enough to see Betty demonstrated the car's effect upon the compass starting at the hood and running 
it over the side back and trunk we watched as the needle spun wildly over the spots but not on the 
side my mother spied Glenn and myself feudally attempting to rub the spots away and cautioned us 
not to touch them for safety reasons my mother who was careful not to jump to erroneous conclusions 
suggested that perhaps something inside the trunk was having an effect on the compass 
Betty opened it and we looked at the bag of fertilizer that she had purchased but not removed 
I don't remember how the needle reacted when she placed it over the bag my mother was again becoming apprehensive about our possible exposure to radioactive material so we were 
quickly shuffled back into the house we found seats in the large living room on the opposite 
side of the room from my father in Barney and Betty explained the details of her sighting 
while we listened intently asking questions to satisfy our curiosity so this is important 
because Kathleen Martin does verify that there was this bag of fertilizer in the Hills trunk 
so the hills and Encounter of course attracted the attention of numerous researchers and scientists 
who are studying the UFO phenomenon and among them were Robert Homan a science writer and C.D Jackson 
a senior engineer these were both UFO researchers who were among the first to talk to the Hills 
and they were hoping to obtain new insights into UFOs and their possible extraterrestrial Origins 
so these two men Homan and Jackson question the hills extensively and were particularly impressed 
by the missing time aspect of their story and it appeared to Betty and Barney Hill that the 
men were familiar with other such encounters and they questioned them about every aspect of their 
UFO experience but it was one particular question which caught both Betty and Barney by surprise 
John Fuller writes about this in his book and I'm quoting John Fuller here as he says Homan and 
Jackson inquired about many facets in the case that puzzled Barney particularly in inquiry as 
to whether there were any nitrates or nitrate derivatives in the Hills car the only thing I 
could think of that possibly had some connection with nitrates Barney later said was gunpowder 
I did have about a dozen shotgun shells in the car left over from a trip to the South when I'd 
practice shooting at tin cans on my uncle's Farm but aside from that I couldn't think of anything 
the reason they were asking they said was that in several Close Encounters the people have been in 
rural areas where they were exposed to nitrates or nitrate fertilizer then it hit us that he had 
left the bone meal fertilizer in the trunk before the trip and I hadn't bothered to take it out now 
who knows maybe it does have significance maybe it doesn't it was interesting that they should bring 
it up when we had forgotten all about it and they asked a lot of other questions that started me 
thinking questions like did we have anything new in the car any new object and had it disappeared 
there had been reports apparently of people having clothes sightings and something they had recently 
purchased had disappeared they asked if anything had disappeared out of our car but this was two 
months later and we had a lot of junk in there and I couldn't remember although Betty didn't realize 
it at the time she did in fact have something disappear she had been wearing earrings at the time of her encounter and after her encounter they were missing this was the fact she wasn't aware 
of until the earrings reappeared mysteriously inside a pile of leaves on the kitchen table 
this was actually shortly after the visit with Homan and Jackson that the earrings reappeared 
the house was unoccupied at the time so but he had no idea how these earrings could have reappeared 
but like Barney Betty was really puzzled by Homan and Jackson's question about nitrates 
as Betty says and I quote their questions were so far out that I just couldn't see what relationship 
they had to our experience and this business of nitrates at that time I had all kinds of 
plants in the house in fact in the living room I had an avocado tree that touched the ceiling 
they walked around to look my plants over and asked me what kind of fertiler fertilizer I 
used on them and things like this so in their book on the Hill's case Stanton Friedman and Kathleen 
Martin write about the possible fertilizer connection as they write he meaning Homan 
asked Barney if he or anyone in his family had any association with the nitrates industry 
the unexpected out of context question elicitated elicited a response of mild
he Holman asked Barney if he or anyone in his family had any association with the nitrates 
industry the unexpected out of context question elicited a response of mild annoyance in Betty 
then she realized she did have nitrates in the trunk of her car a bag of fertilizer 
Betty wondered why the occupant of an extraterrestrial craft would be drawn to nitrates 
during her lifetime this question was never satisfactorily answered 
so this Remains the question could the presence of fertilizer have been a factor because it's clear 
that Homan and Jackson thought there might be a connection and that they had uncovered previous 
cases which apparently did have this connection so as you can see this connection in that case 
certainly has not been fully verified but there are other cases and there's another 
case I'd like to talk about that is pretty well known you may have heard of it this occurred in 
Tioga city in New York actually in a smaller area outside of Tioga called Newark Valley 
and the main witness in this case is a Dairy Farmer by the name of Gary T Wilcox and he 
had an encounter with a landed UFO and occupants actually talked to them for almost two hours and 
yes there's a very strong fertilizer Connection in this case at 10 A.M on April 24 1964 to Yoga City 
Dairy Farmer Gary T Wilcox was spread spreading fertilizer in his fields in Newark Valley 
as he approached one of the fields which was surrounded on three sides by trees he was startled 
to see a large metallic object sitting in the center of the field for a second he thought it was 
an old refrigerator but as he approached he saw the shape was wrong he thought it might be a fuel 
tank that had fallen from a plane but as he got even closer he could see it was a large egg-shaped 
object 20 feet long and 16 feet wide he said it was made of shiny metal metal and had no apparent 
windows or doors but suddenly however two small male humanoids appeared standing next to the craft 
they were dressed in seamless uniforms with hoods that covered even their faces and each 
was carrying a tray that was heaped full of Earth that had been apparently removed from Gary's field 
so as he approached one of these figures looked up and spoke in Flawless English informing 
them to have no fear they said that they were actually from the planet we call Mars and that 
they had already contacted several other people Wilcox thought for a second there that somebody 
was playing a joke on him but these figures proceeded to ask him all kinds kinds of questions 
they actually gave him a prediction that a U.S astronaut would die this turned out to come true 
but they appeared to be interested in the fertilizer that Wilcox was spreading throughout 
the field and asked him how it affected the growth of plants and they said that they got 
their nourishment from the atmosphere and they then asked if Wilcox would give them a bag of 
fertilizer and he agreed and he actually turned to go retrieve the fertilizer and as he left the 
craft suddenly took off so he returned with a bag of fertilizer anyway which he left in the 
field and when he checked the next day it was gone so he knew that this was an unusual experience it 
was pretty clear to him that this was not military and he felt it was his duty to notify the police 
which he did and seeing that he was sincere the police referred him to UFO researchers 
and before long his case began to generate considerable interest and when bendy Betty 
and Barney Hill were discovered to have had a bag of fertilizer in their car this was more possible 
evidence of a fertilizer connection so Gary Wilcox was extensively interviewed by researchers 
and no inconsistencies could be found in his case and as Gary Wilcox says in an interview 
I don't care whether anyone believes me or not it doesn't mean anything to me one way 
or the other I told them the police what I saw and heard and I thought I should 
and in another interview when he was asked what he thought of people who didn't believe his story he 
said I know what I saw we talked for two hours and we were even joking at times I just don't 
worry about it I've got nothing to hide and if I saw another one today I would report it 
so despite the bizarre aspects of this case by all indications it's true in fact Gary 
wilcox's Brother Floyd was interviewed as a character witness instead of his brother 
if Gary says this thing happened it really happened he has nothing to gain and a lot 
to lose by telling a story like this I know it to be true and in fact researchers interviewed 
Gary's neighbors who all said he was an upstanding citizen researcher Marcus loath has looked into 
this case particularly the fertilizer connection and as he says and I quote it is perhaps the most 
mundane aspects of this encounter as is often the case that provide it with the authenticity that 
appears to envelop this particular incident an encounter that would very much appear to 
be a cosmic reconnaissance mission one to gather information about organic materials 
of planet Earth as well as the intricacies and knowledge of farming and rules of agriculture 
The Encounter of Gary Wilcox is certainly one of the most intriguing of its era so again further 
confirmation of wilcox's case is the fact that the prediction given to him regarding the death of an 
astronaut did come true and despite the bizarre elements of this case it's considered a classic 
Gary actually said that there were certain details he was not going to reveal because 
they were too personal or too sensitive and that he was going to be investigated by the airports 
and what I'd like to do is play a small clip a short clip of an interview this farmer Gary Wilcox 
did and this audio clip is about six minutes long but you'll be able to hear Gary Wilcox 
in his own words as he describes his encounter 10 o'clock in the morning a spreading load of manure 
final back to Barn there and I kept seeing this glittering thing it was about a pretty mile away 
I guess up on top of the hill there's nothing in view I mean in uh it's all open ground and 
there's no rice box up there whether something reflected off on that or it looked just like uh 
rear Shiner in my face and I was going up the top of that hill to see if it was ready to plow anyway 
and I drove one up with the tractor and uh as I got up there about 100 feet of this glistening 
thing if I could see what it was oh well I got 100 200 yards from it there and I couldn't see nothing 
there wasn't no signing or nothing but as I went closer I got almost within 100 feet before I 
saw anything this is uh when I took off was about 100 feet and I couldn't see it was gone I mean uh 
but it looked like a wing tank to me at first I've seen them when I was in the service quite a bit uh a few Tanks off these planes it was more a shape than anything it was 
20 foot long 15 or 16 foot wide and about four foot deep how close did you get to it a couple 
inches I was touching it for about two hours what did the surface look like it was made out of
right it was was shiny but it wasn't real bright it was just like a dish or some kind of cooking 
dish really but what it was now did a door open before these people came out of it how did they 
appear how did you meet the little men well I don't know I was feeling another thing there just 
getting ready to come back down car the sheriff up and see if something had fall off an airplane but I kind of wondered into it because it was off the ground it was about four foot off the 
ground and had this idling noise and uh I don't know nothing happened I was touching it there for 
a couple of minutes and I was just getting ready to go and somebody needs it someplace I don't know two things are men or whatever they are came they were about four foot high I don't know 
what they are or what they who they were but they talked to me for about two hours up there and you could perfectly understand that well they talk better English and you're talking 
did they talk with any kind of an accent no no accident or nothing I spoke German and Russian 
when I was in the service and well nothing like either one of them oh the first thing they said was don't be alarmed we're gonna talk to people before and they were questioning uh all right 
seeing them and stuff they were quite concerned that I shouldn't have seen him within 100 feet or so and then when I told him I saw him right down where I was spreading manure I was putting 
her away they were quite concerned he said I shouldn't have seen him in the daytime like that that's why they're laying in the daytime so they said that they were traveling this hemisphere 
this trip they were they had each one had a tray in her hand grass and stuff it was the side looked 
like they took the knife and cut it right out of the ground just a slab of it and he's straight that's what they were doing they said it's like an organic material and stuff where did 
they say they were from well I mean this song's awful silly I know but uh they told me they were 
from what I know as a planet Mars every time they spoke a stuffy refer to it as I know or 
as we know here like as we know Earth as we know Mars and stuff like that you sound like you find 
it rather hard to believe yourself well I know I was up there for two hours I was touching the 
thing and talking to somebody I don't know who it was and you say you talked to them for about two 
hours oh it's probably an hour and a half I was up there about two hours all together we're already 
talking about a lot of stuff some of the stuff I can't say anything about someone I can but uh 
uh maybe he's talking about this people were Silly to go into space that they 
would never survive there just as they can't survive here they said they can only make a tripod every two years or two that were here I'll say you can't stand this atmosphere but 
the first men that would have even a harder time than they though because they they were telling me 
they're a much farther advanced than this kind of stuff than we are but they were more interested in 
agriculture aspects of Agriculture and anything they asked me what I was doing about the manure and what are these where I got it and what it did and all that stuff they didn't know nothing about 
agriculture they don't have no organic material or anything like that up there they said they surviving what they get out of the atmosphere they have and did you stress any point they 
made a lot of statements like that but they never stressed the point they didn't say how they lived or anything like that did you say that they were other things they told you that you cannot reveal 
why not why can't you reveal these other things oh I guess I better not saying why 
sure this is being investigated into yet who's investigating it we're supposed to be the Air 
Force supposed to be coming around I guess what Sheriff says you can't tell us what they told you from my own personal reasons can you give us an indication of what it was but what did it concern 
for our concerned then being here more or anything do these creatures have features like we do on 
Earth they have eyes they were about four foot tall and they had arms and legs and heads where 
the head feeders I would presume so they just had a complete uniform covered everything I mean 
as far as seeing future you can't see anything the voice comes from it from the front one someplace I 
don't know if they come from the head or couldn't say you come from the stomach or where it just 
hear the voice come from it someplace he was about four or five feet away from me what kind of were the uniforms same car as a ship sort of like a spacesuit oh the same car I didn't touch 
the uniforms but I looked to me like the same kind of stuff they seem to go back underneath 
the hip the back one went first and this front one turned around they both went back underneath the ship and where they went to I don't know it was only about 60 seconds and the thing took off and 
I was standing about six inches from it when it took off so that's the case that I think really 
cements this bizarre connection between ETS and fertilizer but there are other cases and there's a 
really unusual and truly bizarre case that I don't think most people have heard of and this took 
place in IRA pueta Mexico and involves a farmer by the name of Jose Carmen Garcia who apparently 
had a contact with a gentleman who had contact with extraterrestrials and learned some very 
interesting things about how to grow giant produce this is a bizarre case but it's apparently pretty 
well verified as we shall see so again this case is all about a humble farmer by the name of Jose 
Carmen Garcia he was born in 1930 and when he was 17 years old this is 1947 so that's a significant 
year for UFOs he was 17 years old and struggling to work his small three Acre Farm in Era puito 
Mexico he had inherited the farm from his father but was really having trouble making ends meet but 
his luck changed for the better when he says he met a mysterious stranger who shared an incredible 
secret with him this stranger told Garcia a fantastic story that he had been held captive 
he said by tall fair-skinned humanoids living in an underground base beneath a volcano in Mexico 
there's definitely a volcano UFO connection so this is kind of interesting but according to 
this stranger the humanoids nourished themselves from oversized vegetables and that this stranger 
was able to obtain a quote secret formula from the ETS which after his experience he was able to 
use to grow vegetables of incredible size and this stranger actually sketched the formula for Garcia 
on a scrap of paper this consisted of strange hieroglyphic symbols and the stranger told Garcia 
to basically concentrate on the symbols for a period of time and then quote the message would 
become clear as the man says and I quote concentrate on these writings and in time 
you will understand their meaning it is a magic formula and by using it you will feed the world 
so strange yes but Garcia followed the man's instructions and to his amazement this formula 
actually worked his farm not only began to flourish he began to produce giant vegetables 
we're talking like 10 pound onions cabbage is three feet wide and weighing up to 
60 pounds collard greens up to five feet long and two feet wide and more 
so Garcia began selling his vegetables at the local market in Valle de Santiago 
and not surprisingly this caused a local sensation Garcia's Fame grew very quickly as 
the locals gathered to Marvel at his super-sized produce and they were interviewed of course and 
they said who the vegetables that they had eaten were actually very tasty and nutritious 
and Garcia claimed that the incredible growth of his plants was due to this secret formula and that 
he used ordinary seeds and no fertilizer at all so the connection with fertilizers somewhat tenuous 
here but it's the same subject so I thought it was you know deserved and being included here 
at any rate this formula is a secret apparently in is mostly mental and Garcia's accomplishments 
caught the attention of authorities who tried to duplicate his abilities because we there are many 
photographs of these giant produce and in 1978 an agricultural Ministry official hired agricultural 
experts and local farmers and they were able to produce about 30 tons of produce per acre 
Garcia however far exceeded them at 106 tons per acre so more than three times better his Fame 
group very quickly when his story was published in the era Puerto newspaper El alacran and the 
Mexican magazine Impacto and news actually spread to the United States when a gentleman by the name 
of Bill Robinson an information officer for San Diego of San Diego California Police Department he 
traveled to era Puerto on vacation and personally met with Jose Carmen Garcia and in fact Garcia 
gave Robinson a giant onion which he transported back to the United States and Robinson eventually 
told the story of his meeting with Garcia in the well-known magazine San Diego Home and Garden 
so as fantastic as Garcia's story sounds the existence of these gargantuan vegetables is 
Undisputed and as I said there are many photos many of which were taken by Oscar Arredondo of 
a photographer and these photos show Garcia and others posing with his humongous vegetables UFO 
researcher Chet denback actually looked into this case uh it's from him that I heard about it and as 
he writes and I quote in the UFO Community there's always clamoring for proof proof and more proof 
of UFOs and extraterrestrials yet very little is ever produced in This Strange Case the only proof 
he offers is giant veggies that have scientists scratching their Collective heads in wonderment 
so there you go a very strange case but apparently Undisputed I couldn't find a whole lot of cases 
that really cemented this fertilizer connection but there are a few out there there was another 
case that occurred on May 15 1988 and this was in Borger Texas this is a pretty brief case but 
I think it could be significant and definitely points towards a possible connection here 
so this case may have only peripheral significance to this subject but it's very interesting because 
on May 15 1988 at 11 20 a.m a witnessed saw a UFO over the agrium fertilizer plant in Borger Texas 
and according to the anonymous witness he observed a quote solid Chrome disk fly directly over the 
plant which at the time was closed for repairs and as the witness says it was moving at a pace of 50 
to 60 miles per hour it was so close I could make up the object very clearly no noise was emitted 
so it's an interesting case but it's not really evident that the object showed any particular 
interest in the fertilizer plant itself but it did fly directly over it the next case I'd like 
to talk about definitely shows a connection between UFOs and fertilizer and ETS being 
interested in fertilizer and this took place in Winsted Connecticut on February 21st 1968. 
and this is pretty well verified in that it was researched by Major investigators such as Walter 
Webb Ted bletcher and others so let's just dive into this case and see what it has to tell us 
the main witness in this case is a young girl by the name of Miss Amato she's 12 years old 
and again this was investigated by Ted bletcher David Webb and Lawrence Fawcett it occurred on 
February 21st 1968 in Winstead Connecticut and it all began when Miss Amato heard a strange bloop 
bloop bloop noise outside the window of her home and her bedroom actually overlooked an abandoned 
railroad station which was then being used as a storage site for ammonium nitrate fertilizer 
hovering close to the ground beside the building Miss Amato saw a white egg-shaped object about 
the size of the family station wagon and as she watched this craft emitted a short beam of light 
at a downward angle much like a wrap she said and at that point 15 or 20 little men each about 
three feet tall exited the craft via the ramp they walked in single file and jumped from the end of 
the beam to the ground each was dressed in a dull silver jumpsuit and wore a fishbowl type helmet 
Miss Amato observed him as they proceeded to climb up the side of the building housing the fertilizer 
one after another using a hand over hand motion almost as if they had suction cups on their hands 
but upon reaching the roof they spread out in different directions and these little guys 
appeared to be looking down inside the building through a skylight at this point the witness 
became frightened by what she was seeing and ran to her bed hiding under the covers 
but the investigators were very much impressed with her testimony even more so because later 
that night there was in fact another report in Winstead Connecticut it was just one hour 
later just past midnight when Ms Cecilia Brewer and five companions were driving home from work 
between Winstead and barkinstead their car engine started to fail and looking ahead of them they saw 
a silver colored domed disc hovering along the left-hand side of the highway just over a Forest 
Clearing they viewed this object from a distance of about 100 feet and observed a cone of white 
light coming from the bottom the Dome of the object was lined with rectangular Windows which 
emitted a green light they watched this object for about 15 minutes at which point it flew away 
so this is further confirmation of Amato's encounter given that it occurred so close to 
her encounter and at pretty much the same time another case that points towards et's interest 
in fertilizer comes from an anonymous gentleman who posted his sighting to mufon and he had an 
interesting encounter in Lee Summit Missouri and after seeing UFOs on more than one occasion in 
this area he was curious as to why this area was so active and so he started to do an investigation 
and found out some interesting things so the main witness in this case I call Stan he is anonymous 
but on August 31st 2014 at 8 15 pm he observed a glowing orb near Lee's Summit Missouri 
and as the witness says and I quote from my first observation of it the light given off was really 
quite brilliant and more yellowish the rays which emanated from it also had a peculiar quality so 
I normally do not see with light there was a definition to the Rays and they came to a point 
so he actually managed to capture the orb on video and intrigued by this encounter he began to study 
reports of orbs looking for patterns and he did find an interesting pattern as he says and I quote 
one of the commonalities is that they appear in areas which are rich in phosphorus such as certain 
Coast water and other waterways which have run off from fertilizer other coincidences of high 
orb sightings occurred during the 4th of July celebrations due to the phosphorus and fireworks 
so phosphorus is an ingredient often used in fertilizer and Stan began researching the 
phosphorus levels in the area where he saw the orb and he found what he believes is a correlation as 
he says and again I quote it is now obvious that at least two areas of known phosphorus 
activity in bodies of water in the Independence Blue Springs Lee's Summit area are also areas of 
orange orb activity both areas are not restricted however to settings of orange orbs many other 
types of craft happen to frequent the area so perhaps this is further indication of UFOs and 
et's interest in fertilizer so there could very well be a connection here but the connection is 
not super strong there aren't a whole lot of cases phosphorus is of course a element 
that does turn up quite a bit in UFO landing cases and of course it is a major ingredient 
of fertilizer interestingly it's also one of the common elements inside the human body 
but there are a number of cases where phosphorus does seem to turn up during UFO Landings and 
there was a very famous cases in verones Russia which did apparently have a phosphorus connection 
and this occurred on April 24th 1989. again the verones Russia UFO landing case occurred on 
April 24 1989. it's very well known so I won't get too much into it I already did an episode 
on UFO landing Trace cases so if you want to hear more about this case you might want to check that 
out but I would like to quote researcher aunts shristava who had a very interesting insight 
as he says the most interesting fact of all is that the depressions in the ground showed that 
the object weighed several tons radiation was found in this soil as were unusually high levels 
of certain elements in particular phosphorus so once again here's this weird connection 
another case involving a UFO landing with a phosphorus connection comes from Uruguayan 
researcher Daniel Iglesias and this is another Landing in which phosphorus turns up as researcher 
Daniel Iglesias writes and I quote in a case in the department of durazno a witness reported 
at UFO landing and soil analysis showed an increase in the values of minerals such as 
chromium manganese phosphorus and carbon enabling researchers to conclude that the event had indeed 
been real another case involving a UFO landing with a phosphorus connection was reported by 
researcher Albert Rosales who wrote a wonderful series of books called humanoids amongst us 
and he reports on a case that occurred in Georgia Russia which does apparently again have this weird 
connection so this next case was reported to the Tas news service and again involved Landing traces 
this was on July 6 2002 and Albert Roselle Rosales did publish a summary of the case and as he writes 
not far from the location where the encounter had taken place several peasants found deeply 
pressed down grass slightly burned at the edges and circle shaped Witnesses also reported finding 
strange crumb-like particles which emitted phosphorus light for several days in a row
so these cases are all Landing cases which do seem to show this weird phosphorus connection 
again we are really left with more questions than answers but such is the nature of the 
UFO phenomenon so those are pretty much all the cases I could find involving the 
ET fertilizer connection I did write about this in my new book not from here volume 4. so if you 
want to get into a little more depth with these cases and other bizarre aspects of UFO research 
you definitely might want to check that out and yeah I think this shows an area of UFO research 
that hasn't been explored and while there aren't a lot of cases some definitely seem to point towards 
et's interest in fertilizer or agriculture in general in a previous volume of my not from 
here series I did a chapter on extraterrestrial gardeners and there are hundreds upon hundreds 
of cases where people have seen UFOs and humanoids collecting plant samples 
so that could be a connection here and I will briefly mention that contactee Howard Menger a 
sign painter from New Jersey whose case is quite controversial but his book from outer space to you 
does talk about et's interest in agriculture and how they are over able to grow produce 
uh and uh he devoted quite a bit of uh space in his book to this sort of Agriculture fertilizer 
connection and the et's interest in it so for what it's worth I thought I would mention that but yeah 
there does seem to be a connection but I'm gonna say it's tenuous at best with the thousands upon 
thousands upon thousands of reports I was hoping I would find more but the cases like the Tioga City 
uh case in New York definitely show that there's an interest there I do wonder about the Betty and 
Barney Hill case and the others I've cited but at this point it can't really say for sure but there 
is a strong connection but there is definitely some interest on part of the ETS so that's our 
show for today I hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you once again for watching I truly 
appreciate it and until next time keep searching for the truth and more importantly keep having fun
