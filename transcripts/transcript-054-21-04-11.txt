BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR: THE PAT BROWN STORY
Apr 11, 2021

Summary:
Apr 11, 2021
Would you like to meet extraterrestrials and go onboard their craft? Are you sure?

UFO encounters can be sometimes be traumatic, and they can sometimes be very friendly. Often they can be both scary and enlightening. Initially, many witnesses may find their experiences quite fearful. However, as they overcome their fear and face their encounters head-on, their experiences begin to transform into something much more spiritual and benevolent.

This video presents the story of Pat Brown, who asked to meet ETs and go onboard their ship, and got a little more than she bargained for. Her wish was granted and she began to meet extraterrestrials face-to-face. At first she was terrified, but slowly her encounters began to transform into events both healing and educational. The ETs taught her all about spirituality, and even took her on a tour through outer space.

After years of encounters, she came to realize that the ETs were not trying to harm her or scare her, but in fact were helping her along the spiritual path towards enlightenment. Given the choice, she has elected to keep having encounters and learn all she can from these mysterious visitors to our planet.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and welcome to another episode of ufos in  
the paranormal i call this episode be careful what  you wish for the pat brown story people have often  
asked me how come there are so few people of color  who have encounters and i kind of always shake my  
head i'm like what are you talking about of course  people of color have encounters in fact in all my  
books in which i feature close encounters there's  always been people of many different races asian  
latino black white you name it so i have to  say people of all races do have encounters  
and this particular case involves pat brown  who is a of american african american ancestry  
uh at the time this was the mid 1980s pat worked  as a telephone operator and lived in a condominium  
complex in a crowded suburb outside of los  angeles and she had no interest in the paranormal  
no interest in ufos was kind  of skeptical of them actually  
a few she'd lived a normal life a few years  earlier her friend denise that is a pseudonym  
uh moved to prescott arizona and denise kept  asking pat to come and visit denise particularly  
wanted pat to come see what she called walk-ins  these are psychic channelers who claim to channel  
extraterrestrials pat had no interest in  this but denise kept on asking and so finally  
uh pat relented and agreed to come visit  her friend denise and prescott and together  
they would go see these people who channel  extraterrestrials so in 1988 that's what pat did  
she drove down to prescott and stayed in denise's  home and it was around the same time that she saw  
the channelers she's not sure if it was before  or after but she had a very strange experience  
she woke up one evening in denise's home and saw  these glowing light beings come through the wall  
and into her bedroom as pat says i was lying in  bed and i had my back to the wall when i saw these  
two aliens off towards the back of my head i saw  them come through the wall and they came up to me  
they were slender iridescent like a whitish color  i didn't try to move i just lay there they came  
over and they went to the top of my head and it  felt very good so i allowed it following this  
you know pat didn't think much of the experience  it wasn't traumatic wasn't scary but she really  
wasn't quite sure what to make of it but  following this they went to go see the watkins  
and uh one of these guys was channeling and pat  was talking to the alien through the channel  
through the channeler and uh asked the channeler  the et do you have a ship do you have a craft and  
the e.t replied yes and pat said i want to go on  your ship and the e.t replied oh really you do  
and pat said yes i'm very curious  what to see what it would look like  
to be on your ship and uh the channeler agreed  and that was really the extent of the conversation  
uh and following this visit to the channeler uh  pat returned to her home in southern california  
it was three days later had a very lucid dream  that she was on board a ufo she remembers being  
laid out on a table and this soothing yellow light  shone down on her and uh it was a very pleasant  
feeling and she fell asleep it was somewhat of a  dreamlike experience but at the same time it felt  
very real particularly because she could feel a  sensation a very soothing and comforting sensation  
coming from this yellow light so she thought  that perhaps this was more than a dream but  
she couldn't be sure interestingly around this  time she decided she's going to quit her job  
which was kind of a stifling position and not  her true passion she quit her job as a telephone  
operator and instead became a healing massage  therapist and uh lived a normal life for at least  
a couple of years more but this all changed on  christmas eve 1990 on that evening pat was asleep  
in her bedroom in her condominium complex  when she woke up to find her bed surrounded by  
gray type ets she was fully conscious and  this terrified her she was very scared  
they shown a beam of light down on her paralyzing  her pulled her up through the wall and the next  
thing she knows she's on a craft she's laying  down on this table it's got a kind of bronze  
color to it there are weird panels all around her  shelves with weird instruments on them and there's  
two grays one on either side of her there's  a female gray on one side and uh what she  
perceives to be a male gray on the other  side the female gray is holding pat down  
holding her uh has a hand on her head and on  her chest and is repeating over and over again
don't be afraid i'm not going to hurt you i'm not  going to hurt you she kept repeating it over and  
over again you're fine i'm not going to hurt you  but pat was in a complete panic as pat says i was  
fighting her like crazy i put my finger in her  mouth that the little thing that was her mouth  
and i was trying to rip it out of her face  i was just going crazy at that point the  
male gray on the other side said boy she's  different tonight and that kind of freaked  
pat out like different tonight had she been on  board before so she was really freaking out and  
that's all she really remembers she does remember  that the atmosphere the air on the ship was very  
strange not quite like earth normal it was  very cool she said it's very thin and almost  
silky in texture uh so that was strange but  uh following this experience she woke up  
back in her bedroom uh immediately jumped up  grabbed the phone and called her friend denise   and said you will never guess where i have just  been uh as absolutely certain this wasn't a dream  
she was awake the whole time and this is  how her experiences really began in earnest  
following this one visitation the et's came again  and again over and over for the next 30 days  
they would come three days in a row and not come  for four or five days and then come another three  
days in a row and it was always the same pat would  wake up to find her bed surrounded by these grays  
and they would say you know  i'm not going to hurt you   we're not going to hurt you we we're just here  to talk to you and to help you but it caused pat  
a lot of fear they would always shine  this beam of light down on her paralyzer  
and she'd float through the wall and pass out  and wake up some hours later back in her bedroom  
so yeah this was not a good experience  for her she didn't like it at all  
and just kept going on and on for at least a  month and that wasn't the only strange thing that  
happened another weird thing that happened was she  saw this apparition as pat says it was just this  
big green thing it didn't have any definite  form just this big green blob it was solid  
kind of like a dirty chartreuse green it was very  large she saw it first in her den and another time  
in her living room she has no idea what it was  but it was definitely very strange another strange  
thing that happened was one day she came home from  work to find that the interior of her condo stank  
real bad like dirty garbage dirty rotted rotting  garbage as pat says it was an awful awful smell  
but i perceived that they had been there that that  was their odor i have heard this described from  
other people who described a sort of sulfur-like  odor so perhaps pat's intuition was correct  
at any rate after 30 days had passed pat was at  the end of a rope she couldn't take this anymore  
these grades just kept coming and coming  and one evening she kind of knew they   were going to be coming it had been a few  days so she was crying and she said out loud  
uh thinking to them this is far too big for me to  handle at that point something very interesting  
happened she heard a voice telepathically in her  head saying here is a ball of golden light for you  
this is for your healing as long as you  need it it's going to be here for you to use  
you're on the yellow ray of healing now when  you're ready for the purple ray we'll be back  
so she saw this ball of yellow light and uh  balanced experience could see it in her mind's  
eye and uh it stayed with her and for the  next four days or so pat just remained at home  
and did a lot of nurturing activities and worked  with this ball of light this really soothing  
yellow energy which he said felt very very healing  and it reduced her fear to a huge degree and this  
is when her encounters made a dramatic shift from  being very scary to becoming extremely spiritual  
uh pat contin uh the grace stopped coming but  pat had many dreams of being on board the ship  
and often when she was on the ship it was  very colorful and she would see these purple  
beams of light and uh red and it was just a very  colorful and beautiful experience and uh she would  
become immersed in these purple beams of light  and again she wondered if these were just dreams  
even though she kind of knew they weren't because  they were different from any dreams she's ever had  
she was on board a ufo in these dreams they were  very very vivid and just different from normal  
dreams but she was still had a little bit of  doubt about it so one evening she decided to  
make an announcement and sort of speak out to the  grays or to the ets as she says uh and i'm quoting  
she says if i go to the ships at night i'm  going to go right now because i feel like going  
now and the next thing i know i was on a ship this  being came over to me and it was like i knew him  
he was a white man with blonde hair  uh the man approached her and said  
do you want to go to your quarters and pat was  my quarters wow uh yeah yeah please and as pat  
says they took me to this room my quarters it  was real small there was nothing personal there  
the shelves were empty one of the things that  was really strange was the texture of the air  
on the ships it's like silk it's cool and  thin it's just a really pleasant sensation  
after showing her her quarters this man took her  to another room where there was an examination  
table very much like the first one she had laid  out on uh sometime earlier it was a bronze table  
she lay down on this table and the man began  to teach her about her aura as pat says they  
were teaching me how to go in between dimensions  i remember things that were happening to my aura i  
remember telling them telling me that there was  something i had to do with my aura during this  
teaching session pat suddenly there was a  shift and pat suddenly woke up back in her bed  
and she shouted out oh my god no i want to go  back to the ships i want to go back onto the ship  
and uh she heard a voice in her head it  was the same one who spoke to her earlier  
uh uh the man on board the ship and he said  wait just a minute we're working with you  
and moments later pat found herself back on the  ship only this time she was shocked to find that  
she was not in human form while she still felt  like a normal person she still felt like pat  
she was actually this mass of swirling colorful  energy and uh this man this human looking male  
asked her would you like to go  meet the master and pat said yes  
and the man said okay and led her to another  room and as pat says in this room she saw  
another person as she says there was this  white man with yellow hair sitting on a throne  
it wasn't the same man i had seen in my quarters  pat asked the man why do you look like that  
and the man replied because this  is the way you want me to look  
at that point uh he changed from human form into  this swirling sort of uh energy this ball of  
light and swirling energy much like the same form  pat was in and uh pat was confused about all this  
and the man said this is your soul this is the  part of you that goes through all the lifetimes  
at that point the man showed her how her  the energies in her body were segmented  
set began to show her the masculine and feminine  part of her energies and in fact he separated  
the masculine feminine energies uh apart so that  she could get a better sense of what they were  
and how they were integrated together and he also  took her through various uh vibrational levels or  
dimensions and was teaching her again how to sort  of travel interdimensionally and astrally out of  
body experiences this sort of thing so it was a  very positive experience for her and at one point  
this man quote the master um took pat  from this room and outside of the ship  
still in their energetic form and uh showed  her our planet earth from way high above and uh  
showed her that there was a an outer band  of energies which was very peaceful uh  
and in this outer band of energies she felt an  immense feeling of peace and oneness and then  
he took her closer and closer to the earth and  she saw that there was this big swirling black  
band of energy surrounding the earth he took her  into it and she was horrified it was very negative  
energy and uh was just vibrating at a very low  frequency of fear and anger and greed and all  
these negative emotions as pat says the vibration  was very thick and it's not a good feeling fear is  
what's predominant it's like all you can feel  when you come through it all you feel is fear  
at that point the man took her back onto the  ufo craft and they went up to the control room  
and this is where pat got another real shock  uh there were other people there again they  
looked human and in fact she recognized them  she felt like she knew them and that she was  
not only knew them but that she was one of them   the whole front of the control room was this huge  view screen the men were kind of standing in a row  
watching the view screen as was she and she saw  the stars racing by as they sort of flew through  
space flew through the galaxy she says it was like  having a tour of the galaxy and it was just very  
very beautiful and it was a glorious feeling she  says and she felt like she finally had come home  
she'd finally come home to where she belonged  she was with her people she loved it it was  
awesome and she didn't want it to end but after  this the experience did end and she woke up back  
in bed feeling absolutely fantastic she felt  great she felt like she had almost had a sort of  
experience involving enlightenment and felt like  she was vibrating at a very high frequency so this  
was a very wonderful experience and following  this she did notice a very interesting change  
while she would be giving her healing massages  at work this blue light would sort of come out  
of her hands and she saw it other people saw it as  well and uh well whenever this light came out she  
got a very vivid picture in her mind's eye of the  grays on board the ship and they were adjusting  
dials and switches and uh they told her that they  wanted her to help her heal the people she was  
working with so that's another really interesting  healing aspect to her encounters and this totally  
changed pat's viewpoint about her experiences and  she started to research ufos and this subject she  
heard that there might be an underground ufo base  at the four corners area in the united states  
and she called up her friend denise and asked her  if she wanted to take a road trip and go visit   four corners and see if they could get  any information about this alleged ut base  
and denise said yes let's go and so sure enough  they took this road trip and went to the four  
corners area and they were approaching this exact  area and we're driving uh right alongside a native  
american reservation when this ufo appears and  starts pacing their car it's not too far away  
it's just above treetop level it's very bright  it's got little bright lights all around it  
and another panel of lights it looks very strange  it's obviously not a plane or a helicopter or  
a shooting star fireball or you know a balloon  or anything conventional it's pacing their car  
pretty closely uh one odd thing was they did pass  other cars uh in both directions and nobody else  
seemed to notice it that was very  strange like why can't they see this  
because it was very obvious to them uh very close  up and it looked very strange and it paced them  
for a good couple of hours until at one point  uh it came close and they started to feel this  
very intense heat the entire interior of the car  started to heat up and it got hotter and hotter to  
the point where they both became alarmed and pat  said i'm getting afraid i'm starting to get afraid  
at which point this object veered off and  paced their car for another 15 minutes or  
so and finally just darted off so that was a very  weird experience and following this they decided  
that was all they needed they turned  around and began their return journey  
so more weird stuff happened after this uh here's  a very weird experience that happened to pat  
she was again alone in her condo in her  bedroom and woke up and a good friend of her  
appeared in the condo as kind of like  an apparition but a very solid looking   one her friend appears in her room and says  i'm going to introduce you to your higher  
at that point something very strange says as  pat says a little gray came around the corner  
and pat was mystified and confused and a  little alarmed and thought to herself what  
this is my higher self a gray alien uh  and chakra asked us and her friend said  
yes uh pat got up and hugged the gray and  uh that was really the extent of experience  
uh she uh doesn't know what to make of it and felt  like there might be some deception here she's not  
convinced that her higher self is a gray alien  and wonders if this was some sort of a disguise or  
some sort of manipulation uh so she really  wondered what was going on uh while her  
experiences were positive uh increasingly so there  was also an element of fear and confusion and uh  
she really felt like there was a element of  violation as well and she wonders if she gave  
any type of agreement to allow this to happen  because she has no conscious memory of doing so  
and she also began to wonder how long she's  been having these experiences uh because she  
remembered the male gray alien thing on her  first abduction boy she's different tonight  
and that cut that stuck in her mind and she  wondered you know has this happened before   so she really started to examine her past  looking for any clues that she may have had  
encounters having educated herself somewhat about  the ufo phenomena she did find some weird things  
that she thinks might be related she remembered  once when she was a younger woman she went to the  
doctor she wasn't feeling well she was having some  nausea and she went to the doctor and the doctor  
took some tests and told her oh well the reason  you're feeling this way is because you're pregnant  
uh pat was absolutely shocked she had not been  intimate with everyone this was flatly impossible  
there was no possible way she could have been  pregnant and uh tests however showed that she was  
and she was pretty upset about it she already  had a daughter she there was no way she was  
going to have another child at her age and  as much as it upset her to make this decision  
she decided she was going to terminate the  pregnancy she could not have this child and  
the night before she was going to have this  procedure she woke up and she was bleeding  
severely she called the doctor and the doctor  said okay you're probably spontaneously aborted  
i want you to be very careful and look for any  tissue that you might pass pat did not pass  
any tissue um all it was was blood she did not  see any tissue whatsoever and uh so that upset her  
and uh at the time she didn't know what to make of  it but now looking back she wonders if perhaps the  
ets came and took her baby before she could abort  it because as she found out missing pregnancies  
is definitely a feature in these encounters  as well as unexplained pregnancies which was  
certainly true in her case uh there was just  no way she could have been pregnant so that is  
interesting to say the least and when she found  out that many abductees carry unexplained scars  
she examined her body and sure enough on her leg  was an unexplained scar and she has no idea how  
it got there and that also concerned her she  wondered if perhaps she had been implanted
so another thing that came to her mind   was early experiences in which she would wake up  feeling paralyzed and there would be these little  
figures running around she thought perhaps  these were waking nightmares or something  
but now she recognized them as typical grace this  was something she had suppressed and very deeply  
and after she started meditating and examining  her past these memories started to surface so she  
realized that this has been going on for quite  some time and intuitively she does feel like she  
probably gave permission for these experiences to  happen but at the same same time she still feels  
a violation like they have no right to do this  to her and scare the living daylights out of her  
uh thankfully she had gotten past all the fear but  initially yeah it was very scary and she still had  
a lot of questions about what was going on with  her so when she had the opportunity to go see  
a psychic channeler she signed up and went  to this meeting to meet a lady who channeled  
spirits and et's so as she's in the audience  people started asking all kinds of questions about  
the et's and their ships and how they travel  through space and uh finally pat got a hold of  
the microphone and she asked her question she  asked is it true that we make an agreement to  
come here and that our bodies can be used in this  way at this point the channeler lowered her head i  
was silent for a few moments and then lifted her  head and obviously was channeling some different  
type of spirit or e.t and as the channeler  said we are here we are reticuli and said it  
in a very robotic unemotional voice and told pat  that yes you did agree to have these experiences  
pat was not pleased with the answer  and she felt a wave of anger and she  
asked another question and she said if you  become consciously aware of your abduction  
can you make them stop and the e.t  said no you cannot make them stop  
but if you become consciously aware  you will be handled in a different way  
you need to understand why you created this we  perceive we are supporting you in your drama  
why did you create this again pat was not pleased  with this uh answer she felt a wave of anger she  
felt like this e.t was just shoving this all back  at her and trying to make it her responsibility  
when she felt that no it was the ets  who were the ones who were abducting her   her it was their fault so the microphone went  around to other people in the audience who are  
asking all these questions and uh one  lady asked you get so much from us you  
come here and get specimens you take things  from our bodies what do we get from you  
and the e.t replied you get a jump start  in your growth that's what we give to you  
and other people in the audience  started asking about emotions   because the grays particularly the zetta reticula  are often known for not being very emotional  
and the gray said or the zetta reticula et  said our emotions are different than yours  
but we do have emotions because we accept  them as important to us at this point  
one of the people in the audience started talking  about love and universal love and pat became  
very angry and thought to herself they come  here and stick metal rods on people's asses  
and she's asking about love so she's very eager  to get the microphone and ask more questions and  
she did and she angrily asked them about this and  told them that they have no right to take people  
and the zeta reticular grey alien uh seemed  confused by this statement and said why  
do we experience resistance from you we are  curious we don't understand that pat said why  
why because you come and take me on your ship  against my will pat did not want to you know work  
out her issues in front of an audience she didn't  want people to know that she was being abducted   but this just slipped out and the  gray replied unemotionally and said  
the growth and the experiences that you are  receiving from this far outweigh the other things  
that you are experiencing there is not one person  in this room that would not willingly trade places  
with you again pat felt a little bit put  off by this answer uh and a few more people  
were able to ask questions but  at this point the session ended   so pat came away from all of that somewhat  dissatisfied and still feels like uh she's  
being violated and that the grey's had  no right to take her against her will  
a couple of weeks later she was able to contact  the channeler and asked her about this session  
and the channeler told her oh you were  the one who asked that question because uh  
she had just started channeling the gray ets  just a few weeks earlier and had never been out  
that long before so that yeah that was kind  of interesting uh meanwhile pat's experiences  
continued in 1994 the greys came again and  took her she had a period of missing time  
uh she still feels violated and is unsure about  this so-called soul agreement that she made  
and uh when the grades do appear in her  bedroom she still finds that somewhat scary  
and she says it's something that i come home to  and i have to deal with i still sleep with the  
lights on i have night lights all over my house  and the hall light is on every night there's still  
an element of fear it's not what's coming through  the front door it's what's coming through the wall  
so pat while she is still uh got  some fear involved with all this  
feels like she has become spiritually transformed  and that the et's have taught her an enormous  
amount of information about herself so  that is a good aspect to this as pat says  
the way i see life is completely different i'm not  the same person i'm a completely different person  
uh pat uh confronted her experiences head-on  she wanted to know everything that was going  
on with her which i think is the best way to  deal with these experiences if you have this  
strength and you're willing to do it and pat  decided she was going to seek out hypnosis  
and she found a researcher  by the name of barbara lamb  
who is very well known in the southern california  area for performing hypnotic regressions on  
experiencers and pat went under hypnosis and each  time she did it was pretty much the same thing  
what she recalled was being physically examined  and the examinations weren't particularly  
pleasant she always felt quite a bit of fear  associated with them so perhaps that's the reason  
why they were buried under hypnosis hard to  say but after a number of sessions where that's  
all that came up she stopped uh the hypnotic  sessions because there was nothing new uh she  
and uh that's where she's sort of at at this point  she still feels violated uh but i asked her about  
this and she said that she does not believe these  greys are evil or demonic or anything like that  
she feels that they are trying to help her because  they don't quite understand how much they scare  
her at times given the choice she says she would  continue to have encounters but again feels like  
the et's don't quite understand emotions or  people which is pretty much exactly what they  
said so what's interesting about pat's case is  she actually asked for an encounter and got it  
what i find also interesting is her experiences  began as very fearful i mean terrifying  
and as she confronted her experiences and  learned more about them and confronted them  
head on she was able to reduce her fear very much  and her encounters became completely transformed  
and were in fact very very spiritual and she  learned all kinds of spiritual information  
and that is a pattern i see in many cases  another very interesting aspect of her case is  
that she has had healing encounters she felt the  soothing yellow light she had that ball of light  
given to her which was also very nurturing very  soothing she enjoyed the purple rays of light  
and all of this shows that there is  a very strong spiritual and healing   aspect to all of these encounters uh like many  experiencers pat discovered she was leading a  
sort of a secret life a hidden life she had no  idea she was having encounters growing up but  
found out that yeah she was having encounters her  whole life but she had denied them suppressed them  
and explained them away but finally after  visiting this channeler and having fully conscious  
experiences that's when she woke up to the fact  that she this had been going on her whole life  
another interesting aspect of pat's experiences is  her mysterious pregnancy her she became pregnant  
under circumstances that were impossible i mean  there was no way she could have become pregnant  
she hadn't been intimate with anyone and yet  she was and she also lost the pregnancy and this  
is definitely a pattern we see in many cases  involving female experiencers many of them do  
later meet their hybrid children pat hasn't yet  had this experience at least not as at the time of  
the interview i did with her which was some years  ago so maybe she has but i don't know if she has  
at any rate i told pat's story in my book  extraterrestrial visitations so if you'd like to  
learn more about it you can read about it in that  book and i felt it was important to share her case  
because it shows many of the details i hear in  other encounters shows how strange ufo encounters  
can be and it shows how they can transform from  something very fearful very scary to something  
that's healing and very spiritual and that's why  i wanted to do this video i hope you've enjoyed it  
thanks once again for watching i really  appreciate it and until next time keep having fun
