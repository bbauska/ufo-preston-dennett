TEN EXTREME EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS
Jan 10, 2025

Summary:
Jan 10, 2025
The cutting edge of the UFO phenomenon are cases involving direct, firsthand, face-to-face contact with extraterrestrial humanoids. Unlike simple sightings, humanoid encounters allow us to closely interact with the UFO occupants themselves. Here are ten cases of extreme contact, cases of contact that are so close, so extensive, they cannot be denied or explained away. These are the kinds of cases that answer the many questions surrounding ET contact, such as who they are, where they come from and why they are here.

THE DISAPPOINTED ALIEN. On the night of October 18, 1954, Renzo Pugina returned home after a night at the movies. Walking up to his home in Parravicino, Italy, he was confronted by a four-foot-tall, olive-skinned entity wearing a jumpsuit and helmet. Afraid but curious, he approached the creature who struck him with a paralyzing beam of light. With great effort, Renzo broke free of the paralysis and chased the figure away.
 
THE MARTIAN STONE. Around midnight on November 17, 1954, Alberto Sanmartin Comes (a nurse) was taking a walk in Madrid, Spain, when he came upon a fair-skinned, angelic-looking man wearing a strange jumpsuit. The man walked up to a small craft landed nearby, quickly returned, and gaveAlberto a small stone covered with odd symbols. He then returned to his craft, which flew away. Alberto’s case generated national headlines as scientists analyzed the alien artifact.

THE ALIEN FROGMEN. One night in 1956, just after midnight, 13-year-old, Mr. E. Venebles woke up in his bedroom in Aveley, UK, as a brilliant light flooded his backyard. Looking out the window he saw a huge craft covered with colored lights. Through the portholes he saw several strange figures wearing “frogmen’s suits.” Then he saw a shadowy figure standing near his home. As he opened his window, the figure disappeared and the UFO flew off.

“I SAW A MAN.” On the morning of April 23, 1966, six-year-old Kim Baker was picking flowers outside her home in Bingham, Maine when a classic flying-saucer landed nearby. Kim was amazed to see a human-looking man smiling at her from one of the portholes. After a few moments, the craft took off. Kim rushed home and told her mother, who returned to the spot to find strange landing traces.

“A HUMAN-LIKE BEING WAS WATCHING ME.” On the night of March 25, 1972, Mr. B. of Soesterberg, the Netherlands was woken up by a strange noise. Looking outside, he saw a strange light by his car. He rushed outside and felt compelled to drive off into the night. Shortly later, he came upon a landed UFO and inside it, a human-like figure looking at him.

ALIENS IN IOWA. On June 6, 1972, Mr. Teig was working the cornfields of his farm in Dayton, Iowa when a silver egg-shaped craft landed nearby. Out stepped three short alien figures wearing metallic jumpsuits. Mr. Teig froze in amazement as the ETs explored his crops for the next 30 minutes then returned to their craft and departed. At that time, many farmers were finding strange burned circles in their fields.

A SENSATION OF BEING WATCHED. One night in April 1973, a man was driving near Grelsby, Finland when he came upon a huge flying saucer. He exited his car to take a closer look. He smelled a powerful order, and watched the craft move towards him. He could now see strange figures in the portholes. The craft moved away. Later, the area would later having many dramatic encounters.

“THIS DEEP SILENCE SURROUNDED US.” On the night of August 22, 1975, two young men drove their motorcycles near St Omer, France. Suddenly a bright light zoomed up behind them. They thought it was a car, but it disappeared, and moments later, they saw a landed UFO and humanoids next to the highway. An eerie silence fell reigned as the two humanoids rushed towards them. The men fled in a panic.

SHOCKED BY A UFO. On the night of October 12, 1977, Manoel Espirito Santo and four friends were outside his home in Santo Antonio do Taua, Brazil when a glowing light appeared, zoomed down and revealed itself to be a craft. Two figures stood inside looking down on the group. A beam of light flashed down and struck Manoel, immobilizing him. It then darted off. At the time, many people in the area were having similar encounters.

“WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU.” In 1979, as a young child in Lima, Peru, Renato Longato woke up one evening to find a beautiful woman wearing a metallic jumpsuit approach his bedside and instruct him to learn how to “use his mind.” Renato decided to develop his psychic abilities, and years later, in 1985, had a face-to-face encounter with a handsome ET approached him with a special message just for him.

These ten firsthand cases of ET contact are just the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of cases like these are on record, reaching back decades and coming from across the world. There are too many cases to deny, too much evidence. The truth is evident: we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs in the
Paranormal today I'm going to be talking about my favorite aspect of euphology
and that is of course humanoid encounters I find these not only endlessly fascinating but I think these
are the cases that lie at the very heart of the UFO phenomenon these are the cases that teach us the most these are
the cases that offer the most insight into who these guys are and why they are visiting our planet and I've chosen 10
cases from all over the world the title of this episode is 10 extreme
extraterrestrial encounters and I call it extreme because these are very close encounters pretty much all of them have
some pretty significant interaction with the witnesses these cases again come
from all over the world including England France Finland Italy the
Netherlands Spain a couple from South America including Brazil and Peru and a couple from the
United States including Iowa and Maine uh these also occur over a fairly
long period of time back to 1954 and all the way up to
1985 all different types of humanoids as well and quite a bit of evidence a good
number of these cases are multiple Witnesses but they're also supported by such evidence as as Landing
traces animal reactions physiological effects and more so I think you'll find
this a pretty compelling episode with a lot of interesting cases that you probably haven't heard before and the
first case I'd like to talk about today I call the disappointed alien this is a
really unusual case which occurred on October 18 1954 in Perino Italy it's a
amazing case involving physiological effects and Landing traces and a pretty interesting
interaction with a very unusual type of ET this case took place in the midst of
an incredible wave of encounters that was centered mostly in France but also spread to Italy and surrounding areas on
the evening of October 18 1954 several people in gel France
reported seeing a UFO landed in a field but it was in Perino in Italy where an
encounter occurred that would Garner International headlines in fact researcher Flavio vanetti calls it quote
one of the most authentic in Italian cestry now the sole witness was
37-year-old Renzo pugina on the evening of October 18
1954 he had gone to see a movie and was driving back to his his home in Perino
again in Northern Italy he had just reached his home when he saw this strange light in a dark Avenue which was
surrounded on both sides by two walls he was slightly puzzled but he didn't pay too much attention to it kind of
dismissed it as perhaps moonlight so he parked his car in his garage got out of
his car and began to walk up the stairs to his home his keys still in his hand
and this is when he was confronted by a Psy that would change his life forever he saw a strange entity three maybe 4
feet tall glowing with light he saw instantly that this was not human and as
he later told reporters he couldn't have been anything but a martian so remember
this is well before we went to the moon or had any idea about life in outer space many people assumed that
extraterrestrial life would be coming from Mars and that was kind of where he went to but he said this figure
its head was encased by a helmet with a transparent face mask he could see
through this mask he saw a human looking face with roughly Asian features he said
he said it was surprising cuz there was no apparent forehead that he could see this figure did have an olive complexion
and per Renzo looked quote as if it had been splashed with car motor oil the
upper half of its body from the waist upwards was covered by a glowing metallic skin tight jumpsuit with kind
of silvery scales but the lower part and this is strange where the legs would be
there was some kind of conical device you didn't see any legs the very bottom
of this cone where the point of the cone was was attached to a thin tube Renzo
estimates it was about four or 5T long and the other end was attached to a small disc like device which Renzo says
was quote as big as a bicycle wheel so the being and this disc floated few feet
above the ground next to a tree the entity's left side at this point was facing Renzo so he was shocked by this
site but also curious so he walked towards it to get a better look and within a few seconds the being's upper
torso rotated towards him and he set a kind of robotic motion its head and face
followed in a slightly slower way but Renzo could now see that this figure was holding what looked like a sort of
flashlight like device in its right hand this device was glowing faintly with a
light on one end Renzo wondered if it might be a gun of some kind but the
entity immediately pointed this device at Renzo sending out some kind of energy
beam of some kind it's not clear whether this was a visible light beam or not but
in any case Renzo became immediately immobilized paralyzed as he says at this
moment I was left left stiff and ground struck unable to move I got scared and
gripped hard my keys to the garage though he remained rooted to this spot
unable to move for just a few moments but with great effort he was able to move his fingers Clos his fist around
his keys and with further effort was able to partially Break Free of this paralysis as he says the contact with
the metal of his keys neutralized in part the fluid or energy to which I was
being submitted and felt myself free from it then I went towards the strange
creature screaming so he now had some anger at this being for shooting this Beam at him
he managed to take a few additional steps towards it but per Renzo this being stared at him with an expression
of disappointment or annoyance that's what it looked like to him he shouted
out at it Mars According to some sources this being GR wanted in response this is
not clear at any rate Renzo took another step and this is when the being began to
move floating upwards a few feet from the ground moving along side of the road
Renzo followed he says he could hear a faint humming noise coming from this being this being disappeared around a
corner in the road and Renzo now completely free of his paralysis ran
after it but it was gone nevertheless as you might imagine he was thoroughly
traumatized he rushed back into his house woke up his wife who had been asleep she said that he was so shocked
he was unable to even speak in fact he lay down in bed and trembled and shook
convulsively for the entire night he remained largely bedridden in fact for the next two days feeling shocked and
feverish so this really had a profound effect on him the Press heard about his
encounter and he was interviewed not only by journalists but by the Italian police and an investigation showed that
his gravel driveway had evidence of a mysterious odorless dry dark colored
oily substance wasn't oil they don't know what it was over the next few days
it increased in size apparently no samples were taken nor was it ever analyzed nevertheless after speaking
with Renzo the police were entirely convinced of the truth of his testimony they described him as a normal man with
no history of drinking or mental illness such an amazing case and really not an
isolated event because again this was during that huge wave of encounters
mostly in France but really in the surrounding areas as well so that's just
a tip of the iceberg with that one there were hundreds upon hundreds of very
similar cases can only imagine what it must be like to be that close to an ET
so I certainly understand the witness having a pretty profound reaction to his
experience now let's move to another case which did get a lot of publicity and attention but really is not that
well known I call this one the Martian Stone this one occurred on November 17
1954 near Madrid in Spain and is in fact one of the earliest humanoid encounters
reported in this country it's a really interesting case involving an apparent
ET artifact and quite extensive interaction with the witness and the
humanoid I think you'll find it a pretty compelling case the witness in this next case was employed as a nurse his name is
Alberto San Martin KZ age 37 and he was employed at this time as an assistant at
the Los Flores sanatorium in Madrid Spain was around midnight on the evening
of November 17 1954 Albert was suffering from a toothache and he often used this method
to help relieve his pain take his mind off of his toothache he would take a walk so that's what he would decided to
do he was taking a walk through the streets which at this time of night were
largely deserted and he was walking near the area around the cad
universitaria and he had decided to return when he noticed a strange figure standing motionless next to the railing
of the pente Los franceses bridge now he immediately noticed several things that
were just a little bit off this figure's clothes were not normal this immediately
caught Alberto's attention this figure was dressed in a weird sort of uniform as Alberto says like the overalls used
by aviators dark cray one piece and without openings so he was curious he
took a closer look and saw that this figure was in fact a very unusual looking gentleman just over 5 ft tall
but had very fine features very pale skin and unusually white straight hair
as Alberto says quote combed like a page boy you can see a sketch of the figure
here this man was smiling at him and he seemed almost quote Angelic in nature
and had an aura Alberto says of quote peace and goodness in fact the
expression on his face was one that quote radiated kindness Serenity and
firmness so although he was somewhat frightened Alberto felt himself curiously compelled to approach this man
and somewhat comforted by his appearance but he almost felt like it was almost against his own will and within moments
he stood directly in front of this unusual man the man gestured at elberto
giving him the impression or the message that he was not from Earth but from another world this point the man
suddenly turned quickly slid down the embankment next to this bridge and walked up to this small dark object
which was parked under the bridge Alberto could see it was about 9 ft wide
and looking at it he saw it was a metallic disc shaped craft of some kind
after just a few moments the man returned climbing easily back up this
embankment and approached Alberto again who still stood there speechless with
shock and to Alberto's amazement the man extended his hand and gave him an object
a small rectangular Stone of some kind about 5 in long maybe 1 and A2 in wide
and inscribed on the surface were nine curious symbols either engraved or embedded onto it this rock had a porous
surface was kind of pinkish in color somewhat similar to pmus in appearance
now without saying a word the man seemed to wave goodbye to Alberto and immediately returned to his craft under
the bridge and moments later this craft took off diagonally at very high speed
and disappeared off into the distance now according to One Source
much of this experience was at first shrouded in Amnesia only to be remembered later Alberto recalled
leaving for a walk and then finding himself in a parking lot with the stone in his hand the so this is not entirely
clear when he recalled this if it was immediate or if it was afterwards at any
rate he did recall it and Amazed by his encounter just a few months afterwards
he decided to go public he contacted the well-known news reporter arcadio vakero
who ended up publishing Alberto's account in the newspaper and actually obtained the quote Martian Stone as it
came to be called so it could be submitted for scientific analysis and it was this artifact was taken to the
minerology institute at Madrid to be studied by Professor Pedro Bayon Garcia
Campo menz you can see him here who determined that the stone was somewhat
similar to potassium permanganate the manganese atom has plus
seven oxidation state an ion with a tetrahedral structure that is a strong
oxidization agent and is widely used in fact in the medical field for cleaning wounds disinfecting it's sometimes used
for treating dermatitis but it wasn't as simple as that because according to the professor
the stone had some strange properties that he couldn't quite explain parts of it were soluble and other parts weren't
it did appear to be salty in nature but did not appear to have any actual salt in it so there was a bit of an enigma
here and some contradictions as to what exactly this thing was composed of and then of course there were the strange
symbols on its surface the stone was then given to Professor Don wakin Maria
daescu of the Madrid archaeological Museum who attempted to decipher these
symbols but he said he was unable to translate any of these symbols except for one which he thought might be a
representation of the planet Saturn in fact as the professor said there are
signs that remind us of the Greeks and the Egyptians but many of them are not unknown the clearest is the one that
represents the planet Saturn in geometric form the one with the sphere crossed by an oblique line there is
another with three lines that resembles the representation of water in ancient
Egypt another could be identified in Greek culture as the one that symbolizes
the boat of Sharon the one that transported the dead so this really became an enigma this Stone became the
subject of many years of study by many people and later in fact one Reser
claimed to have translated it to the following message uh according to this
researcher the message from these symbols is this we come from the high
Celestial spheres towards your divided World soon the Ark of heaven will Unite
with the Earthly light but to avoid The Clash there will be a period of preliminary contacts the union will be
happy you will lean on us and your cross will will be less heavy to Bear you will overcome your evil inclinations when we
all shelter under the same roof and you will finally no peace so I don't know
about that translation this is one person's translation but at any rate
following the analysis of this alleged ET artifact Alberto got it back from the
researchers and his story disappeared from the public for some years just a few years later in 1956
Alberto moved to Brazil and ended up writing a book about his experience called ambassador of the stars and in
this book he shared his story he had this quote Martian Stone analyzed again
and this new analysis revealed that the stone was composed of several elements
including corundum calite dehydrated magnesite aluminum carbonate calcium
silicate and silver and other Trace elements in any rate whatever this
object was composed of it was Alberto's case that helped prompt the founding of
Spain's first ethological study group called friends of visitors from space so
in that regard alone it's an important case unfortunately I wasn't able to read
the fulllength book written on this case but it certainly sounds quite
interesting I do wonder about this artifact it does appear to be unusual no
one's ever proven this case to be a hoax or anything but what the witness
actually experienced I do wonder about the translation of these symbols it's a
really unusual and fascinating case all around that I think does deserve to be more well known now let's move to the
next case which is again hardly publicized at all I I don't think a lot
of people know about this one I call this one the alien frogmen it's an unusual case for sure but it does
involve multiple Witnesses very close-up observation of a UFO and humanoids this
occurred at some point in 1956 the exact date isn't known but it
was in ay in the United Kingdom and really a very interesting case this case
comes from researcher Norman Oliver and was first published in the January February issue of the buor journal the
witness is known only as Mr E venables so we know his last name but not his
first he was 13 years old and was living at the time in his family's home on usk
Road in a which you can see here a in the UK this is just a short little road
maybe one block long and it was shortly after midnight one evening in
1956 when the 1 1-year-old witness was awakened by an orange yellow light
reflecting onto the corner ceiling of his bedroom now this window looked out
over a plowed field behind his home so the witness assumed there must be a fire
he got out of bed stood up on a stool and looked out the window and to his amazement only about 300 ft away 90 M or
so he saw a dark craft of some kind sitting on or right above the ground he
said this craft had rotating multicolored lights around the base and
on the top it had an extremely bright orange yellow light and it was this light that was Illuminating his bedroom
this light was revolving kind of like a police siren light he said below it
there was another bank of Lights which were rotating in the opposite direction and the base of the object was encircled
by what looked to him like orange Flames coming out of it coming out of sort of a
flange like base and these Flames were curling and bending downwards to the ground and sort of became more blue in
color but because of these Bright Lights it was hard for the witness to discern
the exact shape of this object but he could kind of make out a hemisphere on top a rim around the edge which gave the
whole thing an appearance very similar to a classic Flying Saucer he said but
even more amazing just just beneath the row of orange lights the witness could see a line of oval shaped windows and
Behind these windows he could see quote people in frog men's suits their Silhouettes were clearly
illuminated he said by an intense yellow glow coming from the interior of the
craft he counted three or four of them as they were walking around inside the
craft apparently busy doing something as he said quote going about their business
he could see that one of them was holding a strange instrument which appeared to be of quote considerable
size now although the witness could not see their features or how tall they were
he said they looked humanlike except that they had little or no hair also
very strange was that the craft was completely silent so staring at the this
amazing scene the witness became unnerved when he suddenly noticed a quote dark form which was watching all
of this from the backyard curiosity overcoming his caution the witness opened his bedroom
window which of course made a noise and as if in response the object Rose
upwards very quickly move off to the north at such high speed it appeared
only as a silver line a blur and at that same moment the dark figure in his
garden disappeared so this whole experience lasted no more more than 2 or 3 minutes
but interestingly it was later that same exact evening in the we morning hours
that the witness's mother went into the living room and looking out the window noticed a strange Red Orb approaching
her the house she said immediately this looked strange it moved closer and
closer getting larger and larger quite quickly until it appeared that it might actually hit the house so she became
frightened ran from the window to get her husband and when they returned to the window nothing strange was visible
it was gone there will admit that case is largely anecdotal but it's super
interesting because it wasn't only the 13-year-old boy who saw something strange that night both his parents also
confirmed the incident to some degree so it's a multiple witness case and that always raises the level of credibility
to a case and it's certainly a fascinating one can only imagine what
that UFO was doing in their backyard there but a lot of cases like it it's
easy to dismiss one case or 10 hey even a hundred you could dismiss but the fact
is there are thousands upon thousands of these cases I've covered many of them here on this channel and there's still
many many more we're still going strong lots of cases to cover but here is
another I call this one I saw a man this is a direct quote from the witness to
this case who is admittedly a young child but this case does involve Landing
trace evidence and there are other corroborating details to it in terms of
other sightings in the area but this one took place on April 23rd in 1966 in
Bingham Maine and it's an allaround super interesting case because of what
this witness describes red the humanoid she saw the interaction she had with
this humanoid and other details that make it interesting not only the landing traces but there were also animal
reactions as well this amazing case comes from researcher Richard Bona you
can see him here he published an article on this case in the Flying Saucer review
the primary witness is Kimberly Baker who at the time was six years old you
can see her here she and her two cousins Wendy and Bruce Higgins were outside in
a large Field South of the Higgins house located in Bingham Maine tiny little
town they were out there picking willows and they found a patch but discovered that the stems of these
plants were too hearty to pick easily so Wendy and Bruce went to their house to
get a pair of scissors leaving Kimberly alone now she was waiting for her
cousins to return and this is when she saw a large shiny saucer-shaped object
come from the direction of the kbec mill not too far away and land less than 100
ft from where she stood she said it was completely silent it was so unusual she
was startled and frightened and she froze in place and watched for a full minute as the object just sat there
doing nothing she said it was shiny silver like a toaster she said there was
the outline of a door and a rectangular window about 8 in high the craft had
three lights on it two steady red lights on either side and a flashing green light on top and looking at the window
Kim was amazed to see a human looking man inside the craft and as she watched
she said he seemed to stand up and she saw that he was dressed in a shiny white uniform of some kind which had what
looked like to her quote lots of black buttons on his chest
she said he wore a transparent quote bubble helmet on his head but seeing Kim
he took off his helmet and as Kim says he winked at me and smiled now when
later asked by researchers if she was afraid she replied at first I was but
not after he smiled at me he said something to me I don't know what it was I only saw his lips move so she couldn't
hear him but apparently he was trying to communicate unate with her and she continued to watch at this point she did
notice that the neighbor's husky dog was watching The Craft barking at it after
about 1 minute this craft took off moved over the roof of a neighbor's house and
was gone so alarmed she went home crossed the main Highway dividing the
town alone this was something she AB normally did not do and she went to her mother saying persistently Mommy Mommy I
saw something now her mother Joyce Baker was distracted because she had just
recently received the tragic news that an old school friend of hers had passed away but she did notice that her
daughter kept unusually close to her all that day as if wanting the security of
her presence and it wasn't until two days after the incident that Kim's
mother Joyce got the full story from her daughter and hearing it it caused her some concern she and a family friend Mr
Ali King accompanied Kim to The Landing site and they were amazed to see a 15 ft
diameter circle of compressed vegetation including some of the willows that
Kim and her cousins were hoping to pick they did also speak with the neighbor
who owned the dog that Kim had seen barking at the object and the neighbor confirmed that in fact her dog had been
barking on that Saturday afternoon at the time of Kim's sighting the neighbor
had not investigated to find out what was was upsetting her dog so although Kim was quite young her mother said that
she was not quote the imaginative type and Mr King made several attempts to
trip Kim up in her testimony by inserting false information at which point Kim would always correct him and
repeat the details of her sighting again now in re researcher Richard Bona
investigated the case he looked for any outstanding features in this town that might have attracted the UFO Bingham at
that time and still is a very small town situated along the kbec river but
according to Richard he did note that the Wyman Dam and Reservoir is located
only about 2.5 miles north of the landing site this is an important
geological feature this installation actually provides electricity to the
town of Bingham and several other towns situated along the kbec river
and also of interest is that Richard writes that quote UFOs have been
frequently reported over Wyman Lake the reservoir that is formed by the Wyman
Dam that certainly could be a factor because there are quite a few cases of UFOs hovering over hydroelectric
stations I do wonder about these many many cases of people seeing UFOs dropping down out of the sky Landing
right next to them ETS looking out at them or coming out of the craft in some of these cases they do sound to me very
deliberate intentional like the ETS are showing themselves on purpose because it
doesn't appear that in that particular case the ETS were coming out of the craft or doing anything there looks like
they just came down to show themselves to the witness I wish I could follow up on this case and talk to the witness
today to see if she had any other additional encounters but
could be a one-off That's Not Unusual I don't know but a really compelling case
and there's always another here's another Super interesting case with some really unusual details to it I call this
one a humanik being was watching me this occurred on March 25
1972 near the lutter's hide in the Netherlands this is actually a military
area which is I think sign ific to this case but judging from the witness's
description it doesn't sound like a reverse engineered craft or human beings piloting it you can certainly make up
your own minds about it but yeah some very very unusual details to this one
this next case was published in the November December 1972 issue of the Flying Saucer review only about 6 months
after it occurred the main witness is a businessman known only as Mr B he did
allow his picture to be taken here this case took place in the Netherlands in an
area known as the ler hiide this is near the city of sburg it was around 3:30 a.m. March 25
1972 when Mr B was awakened by a loud humming s sound coming into his home now
he briefly considered that perhaps his own stereo might be the cause but when
he checked it it was switched off so so he got up to investigate and this is when he noticed light coming from the
window at the front of his house and looking outside he saw a very strange
blazing light hovering right near his car right in front of it this light was
surrounded by a wall of what looked like fog maybe 12T long 6 feet high so he
quickly put on a jacket a pair of slippers grabbed his car keys and rushed out of the house to see if his car was
all right he did notice that all the cars except his which was wet all the
others were covered with frost so something had melted the frost on his car he quickly got into his car and
started the engine and this is when he noticed this weird light or fog seemed to surround him in fact he felt the car
bounce he said as if someone outside had jumped onto it seeing the light concentrating around the back of his car
he thought now that perhaps his car was on fire he admits he wasn't thinking completely clear clearly at this point
but as he says it was strange and frightening in my rearview mirror I saw
the light or fire phenomena at the back of my car and I thought that my car was on fire I panicked and accelerated I
drove out of the street Panic seized me I was terrified but things soon became even
more strange because Mr B felt almost as if he was compelled to drive and in fact
drove for about 7 miles miles and somewhat of a days at one point as he's driving down the road He Came Upon This
chain blocking the way and was amazed to see it suddenly rise up seemingly by
itself become taut and then suddenly snap so he stopped the car and he
realized that he was now at the ler hiy military range whereas he says normally
no people come here and this is when he saw a quote humanlike figure run past me
as Mr B says it had come from somewhere behind my car and seemed to be on its
way to a certain point right in front of me suddenly it vanished I got out and
now distinctly saw an enormous object in front of me around which was a greenish
glow to the left of me I saw an oval-shaped Bright Light which was moving among some trees towards the
object in front of me so Mr B was now about 30 to 4 40 ft from this large
object which he says was lens shaped and again I'll just let him describe what happened next and Mr B says it had some
sort of Windows from which issued the greenish light it was a peculiar diffuse
glow I also noticed that the object had a metallic appearance like aluminum I
did not see any welds or rivets the windows formed an integral part of the
surface there were no window frames or the light on top of the object were three thick
green beams of fluorescent like light like those of search lights shining
upwards into the sky behind one of the windows I saw a strange human-like being
who was looking at the greenish light phenomena and who seemed to perform certain actions so this object was
hovering just above the ground Mr B was both curious and afraid he wondered if
the figure he had seen run by his car was the one who was now in the object as
the figure had in fact run in that direction but Mr B's curiosity overcame
his fear and he began to walk towards the craft Mr B estimates that this object was about 120 ft long and maybe
12 ft high and as he says when I came closer there appeared right in front of
me behind the window a humanlike being that was watching me it made a gesture
with its right hand which seemed to indicate back back at the time I was at
a distance of some 3 or 4 M from the object and I looked into it the being
which I could see and describe very clearly seemed to be counting the fingers of its left hand the being or
creature was 5T and 5 in it was dressed in sort of a tight fitting overalls of a
peculiar material with a dull metallic glow this clothing had no seams and it
fitted tightly around the wrists around its waist it was wearing what seemed to be a belt at the right side of which
emerged some sort of tube running upwards behind its back and was attached
at the side of its head to a standup collar its head was oval-shaped with
slightly disproportionate almond shaped eyes the eyes seemed to look right
through you so this figure appeared to be smiling and behind it Mr B did see an instrument panel which was flashing
different colored lights he also noticed other quote humanlike beings which were
behind the other windows so shortly after this first figure gestured at Mr be to move back the craft jerked quickly
upwards it hovered momentarily floated 30 ft or so to the right then it
suddenly darted off at very high speed off into the distance emitting a strange
sound in seconds it was just a grayish spot with a glow around it in the distance so
Mr be now drove home to find his wife very anxious she asked him why he had rushed out of the house leaving the
front door wide open and where had he gone so he explained to her what
happened everyone was very puzzled he later returned to the spot and they
found an area of crushed grass Mr B says that at the time he did
not believe in UFOs in fact he had never given them any thought but as he says
quote I must confess to myself that I have seen something very strange which
upset me for two days afterwards so a pretty interesting case and it's not the
only one in this area because on February 17 1991 a military witness was on watch at
this base near sterber in this area when he and another Cadet saw a quote big
circle in the sky straight on top of us it had no shape but only Bright Lights
slowly rotating anti-clockwise the colors were in a liquid manner you can
see the sketch of it here the witness estimated that this object was anywhere from 90 to 150 ft in diameter totally
silent it did not appear to be any object he was familiar with and of course he was familiar with aircraft as
they watched this object r rotated faster and then suddenly shot off at quote incredible speed to the West both
Witnesses felt a short hard down blast of air I mean this object had moved more than 20 miles in less than a second he
said according to the witness this thing covered that distance from stationary in
something like10 seconds I know Aviation and have flying experience and I'm very technical
this kind of extreme acceler ation turns humans into liquid so following this
encounter both Witnesses did become quite ill they suffered from high fever and extreme vomiting and in fact as the
witness says the illness was so bad that it left me completely traumatized and
not able to speak about it for years and he kept quiet about it for a very long time until finally coming forward there
you go another UFO landing case in humanoids that's really hard to explain is something conventional or prosaic I
was leaning towards this being possibly a reverse engineered craft palleted by
humans but I don't know his description of the craft being perfectly smooth
having no rivets or seams or anything like this matches up with genuine UFO
accounts as does his description of the humanoid wearing a jumpsuit without any
seams in it the very large eyes the eyes that kind of stare right through you
some of the other details all Point towards this being a genuine extraterrestrial encounter I'm just
putting out the facts as we know them you can make up your own minds about it I think it's an important case and
here's another one which is super interesting I like this one because it's
actually one of a series of events which occurred in this area at that time I
call this one aliens in Iowa this occurred on June 6 1972 in Dayton Iowa
not Ohio Iowa and this is a very small town a farming town and this case
involves a very close up Landing of a UFO and of course humanoids but yeah a
lot of other Landings in this area and some really very compelling Landing
trace evidence that got a lot of attention from researchers at the time it was occurring this is an important
case I think this next case was investigated by Appo researchers
primarily Kevin Randall it did appear in Saga magazines 1973 UFO special issue in
the May June 1974 issue of the apro bulletin and in Jim and coral lorenzen's
book encounters with UFO occupants the main witness at the time
was known only as Mr T but we now know him to be either Edward Teague or mvin
faue he was 46 years old at the time of his encounter this was June 6th
1972 on that afternoon Mr Teague was working in the fields of his farm when a
flash of light in the sky caught his eye again this is in Dayton Iowa a tiny
little town so Mr Teague looked up and saw this silvery craft now he assumed it
was just an airplane in the distance and didn't pay too much attention to it but
it was moving towards him and very fast fast as a jet he said and it definitely
got his attention when suddenly it came swooping down right for him and when it
got close to him it slowed down rapidly and then very slowly came in for a
landing in his cornfield and Mr Teague could now see that this was a very unusual craft
egg-shaped about 15 to 20 ft tall as it sat down in his field three landing gear
quote grew out of the bottom this object landed only about 300 feet away the
winess could see it was casting a shadow on the ground so it was solid and as he watched a port or a door open on the
lower section and as the witness says quote some people came out and quote
they messed around in his field so these beings he says were four maybe 5T tall
and were wearing one piece metallic qu quote flying suits as the witness says a
port of some kind opened on the side near the bottom and some people got out
they moved around the corn for a while I don't think they even knew I was there
but they remained there for a while about 30 minutes during which time the witness did not attempt to get any
closer he said he could hardly believe what he was seeing but he did keep his eyes on the ship and the occupants the
entire time they were there after 30 minutes these beings returned
back into their craft which immediately took off with a quote slight Roar Mr
Teague did notice a Blue Flame come out of the bottom and the craft very quickly disappeared off into the distance but
looking where the object had landed this farmer Mr Teague did see that his crops
had been flattened and as it turns out at the time of this encounter numerous people
in the area had been finding strange circular marks of burned and crushed
vegetation in their fields this is in Story City and Boon both only about 30
mi from Dayton and in Goldfield 40 m away one of the more impressive cases
was at the farm of lesli Bud polling and in this case these circles
showed not only crushed and burned vegetation but strange holes some 22 in
deep with with dehydrated plants on the outside of the circle and strange gray
dust in the circle some of this dust was collected and analyzed and was showed to
be the same soil in the area only had been exposed to such intense heat that
all the organic matter had been burned out of it there was another family in
this area who said that they had seen UFOs so many times in fact one of the objects actually shot a beam of light
and one of their children they tried numerous times to take photos the photos would never come out they were always
blurred or blank on a few occasions they said beings did come out and everyone in
the family saw them as the farmer said they're about 4 feet tall and wear these
onepiece suits and their eyes look funny they bend around the sides of their
heads so there was definitely something going on in Dayton Iowa and the
surrounding areas at the time of this encounter 1972 can you imagine standing next to a
landed UFO in humanoids for a full half hour well I can't blame the witness for not approaching closer I wonder how I
would have reacted or how you guys how you would have reacted I mean it's easy to say oh you know I would have walked
up to them and said hi but I don't know once it's happening to you your reaction might be a little bit different very
hard to say for sure but certainly An important series of events because again this was not an isolated case there was
apparently quite a few Landings going on at that time and here is another case it's just
amazing there's case after case after case of these UFO Landings and humanoids
this case doesn't involve a landing but it's certainly a very close-up observation of an unconventional craft
with a humanoid looking out of it I call this one a sensation of being watched
this one occurred on one day in April of 1973 in Glebe this is in Finland it's
not an isolated event there was quite a few other cases going on in this
area uh so certainly while this is a single witness case there is corroboration to it but I like this case
because some of the details the witness describes are important and are details
that we hear again and again in other accounts such as the sensation of being watched I think you will find it
interesting certainly hope so this next case is quite brief but certainly interesting and it comes from researcher
Professor berti soderquist he's the muon representative for Sweden this case took
place in gresby Finland it's a very rural area the witness is anonymous the
exact time or date is not known but it occurred sometime in April of
1973 the witness was driving his car in the area when he says he saw an unidentified craft not too far from the
road it caught his attention so he immediately stopped his car and got out to get a better look and this craft
seemed to respond to his presence as it immediately moved closer moving in weird
sharp jerky motions with each jerky motion it would move about 30 ft closer
very quickly approaching to about 450 ft away from him and 150 ft above the
ground and it was a classic saucer according to the witness it was bowl-shaped quite large almost 100 ft in
diameter it was metallic it had flashing red and green lights on it illuminated
windows or Port holes situated around the circumference the craft itself was
surrounded by shimmering heat waves he also noticed a very unusual and Powerful
odor but most interesting of all was that the witness could see moving Shadows presumably the UFO occupants in
the port holes of this craft he also had quote the sensation of being watched so
he watched its craft for a good 10 minutes until it moved off and it was gone reportedly there is more
information to this case but this is all I was able to locate there have been other dramatic sightings in this area
it was just 3 and 1/2 years later at 4:15 p.m. on November 14
1976 that 10 people in separate areas all observed a UFO two of the witnesses
described this object as helmet shaped shiny silver about 20 ft wide yellow red
lights came from the lower portion and what looked like a plume of smoke was coming from the top they saw no markings
or Windows on the craft it quickly moved off but moments later was seen hovering
over a nearby power plant by other Witnesses and in fact it remained in sight for almost an hour moving up and
down maneuvering around sending down a beam of light into the woods below at least three times was during this time a
smaller sausage shaped craft appeared situated itself below the larger one
this one was white in the middle but at the ends was lit up orange blue and red
meanwhile other Witnesses were driving into this same area when they described a glowing object the size of a full moon
there was another farmer about 6 miles away who apparently saw the same thing as did numerous people in various
locations of the same area at least two other groups of Witnesses in the surrounding area also reported strange
aerial activity at that time so many witnesses that the local Air Force was
contacted but they had no explanations to offer for all of the this strange activity I've said it before but it
Bears repeating UFOs are being seen everywhere and of course that includes
extraterrestrials I do think that's what we're dealing with here that's my personal assessment but I'm just putting
out the facts again as we know them in an objective unbiased way you can make
up your own minds about all of this activity that's going on here but I think we can say with fair amount of
certainty that's something very profound is going on here now here's another case
which I call this deep silence surrounded us this occurred on August 22nd
1975 in St Omare France and I like this case because it
is a multiple witness case it's also interesting because of the description
by the witnesses of this profound profound silence that settled down
around them during this Encounter of course this is popularly known as the Oz
effect it's fairly commonly reported this is a good example of it it's one of the reasons I wanted to include this
case but yeah another very interesting case of a very closeup encounter with a
UFO in humanoids this case was investigated by Joel mayard and Jean
Marie beour and was published in the French magazine lumier Donan that means
lights in the night was 11:30 p.m. August 22nd
1975 as two young men they were aged 17 and 20 both students they have requested
anonymity they were making a bulk newspaper delivery between bulong and Li
in France they were able to earn a commission based on their newspaper deliveries so they were driving their
motorcycles when they found themselves being briefly followed by what they first assumed was a car but it was
following very closely behind them a mere 15 ft they said but suddenly it
disappeared which absolutely astonished them as there was nowhere for this car to disappear to but not thinking much
about it they continued their journey and it was only moments later after a turn in the road that they saw something
glowing in the field to their left about 600 to 900 ft away they said it was very
bright it looked very unusual so they both stopped their motorbikes to get a better look and what they saw amazed
them this was a craft they said it was egg-shaped completely smooth no windows
no Landing legs no protuberances of any kind was pretty small it was about 12 ft
long 4 and 1/2 ft high and was glowing with white yellow light on the rear
section they could see a blinking light but standing next to it on the right side were two glowing humanoid figures
standing about 10 ft away from this craft they said these figures were of normal human height and looked human as
far as they could tell but due to the brightness of the light they could really only see their
Silhouettes but both men did notice something else odd a profound silence
which had settled down upon them as one of the witnesses said I had the feeling
of being isolated from the rest of the world in this deep silence that surrounded
us what was even more strange was the way these figures were moving they
seemed to stagger in a strange way but moved with extreme speed and in fact
almost immediately these two figures began to move towards the witnesses as
one of the witnesses says they were moving at a dizzying speed as you can
imagine this frightened the two young men who quickly got on their motorcycles and drove off at high speed they had
gone just a few miles when suddenly through the rear view mirrors they saw this craft taking off at an angle and
disappearing off to the distance in mere seconds they were so frightened by this
encounter that neither of them was able to recall the exact place that they had seen this craft land but there was one
other odd detail that really puzzled both of them this craft was so small it
didn't even look like it could fit the two humanoids that they had scene standing next to it amazing right and
here's another case of a very small UFO that looks too small for the ETS to even
fit inside but as we know from the many reports of people who've been taken on boardcraft the interior of the UFO is
often or at least sometimes reported as being quite larger than it appears on
the outside this just goes to show how advanced ETS are they're able to utilize
I think time and space or have a greater understanding of it than certainly we do
uh so yeah very very Advanced I think that's one thing pretty much all researchers agree upon whoever these
guys are they're extremely Advanced now let's move to another case
which is very interesting undeniable because there was so much activity going
on at this time I call this one shocked by a UFO this witness did have some pretty
significant physiological reactions he had witnesses around him it
was by no means an isolated event because there were other sightings and
encounters on that same day also prior to it and following it this was on October 12
1977 in St Antonio detau Brazil a truly
important case I think that deserves to be more well known it was 11:30 p.m.
again on October 12 1977 when Manuel espiro Santo age2 was
hanging out with four of his friends in front of his house in s Antonio
detau his other friends were Julio Paulo DEA and
carito their attention was all suddenly drawn to a star-like object moving very
quickly across the sky from east to west as they watched it changing color from
bright yellow to red and within just a few moments it decreased its speed and
dropped down zigzagging slightly and rotating hovering about 60 ft away from
the group of young men moved in a very strange fashion they could now see that
this was in fact a strange craft of some kind it was cylindrical shaped vertical
much like a barrel coming out from the bottom was a smaller cylindrical device which was glowing with bright blue light
though the very bottom of it did have a red light coming out of it they also noticed a small pipe-like protrusion
extruding from the center of the midsection of this craft now this craft
was solid metallic except for a large square-shaped window which wrapped
around the entire front section of this Barrel shape this window was 3T 9 in
wide they estimate and about 4 and 1/2 ft High the craft glowed with this
yellow red light the entire surface of it except of course for this transparent window section which seemed to Glow with
the blue light coming from within it they could now hear a soft noise coming from this craft but it was mostly quiet
but the most interesting part of course was what was inside this craft or rather
who through this transparent Square window the witnesses could clearly see
two short human looking figures on the left side was a man and on the right a
woman there was a weird dividing section between them both these figures wore
weird looking goggles in front of their eyes some type of headgear the goggles
were different on the man than the woman but as the five witnesses stared at the craft in Wonder the man inside the left
section of the craft raised his hands and appeared to be adjusting his goggles
as if to better View the witnesses but the woman on the right appeared to be working some controls inside the craft
and this caused immediately a glowing beam of red light to come out of the small device affixed to the right
midsection of The Craft and it went right down towards the group of witnesses was apparently carefully aimed
because the beam of light hit Manuel directly he says he felt a strong jolt
like an electric shock which be began with his feet very quickly moved up to his head causing his entire body to
become rigid and paralyzed he felt weakness overcome him he felt his
Consciousness beginning to waver he said he felt almost entranced like he was about to faint now this beam remained on
him for quite a few moments and then it retracted and it began to move away
Manuel could now move his arms and legs but he says that a numbness continued to pervade his body for the next few
minutes so this craft rose slowly upwards tilted at an angle straightened up moved to the
right and turned onto its left side moved up some more turned completely upside down and then moved off and Away
into the distance it moved said the Witnesses in a wavy motion kind of like a leaf in the wind at various speeds
until it reached a certain altitude and then it just darted away at super high speed the Witnesses were later
interviewed by the braz Brazilian military who showed great interest in their case they would later release a
report detailing the case complete with the drawings you see here and at the
time many people in the area were seeing UFOs and many of these involved objects
that would send down beams of light at the witnesses just a few weeks earlier on September 22nd
1977 at 9:30 p.m. rundo Francisco Des shagas was walking to his home home in
this same area when he saw a bright yellow light coming down towards him he
became frightened and hid in a Grove of palm trees and he says that this object hovered overhead sending down blue beams
of light in various directions as if looking for him he said he could hear a hissing now noise coming from this
object which finally left but he says afterwards he felt a numbness in his
body which persisted for a few days on the very same day as Manuel's
encounter some hours earlier at 2: p.m. another gentleman by the name of Manuel
Matos deza was on the road pa16 at the 23 km Mark when he says he saw an object
hovering 60 ft overhead lighting up everything around it he actually pointed
his gun at it probably not a good idea because this object immediately struck him with a beam of red light which he
said felt like electricity and rendered him temporarily paralyzed until this
object moved off again on the same day same area immediately after Manuel's
encounter the first one a 40-year-old man also by coincidence named Manuel
Manuel dos Santos he was in his home when a beam of light came through the
roof rendered him temporarily paralyzed and he says he suffered from numbness
and soreness for a full week the next day October October 13 1977 Dona alzera
was in the backyard of her home in this same area again when a huge Light Came
60 ft overhead she ran into her house but was hit by this red beam of Light
which again caused this weird numbness in fact for 8 days she said she felt shaky lethargic and suffered from a
headache this was the time of the very well-known Kolar sightings in fact Dr
wed carvalo who worked at the nearby kera's hospital treated some of the
witnesses who said they were struck by these beams of light she herself had a sighting of an object hovering overhead
and she Drew what she saw and as you can see shows a remarkable similarity to the
object that was first seen by Manuel and his four friends on October 12 not only
an appearance but in movement so something was going on in that area at
that time come on that's totally undeniable when you have multiple cases
occurring on one day and in the time prior and following an incident with so
many witnesses and physiological reactions it's absolutely undeniable that something very profound is going on
here and I wonder about cases like these with this UFO coming down and just kind of showing itself off in an obvious
intentional purposeful deliberate way it appears very much like this is some sort of publicity campaign where the ETS are
coming with an agenda to Simply announce their presence I don't know just presenting the facts as we know them you
can again make up your own minds about it but it's case after case after case
and here is another one I really like this case it's quite positive it's very
extensive and really just a very compelling witness I find him to be
quite sincere and honest I call this one we have been watching you this is of course a direct quote
from the ETS involved in this case this actually involves two major incidents
the first occurring in 1979 when the witness was a young child and the second
occurring on March 15 1985 both of these were in Peru one in
Lima and one in a location in the foothills of the Andes known as Koka
chakra really interesting case this one the sole witness in this case is rato
longato you can see him here in 1979 he was just a young boy but even at that
age he had developed a strong interest in UFOs but was frustrated by it because
at that time there were very few Publications that featured this subject especially where he was located in Lima
Peru he would find himself lying in bed at night staying awake until 1: or 2 in the morning morning just looking out his
window and watching the Stars thinking about what was out there it became such a persistent habit that his mom would
have to chastise him go into his bedroom and Order him to go to sleep but he kept
doing it and it was one evening in 1979 he had gone to sleep like any other
night but woke up to an amazing sight as ronado says I opened my eyes and I saw
my bedroom glowing illuminated and the door opened by itself once the door
opened I sat down on my bed and I saw this woman wearing a metallic uniform
with a white belt now per Rado she was quite beautiful she had pale skin blonde
hair Christine green almond-shaped eyes and a tender smile Rado instantly felt
at complete peace with her he felt like she knew everything about him like he was an open book to her she walked up to
him stood very close placed her right hand on her forehead and began to speak
to him telepathically and she said what you need to do rato is use your mind she
repeated the phrase again what you need to do rato is use your mind and she
stepped even closer at this point Rado felt this overwhelming sense of love
coming from her and she repeated this phrase a third time what you need to do
Rado is is use your mind this point ronado found himself
closing his eyes and the next thing he knew it was mourning but he knew it was a real experience this was not a dream
it completely changed his life as he says since that day I was just really
desperate to find out information about how to use my mind so as a young man he
began to visit various groups and seek out teachers he tried maharash Yogi the
Hari krishnas finally he heard a lecture from Jose Silva and learned about his
method called the Silva mind control method which is all about psychic
development and sure enough Fado began having ESP experiences remote viewing he
started to see images of the Peruvian Andes mountains that would pervade his mind over and over again a very specific
scene and he began to have a strong feeling that something was going to happen he started experiencing ing a lot
of coincidences and synchronicities involving the Peruvian Andes so he knew
there was something to this finally he decided to take action it was around 11:00 a.m. on March 15 1985 that he
found himself in a place called Koka Shakra this is in chosa Peru he
immediately recognized this scene once he got there from the Visions he had been seeing in his head so he stayed a
while hoping something would happen but after half an hour waiting for something
to happen nothing did so he decided to leave and as soon as he made that
decision this is when his experience began as Rado says I saw in the distance
in front of me this glowing Arc of energy a shivering light pulsing and it
became stronger the wind stopped blowing the birds stopped singing the leaves the
branches everything stopped for a moment I felt like I was inside a bubble time
seemed to stand still in that moment a humanlike being popped out of the light
I was in shock I almost fainted Rado realized that this being was not a
normal human and he became absolutely overwhelmed with fear wondering if he
was about to be taken abducted would they be friendly he says this being was
very tall about 6' 3 in very athletic strong broad shoulders very long arms
reddish hair and was wearing a gray metallic silver uniform so this being
walked towards Rado almost seeming to Glide or float towards him ronal started
to tremble and shake in fear but the man raised his left hand and said I will not
hurt you relax at this point ronado could feel the man's Aura of friendliness and he
immediately calmed down the man said don't worry I came here to give you a
message in fact the man gave Rado a name and said this is your name this is like
a mantra for you your personal Mantra Rado has kept the secret but this man
told him we are here to contact you in order to give you this information this
mantra for you we have been observing you since the day you were born and we
want you to continue what you're doing so Rano thought to himself you know what
have I been doing but he had the impression it was the meditation he had been doing he had purified his diet was
eating no meat not smoking or drinking any alcohol again he was training very
hard to work on his psychic abilities so he believes this is what the being was
talking about and this being continued to talk and said you have to continue
what you're doing we're going to be in touch with you and you have to practice with this new name that you have the
being said that he had to practice the pronunciation and when he finally got it right rato would feel this energy coming
through his solar plexus this whole meeting lasted a good 10 minutes and then this being raised
his hand gave his name told Rado where he was coming from and said we're going
to be in contact with you he then walked backwards or floated backwards became
swallowed back into the shimmering light and disappeared instantly rato could feel
the wind blowing the birds started chirping again the water running and then as Rado says I saw this metallic
disc make a 45° angle and it disappeared he saw it rise up from behind a nearby
mountain or Hill and it was gone in a mere seconds but it was the after effects of
this experience that affected Rado profoundly he found it very hard to go on with his day-to-day life he later
became very active in the UFO Community speaking publicly about his experiences
connecting with many major researchers and in fact wrote some books about UFOs
and related subjects so yeah you can tell that that witness was very deeply
and profoundly affected by his encounters to the point where this subject really became a big part of his
life and he has lectured all across the world has met a lot of leading
researchers and contacts and had a profound effect on this field all
stemming from his two major encounters with ETS it's amazing how many people
are having these kinds of experiences it's not just few thousand uh I think
it's probably closer to the millions and I know there are a lot of researchers
who would absolutely concur with that this is not as rare as a lot of people
might think I think Millions upon Millions upon millions of people are having these encounters I've mentioned
this before but Jay alen heinik was once quoted as saying one in 40 people have been on board a UFO and of course
there's the Roper organization which did a poll in 1991 that found about 1 in 50
people show the markers of being a contacte so the point is this is far more common than most people realize
there are a lot of cases this is important information I think this is a subject that really has the potential to
change the world I think all of humanity deserves to know that we are not alone
in this universe I can't imagine if we were to me that would be far more frightening than not being alone I'm
actually very comforted by these cases I know some people do have a lot of trauma
and fear surrounding their encounters but I think if you take a good hard long
deep objective look at the totality of cases you'll find it's quite encouraging
and really good news for Humanity that's certainly my assessment but again I
encourage everyone to research this themselves do the work ask the hard
questions and that's how I'm going to close this episode for today thank you again for watching you guys I truly
appreciate it these 10 humanid encounters again just the tip of the iceberg have so much to teach us so
until next time again keep asking those hard questions keep searching for answers most important of all it's why
we're here keep having fun bye for now and I will see you on the next episode
