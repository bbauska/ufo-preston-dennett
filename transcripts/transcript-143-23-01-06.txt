INTERVIEW WITH A FULLY CONSCIOUS UFO CONTACTEE PART V: GATHERING THE CHILDREN
Jan 6, 2023

Summary:
Jan 6, 2023
It goes by many names. Some call the experience UFO abduction. Others call it a Close Encounter of the Third Kind. Some prefer to call it Contact, or an Onboard UFO Experience. Whatever term you prefer, the truth is that many people are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft. In fact, some researchers believe that millions of people have had this experience.
Dolly Safran has been a fully conscious UFO contactee her whole life. Beginning at age fourteen, she has been taken onboard hundreds (if not thousands) of times. She has spent days, weeks, and sometimes months with the ETs, learning from them, working with them, flying the craft, interacting with various ET types, traveling to other star systems and more.

In this interview (Part Five of a series) Dolly describes the very controversial aspect of UFO encounters that many people call abductions. She doesn’t call them that. And neither do the ETs. The extraterrestrials are contacting people and bringing them onboard, but they call this process, “Gathering the Children.”

What is the reason for people being taken onboard? Why are the ETs contacting so many people? Is it for our benefit or theirs? Dolly answers these questions and more, and not from speculation, but from firsthand experience of her many interactions with them.

The reasons, says Dolly, are many. The ETs are here to heal, to teach, to guide, to warn…to help enlighten people to their own psychic abilities. There is a lot of fear and disinformation surrounding the UFO contact experience. Many people experience terror and trauma and believe they are being taken against their will. But after living and working with the ETs for many years, Dolly knows that this is not what is actually happening. The ETs are not here to scare people or harm them. They are here to help. Dolly has been onboard the ET craft hundreds of times when people are picked up for medical exams, consultations, guidance, healings and more. She has not only experienced this herself, she has watched it happen to countless other people. She has been onboard and counseled others during their own close encounters.
 
While some may perceive the experience as scary and negative, the truth is far different. Dolly shares her own experiences with people being taken onboard and healed, taught, guided, awakened to their own contacts. Dolly’s story of UFO contact is one of the most extensive on record. Her case is well-documented with multiple supporting corroborative witnesses, medical records that show her own healings (and implants,) impressive photographic and video evidence and much more. After watching this video, you will see that contact, despite all the fear and misinformation, is in fact a positive experience, one that is for the betterment of all humanity.

For those who want to know more, Dolly’s lifelong experiences (recalled fully consciously and without the use of hypnosis) are presented in the book, “Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure.” A Number One Amazon UFO bestseller. Now available!

Introduction
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
got a very special episode for you today I'm bringing back Dolly saffron she's of course the 
subject of my book symmetry A true UFO Adventure which is all about her lifelong experiences with 
extraterrestrials and this is part of a series of interviews I've done with her covering the book 
and other experiences that were not covered in the book and today will be part five I'm calling 
this episode interview with a fully conscious UFO contactee part five Gathering the children 
and by this I mean we're going to talk about on-board UFO experiences I think this is the 
most extensive type of UFO encounter this is where we really get the answers about the agenda behind 
ET contact don't really like that word agenda the goal perhaps the reasons uh and Dolly has a lot to 
say about this this is one of the main reasons she decided to come forward because of the UFO 
contact experience is being badly misrepresented there's a lot of fears surrounding this subject 
which is not warranted they're not here to hurt us I've long ago come to that conclusion and the 
onboard experience is just so darn fascinating this is my favorite aspect of UFO encounters 
and boy does Dolly have a lot of them and uh this is what we're going to be talking about Gathering 
the children is what the ETS call it so first I'd like to welcome you Dolly back on the show 
thanks so much for being here you're welcome thank you and then fun this is a good thing to 
do and thank you for allowing me to do it ah my pleasure and honor too so this is exciting I've 
got a list of questions and I'd love to cover yeah something really poignant and more interesting and 
unusual experiences we described in the book and uh of course you're free to talk about whatever 
I always learn something new when I interview you uh your experiences are so fascinating and 
uh really confirm a lot of what I've learned from other people so let's just get started with the 
root of it this is a controversial aspect of UFO encounters I don't think it should be it's clear 
that people have been take you know are being taken on board uh invited on board is how many 
people put it you won't use the term abduction it's not accurate and I agree with you on that 
so this is my first question because this comes up so often when I interview people 
is being taken on board a voluntary experience do people choose to work with the ETS and go on board 
or are they quote I have to use this term but people keep telling me kidnapped are they abducted 
against their will um so yeah this is something I'd really like just to get some clarification 
on and you know have you explain as someone who is a fully conscious conductee doesn't 
have fear knows what's going on and uh I've had a lot of experiences with onboard encounters not 
only yours but seeing other people so yeah is this voluntary or are people being kidnapped 
Are people being kidnapped
in every sense of the word we are voluntarily uh going with them 
um there is a very expressed reason why it's complicated and it's generational 
ETS have worked with Humanity since the beginning of our time and their time 
uh here we've had 12 000 years this iteration 12 000 before that twelve thousand twelve thousand 
twelve thousand for two hundred and eighty thousand years or million years actually on this planet and then before that on another uh you are genetically conscious of them whether 
you realize it or not every generation before us has had contact and all of that is in us to know 
we are not fully conscious of it in this iteration because it has been pushed away from our ability 
to remember we have been uh enslaved somewhat away from our knowledge and our abilities we 
have been told that they don't exist we've been told that we're crazy for being psychic we've 
been told that we're uh super Supernatural is not natural they've pretty much turned us into
agreeable followers and not doers on our own behind that governments have yeah yes behind that 
your Consciousness which is who you really are and can express itself to your physical mind is 
not able to alleviate your fear because it can't you your physical mind can't hear it thinking all 
the time that's why their message we need you to wake up we need you to know who you really are we need you to know how to hear the truth and hear and understand what's really going on 
where education systems everything now imagine a human being right now who's had no uh memory 
of it and have has been expressly told this is wrong thinking suddenly wake up and they have an 
ET in the room with them they will mentally start going into shock that's my experience seeing it happen in real time uh they shut down they mentally wall themselves in in pure fear 
until we get them on board and we show them that they've done this before and we show them that 
there's nothing to fear we show them what the reasons are why they're there and what's really 
going on it's still up to them whether they want to consciously remember that memory or 
treat it as if it's a dream we Obe every night and and when we're asleep everybody does that's 
a natural Talent of all Humanity but your dreams are dreamlike to you and you don't 
remember the obes as if it's really happening to you and you you shrouded your physical mind can't 
comprehend it so it shrouds it in mystery and and exotic things when it's not true 
um it we self-delude really easily and a lot of people choose to stay in that delusional pair 
I really really want to come to the conscious control of it because if they do it Alters their 
life in a drastic unprecedented way it singles them out it puts them at odds with Humanity 
their families their friends everything it makes their life hard to live and E.T is very aware of 
this and will allow them to keep it in the dream state in their mind they choose that they don't 
hypnotize us we do it to ourselves if you want to know what um split personalities are this is a 
real good example of it we dream personality walk away from the truth of what's actually happening 
um I see this is somewhat okay but I mostly see it as a waste of our time and ETS it makes 
me a little upset a little bit sad for everybody because the truth is way better than the fiction 
or the dream the truth of who they are and who we are to them with them is way more expansive and 
more productive to us as a people than anything else and well that's the thing behind missing 
time then is because it's a sort of a agreement between both parties involved correct exactly 
it's a Cooperative effort to give you relief from that which is too much for you to handle right now 
a lot of people choose to be woken up by um it's sort of like a trigger you know a hypnotist will 
tell you this is going to happen in the future when it does this memory is going to come back to you you can be allowed to do that you can allow a situation to wake you up Suddenly and 
a lot of people are under that trigger because we have things coming at us and everybody pretty 
much knows it under their skin most people are walking the streets today knowing that we're facing something immense they don't know why they know it but they do and when a few things start 
to happen if they're going to wake up it's going to be a big deal is that fear is the real problem 
Fear is the real problem
behind people interpreting this is a negative involuntary experience trigger for missing time 
wow it's ultimately always coming down to simple fear because most of the people I've talked to 
who had repeated onboard experiences at some point realize okay I did in fact agree to this 
this is for my benefit right and they start to remember and start to get all the good stuff right 
I've actually had people uh that I've watched on board who uh decide at that point after multiple 
contacts decide okay this is it I'm going to start to remember now and how do we do this how am I 
going to do this safely how am I going to mentally take this and they walk them through it and they 
begin that process of giving them the ability or helping them that's why they suddenly think that 
they're psychic and that ET did it no they did not you're psychic on your own you don't need any help 
doing that but all the blocks that are there for you not to be psychic are suddenly going 
to start being removed from you in other words but you're doing it to yourself no hypnosis test has 
any control like that over you and neither does ET we control ourselves we're autonomous beings 
so we decide how we're going to wake up that's how that process goes contact experience sort of 
provides one an opportunity or facilitates you facilitates exactly they give you they give you 
the opportunity you take it and then they offer you support that's what they do all right yeah 
Why are people taken on board
this is what I love about your um experiences is because you've watched this happen so many times 
when you're there when people are being taken on board this is one of the things you do with them 
so this is another thing I want to bring up is because people say you know why are they taking 
us on board and I hear people's you know saying without any real evidence um this is medical 
experimentation and I don't have evidence of that I do think that often the purpose is to be healed 
uh I think there's multiple reasons people are taken on board but I thought it would be interesting if we could go over some of the main purposes behind the onboard experience 
when the reason that you're contacted and brought on board of craft is to check up on you they want 
to know how you are doing they want to take to categorize the state of your health and 
they monitor it a lot of people are monitored and they see how well you're doing now as opposed to that they have a baseline on everybody the number one reason is is that we're taking heavy loads of 
gamma radiation our DNA is being attacked and that is causing us all kinds of physical and mental ailments and they're trying to hold up the human genome and help us survive what's coming and 
for us to be totally magnetically erased before it even occurs is a bad thing so they're helping us 
that's the number one reason uh they understand that we have karmic reasons for being here that 
each life is important and that life has the right or the purpose of learning what it needs 
to learn so they don't go past that but if you have something that they can take care of right now that will help you keep your purpose going in the way that it's meant to go they do heal and 
they they have they have always endeavored to do so some people realize they're being healed some 
people don't some people are totally aware of it it just depends on your circumstances with them 
The onboard experience
all right yeah that's the conclusion I've come to the onboard experience in a nutshell is 
poor healing it's for guiding it's for teaching it's for informing it's for waking people up to 
themselves their own abilities their own autonomy their immortality uh this sort of 
thing so yeah it's very nice to hear you say that uh and what I'd like to do actually is provide 
specific examples so people can see this in action and I've got a few examples here that 
we did Cover in the book it can be really fun and because some of these are so poignant I 
mean just brought tears to to my eyes when uh you talked about some of these experiences you've had 
uh with people uh before we get to that one other thing is you know how people 
react when they're taken on board you've seen it all people reacting in utter fear Terror vomiting 
uh soiling themselves attacking the ETS where some are joyful and celebrate and like it would 
be interesting I think if you could talk about how people react among you know the spell curve 
with some kids being very fear you know happy other people being fearful other people you 
know how do people react when they when they are pulled on board uh okay it well it does run the 
gamut in other words from zero to a thousand children are the least likely to freak out 
um and I say that uh it's not a generalization 99.99 of the time children go hey this is cool
um they're loving little creatures and they're so wide open uh every blue moon I will see one 
come on board who's newly coming on board first time and they go solidly still they 
freeze and they won't move and they just look around you know their eyes are moving but they're not doing anything until you make physical and emotional contact with them and 
when they realize that you're not there to hurt them that's when they loosen up 
ET does prefer to bring mommies on board with the children if that's happening because mommies 
are the barometer of their emotional expression they follow her or daddy even in some instances 
or Grandpa or Grandma so they are brought with them if mommy's acting badly baby's Gonna Act 
badly so they mommy's been a repeater so she's not going to go crazy and the kid's gonna go 
hey okay and it's better than the human doctor I've seen this both ways um in my own instance 
as a child I had mama and Mama helped me to understand what was going on and I was like 
you know um but I've seen others come forward yeah your your main liaison right right I have 
Adults on board
that Advantage yes they do like to bring mommies and Daddy's homeboy uh adults um it just depends 
um men and women who are married or together are Partners or whatever or anybody who's a 
partner for that matter uh are generally separated they brought on different times sometimes they're together but most of the time it's one or the other take your pick and 
um that's so that they're isolated from the reaction of the other one because adults can react even worse to Children sometimes and that's what they're looking not to have happen on board 
they're the big ones and they can do the most damage to the ETS who are fragile and it's all get 
out the layout as usually hurt them uh the taller Grays are um capable of getting away from you 
rapidly in other words you can't really hurt one uh they have the ability to suspend you they can 
levitate you I mean they can do a lot of things to stop your physical uh advances on them uh children 
they won't do that to though that is not something that's no they go nowhere near that at all 
I have seen some older people react and fear but most of the time they're like I knew it I knew it 
but I knew it I get that a lot I knew I knew you were there and it's like oh wow okay yeah you did 
some older people actually remember a lifetime of experience all at one time they'd go 
I have these dreams they're real aren't they we're like Yep they're Dreams they're real some of them don't want to leave I get that a lot lately I'm not going back and that tells me a lot 
about the state of this planet right now a lot of people when they go they're like not leaving 
and it's hard to tell them you have to this is your life you know we're only helping you out 
because you need help but you got to go back you got to finish this well you said something once which really resonated with me because I've heard before people who have these experiences 
Two separate lives
talk about how they live two separate lives to a certain extent yes so I can only imagine 
how it must be to you know have that culture shock of finding yourself on board and like wow
I'm more of an um it's amazing when I'm with them that's my life and when I'm here I become I feel 
more like a Gulliver and Gulliver's Travelers you know I'm I'm seeing things that I don't 
quite understand sometimes it's a little difficult for me but I'm here because I'm a human being and 
these are experiences that I'm having and I have to fully participate in them you know enjoying it 
um it makes it difficult because sometimes I don't want to I back up and go uh you know and not I'll 
hide well they don't cost introductions and they they call it they don't call this you know the 
ETS from their perspective they don't call the experience an abduction no we're Gathering the 
children that's how they think about it it's their concept we are their children literally 
we are their children all of us and when when we go out on uh you would call it a mission 
it's not a mission we're going out uh um it's not even an Excursion they have a word for it and it 
literally comes out to be uh we're Gathering the children or it's time we gotta go get them 
you know it's time to check up uh that's how they think about us uh strangely and it doesn't matter 
who you are good bad or indifferent they're going to gather their children and you are and that's what happens and everybody's given the same opportunity nobody's discounted they it is 
all of us now you can do every now and then one of somebody will impress them to the point they 
want to go okay we're going to leave you alone now okay have it your way and go right ahead and 
they will they won't bother you anymore but you have to really convince them of that and some do 
um but where are their children they're not going to leave us alone existence to them is everything we're we don't come here for any other reason other than to advance 
to learn to explore we're all together in Source we're all we all know each other in source and how 
could you act any differently here that's how they feel about it and the fact that most everybody on 
this particular Planet at this particular time are having a hard time with this doesn't matter to them they still love us and they still want to help us period yeah well I think that's you know 
Dont be afraid
I mean it's obvious to me having talked to so many people and the fact that it's so consistent that 
when they do appear to someone which I have no fear don't be afraid no harm will come to you 
you know you will not be harmed this is what they always tell people 
and so I think that's an important point because certainly that's not what a criminal says or a kidnapper and most again most people I've talked to come to that conclusion and
not get in there fighting it the whole way if you're gonna fight it if you're gonna say no I don't want to go they won't even take you you stay home and if you make that decision that's your 
decision they won't take you you go willingly with God when they show up to pick you up 
um even me I mean when I saw that beam of light at first I had a negative reaction to it okay 
I'm trying to jump and hide but when I realized what was really going on and I was seeing what 
was happening I realized okay this is not too bad I threw up because I was so emotional about 
it I puked okay I had a visceral reaction to it but I never had a fearful one in other words I 
wasn't Oh no you're bad people I want to get in no that's not what it was I was trying to evaluate my situation and this was totally cool and I was like I have to realize that 
this is real that's what was going through my mind this is really real you know and 
I finally came to it I finally went okay I'm good I'm good with this and I meant to remember at that 
point I was no way you were going to stop me it was too awesome a situation it was the best one I 
could possibly be in and I'm hoping that everybody gets that I'm hoping that everybody wants to do 
the work to remember who they are to remember that they have abilities and to use them and to wake 
up to it and that's my fondest deepest open way she'll eat these as well that's why I wanted to do 
Onboard experiences
this episode I just recently interviewed a man who was had an onboard experience at age 14 with his 
mom they were on board together she was reacting quite violently cursing at the ETS like don't you 
hurt my son well yeah actually you know he's come to the conclusion now that they were healing him 
a problem with his stomach and so he was laying there in sheer Terror at the same time they're 
saying what's wrong child uh you know you're not going to be harmed or almost done and he's and 
comfort him and he realized oh they're not here to hurt me and yeah it's just really interesting to 
me that people go through that process of trying to yeah through their fear because fears will 
absolutely distort your perception of what's going on exactly yes all right so let's talk about some 
of these really cool uh specific incidents where this is all Illustrated I think we did talk about 
in the book which was really poignant and touching uh was about a lady who was in a house fire and 
was badly burned and they pulled her on board do you remember that one yes um she was somebody that 
we visited um probably about every eight months and uh she was living royally out in the Midwest 
and when we came in uh we realized that our house had been burning and um nobody knew it nobody saw 
the fire nobody saw the smoke for whatever reason I don't know maybe it was smoldering rain around it that much I don't remember the topography all I know is there was a burnt house in front of us 
and she was broadly badly burned and she was going to die and we brought her up and 
the decision was made that she was savable and we were going to do it and she was taken to be saved 
um I didn't I didn't uh wasn't able to track her through that entire process because I 
had other things that were going on I fly The Craft um later in that time period that I was 
with them I kept asking how is she lie is she okay she okay and they would say she's coming 
coming it was about a month month and a half where I was given the word that she was up she 
was awake and she was able to communicate again and I wanted to see her I had to see her and um
when I did I expected to see scarves bad scars um unless I know what it looks like 
when you've been burned and she was she looked good she did a beautiful job and 
she was just a wonderful human being and she remembered what happened she was a smoker 
and I guess she fell asleep with a cigarette and it burned her in the room and I don't know how she 
survived that I don't know why the whole house caught as fast as it did I just know that she somehow survived it she was on a ground floor she was in an outside room you know a corner room and 
that the air coming in didn't feed the fire to her it fed the fire to the rest of the house quickly 
uh it gave her more oxygen that way I think that's how she survived it 
well they were counseling her because they could not take her back under these circumstances it 
was believed that she burned to ashes with the house and um she was being counseled because she 
had to come to the fact that she was not going back and I I worried for her that it would be 
too hard for her to accept and when I saw her I couldn't believe what I was seeing because she 
not only took it really really well she was kind of happy because she realized that what she went 
through bought her another life and bought her a chance to go on and she should have thought she 
would have thought because we hadn't shown up she would have thought she was in the process of going 
um she was very happy about it and she was trying to figure out where she wanted to go and she was 
really surprised to see me because I'm human and I'm a hybrid but I'm I'm you know look at me I'm 
human and uh we had a good old time together we talked and talked and talked and I kept coming 
to see her because it was a little while before any decisions were made about where she was going to go when I saw her the last when the decisions were made what was going to happen for her um I 
got to sit with her for five minutes and we hugged and she said thank you she said your eyes saw me 
first and I did I starved first and um she said I walk because of you and I I was shocked and I said 
you don't have to be grateful to me you're willed to live outshined anything else you would not be here if it not or not for your will to survive what you went through and I barely understood 
what I was saying when I said it I know it now but it's true okay and that's the most pointed thing about this whole thing is she saved herself she had a will to live she had a will to go through 
what she needed to go through and she trusted them to save her and they did and she trusted 
them to help her move on with her existence and to go somewhere where she could carry that out 
and I've never forgotten it my entire life it is always with me always will be with me really cool 
Homeless people
well it's very touching it's funny so that reminds me of you know another case that you talked about 
because most people you know don't go with them but though this does happen right and yes yes 
about them picking up homeless people at times on who are you know basically not going to survive 
because this planet is not caring for them so can you talk a little bit about a case like that or 
two um people are an interesting solution to life when you've been dealt blow after blow 
after blow and had so much taken away from you you pretty much sit on the ground and wait to go 
you still have to eat you still have to sleep you still have to do the things that you need to do to be alive while you're here but they pretty much buried themself in ashes I think 
job describes this the best sackcloth and Ashes I've had it all taken care away from 
me and I'm just sitting here waiting to go I'm waiting on the Lord you know um
they see this happening and it's a travesty in their minds because nobody around them cares 
enough about them or they think they do but they don't to pick them up and dust them off and give 
them a new start to give them something to start with sometimes they're so far gone they'll never 
do it some do BT can hear you think they know your heart they know what's going on with you mentally 
and they will pick one up well they pick all of them up they're always checking on everybody but every now and then one will come up he don't want some bath that wants to sit and talk that doesn't 
have any regrets and have no recriminations they don't hate anybody they love everybody 
despite their problems and they really really are interested in everything that's going on and 
that's the key they look for that your Humanity hasn't been lost in your condition it's still 
with you and they will give you opportunities at that point and they will tell you we can give you 
something better than this you want to go and they'll work with you till you can achieve it with them and there's a place for you to go on standby to see if you can fulfill what they're 
hoping you're going to fulfill so you can go and yes some homeless people just go poof they 
disappear to us and nobody knows what happened to them well et's taking them because they wanted to 
go with them they gave them opportunity uh you know imagine ugh you know I do have other cases 
Disasters
of people who are like involved in disasters and wouldn't or couldn't be missed because like the 
response of a volcano the Nevada Del Ruiz volcano buried some 21 000 people right feet of mud 
contact the I talked to was involved in a rescue of some of these people yeah they're not being brought back now people aren't missed they're rejected anyway so 
you can see disasters on this planet but that's occurred in this iteration yes um they've always done that it's always been a given the choice you want to go let's go don't 
want to stay here come with us and a lot of people will say yes some of those people actually said no 
I guarantee you that whoever was helping them go up ship saw one or two walk away from it no 
you know that has happened uh but most of them went and we're talking 20 30 
000 people at a time on in those situations everybody was working that night I mean they had people helping them it was such a big deal to get them off with very little notice and 
Healing cases
okay you hear about this with you know occasional plane crashes or ship sinking they never find some 
of the people and I think now we know why yes so I'd like to talk about a few more healing cases 
as well there was one case that we did Cover very briefly in the book I really just mentioned one 
sentence of it so I was wondering about this one where uh I guess you you guys landed alongside a 
road way and a man driving by happened to see you and foolishly and this is how a lot of the 
so-called UFO injuries occur runs up to a very hot essentially radioactive craft this is what's so 
interesting about the injuries is if you look at them you categorize them most of them look 
like accidents whereas the healings are clearly intentional and this guy from what I remember you telling me again it's just one sentence in the book saw the craft and ran up to and got burned 
and he didn't even have to touch it he was burned before he could put his hands on us uh he got out 
he ran up the road toward the craft we had just landed and it was a very fast very quick Landing 
when we come out of atmosphere we're at least 4 000 degrees no kidding uh when you go from plasma onto the ground it's hot think about the special when it comes down and it lands nobody can 
go near that thing for hours and hours it's hot okay they're really hot and we're Radioactive on 
top of it and he ran up and he he leaned back like this I saw him going and I'm like oh no he's too 
close and he kept physically going forward and he just laid flat down on his back he was instantly 
irradiated oh it burned him and uh you don't leave that alone we picked him up we had to he was going 
to die and uh they took him in an emergency and it was until I did he didn't stay until we got him to 
a mother craft as fast as we could because he was in a lot of trouble he needed a lot of help and um 
he was brought back after he was healed and he was put back just before we were there and yeah before 
he was there before we were there it's a very close call and he woke up to seeing us leaving 
so he saw something and then he saw us leaving in that in his mind that's what he remembers and uh 
well yeah that's interesting because I've talked to people who like to see the craft there next thing they know it's leaving yes so yeah that's very very interesting and uh 
a good cautionary a bit of wisdom don't approach a craft and you don't know if it just landed or not 
ever just rule of thumb no touching craft period ever ever don't get within 150 feet 200 feet of 
it until you know for sure that thing is cool and somebody's open a board and they're going hey how you doing don't no it's dangerous it will kill you yeah another thing I covered in one of my 
Shooting UFOs
not from here books was people who've shot at UFOs or for that matter ETS yeah which usually doesn't 
have much of a reaction other than it pinging off the craft and off the craft will go right this is 
where they did actually beam the person back but you had this experience uh once we have a graviton 
wave shield around us okay what what gives us anti-graph is like a shield okay we're in it 
it protects us from everything including incoming and yet gone you know standing there staring at us 
watch this come down and I'm thinking don't just don't yeah we're 500 feet away from him we're 500 
600 feet uh we didn't even land yet I mean this is in the U.S and it does this he's got his got 
you know most hunters hold their guns you know at their sides like this and he's got his hand down around the trigger you know hold mid and he literally did this he took his other hand I don't 
know if you can see me or not he slid it forward and shot at this and I'm thinking please let 
Ricochet away no it went straight into his thigh it came off the shield and right back into him 
this is bad because it got radioactive the second it hit the shield and then it went into his thigh 
and he went straight to his ass he sat down with the gun he tried to lift the gun again and then 
thought better of it and that's when we took him out and we got him out of there as fast as we could we left the gun on the ground and we took him away and fixed the slate and put him back yeah 
and was he left with any memory of what happened yes we didn't let him forget that one it's like a 
dream to him he was he was talked to about it when he was there he was very belligerent at first where you think I was gonna do I was going to shoot her you're crazy you know took welcome 
into him that's not a good idea very bad idea he held the the armies of this planet can't hit 
one and kill it they like to make you think that they can shoot you down and it's not true that you cannot hurt them the only reason that they crash is because they've lost the magnetic uh resonant 
line that they're surfing you know skipping and uh yeah they'll go down and it's a Pilots not paying 
attention and or totally loses the line and they go now it's an unpleasant experience once in a 
blue moon something bad'll happen on a craft like anything nothing is 100 percent or feel safe and 
will crash because of that but that's way you know point zero zero zero zero zero zero one you know 
not that often it's mostly the magnetism of this planet screwed up and they go down so yeah so 
Death Row
those are some of the healings and stuff there's a couple of other incidents that we did mention 
the book which I thought were so touching and uh because they do come down and console people who 
are in bad situations and uh you talked about one time where a gentleman was on death row I wonder 
if you could talk a little bit about that incident or that type of incident everybody everybody
is capable of making great mistakes in their lives everybody is capable of cracking or breaking down 
and a lot of that goes on these days because we're being messed with our brains are being messed with you know magnetically and DNA has a lot of reason to do with that um this Man's family was 
known to them he was a contactee all his life he was somebody that they cared about greatly 
they respected him and his life and they thought that it would be important for him to at least 
have somebody to confess to and maybe try to work through what happened to him we don't always give 
people those opportunities you know we like to think we do but we don't and give him a forum in 
which he could let it all hang out and understand what he was facing and why and they did they took 
him up and they counseled him through what was about to happen to him they couldn't stop it but 
they gave him the opportunity to be stopped sure that he would not only move on to the university 
Interruption
all right sorry about that we had a brief Interruption with the internet but we're back now 
so sorry about that dolly but as you were talking about the death row inmate who was facing the last 
of his life in the ETS brought him on board and we're counseling him give him the opportunity to 
talk about what she was facing the end of his life and all of that so you pretty much got 
through most of it I think but if you had anything else you wanted to say about it uh they gave him 
a connection to them to the end of his physical life in other words he didn't go alone they were 
with him and they were waiting for him on the other side they have that ability to do that 
they can obey as well as we can and they gave him that reassurance they felt like after counseling 
with him and understanding that he knew why he did what he did and he understood it that they would 
not let him alone he was alone before that and they did not want him to be it's a great lesson in 
that oh you know these are such wonderful examples which is why I think it's important that people 
Doctor Who
know that this is what is really going on people are being taken on board and one really good final 
example I'd like to bring up which again I found so touching uh you talked about this uh Doctor Who 
had spent their whole life in service of humanity and I believe was over a hundred when they brought 
him on board as sort of a celebration of his life and the service he had given to humanity so many 
people who are taken on board are doing good work for Humanity I see a lot of people who are doctors nurses like yourself social workers people working for Animals animal rights preservation of 
our environment social workers musicians you know good people who are working hard this is who the 
ETS are helping because these are the people who are helping others and that's true about 
this uh gentleman so I wonder if you could talk about what happened when he was brought on board 
who's the much younger woman than I am now I was in my early 30s and uh he was 104 years old 
um when I met him when he came up and this was a special trip and I was warned that he would be 
the only one that day and uh I was not prepared to hear his whole story and when I did I was uh 
unbelievably driven to my niece so much only ever this he lived his life out as a man 
104 years my senior I was only 32 or 33 when I met him so 70 years before that he had no way of being 
a doctor the female could not would not it was intelligent he was able to uh make all the grades 
and he lived his life as a male for this reason and nobody knew nobody on this planet knew that 
he wasn't a male he worked very hard at it those few that did kept a secret because of who he was 
you never married you never had children he gave of himself he never tried to be 
famous or an expert at anything he just cared about people and he was a good good doctor 
EP is known about him his whole life and honored him and wanted him to know that 
his they wanted to honor him they were honoring his good work of service to 
humanity I mean think about it Oliver should feel the swear about Humanity all of us 
they gave him the greatest gift you can give they gave of their minds they opened up to him 
and then he they let him see what he was going to go to because there was no way they were going to 
lose him one way or the other they were going to help him have the decision where he wanted to go 
by the time he got to them and they showed him these things his decision was that he 
wanted to move on that he wanted to go ahead to the next step in his Evolution he knew he 
had a chance to live again somewhere else and but he had no family to hold him or hold his 
um interest here in any way and so they promised they would be with him and they would hold him 
true and they would walk him through the process as well like demand and death row and they celebrated his life while he was on board he was taken to a 
few places he was shown what he wanted to see he was given their hearts everything
well so touching oh well I think this is a good place to end it because I know 
Conclusion
you have more examples of people who've been taught yeah guided healed rescued 
even you yourself have had some healings and amazing incidents but I think we can save that perhaps for another time and that was covered in the book but none of these 
incidents that we've talked about were covered to the detail I think we've covered here today so I really want to thank you for sharing these amazing experiences uh one thing I have heard from 
many contactees is the same message and when you brought it up I'm like wow here it is again which 
is they will tell people you are us we are you we are all one we come from the same place and uh to 
hear you say that as well it's like wow so I think this shows us you know really what the purpose for 
onboard UFO encounters are as I said they're here to guide help heal teach wake people up 
so if you'd like to give some you know any closing statements or anything else you want to add to 
this subject of gathering the children uh I think that would be awesome and uh yeah just a good way 
to wrap up this whole particular aspect of onboard UFO encounters the truth is is that we've always 
been with them we've always known them and they have always known us we've known every creature 
in the universe literally we are all in sourced together and we all come out together to live 
and to experience life and to learn and to make ourselves wise and to ascend upward as we should 
um we've been put off here and it has been in a hard position here with this and they've people 
want us to be helped by them and that's all well good and they do help us as much as they can 
but we all have to be willing to meet them at least more than halfway it is our economy it is 
our right to do what that which we need to do for ourselves you can't be anything unless you 
yourself are that that you be that yourself you learn it yourself you wear everything you know 
everything please remember that please remember that everybody is doing the same thing you're 
doing and that we should help one another we should love our brothers we should love them unequivocally every Great Master who's ever been on this planet and said anything to any 
of us about anything have all said the same thing love one another love is freedom love is the way 
that's what I have to say well that's perfect yeah thanks so much Dolly I'm in such a joy always
