THE SMELL OF UFOS
Aug 27, 2021

Summary:
Aug 27, 2021
Nearly every aspect of UFOs and extraterrestrials has been studied in detail. Investigators have researched cases involving landing traces, radar-returns, animal reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic effects, UFO propulsion, ...the list goes on and on! One aspect of Ufology that has been largely overlooked, however, is: the smell of UFOs!

The sense of smell plays a powerful role in human perception, and is closely connected to memory. And with amnesia exhibiting itself in so many UFO encounters, the importance of smell in connection to aliens and UFOs becomes even more profound.

This video presents more than 30 cases involving witnesses who smelled unusual odors during their UFO encounter. These cases have occurred over many decades and come from all across our planet, and yet they are surprisingly consistent. Over and over again, people report odors that are remarkably similar. An exploration of these cases reveals some surprising and significant insights into the nature and origins of UFOs and extraterrestrials.

What do aliens and UFOs smell like? What do these scents tell us about these mysterious visitors to our planet? The answers may surprise you!

If you would like to explore more about what UFOs and aliens smell like, and what these cases reveal about the phenomenon, check out my book, "Not from Here: Volume Two." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal i've got a pretty unusual episode for you today it's called the smell of ufos 
there's been a lot of research into the various aspects of the ufo phenomena people have studied 
landing trace cases medical effects animal effect cases electromagnetic effects ufo crash retrievals 
ufo propulsion cases uh virtually every aspect of ufos has been studied intensely however I was 
surprised to find out how little research there has been done into alien odors or what ufos and 
ets actually smell like and there are quite a few cases I did some sniffing around and came up with 
more than 30 cases involving alien odors and that's what this episode is about today 
before I get into the actual cases I would like to make one point about alien smells and smell in 
general the ability to smell is deeply connected to human memory in fact the olfactory nerve 
leads directly to the core of the brain so memory and smells are inextricably connected and this is 
why memories are often easily provoked by odors and of course scientists have long 
known that smell plays a powerful role in human behavior it influences the appetite the sex drive 
physical attraction and many areas of everyday life and should also be pointed out that 
smell for animals is often the superior sense they rely on it much more than even vision or hearing 
so the point is smell is a very important sense and it's been largely overlooked into 
how this is part of the ufo phenomena so what i'd like to do is look into these cases 
of alien odors and see what they tell us about the ufo phenomena and i've got a lot of cases 
i want to go through so i'm going to go through them fairly quickly and see what we can figure out 
and the first case I want to touch on is that of whitley striever he's one of america's 
best known experiencers and has experienced a wide range of ufo encounters and has of 
course written several best-selling books about his extensive experiences with the visitors and on several occasions he reports he has actually smelled them 
on december 26 1985 strieber reports uh being taken from his cabin in upstate new york 
and on board the ufo he was shocked to find out that the interior of this craft was actually 
quite dirty and as he says I quote I know this is no dream i'm sitting on a bench in a little 
room and it smells funny it smells something like cheese in here smells kind of nasty to tell you 
the truth it's not clean in here the space I entered smelled like warm cheddar cheese 
with a hint of sulfur it was later on during this same experience that whitley had a very strong 
fear reaction when the ETs informed him that they were going to perform an operation on him 
he panicked and began screaming and one of the ET's asked him can we help you stop screaming 
and striver surprised himself by saying you could let me smell you the alien then pressed her cheek 
up to whitley's face allowing him to smell her and this worked it calmed him down so what do 
the aliens actually smell like whitley strieber definitely has an answer on february 7 1986 he 
had an experience where he distinctly smelled them as he says there is one earlier incident 
worth recounting because it was this incident more than any other that opened the door to the past 
and it did this via my sense of smell the night of friday february 7 we spent in our apartment in the 
city I was absolutely frantic I had an awful feeling I felt their presence it was palpable 
most upsetting I could smell them I could smell a distinct odor as if of smoldering cardboard and it was familiar from my past my wife could also smell this odor 
it was one we had both smelled many times until now I had not understood its significance there 
was also another odor as if of cheese and cinnamon that I remembered from december 26. 
so for whitley strieber the smell of the aliens actually played a powerful role and was actually 
the impetus that led him to consider the physical reality of his experience as he says I remembered 
the odors I had smelled the night before odor is an excellent trigger of memory and the odor of 
smoldering cardboard seemed to unlock a lot of doors I last smelled it in 1972 or 1973. 
my wife and I had gone down to san antonio to see my family and we were sleeping in my 
sister's old bedroom in the middle of the night I suddenly awoke with the impression that I just 
heard a loud noise I decided to get a glass of water as I left our bedroom I noticed a strange 
smell like smoldering cardboard as I went toward the bedroom to get my water a small 
dark figure with a red light in its hand burst out of my old bedroom and dashed downstairs
so yes ETs do have an odor another case comes from an abductee by the name of jean marie robinson 
an abductee from branson missouri who wrote a book called alienated she has had lifelong 
contacts with a variety of extraterrestrials and one of her first clues that she was having contact 
was an identifiable odor as jean says and I quote several times as a youngster 
i noticed a strong odor on my hands and a brown substance under my fingernails 
i recalled this substance smelled similar to beans and onions I had not eaten anything 
that would have left this residue on my hands for some reason memories of those childhood 
incidents came back to me while I was listening to a boring lecture at college I knew this was 
significant smell is a good memory trigger so later under hypnosis gene recalled the source 
of this odor she recalled being taken onboard a craft where she was surrounded by gray type 
ets and was shown several apparent hybrid babies it was then that she smelled this same odor 
as she says and I quote two greys in another part of the room were busily preparing something 
it was a bowl of foul smelling substance the smell was very offensive it smelled of onions garlic 
beans and some other odors I could not identify the substance was the color of apple butter a 
gray held the bowl and I received a thought that I was to stick this substance and rub it on the baby 
jean marie robinson learned that this was how the babies received nourishment and she was instructed 
to feed them in this manner on several occasions but initially her only clue that something had 
occurred to her was this strange odor coming from the traces of the substance left on her hands 
so as you can see odor is playing a powerful role in people's experiences another very famous case 
involving odors occurred on august 13 1973 to police sergeant charles moody who experienced 
a ufo abduction while driving through the desert outside of alamogordo new mexico 
i had stopped to watch a meteor shower and instead a large metallic disk swooped down and landed 
and moody was taken on board by ETs that looked very much like the modern day graves 
this is a very well-known case so I won't go too deeply into it other than to report that 
charles moody did smell a strange odor while he was on board the craft as 
coral and jim lorenzen write from the report on this case from the time that moody had come to 
in the white table room where he found himself on a table he had noticed a sweet odor in the 
air she compared to burnt sugar and throughout his stay on the craft his breathing was labored
another very famous case involving powerful odors is probably best known as the flatwoods 
monster or the braxton county monster this case occurred on september 12 1952 
and the main witnesses ms kathleen may and two of her children aged 12 and 13 years old 
and four other children ranging in age from 12 to 17. all of them cited a large reddish glowing 
object which had landed on a nearby hilltop in flatwoods virginia and the seven of them hiked up 
to see what it was and were confronted with a very very tall man-like creature robotic-like creature 
with large eyes and a vaguely human appearance the red glow was coming from a craft behind the 
creature and the sight of this quote monster sent this little group of individuals into a panic and 
they fled from the area after they returned to safety they were pretty much in a state of 
shock and had some disagreement on the actual appearance of the creature however what they all agreed upon was this weird odor which was something like 
i mean none of them could ever forget it kathleen may said that the stench was unlike anything she 
had ever smelled but that it was close to sulfur the police were called and arrived on the scene 
with a a local reporter and the reporter ailee stewart jr who had served in the army 
uh in a capacity where he became familiar with the order of a wide variety of gases he smelled 
an odor which he described as sickening and irritating but was otherwise completely unique 
to his experience another famous case involving odors occurred on december 20th 1958 on this in 
the swiss countryside when two young men by the name of hans gustafson and stig ridgeberg were 
driving along a remote road when they came upon a strange illuminated mist and upon investigating 
they saw a metallic disc and suddenly they were grabbed by two very strange creatures which 
looked like and i'll just quote here blobs like protozoa just a bit darker than most 
sort of a bluish color hopping and jumping around this saucer like globs of animated jelly the drag 
the things exerted was terrific and they gave off such a terrible smell like ETher and burnt sausage 
the two men were terrified and escaped the grip of these gelatinous like creatures and fled the area 
at first they decided that they weren't going to tell anybody but this odor was so bad that it was making them ill and they had to seek medical attention 
as hans gustafson says we endured it for three days and then we decided we should see 
a physician as a report on the case reads the terrible stench seemed to stay with hans and stig 
it seemed to have scarred their nostrils with its terrible odor
investigators did research this case and found landing traces where this object had landed 
it's one of the most unusual contact d cases because most involve humanoid creatures but no this one involved gelatinous blob like creatures it's a very unusual case 
but once again we have this these very powerful and somewhat disagreeable odors not all of them 
are disagreeable there's a very interesting case which occurred in april of 1955 to 
a cook from loveland ohio his name is robert honeycutt according to the report on the case 
robert honeycutt was driving home from work when he saw what he thought were three men 
praying by the side of the road he noticed that one of the figures was holding a glowing rod 
and that all these figures were about three feet tall in uniforms and were grayish in color 
and as honeycutt says quote fairly ugly he walked towards the creatures and then decided he should 
stop and rushed back to his car so he was hoping to get some additional witnesses but as he was on 
the scene he did notice a very powerful odor which he described as quote an extremely strong odor 
which smelled like a combination of fresh cut alfalfa and almonds he decided he'd drive 
straight to the loveland police department and reported his encounter to chief fitz
and chief fitz did confirm that honeycutt reported this quote terrible odor
so more and more cases keep turning up with weird odors here's a case which occurred in hampshire england on november 6 1967 to a truck driver 
by the name of carl farlow he was driving his route when suddenly his headlights failed 
and looking up he saw a floating egg-shaped object according to one report on the case 
the object made a sound like a refrigerator and gave off a smell like a drill boring through wood 
another car arrived which had two passengers in it and they also observed this object which quickly 
moved away and disappeared off into the distance by this point however carl farlow 
went into a state of clinical shock turned out the road itself was marked and the surface 
was actually partially melted what's interesting timothy good wrote about this case within 
a week of this encounter all the evidence of the road having been melted 
was covered up and the entire road itself was resurfaced for a 200 foot stretch 
so it's apparent that this the landing traces were covered up in this case 
it's unfortunate because uh we could have gotten some real good evidence from that but there are many cases involving odors another case occurred actually at whitley strieber's cabin 
when he had invited a couple of people over to spend the night this was in 1988 and one of the 
witnesses was raven dana she woke up in the middle of the night to see a gray e.t entering her room 
it actually approached her quite closely and she could smell it 
she says that it stared at her a few moments and that was when she noticed its odor which she described as quote kind of a musty odor like the wet fur of an animal not unpleasant but 
very woodsy turns out another person at whitley's cabin also had an encounter that night her name 
is laurie barnes she was asleep in another room when she woke up to see what was apparently the 
same gray entering into her bedroom and she gave an identical description including its body odor 
which she described as a musty odor I would liken it to damp woodsy this really impressed 
whitley strieber because they both used pretty much the same words to describe this odor as whitley says it is interesting that they both used such a specific description independently 
this implies a very identical identifiable odor and more importantly a real one two 
people might well both imagine ascent but not the same precise one not after six years i've 
been interested in their odors because I think of smell and touch as confirming senses much more so 
than sight and sound over the years i've tried to smell them and touch them as much as I could 
and have noticed many different odors the most notable of which is the human smell of them
another interesting case took place in ross ohio on november 19 1973 
when two anonymous gas station attendance witnessed a large glowing white light 
which moved towards their gas station and then blinked out it was a brief encounter but both 
witnesses did remark upon a powerful odor left by the object according to the report on the 
case and I quote when the ufo disappeared both attendants smelled the strong odor of sulfur 
also a motorist driving in for gas remarked about the strong offensive odor 
researcher leonard stringfield has uncovered some cases involving alien odors as he says and I quote 
research records show again and again when humanoids are near so is an odor he quotes one case which occurred on october 2nd 1966 in cincinnati ohio 
when a housewife by the name of miss everett stewart was talking on the phone with a friend 
when she noticed a foul odor in the room which was so strong it made her dizzy and nauseous 
she hung up the phone and went to her bed where she had the feeling of being watched and looking 
out the window she saw a large oval-shaped object with portholes hovering only a few hundred feet 
away she woke up her husband who also saw the object she called her neighbor janet and uh 
as miss stewart says I was feeling quite sick when I called to alert janet 
the odor seemed stronger and I was so dizzy I had to sit down
so there were quite a few witnesses to this case ms stewart called the police 
who told her that they had already received more than 40 calls reporting ufos in this area 
by this point the odor in her home was so strong it was on was intolerable she said and I quote 
it was an ill smelling chemical odor a smell that made me lose my equilibrium her neighbor janet 
described the smell as exactly like quote bad garbage eventually the object did left did leave 
but uh miss stewart was left in a state of near shock took her quite some time to recover
not all smells are disagreeable uh in 1950 six-year-old virginia horton 
that's a pseudonym used by bud hopkins this case occurred uh I mean this is one of the cases 
that he wrote about in his best-selling book missing time so six-year-old virginia horton 
had traveled outside her family barn to collect some eggs and experience the typical ufo abduction 
she gave a very detailed description of the inside of the craft including an odor 
as she says and I quote I was lying on a couch a little couch it was comfortable like a bed 
or almost like a medical thing but it did not have the quality of a doctor's office it's not chromie and white and the light's bright there's plenty of light 
i think it might be a pale or a soft gray it's it's pearly those kinds of colors there was a 
luxuriant feeling to it elegant and simple and rich i'm trying to think if it had some smell 
clean really an ozone smell that was the smell kind of a clean smell but nothing very specific
so some of these odors we start to get a lot of repetition particularly of a sulfuric type odor 
one such case was investigated by jacques valle during a wave of sightings 
over kolaris brazil involving objects that the locals called chupas 
and according to jacques valle and I quote I found little consistency in the descriptions of the beam 
itself one of the witnesses compared it to an electric arc on an interview tape another witness 
said he remembered a bad smell like an electrical odor ozone and saw a blinking light with 
pulsating colors inside valet quotes another case involving a gentleman a prospector by the name of 
manuel and he also reported an odor he was struck by a beam of light and as jacques valet says 
every time the light hit him he felt weak and felt and fell he also smelled a foul odor in the whole 
incident which manuel calls the worst thing in his life it was the smell that affected him the most 
it was penetrating like burning sulfur and it made his nose run 
it did not impair his breathing but it forced him to clear his throat at frequent intervals he believes it was the smell rather than the light that made him fall
so another really famous case involving odors is none other than travis walton on november 5 1975 
travis experienced a five day long abduction that became very well known this occurred of 
course outside of snowflake arizona travis had a number of witnesses to his encounter who also 
saw the craft saw him get struck by the beam of light the men in the truck drove away and did not 
observe him actually get taken on board but according to travis one of the first thing 
he noticed when he was taken on board was the odor of the craft as he says 
where in the hell am I oh my god it's the hospital they brought me here to the hospital 
it was very hot and humid the heavy air was almost stifling it smelled slightly stale 
and muggy the heavy air was difficult to breathe so this is a type of description we hear quite a 
bit another very similar description comes from casey turner who is the husband of carla turner 
author of into the fringe masquerade of angels and other books on the ufo phenomena and according to 
casey turner he had a ufo encounter an abduction and his description of the inside of the ufo the 
smell of it is actually pretty familiar as he says and I quote it feels small and dank like a seller 
but not a seller it's not wet but it smells yucky closed quarters like an old gym an old locker room
another abductee who has reported e.t odors is kim carlsberg who wrote 
an excellent book called beyond my wildest dreams also another of a book the art alien art 
and she also reports a very powerful odor as she says have you ever experienced strange 
pungent odors like burning wire or rotting organic material without being able to locate the source 
because she points to this as one of the clues of being an abductee 
and she describes one of her experiences and again I quote instantly I felt claustrophobic 
not due to the small enclosure but due to the fact that I was packed in with many other bodies 
and jammed into a blind corner although I felt I was trapped by sentient beings the stench of 
rotting organic matter was suffocating I didn't know where I was how I got there 
or how I could have been taken from my bed in the middle of the night
uh one case involves a very specific odor this case occurred in beaumont france on october 5th 
1954 when several witnesses saw a glowing object approach to within about four to 500 feet 
and it left them in a state of temporary paralysis and then darted away however 
according to a report on the case the object left a smell compared with that of nitrobenzene 
the smell of nitrobenzene has been compared to the smell of almonds by the way which is 
interesting because that does turn up as we have seen in another case so some of these I mean 
we're definitely beginning to see some patterns in these odors another really famous case uh was the 
star of bud hopkins book intruders uh kathy davis was the suitor name she's since come forward her 
name is debbie jordan cobble she's written a book about her experiences which has just 
recently been released I spoke with her directly and yeah she also reports smelling an odor
during her encounter and again this was one of the first clues she had was this strange 
odor and as she says and I quote I can smell burning matches it smells like burning matches 
and it stinks another case occurred in january of 1969 to a lady by the name of anne-marie 
this occurred in springfield massachusetts and anne-marie was driving alone when she was stopped by three glowing objects which hovered over her car 
she felt a blast of heat and at this point a strange odor filled her vehicle and as she says 
there was this very funny smell almost like a skunk but like a sweet skunk you know it was weird 
and at this point the objects darted away but raymond fowler who investigated this case says 
of this odor have you ever played with an electric train and smelled the odor I think it was ozone 
so this ozone odor turns up again and again another very well known case investigated by 
raymond fowler has come to be known as the allagash abduction involving four witnesses 
um there's four witnesses to this case all of whom have apparently had a lifetime of encounters 
two of the witnesses are actually twins and one of the witnesses his name is jack weiner 
and he lives in cape cod vermont and on may 21st 1988 jack experienced an abduction from his home 
and he was pulled out of his home and led to a glowing craft that was actually landed 
on the ground and as he was being taken into this craft he smelled a very peculiar odor 
as jack says I smelled something weird it smells like a freezer maybe something like a freezer like 
when you open one of those freezers with a lid and it smells tangy sour like cold or a chemical 
it's a weird weird smell another very well known case is that of betty andreasen 
and her husband bob luca and it was bob luca who actually reported smelling a distinct odor 
in the summer of 1967 bob luca was abducted from his car while driving near wallingford connecticut 
it was a very typical experience he was taken on board and examined but while on board the craft bob luca noticed a very distinct and recognizable odor 
as he says there was no noise but I smell ozone or something after an electrical discharge 
in my work I run into that a lot it's just inside the room like after a lightning 
storm like after an arc of high tension or high voltage there was an odor like that
another case occurred in caracas venezuela to miss alicia rivas aguilar on september 8th 1973 
alicia was frightened by the appearance of a strange humanoid figure in a silver suit 
which was floating outside her window she began screaming this brought in additional witnesses 
in her home all of who saw the figure but according to the report on the case 
a strong smell which resembled that of hot iron was detected by all 
another very famous case occurred in cherry creek new york on august 19 1965. this is a very strange 
case a whole family saw this object there was a farmer and three children who observed this 
saucer-like object which landed in a neighbor's field uh it was very brief it instantly took off 
and uh this as this object took off it left quote an odor like burning gasoline 
this incident was investigated the pipe by police and other officials and was actually 
written up by the air force's project blue book who marked it as unidentified
i investigated a case personally involving a lady by the name of pat brown she was a 
physical therapist from panorama city and in 1992 she began having a series of bedroom encounters 
with mostly gray type ETs she would later see human-looking ETs but it's a quite complex case 
i actually did a video on this it's called be careful what you wish for the pat brown story 
so I won't go into all the details on the case other than to say that it does involve strange 
odors on one occasion she returned to her home and found it filled with this very peculiar odor 
as pat brown says and I quote one time I came into the house and the house smelled so bad 
it smelled like someone had left garbage and I was trying to figure out what it was an awful awful smell but I perceived that they had been there I perceived that that was their odor
another case involving odors occurred on june 29 1964 to a businessman by the name of beauford 
parham of livonia georgia who was driving near his home when a ufo swooped down from the sky and 
hovered over his car causing the engine to sputter and after a few minutes the object departed 
leaving quote a strong odor like embalming fluid and a gaseous vapor the witness himself says he 
felt a burning sensation and the paint on his car actually bubbled following the incident so it's 
a very interesting case involving physiological effects uh physical effects and a strange odor so 
there are many cases involving odors another occurred on november 19 1980 in longmont 
colorado when a husband and wife were driving along and the ufo hovered over their car and 
pulled it up into the sky uh they were taken on board this craft and the witness once he 
was taken on board did notice an odor as the report in this case reads it was quote 
a strong odor that he thought was electrical in nature and it pervaded the entire area
another very famous case occurred in january of 1996 in vargina brazil this is 
a very well-known case involving two live ET's who were seen by the local 
townsfolk this ET was up against a brick wall and many people saw it 
and what's really interesting is the odor that was described in this case these these uh beings were 
described as humanoids about three feet tall with dark brown hairless skin that was very 
oily looking they had triangular heads with short protuberances on top and red vertically oval eyes 
more than a dozen people in this town of varginha saw these ET's and what's 
important here was that an odor hung over the area which was described as quote a smell like sulfur
one anonymous witness had a close encounter with gray type extraterrestrials and according to this 
witness the e.t did have an odor as she says her skin felt like very soft leather and she 
had a pleasant but cheesy smell one case that has become fairly well known occurred to a junction 
by the name of eugenio douglas this occurred on october 12 1963 in argentina and you genio eugenio 
had a close encounter with a ufo while driving he stopped his truck and observed three figures 
exiting a craft which had landed along the roadside these three figures spotted him and 
fired a beam of red light at him causing a burning sensation and according to the report on the case 
douglas could also smell a pungent gas he had to be treated for severe burns and 
later an investigation revealed that there was physical evidence at the site of the encounter 
another very well known case is the coronado island ufo incident yvonne smith wrote a book 
about this incident I also co-wrote a book with mike evans on this particular case called the 
coronado island ufo incident which occurred on march 26 1994 at the village inn on coronado 
island it involved multiple witnesses what's interesting here is one of the witnesses laurie 
had fully conscious recall of grays entering into her hotel room 
and she reported an odor for sure as she says and I quote I see these small grays come in 
i've never seen them before they smell really bad they smell like I want to say sulfur rotten eggs 
they coming through this window they were small gray beings they're really small maybe three 
feet high and very limby very spindly looking their torso is quite big their heads are large 
they look disgusting and they took her friend who was sleeping 
her friend has very little memory of this uh just some partial memory and at some point the grays 
returned and again she could smell them as laurie says they smelled the same they were terrible
another case which involves odors is of course the very famous roswell ufo case according to 
the mortician glenn dennis who was on the scene he says that there was an odor he spoke with the 
nurse who actually saw the bodies and the nurse told him that the ET's had a terrible 
terrible stench that was so bad it permeated the whole building and made several people sick 
so yeah I mean there are many more cases it starts to get a little bit redundant 
here's a case which comes from a gentleman who heads what he calls the orion project which is 
all about reptilian ETs and as he says and I quote reptilians are notorious for having a very strong 
body odor which most humans find very uncomfortable almost like meeting a skunk i'd describe the smell of hamish the reptilian that's the e.t he reports seeing 
as quote the smell of vomit and old cheese a very visceral smell I found another case which is 
anonymous from a gentleman on the internet on the above top secret forum and as he says and I quote 
i've been told there are several abductees here who might know what i'm talking about 
the greys have this odor that is so bad it's enough to make you physically ill it's a cross between a well-aged french cheese and the sulfurous smell similar 
to what a natural hot spring smells like are they a race of habitual non-bathers 
do they not have a good sense of smell is it from what they eat like when you eat garlic 
or asparagus or is it because there are no shower facilities on spaceships you'd think 
if they could build a flying saucer they could invent perfume or antiperspirant or something 
my last question is do we smell as bad to them as they smell to us it's a good question 
but apparently ET's do have a body odor I wouldn't say it's necessarily bad the sulfurous odor could 
be a product of them actually manifesting uh and how all these electrical arcing odors 
uh researcher eve lorgan who is quite a prominent researcher made a list of all the 
signs that indicate a possible ufo experience and on her list is of course these 
unusual odors I did a whole study of this case in my book not from here volume two and I think 
these do these or odors do have quite a bit to tell us about the nature of this phenomena I 
literally went through hundreds of cases looking for odors and came up with these few dozen and I 
would say that these odors can be broken down into two main categories organic odors and electrical 
odors so these odors are described variously the organic odors are described variously as 
cheesy like cinnamon like beans and onions burn sugar burn sausage muggy woodsy like 
wet fur alfalfa and almonds rotten organic matter a locker room bad garbage rotten eggs 
i think this is important because what these odors tell us is that we are dealing with organic 
beings beings who have a living body beings very much like us remember when someone smells 
something it's because they are actually bringing in actual molecules into their nasal cavity it's 
striking their olfactory nerve so these odors indicate that this is an actual physical phenomena
so the second main category would be what I would call electrical odors and this is a slightly 
smaller percentage but as I mentioned earlier this odor is a common side effect of electrical 
discharges and this odor I mean is very consistent in a number of independent cases so it's important 
that it provides really good corroborative evidence but it's also important because it points 
to the nature of ufos as being actual physical machines using high levels of electricity it also 
points to the nature of ufo propulsion and the probability that we are dealing with an advanced 
technology of some kind so some of the odors are difficult to categorize I mean 
like a clean smell or a chemical odor like burning cardboard or burning wood nitrobenzene 
uh these types of things it's very possible that these are just misidentifications of what we 
would think of as an ozone like odor but yeah again these odors are surprisingly consistent 
i remember when I was talking to an abductee and I asked her about this and she said what 
she smelled was beans and franks and I thought she was kidding at first but no she was entirely 
serious and I was quite surprised later to get additional reports involving this same odor so uh
yes as we can see these odors do turn up it's a fairly consistent feature of ufo encounters 
the only other research I could find into ufo odors was done by ufo researcher thomas 
bullard who considered more than 200 cases of ufo abductions 
and of those 200 only 11 involved odors he writes and I quote 
the witnesses smell an odor in 11 cases usually ozone or something described in similar terms 
sulfurous pine-like or rain-like exceptions include a burnt sugar smell a smell like chicken 
or something burnt or simply a bad odor these smells may contribute to breeding difficulties 
mentioned in several cases but the problem of air being difficult to breathe is widespread 
enough to occur in 21 cases and bullard's study shows pretty much the same thing we found out 
here that these odors are organic on one hand and ozone or sulfurous on the other which again 
indicates that these ETs are biological creatures and their craft are technological machines 
so I think the most important conclusion we can draw from ufo smells is that the ufo experience 
is taking place in physical reality again odors are molecular compounds which strike the 
olfactory nerve and in many of these cases these odors are being detected by multiple witnesses 
which again confirms that ufos and these occupants are material in nature 
some people have remarked upon the connection between bad odors and other manifestations of 
ghosts and even bigfoot so perhaps there are some weird correlations there it's hard to say 
but what we can definitely say is that ufos do smell and unfortunately it's not always pleasant 
but it's certainly very interesting and uh consistent so it's easy to speculate in this field 
however the facts speak s speak for themselves odors are being detected in ufo cases so if you 
ever have the opportunity to see a ufo or a take are taken on board remember to use all your senses 
don't just look around and touch things try to smell what's going on because these odors do 
provide a clue as to the nature of this phenomena which is why I really wanted to do this video 
i think it's an important piece of evidence that has been ignored for too long so that's 
it for now hope you've enjoyed this episode and until next time keep having fun smell you later
