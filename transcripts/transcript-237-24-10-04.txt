SO THAT HAPPENED! EIGHT INCREDIBLY WEIRD UFO ENCOUNTERS
Oct 4, 2024

Summary:
Oct 4, 2024
Some UFO encounters are so incredibly weird, that after it occurs people can hardly believe that it actually happened! This episode presents eight cases from across the world of truly high strangeness, each involving close encounters of the second kind, in which the environment is affected in some way. Many of these cases have multiple witnesses, and virtually all of them involve some form of evidence: radar confirmation, photographs, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances. These are the kinds of cases that simply cannot be denied.

UFO COLLIDES INTO A HOUSE. On April 23, 1966, Jeanne Kalnicki and her six kids were shocked to see a UFO hovering right outside their home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. It fact, it was so close, they thought it might hit them. It moved off, but just a few hours later, it was back, and this time it ran right into the side of their apartment building, causing the whole structure to vibrate and the power to go out. And this was just one of many sightings occurring in this area at that time.

A UFO WITH A MESSAGE. The night of December 12, 1967 would change the life of Rita Malley forever. As she drove with her young son near Ithaca, New York, a UFO began to follow her down the highway. Suddenly it struck her car with a beam of light, pulling it off the road. Then chorus of voices spoke to her, delivering a message that would chill her to the bone. The very next day, Rita learned that the message from the UFO was absolutely accurate. This case was just one of hundreds in the same area around the same time.

A VERY HOT UFO. Around 10:50 pm on August 13, 1970, patrolman Evald Maarup was driving near Haderslev, Denmark when his car and the surrounding area became illuminated by a blindingly brilliant light. As the engine and electrical system failed, Evald looked up and saw a UFO right above his car. Suddenly the interior of his vehicle became hot as a summer day. As it finally darted away, he managed to capture three photos of the object. Soon the UFOs would return, not only to him, but to others!

A SILVER UFO WITH PRONGS. One evening in October 1973, Mary Rose and her 11-year-old son Teddy were walking near their home in Wilcoe, West Virginia when a UFO dropped down and hovered a telephone-pole height overhead. Fear filled them as they watched two prong-like things come out from the bottom of the craft. Both could feel a weird sensation of heat and electricity, and thought that they were about to be taken into the craft. They ran and hid, and to their relief, the UFO darted away.

STRUCK BY A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM A UFO. Around dusk on June 17, 1977, Dale Schexnaider, and two children, Jena (age 14) and Krissy (age 11) were walking to their car at Cotile Lake in Louisiana when a UFO appeared. Suddenly it came right over their heads, sending down multiple beams of light which struck them on the solar plexus. They were unable to move and saw with shock that their entire bodies were glowing with electric-blue light. Hours later, a tragic event occurred which seemed connected to their sighting in some indefinable way.

ALIEN FOOTPRINTS? On the night of September 4, 1979, Jerzy Wasilewski left his 4th floor apartment in Wroclaw, Poland to take a short walk. He left his kitchen window open. Returning later, he was shocked to see 17 strange footprints leading from the open window, meandering around his kitchen and hallway, and going back to the open window. The prints looked like burn-marks from some strange creature. But a later analysis revealed that these prints were something much more strange and inexplicable.

I WAS TRYING HARD TO HOLD ONTO REALITY. On the night of March 8, 1982, “John” and his wife were in their home in Bethel, Connecticut when the whole house began to shake. Fearing an earthquake, they ran outside only to be confronted by a massive shadowy object with scores of tiny red lights lining its edges. John later found out that there were dozens of other witnesses in the area, some who saw the same object and also reported very strange effects.

HIGH STRANGENESS IN SLOCINA. At 10:42 pm on December 27, 2013, Ewa looked outside the window of her home in Slocina, Poland and saw a huge glowing UFO at treetop level. She called to her mother, Anna and both watched the object approach. Suddenly the sound from their loud radio disappeared and time seemed to move in slow motion. As the craft passed over a streetlamp, it pulled the light away from the streetlamp, as if it had some kind of forcefield that could bend light.

These eight case, all close encounters of the second kind, show that UFOs can affect the environment (and the witnesses) in weird and unusual ways that defy comprehension. Cases like these have much to teach us about these strange craft visiting our planet, and the behavior of the occupants inside them.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal
today's episode is called so that happened eight incredibly weird UFO
encounters there are no humanoids in this episode these are all Close Encounters of the second kind and by
that I mean cases in which UFOs affected the physical environment in some way so
yeah no humanoids but I guarantee it you will find these cases very interesting
they're incredibly strange I've got cases from a wide variety of locations
one from Denmark two from Poland and five from the United States including
Connecticut Louisiana Massachusetts New York and
West Virginia these cases reach back to 1966 up to 2013 pretty recent but most
importantly they contain really compelling evidence the full range of evidence we see associated with UFO
encounters including radar returns actual photographs of UFOs but landing
traces electromagnetic disturbances physiological effects
animal reactions the whole deal and boy oh boy are these cases weird first case
I'd like to talk about today I call a UFO collides into a house this is a very
strange case I hadn't heard it before I was quite stunned to hear about this one
which does involve multiple Witnesses multiple events actually has radiation
readings along with it it's a very compelling case it occurred on April
23rd 1966 in Dorchester Massachusetts I
think you're going to find this one really amazing it was about 10:45 p.m.
on April 23rd 19 66 when Jean Kal Nikki was in her apartment home located at
1284 doorchester Avenue this is in doorchester which is a suburb of Boston
Massachusetts and she was listening to a WME radio talk show moderated by Steve
Fredericks and this is when he took a phone call from a woman in the area who said she had just seen a UFO moving over
Dorchester Avenue which is Jean kcki Street she was shocked so she quickly grabbed
two of her six children Judy age 11 Robin Age N9 and ran with both of them
to the front bedroom of their third floor apartment which overlooked Dorchester
Avenue and looking out the window they were shocked to see a UFO floating just
a few feet away outside of her apartment Windows floating right across Dorchester
Avenue right above Ernie's auto repair shop now this craft had a typical saucer
shape had one large yellow light and circular red blinking lights around the
circumference with a transparent bubble on top these lights were all flashing on and off and the craft itself was bobbing
up and down as it moved to the South Direction then it stopped hovered over a
sign on top of the auster built company building and as it started to move out
of view the three witnesses as a group ran back to the living room to look out the other
window and they watched as it crossed the street and now came straight towards
them exactly at eye level in fact it approached so close that they feared a
collision and stepped back from their window at this point they could hear it making a low humming sound as it passed
right between their apartment building and the one next door it then moved almost to the end of the alleyway
between the building buildings then stopped and hovered for several minutes and as this yellow light on top blinked
off and on they could see that this transparent Dome on top was glowing from
within then the object moved erratically off to the East and was gone but the
encounter wasn't over yet Jean Judy and Robin returned to the front bedroom and excitedly discussed their sighting at
this point Jean's 17-year-old son David walked in after walking the dog outside
and hearing his family he called the newspaper and learned that numerous people in the area had called in to
report seeing a UFO presumably the same one it turned out that there was in fact
an advertising plane flying that night in the area with a big sign behind it
and this was being used to explain the sighting but further research by Raymond Fowler showed that this plane had
actually landed at 10:30 which absolutely ruled out the kikki family's
sighting so they were so excited by their encounter that most of them were unable to sleep that night and hours
later at 5 a.m. 11-year-old Judy was lying awake in bed thinking about the
encounter her 9-year-old sister Robin was asleep in the bed by the window so
Judy's still thinking about this strange craft when there's suddenly a brilliant flash of Light which lights up the
window right through the Venetian blinds and illuminates her bed now this filled her with fear but she
was too afraid to call attention to herself so she called out softly to her mother now when her mom didn't hear Judy
leapt out of bed and walked up to the window looking out she saw the same
object again only this time it was close enough that had the window been open she
said she could have actually reached out and probably touched it she said it was about the size of a car disc shaped with
again red lights around the edge a dome on top with a bright yellow blinking light and as she saw it this object
began to bob up and down in front of the window so Judy at this point is rooted
to the spot with fear she screams in Terror and as if in response the object
begins to bup bob up and down even more quickly then suddenly there was a heavy
dull thud as this object appar ly struck the side of the house in fact all of the
windows in the house rattled Judy's bed rocked back and forth and all the lights
in the house immediately went out and as Judy herself says it was so close I
could almost touch it it had a bubble on top that seemed to be round with red lights around the edge it seemed to be
made partly of silvery gray metal with no doors it banged against the house as
we watched it I was sitting in my bed and it rocked the bed back and forth
then the lights in the house went out so still screaming Judy ran from her
room at that same moment their German Shepherd dog whed and scratched at the
back porch door Jean her son David and two friends
Mary berck and Helen Lichfield all together ran out onto to the back porch
and saw the same object again only this by this point it had moved off a mile or
two away they watched it for about 12 minutes at which point the house lights came back on so they returned inside and
David called the doorchester police they immediately tried to explain the sighting away as a nightmare or
lightning uh but there was a Boston Globe photographer at the police station
when the Cal nikkis called so he went directly to their house along with Roland oxin another newspaper
photographer and per him per Roland the kids were quote still hysterical and
crying now UFO researcher Walter web heard about this sighting and did some
investigations and he learned that there was in fact a power failure affecting 2500 homes and it was at the exact same
time of the C Nikki's sighting so that tracked perfectly and in fact tracing
this power failure they found two faulty C on pole number two on East Street
which was located only one block Northwest of the Kiki's
residence now nightcap researcher Ernest Reed went to the house and tested the
window sill in Judy's room with a Geer counter and he did find evidence of radiation that was beyond normal levels
and Walter web after speaking to all the witnesses and Judy he was convinced that
Judy who was in fact an honor student was telling the truth as he says if it
were a hoax she was a very good actress to cry as convincingly as she did police
officers and news photographers found the whole family upset I questioned Judy
very closely I don't think someone perpetrating a hoax could make a child stick to such a detailed story under
repeated interrogations over such a long period her account impressed me to say
the least and as Judy says I always used to say that there was no such thing as a
flying saucer I thought those people who said they saw them were making it up now
that I saw one myself I never want to see one again now in further support of the C
Nikki's case only one day earlier and a mere 32 miles to the north on the
evening of April 22nd 1966 at around 900 p.m. Nancy modugno age 11 looked out her
bedroom window in Beverly Massachusetts and saw an incredibly strange looking
object flying just above soir Road this is only 40t from her window and as she
says the object had four lights red blue green and a lamp color it looked like a
football but was the size of a car on top it had no windows the front was
pointed I was terrified I had no idea what it was it would be like if a car
was in the air right outside your window that's how I remember it being I think
it was metallic and I remember the flashing lights I knew instantly that it was nothing I'd ever seen before she
rushed down told her parents they didn't believe her at first but finally she persuaded them to go outside and they
all a whole group of adults saw this object hovering over nearby Beverly High
high school and in fact it came so low overhead dropping out of the sky that
one of the witnesses was so frightened she actually urinated herself I did cover this case in more detail in my
episode on schoolyard encounters if you'd like to hear more about this but it's amazing confirmation of a case that
occurred the day later and one final probably related case occurred on April 12
1966 this is again in Dorchester was around 7:45 p.m. when Witnesses saw a
low flying oval-shaped object with a dome and colored lights it exhibited the
same behavior as seen over Beverly it circled over a Schoolhouse bobbing up
and down and at the time there was an unexplained power failure in the
neighboring town of Roxbury then 5 days later on April 17
1966 a UFO was seen hover ing over a school in Peabody
Massachusetts again it was oval with a dome on top and had red green blue and
white lights and after hovering the object moved rapidly away with an oscillating motion how weird is that
there are not a lot of cases like that in fact I think that one is probably unique in the UFO literature there might
be some out there that just haven't been reported but like many cases this one
involves a series of events rarely is a UFO encounter a one-off and isolated
event usually there are a lot of people experiencing activity in a location at one time but again most people don't
report it and would you if something like that happened all right let's move on to the
next case which is also incredibly weird I mean just beyond bizarre I call this
one a UFO with a message this is occurred in December 12
1967 in ithaka New York and this was during a very intense wave of UFO
sightings the full range of encounters but this one involved a lady who
received a very personal message ETS do provide messages to people this kind of
message is incredibly profound very personal really poignant and I think
you'll find this case case really compelling this exceptionally unusual case was investigated by William D
Donovan and again it took place during a huge wave of activity in ethaka New York
in fact it involved about 1,000 sightings over a very short period of
time but the primary witness in this case is Rita Mali age
24 she's a part-time Beautician and mother of two her daughter Renee was 6
months old at the time and her son Dana was in kindergarten now on the night in
question December 12th 1967 she was driving home from North Lansing where she had visited a friend
to her home in South Lansing New York her son Dana was in the back seat they
were on Route 34 between Auburn and ithaka and her son was Jibber jabbering
like crazy just talking like a little kid does Rita was paying very close attention to driving as the wind was
blowing quite strong and there were occasional snow flurries it's about 700
p.m. and coming around the corner Rita noticed something very strange as she
says in her own words I noticed this brilliant red glow like on the inside of
my car I thought it's a police car I've been speeding I looked in the rear view
mirror and saw nothing there was nothing but this red light covering everything and I thought what is it and I could
just figure it out and I was shaking like a leaf trying to figure a way out of this so she thought it was the police
but she didn't see any police car nor did she hear any Sirens so she just kept driving and that's when the UFO appeared
and as Rita says I was suddenly panicked this object whatever it was suddenly
appeared on my left it came into sight over a telephone pole I glanced out and
I saw brilliant red and green lights underneath an object that was Airborne it must have been 55 to 60 ft
in diameter it was round and had a little Dome like thing on the top and it
tilted once you couldn't look right out and stare at it for long because the lights were so bright from
it so at this point ritaa realized that her son Dana was unnaturally quiet and
she looked back at him and saw that his eyes were bugging out of his head is how she put it so she screamed at him are
you all right and weirdly he didn't respond in any way he just sat there
staring Straight Ahead as if in a complete trance so she looked back at
the object she could see it was about 120 ft High 180 ft away and the next
thing she knew this object sent down a beam of Light which struck her car and
she says it extended a white beam of light from underneath and it just completely took right over the controls
of my car my car stopped moving when it stopped my first thought was to grab
Dana and get out of the car and run then I thought what good is it to run this
object this thing has got complete control of me I was shaking I just
didn't know what to do what was happening I became hysterical I couldn't scream my throat felt tight it was dry
the situation was weird this was the first time I had ever been really scared
my eyes started hurting started burning and I couldn't swallow so there were no other cars on
the road her headlights had gone out she did see the lights of a house but they were about a mile away she tried
stamping on the accelerator but nothing happened then the colored lights on this
object started flashing and she realized that her car was now moving as she says
this thing was taking me off the road I twisted and turned the steering wheel in the opposite direction but no matter
what I did I even tried using the brakes to stop my car gradually moved sideways
and took me under the shoulder of the road so this object pulled her car about
10 ft off the shoulder Rita could now actually hear the object which was making a humming sound which she said
was very much like a swarm of bees or maybe a TV antenna blowing in
the wind then the humming sound stopped and this is when she heard voices
talking to her again I'll just let Rita describe this as she says these voices
came out of the thing this hovering object I want to explain my windows were
rolled up tight and as I said the wind was blowing the voices sounded like a
group of people A Chorus of voices there were all talking at the same time saying
the same thing only they spoke as if what they were saying was being translated into English because the
words were broken these were not impressions in my mind they were external coming from that hovering thing
they sounded like maybe they were talking through a loudspeaker but not quite I couldn't tell whether they were
male or female there were so many of them all at once they gave me a dreadful
message So speaking in chorus this the voices from this UFO said and I quote Hall
Donald's Moravia killed in mesina in a tractor trailer owned by Joe Edinger
Moravia soita recognized this man's name in fact Paul Donalds was the sister of
her friend Maran Donalds the voices continued and said your son will not
remember the time stop from the car from the time you left the highway so that
was the message at this point the UFO moved her car back onto the road she said her car
lights came back on and the car still apparently under control of the UFO
moved on down the highway the object was to her left at this point and coming
around the straightaway the object slowly moved off and Rita was able to
regain control of her car now it took a little bit longer for her to regain her composure and finally
she thought of her son and asked him if he saw anything she said did you see what Mama saw and he replied
no so she drove home to find her husband John concerned about why she was so late
she didn't want to tell him he became increasingly concerned by her silence and she was clearly upset so he asked
her repeatedly what it happened and finally she just broke down in tears and told him everything she said physically
she had headache some eye pain and neck pain and her husband was absolutely
shocked by this story he just wanted to forget the whole thing as frankly Rita
did herself but that evening she did have a nightmare about the incident and the
next afternoon she got a shocking phone call from her sister who said what do
you think of Paul Donald's getting killed in mesina Rita was of course shocked asked
her sister what happened and it was just as these voices from the UFO had said he
had been killed in a tractor trailer owned by Joel Edinger the accident
happened around 400 p.m. on December 12th which was about 3 hours before
Rita's sighting and about 75 miles away Paul Donald was only 29 years
old so Rita's case generated huge interest when it was published in Popular Science magazine and fate
magazine and un reportedly other experiences followed but she became so
tired of all the publicity and attention she was getting she refus to discuss her
experiences any further with any researchers how weird is that I mean
there are a lot of cases where people do receive messages but having a UFO come
down and warn you that someone you know has passed on wow very
strange and in support of R's testimony are the many many cases that were occurring in that area at that time
really incredible now let's move to another case which is very well verified this
one has photographs it has radar returns it's got a great witness a police
officer it's incredibly well investigated case as well probably one
of Denmark's most famous UFO encounters I call this one a very hot UFO this
occurred on August 30 19 1970 in haderslev jutand Denmark and I'm
actually going to include two cases in this segment because there's one that
occurred after it that's remarkably similar and equally strange and compelling so as I said this case is
Denmark's perhaps most famous and best verified UFO encounters certainly among
them and it garnered National headlines and was covered in numerous UFO Publications across the world the w is
Danish police officer iald Hansen marup he was 38 years old at the time of his
his encounter and it was on August 30 he's
1970 around 10:50 p.m. he was driving alone in his patrol car this was an
almost brand new six-cylinder Ford zodiac he was on an isolated Road about
8 to 10 kilm north of Hatter slev Denmark and this is when his life
changed forever he was near the T Junction of the hatter slev V troop
Highway crossing the road to cab Dro and as eval says in his own words suddenly
the car was surrounded by a bright bluish white light and at the same time
the engine stopped the lights of the car also disappeared even the light of the
ignition I drove aside the road and stopped the bright neon light out
outside was so dazzling that I could see nothing with my arm hiding my eyes to
protect them against the light I succeeded in groping my way to the radio
when I got to the microphone and tried to call this station it appeared that the radio was just as dead as any of the
electric installations in the car so now with his car dead and the dazzling
lights blinding him evald had no choice but to sit in his car and wait to see
what would happen next and soon events escalated to a very concerning level because as evald says
the temperature inside the car was increasing and it became pleasantly hot it could be compared to the heat you
feel when you drive against the sun on a summer day slowly his eyes adjusted to
the light over his Patrol vehicle and at the same time the beam of light began to slowly retract allowing him to see the
object which he estimates was about 20 m or 60 ft away and as eval says in his
own words after a while the light was Rising it was a conical light with a
diameter of 4 to 5 m when I was bending forwards and looking up I could see that
the light cone ended at the bottom of a big gray thing if I should describe the
thing I can only say that it was circular and about 10 m in diameter seen
from my position obliquely from Below below the object had two extensions or
domes at the underside they were about 1 and 1 and 1/2 m in diameter not a sound
was heard from this thing after a few seconds the light was drawn into the thing it is difficult to explain how the
light was not extinguished but the bottom of the light was Rising so that it became dark under the cone it took
about five minutes for the light to be drawn up I stepped out of the car and saw how The
Last Remnant of the light cone disappeared into the bottom of the thing in a hole with a diameter of not quite a
meter so when eval stepped out from his car he touched the hood and almost
burned himself on the hood of the car it was so hot and as the cone of light retracted back into the object it
started moving away slowly at first eval thought quickly and managed to snap
series of six photographs of this object with the police car's camera as it moved
off three of them did not come out but three of them clearly show this object
in a matter of a few seconds it vanag vertically into the air still totally silent it was around this time that
another car did pass him on the highway and EV VA thought about flagging this driver down to ask if they had seen
anything but the object was gone so he just let the car drive by he did check
his own Cruiser and the surrounding area but noticed nothing unusual he got back into his car he estimates the entire
encounter lasted just a couple of minutes and as eval says when the object
moved away all lights in the Electric System of the car returned I tried to
start it and it started quite normally just as I again was able to get in touch with the station I reported to the
station what I had experienced so this this is when he found out that another motorist had also
called the station and reported that his car was stopped in roughly the same area on the same night so returning home that
evening evalds wife immediately noticed that he was pale and frightened he told
her about what happened he also called the nearest Danish Air Force Base who
was very interested in what happened and actually took his film for analysis he also shared his encounter
with his fellow police officers most believed him though there was one who expressed some concern about Eva's
mental health now it wasn't long before reporters heard about his encounter and
eval granted a few interviews but when his experience was published in newspapers he began to receive constant
phone calls and interview requests which became so numerous that he came to
regret going public with his encounters now it turned out that several people in the area did say that
they had also seen UFOs on that same night after 3 months of Investigation
the Danish air force closed their investigation of the case saying that they didn't think eval had a UFO
encounter and that perhaps he had seen the landing lights of a passing jet aircraft while at the same time there
was a meteor in the sky and at the same time his car which by the way again was
almost new coincidentally malfunctioned so a pretty obviously
debunking explanation few people agreed with this and in fact eald himself did
recall seeing Air Force jets about 10 minutes after his encounter and they looked quite different now many years
later he found out that a radar operative for the Air Force his name is
n kog said that he had also seen a UFO on his radar scope on the the very same
night of evol's encounter and in the same area and the story doesn't end here
because by incredible coincidence exactly 3 years and one day later on
August 14 at 10:50 p.m. pretty much the same exact time evald was on the same
road this time near Schoo balling about 2 kmers south of his original encounter
when he saw a bright light shining over a field coming from a saucer type UFO
and in this field he could see several horses and cattle panicking and running around inside this cone of light and in
an incredible replay of his previous encounter this UFO moved towards him
came right overhead Shone down a cone of light directly onto his patrol car once
again stopping the car's engine and electrical system this time the object
was tilted at a 45° angle projecting the beam of light right at him and a owing
him to get a good view of the underside of this saucer-shaped craft which he
said had three half circular bumps very similar to the object he had seen
earlier this time he did hear a soft whooing noise coming from the object he
tried to take photos but they did not come out then 3 years later in
1976 evald was driving with another officer along the A10 Highway this is
between cing and Hatter slev not far away when they both saw another UFO a
glowing dome-shaped object floating just above the trees they drove towards it to
get a better look and the object began to move up and down then suddenly disappeared the next day they did learn
from the local newspaper that a woman from a nearby Village had seen a UFO on
the same evening now perhaps related to evol's
encounter is another equally if not more dramatic car stopping case which also
occurred in jutand Denmark this next case occurred on the evening of September 29
1995 and the witness was 24-year-old K Claus lundholm who was heading south
between brand and vge on his way to visit his parents he had his pet dog a
black Labrador in the car who was laying on the back seat it was around 9:30 p.m.
and he was traveling about 60 km per hour and suddenly his dog for no
apparent reason became nervous clous came around a corner in the road and was
shocked to see that the instrument dials on his dashboard went completely crazy
his speedometer dial went up to maximum speed as did the revolutions dial now
the temperature dial went into the red and the needle started vibrating back and forth and at the same time his
windshield wipers start Ed going at high speed and they weren't even turned on he tried flicking the switch to turn them
off but this had no effect and his dog at this point became very agitated and
this is when he looked outside his car and saw that his headlights were pulsating in brilliance becoming dim and
then bright and at the same time his engine began to misfire Claus tried pumping the
accelerator but this had no effect in fact the engine then went completely
dead as did his headlights and his entire electrical system the car rolled
to a stop in the middle of this dark country road now fearful about what was
happening Claus tried several times to turn the key and start the car but nothing happened he did notice one very
weird and curious detail the clock on the dashboard was faintly lit up but
instead of the normal time it read the numbers 88 88 88
8 so clous at this point felt almost like time had stopped or that he was moving in slow motion he continued
trying to restart the car and this is when he began to sense an Indescribable
oppressive presence coming from overhead he hadn't seen anything at this point
but 20 seconds into all of this a blindingly brilliant light exploded over
his vehicle coming from above he said it blinked and pulsated rapidly his dog
began to whine furiously and tried to hide under the back seat now opening the
door and kind of leaning halfway out of his car and looking up clouse who was forced to squint against This brilliant
light saw that this light was in fact coming from a huge disc-shaped object
right above him he could see a series of concentric circles of separate lights
which were situated on the bottom of the craft a bunch of them and they became increasingly bril brilliant towards the
center the object itself he estimates was about 15 M wide and only 4 m above
the car so needless to say this scared him quite badly he retreated back into his
car and shut the door and looking around him he could see that the beam of light from this object extended around his car
and covered the entire section of the road he said it was very sharply defined and weirdly did not illuminate the
surrounding area the light he said was a very strong blue white and had a strange
quivering quality to it he was afraid but very curious so he rolled down his
window and stuck his arm and head outside and looked up and he did notice something else strange the light seemed
to cause a kind of indefinable but powerful sense of peace and Tranquility while he did still have some
fear he says he also felt this incredible Pleasant feeling that he had never experienced
before in fact he felt like he was about to be taken on board or that he might see the entities who were piloting this
craft he had a real strong impression that they were recording him or taking his picture in some way then very slowly
the light diminished in intensity and he saw that the disc-shaped object was now
moving forward ahead of him it moved off towards some nearby trees so low that it
had to tip to a avoid hitting them it then moved out of sight the entire encounter took place in complete silence
so afterwards he sat in his car thoroughly Shook Up tried to calm his dog down who appeared to be equally
traumatized the whole encounter lasted he says no longer than one minute but
after about 3 to four minutes of calming down he tried to start his car it did
start immediately the electrical system functioned normally and he drove straight to his parents and told them
what happened other than sharing the experience with his parents he told nobody for some time but after seeing a
documentary about UFOs he decided to contact researchers who began an
investigation and they discovered that the residents of a farmhouse just a few kilometers away said that at 7:20 p.m.
on that same evening they were in their kitchen when an object came over their
house and sent down a brill iant beam of light into their yard for a full 5
Seconds hard to deny cases like that if there's one thing UFOs are known for
it's coming down over cars driving along at night on a remote highway there are
quite literally hundreds of cases like this and those two are really compelling
cases with quite a bit of evidence uh as well as not only the
radar and the photographs but animal reactions electromagnetic disturbances
of a very strange kind can you imagine your windshield wipers going off at high speed and everything just going haywire
in your car and then you see this giant craft hovering right overhead
amazing now let's move to another case which is largely unique I don't know
that there are many other cases out there like this there's a few but none quite like this I call this one a silver
UFO with prongs this occurred in October of 1973 in the very tiny town of Wilco West
Virginia it is a multiple witness case doesn't have a whole lot of physical evidence to support it but with double
eyewitness testimony that certainly adds a level of credibility to it and this is
a case where we see a UFO hovering over high tension wires quite a few cases of
that as well that's one of the reasons I wanted to include this this very small town of Wilco West Virginia had a
remarkably unusual encounter witnessed by two people Mary Rose and her
11-year-old son Teddy this case was investigated by David Bodner and Ted spickler both muon
field investigators and was published in the muon UFO Journal it was just after dark on a
Monday evening in October of 1973 Tre as Mary and her son Teddy were walking home
after visiting Teddy's grandmother they were approaching some power lines when suddenly a low-flying
saucer-shaped craft covered with bright lights came swooping overhead from
behind them Teddy wondered for just a second if it might be a helicopter but
the object made only a quiet humming noise so it was clearly wasn't a helicopter now at this point both re
Rose and Teddy were standing directly under the power lines and this is When
the UFO positioned itself directly above them and they could see it was a silver white disc about 20 ft in diameter with
red purple and kind of greenish blue lights Rose became filled with fear when
she saw these weird two silver prong likee extrusions coming out from the
bottom of this silver disc and lowering down towards them now judging from the
advance Ed look of this object this craft she definitely believed it was not
ours and was from outer space and she was terrified was trying to capture both
her and her son she said she could feel a strange sensation of heat and
electricity coming from these luring prongs so both Rose and Teddy ran from
underneath this object to a nearby Tool Shed about 60 ft away and hid under the
shed in fact Ro was so frightened she refused to look at the object and hid
her face In Her Arms by the time they hid this object quickly departed though
it took the witnesses a full half hour to compose themselves after this very
close and very unusual encounter a pretty strange case that barely
qualifies as a close encounter of the second kind but I think it might because the witnesses did feel heat coming from
this object I said suspect it was scooping up electricity over the electric lines we have so many cases of
this sort of thing that I think that might be what's going on here this is of course
speculation but turns up a lot all right now we move to another case which is so
strange very well investigated by J Allen heinik himself and involves
multiple Witnesses and not some really strange after effects to it or
Associated events I should say at any rate I call this one struck by a beam of
light from a UFO this occurred on June 17 1977 in cotile Lake in
Louisiana and what a case this is because not only is the event itself strange but what happened afterwards
this next case is a doozy was around dusk on June 17
1977 as five PE people Dale sheater he's
26 years old and his two daughters Gina age 14 and Chrissy age 11 and a couple
who were good family friends were packing up and preparing to go home after a camp out at the cotil Lake
Recreation Area in Louisiana Dale and his two daughters were walking alone
carrying ice chests towels air mattresses and other camping and fishing and swimming gear everyone was just
talking and they had just about reached Road where Dale's pickup was parked and
this is when they all suddenly heard a very strange sound and I'll just let Dale describe it in his own words as he
says I became aware of an ultra low frequency I heard it and felt it vibrate
my sternum simultaneously I looked up toward the sound or sensation as it were and above
the tree line was the outline of a huge craft or UFO it hovered completely still
and had points of Lights surrounding its shape it appeared to have parking lights on it was huge I would guess the size to
be about 75 ft across 50 ft high it was disc shaped but plates and sections were
clearly visible at this very instant the craft floated directly above us almost
it moved immediately yet gracefully almost in a magnetic sense of control
was much closer now and less hidden by the trees the underside was almost
horo the underside was almost hor Sho shaped and irregular but anything below
these points of light were too shadowed for details now as Chrissy says regarding
the sound it was a sound you could feel more than hear I was sort of shocked
into looking it didn't remind me of anything and as Jenny says I couldn't
believe I could be seeing this I never saw anything like it before it was awesome in a Biblical sort of way so all
of them stopped walking and talking all of them looked up in absolute open-mouthed
astonishment and then strange went to incredibly weird and bizarre cuz as Dale
says before we could react the middle of the craft started to Glow but I suspect
this was an illusion of a flood light for I looked to my side and the children were brightly illuminated in their shock
mouths still open holding the swimming gear before we could Shield our eyes or
turn away there came from the same Source several Rays or beams of blue
light they were not diffused but not unlike lasers or laser beams they
appeared to strike us at the solar plexus it was an intense silver blue
thin beam three to five of them centered on our bodies we were immediately
affected I recall hearing crackling sounds in the air right around us but not loud or threatening we were trapped
in what I guess was a force field for we couldn't move hardly at all in a few
moments our entire bodies Shone in the Eerie blue aura we slowly forced our
head down to see our arms glowing with electric blue light movement had become
difficult as in a dream slow heavy so Chrissy
remember this remembers this as she says the blue lights were more focused on us
the white lights were broader and as Gina says when it Shone
down on us like a force field we just had to stand there and look at it Dale
says I had never been subject to such a force field or that type of energy it
kind of fogged my head up after what seemed to be about 10 seconds all the lights vanished instantly along
with the force field the craft began to Glide away over the Treetops so at this point the craft
moved off in the direction it had come from with these weird headlights still on the loud humming sound faded as this
object moved farther away the children immediately began to frantically jump up
and down shouting did you see that Flying Saucer did you see those lights coming down down so Dale was absolutely
stunned by all of this he tried to calm them down find a rational explanation
but there was none and the children were absolutely convinced that they had seen a flying
saucer and Dale slowly came to the same conclusion cuz there was no other
explanation meanwhile Gina and Chrissy ran back to the cabin to inform their
older sister who was in the cabin and they shouted out to her you'll never believe us but and the sister
interrupted and replied oh yes I will I heard you outside so they finished packing up and
began the drive home just the three of them Dale and his two daughters and this is when events became even more strange
because one hour later as they drove home a man in another car a drunk driver
ran two stop signs and slammed very hard into Dale's pickup truck and in fact the
truck was pretty much total old Dale broke his finger Gina broke her leg by
coincidence or synchronicity Chrissy who normally would sit in the window seat had been so
frightened by the encounter that she insisted sitting in the middle in the accident the passenger door was blown
open and everyone thought that had Chrissy been sitting there she probably would have been ejected from the car and
killed Gino who was much taller did have her leg forced under the dashboard and
it was severely mangled in fact she was unconscious for 24 hours spent 2 weeks
in the hospital and wore a cast for the entire summer so researchers wonder and
I quote it is little wonder that they and especially their parents believe
that the UFO encounter may have prevented the death of at least one of
them so they believe that this was not a coincidence and of the two events the
car accident and the encounter the UFO encounter was far more shocking and
Dale's not sure if this was coincidence or not that they were meant to see it but like his daughters he believes that
they he did encounter an extra terrestrial craft as he says I too am
convinced and to this day I cannot recall the memory without heavy moodiness sometimes getting a little
shook up I am a rational person but my feet haven't been on the ground
since that night my life has not been the same since that night I was never
frightened until after it was over underneath I was terrified I thought we
were going to die it was the most frightening and interesting thing I've ever seen it's an incredible feeling to
see something like that you can sense the intelligence the culture shock right
at first is the most evident thing your values changed you realize that there's
someone out there with incredible technology it's got to change you it
just really changes your outlook it was the most awesome and unexplainable experience I've ever had the entire
incident was a shock and a bewilderment so when researchers asked what Jenna
would say if someone didn't believe her she replied there's nothing I could say
I know what I saw I can't make you think I did you'd have to see it
yourself now when Chrissy was asked what the most memorable thing was about the
experience she said the blue light I just remember the light and that it was
real big so Dale unable to forget this experience two months later sought help
and was put in touch with Jay Allen highneck in fact he even considered going under hypnosis to better
understand what happened to him and why as he says I know there's something very
unfinished about it I just want to know why now he doesn't think it was a
negative experience in fact he says he would like to meet extraterrestrials face to face and all the witnesses want
to see the UFO again as it turns out this wasn't Dale's first encounter 7
years earlier in 1970 he and some high school friends had seen a small craft hovering only 40 ft
overhead sending down a cylindrical shaft of light they drove near it at
which point it darted away and in fact his friends were so frightened they also fled the scene how bizarre is that I do
wonder if there's any connection with this auto accident and the sighting
itself the witnesses certainly seem to think so and they take this as a very benevolent encounter even though it did
affect them profoundly and was quite scary such an interesting case there's
always another here's one that is probably one of the most bizarre I've ever heard of and this might only
peripherally be involved with UFOs or ETS but there doesn't seem to be any
other explanation I call this one alien Footprints this occurred on September 4
1979 in R claw Poland and it is truly bizarre as you'll see I really can't say
much more without giving it away so let's just get to the case researcher p
seelas is the investigator for this incredibly Strange Case complete mystery
he wrote about it in his book UFOs over Poland and it appears to involve the
intrusion of some small humanoid who left Footprints inside the witness's
house his name is Jersey walosi he had an apartment located at
539 Cruz wika Street Street in R claw Poland in fact his flat is on the fourth
floor of this building as you can see here on September 4 1979 he left his
flat and he had left the kitchen window open and when he returned he found that
there were 17 strange marks what looked like footprints on the blue vinyl floor
tiles of his kitchen and hallway each Mark was about 13 mm in diameter roughly
oval in shape and separated by 40 cm in fact as P writes it looked as if someone
had marched through the kitchen and hall and then returned leaving in the same direction from which they entered which
presumably was through the open window in the kitchen where the tracks LED but
the thing is this is the fourth floor so whoever came in there would have to have either gotten there from street level or
floated down into it now the floor was made of polyvinyl
chloride tiles and researcher peor had these tiles analyzed at R claw
University and the results were nothing less than astonishing the analysis of
these tiles showed that they had not been melted by high heat as was
previously assumed but instead were affected by some kind of quote highly
concentrated magnetic field it did find traces of ozone the internal structures
of the tile were unchanged meaning there were no crushing marks no deformations
or damage and there were no traces of burns found either it was all just this
weird magnetic field that had affected them somehow the quote Footprints were
sort of whitish In Color the area around them was also slightly
discolored but there was no explanation in other words it couldn't have been lightning it definitely wasn't any
corrosive agent or accelerant it wasn't a heavyweight in fact there was no
logical explanation it appeared exactly as if something had flown in through the open fourth story window walked around
the kitchen into the hallway back to the window and flew off but with no direct
eyewitnesses the mystery of this remains unsolved interestingly the witness
Jersey did get a number of offers from quote collectors who wanted to buy these
weirdly affected floor tiles so there you go how weird is that looks like some
ET walked into this guy's kitchen floated down from above he's on the fourth floor burned his piles and went
on its merry way I like this case because these Landing traces if you will
these ET Footprints are almost impossible to fake so what happened
there nobody knows but man oh man is that bizarre Now we move to an equally
bizarre case really well verified I find this one quite interesting because there
are some really interesting physical effects and multiple Witnesses who are
independent of each other I call this one I was trying hard to hold on to reality that is of course
a direct quote from the witness who's a highly qualified very well educated Witness
always adds a level level of credibility to a person's account this one occurred
on March 8th 1982 in bethl Connecticut
and boy it's a very strange UFO very strange effects as we will see Jay Allen
heinik is the main researcher for this case he interviewed the witness directly
he's anonymous we'll call him John he was an army officer in Vietnam who
worked as an aircraft Observer it was his duty to call in ground and air strikes and identify aircraft what she
could do sometimes by sound alone now at the time of his encounter he was employed as a professional photographer
working for a private company engaged in highly classified military projects and
in fact John held a top secret clearance as J Allen heinik says about this case
this case rates as one of the most bizarre UFO cases I have ever ever come
across it fits no recognized pattern yet was independently witnessed by two
highly technical trained people separated by more than a mile so John's
encounter began when he was at home in his Workshop repairing a camera was 8:15
p.m. again on March 8th 1982 I'll just let John describe what
happened as he says I was seated at my workbench repairing a camera when the
Tool in my hands started to shake and I became aware of a low rumbling sound
which intensified in the space of approximately 10 seconds to the point
where I could no longer hold the tools in my hands because of the vibration at
that point the whole house was shaking and my first thought was that we were having an earthquake later we found that
the vibration of the house had been so great that our washing machine and a floor cabinet had moved 2 to 3 in from
the wall and the flooring had separated from the wall in the amount of a half in at one place for a distance of 2
feet at the point when the whole house was shaking I went into the hallway and met my wife coming out of the bedroom we
both quickly went outside as the sound now seemed to be coming from a definite Direction and seemed to be getting
closer and it was cuz now on the porch John with a pair of binocular in his
hand and his wife both saw this massive craft he estimates it was about 75 ft
High only 100 ft away moving at about 80 knots he said the object itself was
quite dark just a black mass with about 40 to 50 small red lights on either side
he estimates it was about 100 ft long 75 ft wide now they do have two dogs and
they do live right next to an airport and when low flying Flames would come by the dogs would often come out and bark
at them but when this object showed up the dogs did something very unusual as
John says they behaved as never before they were extremely frightened and hid
under the bed something they never do the dogs were petrified so as they stared at this
neither John nor his wife could believe their eyes they could not understand what they were looking at as John says
what we saw doesn't fit into anything I've ever seen before in my whole life I
thought it might be an aircraft crashing but dismissed this thought almost immediately as it remained at a constant
high and was moving too slowly well below the stall speed of any aircraft I
know and its lights looked like no aircraft configuration I had ever
seen so he was most impressed by its slow speed and the low but very loud
rumbling sound also odd was that even though there was a near full moon the
structure between the lights was quote absolutely black as he says this thing
was just completely black in fact it looked to him almost like it was absorbing the light around it with
almost no reflection on it whatsoever both he and his wife did have the impression of immense size and the
weird rumbling sound reminded them of the movie Close Encounters in the Mother Ship as John says it was nothing like
anything I know about it was very close there was no exhaust or smell it was
like being in a rowboat out in the ocean and having a giant oil tanker come Slowly by you really get the feeling of
immensity so this object moved off and following the sighting as is
understandable John was deeply shaken up as he says I was trying hard to hold on
to reality so in a search for answers he started making some phone calls he
called the local and State Police who told him that they were quote swamped with calls from all kinds of people
reporting UFOs now having technical knowledge of aircraft and knowing the lingo he phoned the local airport and
the local Naval Air Station in Norfolk Virginia also the Sikorski air service
at Norfolk and West over Air Force Base now now the airports did say that they
had also received calls but the other agencies provided no useful information
the air traffic controller at oxbury airport said that they had actually seen it and that the quote thing had come
right over one of their own house this is located about 2 miles from John's
house and this guy said that the vibration from this object had made a coffee cup literally walk across the
table and fall to the floor so the next day John spoke with a
fellow Air Force Reserve officer who was driving home in this area and he also saw the same object his friend is in
fact a program manager who works on camera systems electronic counter measures laser designators and more so a
very intelligent guy and he was driving along this country road when this object he says came about 500 ft over his car
causing a very heavy vibration it was moving very slowly he said almost hovering he briefly wondered
if this could be a formation of helicopters but when he saw this black mass and the red lights at the side he
described it exactly the same way he realized it wasn't anything he knew about it was something completely out of
the realm of his experience as he says it bothered me that I couldn't identify
them no structure no silhouette so jlen heinik was very
impressed by this case and as he says the case is so bizarre that one can hope
that some of our readers can suggest a logical explanation the case is a
complete Maverick indeed when Bob Gribble of the UFO Reporting Center in
Seattle notified the center qos about it I was on the verge of not following it
up at all but I finally decided to waste one phone call on it an amazing
encounter by any definition I mean J Allen heinik was absolutely Ely
persuaded it did take place there apparently were quite a few Witnesses I
suspect there's a lot more than the ones we know about because again people rarely report their encounter in any
official capacity and this guy did because he was
educated with aircraft and he wanted to know what was going on I wouldn't
surprise me a bit if there's a whole line of people who saw this object but
didn't tell anybody now let's move to another very strange case which I call High
strangeness in slina this occurred on December 27 2013 in sosina Poland and yeah this is a
very unusual case again a simple sighting but technically a close
encounter of the second kind the effects that the witnesses describe in this case
are really quite unusual it's why I wanted to include this casee it's really
quite compelling and I think you'll find it really fascinating this final very
unusual Close Encounter of the second kind comes from researcher arak
maaza this one involves two witnesses Anna age 64 and her daughter yua age 22
it was 10:42 p.m. on December 27 2013 and UA was turning off the Christmas
tree lights in their home again located in sosina Poland this is when a light
outside the window caught her eye and looking outside she saw a dome-shaped craft covered with bright orange lights
coming out from behind a nearby house it was slightly larger than a full moon she
said it had short and long rays of light coming off the surface weird rays of
light the object itself pulsated with light was pretty close about 150 M away
400 to 500 ft no higher than 10 m above the ground about 30 ft so she called out
for her mother they both saw it they estimated the size of this object was about 7 to 9 ft no larger than a small
passenger car it made no sound that they could hear so the mother Anna joined her
daughter and actually used a pair of binoculars to look at this object she could see a red light on the right side
and a green light on the left said it was hovering right above the high voltage electric lines but weirdly
the Rays of light coming out of this object were not normal some were short
some were long about 2 m but what was so weird is that they kind of cut off after
reaching a length of about 2 m and while the object itself was quite
bright it was not blinding in fact they said it was rather quote Pleasant to the eye it did occasionally tilt giving them
a good view of of the underside this is not a normal plane or aircraft or
helicopter as you can see from their drawings but there were some very high
strangeness details one was that the Witnesses were listening to the radio at the time of
the encounter but the very moment this object came into view the entire
environment around them became enveloped in complete silence the radio didn't fuzz up or malfunction or turn off they
could just know no longer hear it also weird were these strange black spots
that were swirling around the object it looked almost to them like it was absorbing the light around it and in
fact as it approached a street light the beam from the street light seemed to get
pulled away from the light itself I mean the light didn't go out it stayed on but
the beam itself kind of disappeared or was somehow suppressed in fact even the outlines of the nearby
houses next to this object became pulled into this weird Darkness it looked to
the witnesses almost as if the object was exerting some sort of energy field around it that was pulling light towards
it and a third element of high strangeness was that both Witnesses felt
that time almost seemed to come to a stop they watched this object they thought for about 10 to 15 minutes as it
moved around but when the object moved off they were shocked to see that only 5 minutes had passed so that was weird and
as soon as this object was out of view the noise of the radio immediately filled the house so they were really
puzzled by that and in fact the daughter was so filled with fear that she was unable to get any sleep that night she
had previously had two encounters and after the first one had been having regular dreams about
UFOs this one really scared them for some reason and at this point neither of them wanted to talk about UFOs anymore
or have any other encounters so there you go another amazing High strangeness
case I like that one because it is a good example of the so-called Oz factor
with this unnatural silence that pervades the environment during an encounter but it's also got incredibly
strange effects involving light around this craft and also of course the weird sense of
timelessness that the witnesses report this is something we do hear in a lot of
cases so yeah it definitely is an important case I think so that's it for
today eight cases from all over the world which you would probably categorize as Close Encounters of the
second kind because they do affect the environment in some way yeah no
humanoids but I think you'll agree those cases were very interesting and certainly add to our knowledge of what's
going on here that's why I wanted to do this episode I think these cases show just how incredibly strange a UFO
encounter can be so that's it for today once again thank you so much for
watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep asking those hard
questions because it's up to you to do it don't know if our governments are ever going to willingly disclose it's up
to all of us to make sure that we know all we can about about this subject so
yeah keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun I
will see you next Friday stay safe bye for now
