DO ALIENS HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR?
Apr 7, 2023

Summary:
Apr 7, 2023
Do aliens have a sense of humor? It’s a question many people have asked. And the answer appears to be, yes! In fact, there are many cases where ETs show a sense of humor. There are accounts of ETs smiling, laughing and showing in many ways that they, like humans, do find some things funny. These cases reach back decades and are still occurring today.

Many contactees have seen this firsthand. This video presents more than a dozen cases in which aliens exhibit a sense of humor very much like our own. One example comes from contactee, Bill Foster. After being abducted many times, he wondered how big the craft was. Sometimes it seemed small, and other times large. Finally, he decided to ask how big the craft was. Bill says that the gray seemed to laugh and told him, “It’s as big as we need it to be.” It wasn’t the only time his questions amused the ETs.

In his book, “Secret Life,” researcher David Jacobs Ph.D. presents a case involving a young girl who was taken onboard a craft. During a physical exam, the ETs cut off a lock of her hair and then, in an act of apparent humor, held it up to his bald head and showed it to the other grays! 

In 1910, two witnesses in St. Merryn, Cornwall, England saw a red object hovering in the clouds. Through the portholes of the craft they saw a group of little humanoids chattering and pointing down at the witnesses, laughing.

On Oct 15, 1954, an anonymous gentleman from Shamsabad, Iran saw a “short young man” looking down at him from inside a UFO. The witness was frightened by the sight, but then noticed that the UFO pilot was laughing at him, apparently at the witness’s frightened expression.

A similar case occurred in 1959 in Aubagne, France. Miss Moulet had just gone outside to hang her laundry when an egg-shaped object hovered overhead. Looking down at her through a porthole were about twenty human-looking ETs, smiling and laughing.

A strange case of UFO contact was revealed by John Keel. On Nov 17, 1966, two policemen from Gaffney, South Carolina came upon a landed saucer. Out stepped a short humanoid who began asking them all kinds of question. He seemed puzzled that the two officers were dressed in identical uniforms. After answering the ET’s questions, the officers asked the ET where he was from. The ET seemed to think the question was funny and began laughing, and then returned into the craft, which promptly took off.

Whitley and Ann Strieber present a case from a woman who, in the summer of 1968, was driving with her daughter outside of Flagstaff, Arizona when they were both taken onboard a craft. Although initially quite frightened, the woman was amazed when the human-looking ETs communicated telepathically, smiling and laughing during the entire time she was onboard. Interestingly, the ETs were teaching her how to pilot the craft.

On Feb 7, 1969, Thiago Machado of Pirassununga, Brazil encountered a landed UFO and occupants. Thiago was smoking a cigarette, and the ETs appeared to find this behavior quite amusing.

In Jul of 1972, a woman was woken by a sound outside her home in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. Looking out the window, she saw a UFO hovering over the building next door. Inside were two male human-looking figures. As she watched, one of them said something to the other, which was apparently funny, as the ET began to laugh.

On Oct 19, 1975, a couple was driving with their dog near Llangothlin in New South Wales, Australia when a UFO began pacing their car. The dog became scared and jumped into the front seat and began acting up. Looking up into the craft, they saw several human-looking figures staring down at them. One of them was pointing at them, apparently laughing at the fact that their pet dog was jumping all over inside the car.

A bizarre case comes from researcher, Salvador Frexiedo. In the summer of 1976, a busload of passengers in Santander, Colombia were shocked when twenty short humanoids emerged from the forest and stopped the bus, then began rocking back and forth, eventually tipping it over on its side. The humanoids began laughing hysterically and then, on cue, ran off back into the forest.

In Aug of 1977, Viktor Alexandreovich was boating on the Dnieper River in Ukraine when he was taken onboard a craft piloted by human-looking ETs. He says that the ETs were very kind, smiled often and had a strong sense of humor.

An amazing case of ET contact occurred in an unknown location to teacher, Mark Andrews. On Sep 3, 1995, he was invited onboard a craft to help ETs become oriented to Earth life. While onboard the craft, he was assigned to a young boy who pointed at him and began laughing with amusement. He told Mark, “I am assigned to be your baby sitter!”

These are just some of the many accounts of ET humor. Cases involving ET humor are more common than many people realize. They show that ETs are more like us than different, and that they share the same emotions we do.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I call this episode do et's have a sense of humor and the answer of course is yes they do I found 
quite a few cases one of you out there actually suggested this topic to me I thought it was a 
great idea I've been asked this question many times so I really wanted to explore it more in 
depth I did I found a bunch of cases where ETS do Express humor laughing having fun finding things 
funny so I think this will be quite an interesting episode and I've certainly not heard a lot about 
this in fact just recently I interviewed a gentleman from Canada from the Ontario area 
in Canada I'll call him Carter that's not his real name he does not want his real name used 
I will be talking about his case in more depth in the future but I'd like to give you a little preview here because it involves this topic of humor 
one day Carter who was just a teenager was walking across a bridge and looking down over 
the side at a parking lot a hundred feet away saw a little gray E.T and it really quite startled him 
and in fact as soon as he realized what he was seeing he kind of jerked I mean oh my gosh look 
and what was really funny is this gray was looking right at him and sort of mimicked him in a very 
playful funny way jerked the same way as if the gray was frightened to see him as well and that 
really caught Carter's attention and made him lean forward and stare even harder at this little gray 
and at that moment the gray did exactly the same movements so this kind of made Carter laugh it was 
clear to him that the gray was kind of playing with him in a very fun sort of humorous way 
and he said it removed all the fear it made the gray seem very much human to him so this 
is an example of the sort of thing I'm talking about there are a lot of cases like this where 
ETS do Express a sense of humor so I'd like to take you on a little Journey Through Time quoting 
some various contactees and quoting various cases starting at the earliest to the latest 
coming from all over the world really and we can see for ourselves that ETS do in fact have a sense 
of humor and express emotions in a wide variety of ways so let's just get started I'd like to 
start with a quote from UFO contact D Judy Carroll I'll just quote her directly she sort of channels 
ETS and one of her ETS goes by the name of Maris so this is Judy talking here and I quote 
speaking of ETS and their sense of humor I thought I'd share a joke one of the great 
Elders told me a few years ago Helene and I were running a contacty group at the time and 
people had questions they wanted answered so we suggested they write them down so I could sit 
quietly to allow Maris to communicate the answers to me neither Maris nor I enjoy voice channeling 
as the grades don't communicate verbally being telepathic so writing is our preferred medium 
one of the questions was very complex to do with Galactic Warfare or some such thing and as I sat 
at the computer I was thinking to myself oh boy this one's a bit of a worry just not into all that 
Star Wars stuff next thing I became aware of Maris standing beside me and I could pick up on his 
amusement he asked what do you reckon is a real worry knowing that there was a joke in the air 
I responded with I don't know Maris tell me that came his answer quick as a flash being taken on 
board an ET ship and finding a copy of an idiot's Guide to the universe open on the control console 
needless to say I totally cracked up it took me about five minutes to stop laughing enough to get 
on with answering the questions I love gray humor so that's one unusual example but there are many 
here's another contact D I'd like to quote directly this is just a short quote from Jackie 
alcion and as she says I'm going to be clear these ETS that are in my life have not hurt me 
they might appear intimidating but they actually have a sense of humor and do things to make me 
laugh they've saved my butt a few times too so yeah a short quote but here's another contact 
D saying that they do have a sense of humor I talked to Whitley streber and he said the same 
thing they will often do things that he finds very funny and that's true of Dolly saffron the subject 
of my book symmetry A true UFO Adventure if you watch my channel you probably know her pretty well 
but she had an experience when she was with the Grays being taught by them and a very funny thing 
came up dolly was describing an event involving what we hear on Earth called the Darwin Awards 
and this involved an incident where a gentleman died in a very unusual and frankly funny way he 
was giving an elephant a suppository when the elephant's bowels let loose and basically this 
gentleman was buried in the elephants um there's no nice way of putting it crap he died suffocated 
so not only did the students that dolly was with appreciate the Grim humor of the situation but she 
says so did the ETS and I'll just quote Dolly directly here as she says it cracked them up 
they find humor in some of the dumb things that we do and they find it funny as hell humans are 
funny to them they just think it's funny when you do something so stupid they also find our emotions 
odd because we act like idiots sometimes and they find it funny and that she's had a number of funny 
situations with them I mean one time they returned her wearing a baby doll nightie it's kind of a 
joke she thinks it probably was a joke uh but yeah that's not what she normally wears these were not 
her clothes and there are a number of examples where they do this sort of thing to people 
and another example comes from the very controversial case involving Stan Romanek 
he's from Colorado he wrote a couple of books the first one called messages I know his case 
is controversial I've interviewed him and his wife I think there's probably legitimacy to 
it and that he was framed by the government I don't know you can make up your own minds about that but I he did have an example of E.T humor so I thought I would include it here 
uh he talks about a time that he was taken and I'll just quote him directly I wore one of my 
favorite t-shirts to bed was one that had been given to me by my friend Mark at my bachelor party 
two years earlier and it read I've been abducted by aliens and all I got was this lousy t-shirt 
so he was too embarrassed to really wear it outside the house and he used it as a night shirt instead it was around 1 45 a.m one evening when he woke up to hear his wife coughing next to 
him in bed and he was somewhat concerned because he had just been dreaming that the gray aliens 
were there working on her and he thought that maybe she had been taken so he got out of bed and 
went to the bathroom and that's when he received an incredible shock as Stan says as soon as I 
turned the bathroom light on I noticed something unusual it seemed that instead of wearing my 
novelty t-shirt I had on a woman's red in black plaid flannel nightgown several sizes too small 
he rushed back into the bedroom and asked his wife is this yours tell me is this yours 
and she looked at him barely able to keep from laughing and said no it's definitely not mine 
at this point they both burst out laughing snack on was far too small and he actually needed his 
wife's help to get out of it so I wrote about some of these types of cases of people being 
returned in the wrong clothes or to the wrong place even in my book not from here volume 3. 
I'm wondering if those are a mistakes or if these are the ETS just being funny 
here's another example which comes from researcher David Jacobs in his book Secret Life 
and he talks a little bit about alien humor and I'll just quote David Jacobs directly as he says 
abductees rarely describe humor or lightheartedness in any of the aliens although we 
do have one reported episode the beings had just caught up cut off a lock of a young girl's hair 
the taller being then put the hair up to his head and showed it to the other beings this apparently 
was amusing in the main however abductees say that the beings do not express a sense of fun so that's 
his opinion I'm not sure I totally agree with it but yeah he has at least one case involving humor 
and there's another gentleman I interviewed his name is Bill Foster he actually wrote a book 
about his experiences where he was taken with his wife and two others in the state of North Carolina 
he wrote a book about his experiences called the black triangle abduction 
and he's had many many experiences of being taken on board and talking with the grays in fact he 
had so many experiences at some point he pretty much got over his fear and was able to have long conversations with them and he has a couple of interesting incidents involving what seems to be 
E.T humor and I'll just quote him directly he was on board and was asking them questions well they 
were talking about time and the ET said he tells me that we have gone to a reasonable distance 
where they are certain the ship can remain in stasis then he tells me that they remain in stasis 
for the time needed to complete their work and then they can return me to the point of contact 
or little time in my world has passed and I asked him yet again what is the stasis point so they're 
he's talking about how they pull him out of time basically and then return him minutes afterwards 
and as Bill Foster says the big guy patiently tells me that it is a safe point for them and 
it should be immaterial to me since I cannot see outside of this room anyway I asked him why if 
we are here outside the gravity of the earth do we have gravity here aboard this ship and you 
know that's the closest thing I have ever seen to a laugh inside of a brain before apparently 
I said something very funny to him unknown to me of course but he doesn't bother to answer 
that question so I guess they must maintain their own gravity system somehow so the gray apparently 
found Bill Foster's question amusing to him about how they have gravity on board their ship 
and he had another incident very similar to that where the Grays expressed amusement and he was 
asking about the size of the craft because it seemed to change size each time he was on board 
and he said to the gray you know I want to see more of this place I am sick of this same room 
every time how big is this place as bill says now that's the first time I ever saw this gray smile 
in fact I said it twice now that was an idiotic answer he said it's as big as we need it to be he 
had a great knack for just passing a question by as if he didn't doesn't want to answer something 
but it was clearly an equ a question which amused the gray again a really unusual example 
but there are a lot of them and here's one that really made me laugh this is also a very unusual 
example because it comes from Robert Monroe Robert Monroe is best known for his series 
of three books about his own experiences with astral projection with out of body experiences 
and during one of his out-of-body experiences he asked his spirit 
guide to take him to see a non-earth entity one that he could communicate with easily 
and his spirit guide agreed and off they went and I'll just quote Robert Monroe directly here 
as Robert Monroe says somewhat to my surprise my friend offered to lead me to one and we set 
off through the darkness in what seemed only a moment we flashed into a space filled with stars 
just below us was what I recognized as our moon and in the near distance the huge blue and white 
marbleized Globe the Earth I looked around where was this super non-human intelligence 
she says his guide told him to look behind and above and as Robert Monroe says I was astonished 
just 20 feet above me and stretching for what seemed to be miles was a huge circular 
saucer-shaped object a typical Flying Saucer as so often described but a thousand times larger 
much too big to credit but as I had that thought it shrank instantly to some 200 feet in diameter 
then a door in the bottom slid open and a figure a man a very human looking man emerged and walked 
yes walked across to where I floated as he approached I recognized him Short Round chubby 
dressed with the sort of shabby gentility and wearing a gray top hat his nose red and bulbous 
his mouth a leering grin he was an exact replica of the star of so many comic movies I had enjoyed 
in the physical when I was young WC Fields this replica projection hologram whatever it was spoke 
like Fields as well with the same intonations and repetitions he invited me aboard and showed 
me into what appeared as a large domed room with pictures on its walls of every comedian I had ever 
heard and many more of whom I hadn't together with thousands of scribbled jokes and cartoons 
he described this all as his cargo I framed the question in my mind cargo what do you mean cargo 
and I continued you can drop the impersonation I can take you exactly as you are 
the alleged ET replied you really mean it don't you but I'll keep it if you don't mind it helps 
me to think like a human or would you prefer someone else Groucho Marx perhaps Monroe replied 
no no stay as you are tell me what you are doing hanging around Earth my boy I'm an exporter the 
ET replied Robert Monroe said I see what do you have that we need apart from this spaceship 
the UT replied I must have used that term wrong I export from here not to my friend 
Robert said what possible thing could we have that is valuable to you you're obviously way ahead of 
our technology you use thought communication we have nothing you could want or need 
he scratched his nose well sir it's not easy to get it but I do yes sir I do we don't have any 
and you can't imagine how valuable something is if you don't have any Robert Monroe asked don't 
have any what the ET said I've been Gathering it for ages it used to be very rare but there's more 
of it about now Robert Monroe said you've lost me the UT replied sometimes you need to know the 
civilization to understand it that's one of the problems I still don't see Robert Monroe said 
the E.T replied you humans have it and it's very rare and valuable among the rest of the 
intelligent species in what you call the physical universe and elsewhere very rare and valuable 
sir I'm a specialist in collection you don't understand I see let me explain please do it's 
a one in a million product and you humans have it a sense of humor jokes fun the best tonic there 
is for overloaded mind systems it auto erases the tension and pressure almost every time it's used 
Robert Monroe said so you cruise around Among Us looking for the newest and latest exactly the E.T 
replied you humans catch sight of our collection units every now and then you get the wrong idea 
you even make UFO jokes about us all we want to do is look and listen nothing else apart from the 
odd practical joke just to keep in training and now if you'll excuse me sir I must be on my way 
suddenly I found myself outside the spaceship which was rapidly diminishing into the far distance now I knew that at least humans have one unique quality 
so I don't know make of that what you will it's a bit of an outlier like some of these cases 
but now I'd like to get into the actual contact cases the physical contact cases starting very 
early in time moving all the way up to the present day and here's a case which occurred in Saint 
Marin in Cornwall this is in England and it dates all the way back to 1910. there were two witnesses 
who saw a red object resembling a ship among the clouds they said and they could see apparently 
through the portholes that this object contained a large number of little dwarf-like creatures that 
were chattering and laughing and pointing down at the witnesses so they were apparently having 
a good time this case comes from Janet and Colin board in their book modern mysteries of Britain so 
that's an unusual case for sure but it shows et's laughing and chattering and having a good time 
here's another case which comes from the Flying Saucer review 
and this one occurred on October 14 1954 and the location is shamsabad Iran 
there was one witness who saw a five meter wide luminous object this was about 300 
feet away and approaching more closely he perceived quote a short young man 
standing on a circular piece of metal in the middle of this glowing object and this 
figure was looking around him and sort of searching and so he got closer to about uh 
60 feet from this saucer and now he could see that this pilot was actually laughing at the terrified 
expression on the witness's face so he found the person's expression funny and at this point 
suddenly this object shot straight up into the air at unbelievable speed and vanished here's another 
case which occurred in obania this is in France obania it's occurred in the end of October 1959 
ismulay 45 years old was with her three children and went outside to hang up her laundry this was 
around dusk and she saw this egg-shaped object descend silently and hover just above her 
through a very large triangular shaped window in front it was illuminated she could see about 
20 people tall with wavy blonde hair light skin wearing white suits and short sleeves they were 
all human looking and she says they all appeared to be smiling or perhaps even laughing at her 
and they were there for a good 10 minutes or so before suddenly taking off at super high speeds 
so this again shows et's with emotions or a sense of humor here's a very interesting case a new one 
with this one occurred on November 17 1966. in the town of Gaffney this is in South Carolina 
this is a pretty involved case it was investigated by a UFO researcher John Kiel it occurred at 4 
00 am and there were two witnesses two police officers Charles Hutchins and a g husky 
they were driving just outside of Gaffney on a street called the West Buford Street Extension 
and as they came around the corner and they were in the road they saw this metallic object directly 
in front of them coming in for an apparent Landing and it stopped about 20 feet above the ground 
the witnesses described it as spherical with sort of a wide flat Rim around it they saw no lights 
or portholes it was dark but reflected the dull gold color in the headlights of their police car 
and uh they drove pretty much right up to it got out of the their Cruiser to look at this 
thing more closely and the estimated was about 20 feet in diameter suddenly a door 
opened silently on the underside of the sphere a short little ladder came down and light came 
pouring out through the opening and they couldn't see anything in the interior until suddenly this figure appears descends the ladder and walks slowly towards the two police officers until 
it's about 15 or 20 feet away as officer Hutchins says he didn't move stiffly he moved just like 
anybody else but kind of slow like he was taking his time he wasn't scared of us or anything 
he said he was quite short maybe four feet tall had no helmet or headgear but was dressed in 
a gold suit without any markings no buttons no zippers it was just shiny like metal and started 
asking them all kinds of questions and they asked him questions too but he would not answer 
uh this figure was standing in the grass so they couldn't see his feet and they couldn't 
really remember the entire conversation but they do remember that this figure spoke perfect English 
and as officer Hutchins says he didn't have any accent or anything he acted like he knew exactly 
what he was saying and doing and didn't make any quick moves or false moves you just stood there 
so he this figure wanted to know why Hutchins and the other officer husky were dressed alike 
in their uniforms his speech was very precise he pronounced each word carefully and finally 
the officers asked this figure where he was from and this is when the figure just laughed so he 
apparently the figure found this question funny or didn't want to answer it this was a brief meeting 
perhaps two or three minutes and then the figure said I will return in two days turned and walked 
back into the object which took off with a low whirring sound rose up and was gone this case 
became pretty well known in fact investigators went to the site and found numerous Footprints 
at the site where this little man had stood apparently he did not return like he promised 
and that was the end of that case but certainly an unusual one where again an E.T is laughing
here's another case which I found quite interesting this took place outside of Flagstaff 
Arizona in the summer of 1968 in the Mojave Desert and this actually comes from Whitley and 
Ann streber in their book the communion letters and it involves a lady and her daughter who were 
driving about two hours outside of Flagstaff when they saw strange lights in the sky and suddenly 
right in front of their car there was this huge dark object with a row of Lights in the middle 
the next thing the lady knows she's being pulled through the windshield of her car she looked 
back to her car nobody was in it she and her daughter were apparently both being taken on board 
and finding herself on board she asked about her daughter and the ETS said that don't worry she's going to be all right and this was telepathically at which point 
the woman calmed down she said she felt very much soothed and unusually happy she described these 
beings as pretty much human-like quite tall about six and a half feet tall they were wearing robes 
they had sort of silvery skin she said round eyes that were almost a violet bloom but she felt a 
real connection to them it was like her long lost family she said it was almost like a homecoming 
they seemed to be smiling she says though their mouths did not move and she was in this room which 
was about 25 feet wide semi-circular and she said she saw what looked like screens along one wall 
and they were showing various terrains strange symbols and other things 
and there was a table in the center of the room with some chairs and she says that some of these were facing the screens and while another ET was at a desk 
area and was standing from time to time moving things around but did not look up 
and she says two of them seemed to be laughing all the time they kept saying welcome welcome 
in her mind and laughing so this was a pleasant experience for her though initially frightening 
they started talking about human Origins and alien intervention on the planet Earth 
and they told her that her name in their tongue was actually shalisha they actually 
told it to her many times shalisha Lee akumu Ram saying it over and over until she got it right 
they told her that these words could actually be found in Earth literature which was true 
but she said she felt much love flowing from them and they helped her understand this name the Earth 
lineages that went way back to the Stars it's an interesting case there's quite a lot to it 
they took her into another room which apparently contained the ship's driving mechanism 
and in front of her she saw this huge Crystal about three feet across in the middle shaped 
like two pyramids placed Base to Base she says it appeared multi-faceted and at times was totally 
brilliant and jewel-like was suspended in the air about four feet from the floor 
and I found this part interesting they told her to put her mind into the Crystal and as she did 
so she'd be able to learn how to fly the ship one of them telepathically actually told her 
how to do it she tried and failed but they kept encouraging and coaxing her and she could hear 
them smiling she they'd say go on you can do it and finally she got it right they began to move 
out first above the Earth and then through space and she asked why she had to do this and they said 
so that you can remember flying and piloting when necessary and then they started laughing 
and after this was information was placed into this Crystal nothing more was needed they said 
and the experience went on for some time until finally they said it was time to return to Earth 
there is much more to this case which you can read in the communion letters but I 
thought it was interesting because the ETS were smiling and laughing throughout this experience and they were also teaching her how to Pilot the craft which is certainly 
what Dolly saffron has reported and also Grant Cameron in his book Sky Pilots 
which is all about people who've been taught how to fly the craft so that's another example of that 
and here's another case February 7 1969 this took place in PIRA sanunga this is in Sao Paulo Brazil 
and the main witness is Thiago Machado this is a very well-known case in Brazil 
investigated by researchers Nigel rhymes nedes Martins and reginaldo Da Silva 
but it's an interesting case because people in the area were taught saw this object on a Hillside and 
this awakened the main witness Thiago Machado he's 19 years old so he woke up got his binoculars and 
went to see this object and he walked up to it and got to within 30 feet of it and saw that it 
was a domed disc aluminum colored this is about 12 feet in diameter five feet high not very big 
door opened and from this door two humanoid figures emerged and floated to the ground you 
could see two others inside the craft through portholes says these figures were short about 
four and a half feet tall dressed in tight silvery jumpsuits covering them from head to toe 
they were wearing transparent helmets he said they had kind of a yellowish skin slanted eyes 
very thin lips and mouth and they approached right up to him about 10 or 15 feet away 
and they started laughing at Thiago apparently because he was smoking a cigarette 
so they seem to be interested in that so he tossed the cigarette pack close to one of them 
who put his hand above it and this pack floated up into the et's hands and he says the 
ET spoke in this weird sort of horse guttural sounds and uh once one of the ETS in the craft 
called out to the witnesses the entities walked backwards and re-entered through the door 
and we're halfway up into the craft when one of them pointed a tube-like device at Thiago it 
emitted a bluish flame that sort of went towards him and when it hit him he became paralyzed 
this object took off horizontally at which point Thiago fainted when he woke up he had 
a mark where this beam had struck him and on the ground Witnesses researchers found three 
Landing leg marks so it's an interesting case with physiological effects and Landing traces 
but important here is that the ETS found it very funny that he was smoking a cigarette which I 
can see how that would be funny so many cases here's another which occurred in July of 1972. 
this occurred in New Zealand specifically in lower Hutt New Zealand a woman reported that she was 
awakened In Her Bedroom by a blue light shining in through her window and annoys like a spinning top 
and she rushed to the window and saw this object your classic Flying Saucer she said 
it was more like an inverted soup dish I was hovering over the building next door 
and on top of this object was a clear Dome and she could clearly see two 
male figures human looking wearing shiny blue satin-like suits with bald heads one appeared 
to be controlling the object and the other had his back to the witness and at this point the 
figure turned towards the other ET said something and began laughing so this lasted for about a 
minute at which point the object shot straight up and disappeared over the wainu Mata Hill 
so this sighting right in the witness and she told nobody about it for about five years but 
finally did step forward to tell her account important here is that these two ETS one of them 
told the other something and it started laughing so again they do appear to have a sense of humor 
here's another case this occurred in langu New South Wales this is in Australia and the date of 
this encounter is October 19 1975. this occurred in the evening one of the main investigators 
is Australian investigator Bill Chalker he's written a number of books the main Witnesses 
are Anonymous we know them only as Mr and Mrs M and they were driving to their home in Armadale 
and in their 1974 Ford station wagon with their dog their dog was a 10 to 12 month old Samoyed 
the dog was asleep in the back seat and they're traveling along the New England Highway heading 
south and after passing the town of Glenn Inns they saw this bright light rising up over a hill 
and Mr M was so startled he said what the bloody hell and this woke up both the wife and the dog 
the dog began yelping and climbed over the front seat into Mrs M's lap and frantically 
tried to bury its head into her lap as she says the dog was going crazy so they're looking at 
this object and it's coming closer and they can now see it's a long cigar-shaped object 
with a bright silvery surface like unpainted aluminum it was about 25 to 30 meters away 
quite large about 150 feet long it had what appeared to be short stubby wings 
and a large front cockpit window but they could see six other large portholes or Windows in two 
rows one above the other going down the side of the object this was behind the main cockpit 
window and all these windows were brightly lit you could see inside of them and they saw 
two figures sitting down towards the front of the object in in what looked like white backed chairs 
they saw three more figures visible from the hips up standing close by looking out the large cockpit 
window directly towards them these figures were humanoid and they said seemed quote pretty normal 
they were all wearing silvery colored coveralls from the neck down they could see all kinds of 
what looked like instrument panels with green blue and red lights blinking and pulsating 
and two of the apparent Pilots kept turning their heads and looking out towards the station wagon 
now they said that the shortest standing figure was actually laughing and pointing at the station 
wagon they believed that the antics of their dog who was still freaking out I said this 
figure looked female with shoulder length brownish hair and she seemed to be the one who was piloting 
at any rate the these three figures seem to be smiling and the woman actually waved at them 
and this object paced the station wagon for about three kilometers and was just above the 
ground Maybe a hundred feet or so and uh kept pacing their station wagon alongside the road 
occasionally stopping and hovering and the dog was still upset but at some point they stopped the 
car the guy was driving had our movie camera with them and it quickly took some films of this object 
and at some point this object just took off though the witnesses did get the impression that the ETS 
told them that they would return sometime in the future so this lasted for about 10 or 15 minutes 
the witness Mr M did send his film in to get developed and when it was returned there was no 
sign of the sequence where he had filmed this object and examining he saw that the film had 
actually been spliced he wrote a letter of complaint to the film processor who told them 
that they would not print anything obscene or detrimental which was clearly a debunking excuse 
uh and they later would receive calls from someone who threatened them told them not to speak about 
their case so it's unfortunate because they had apparently taken some really good film of this 
and it was covered up it's an interesting case but what I found interesting here 
was that the figures inside the craft were amused by the antics of their dog it's unusual 
a lot of these cases are really quite bizarre especially this next one which occurred in the 
summer of 1976 in the Santander area of Columbia this is in South America 
and this was investigated by researcher Salvador frixado 
and this is an unusual case it involves a group of people who are on an old bus filled to capacity 
riding up an isolated and wooded area of a Mountain Road at very low speed it came around 
a turn in the road and the passengers watched is about 20 short dwarf-like beings emerged from the 
forest they actually grabbed a hold of the back of the bus and would not let it move and at this 
point some of them began pushing on the side of the bus rocking it back and forth until suddenly 
it actually overturned this naturally freaked out the passengers who scrambled out and watched the 
beings who were apparently laughing and they said obviously enjoying the spectacle and suddenly as 
if obeying an unheard order the beings quickly retreated into the forest and vanished I don't 
know what to make of that case it's very unusual I don't know I included here for what it's worth 
you can make up your own minds about it here's another very unusual case this occurred in Ukraine 
actually the exact area is olginskaya zatoka along the banks of the deniper river this was at night 
in August of 1977. the main witness is a driver 39 years old and his name is Victor alexandrovich 
he had gone fishing on the banks of the Juniper river near the outskirts of Kiev 
and was sleeping in his boat under a tarpaulin and in the middle of the night someone he says 
awakened him entered his boat and woke him up and he was about to defend himself but was 
unable to move and at this point he saw the face of a strange looking entity began 
to speak telepathically and said do not be afraid there is no danger we won't hurt you 
so Victor calm down and says that he was invited to come along with this E.T so we went outside 
of his boat and saw an oval or egg-shaped craft sitting along the banks of the river 
the door opened up and they went inside this craft 
according to Victor these ETS were very much human looking and in fact there was 
a very beautiful woman he said on board the only real difference was that they had pointed ears 
that very otherwise very much like humans he says they smiled and possessed a sense of humor 
he said they had sort of a bronzed skin very flat noses and were dressed in a dull 
gray tight-fitting overalls and they took him on this little trip over a landscape and finally up 
into space and he freaked out when he realized that they were far off of the earth which you 
could see quite far below him and he started panicking and begging the ETS to take him back 
the ETS calmed him down at which point they visited he says a Mothership and inside this 
mother ship this is quite an involved case they showed him in a holographic image of their planet 
and also their buildings they told him that they come from the Tau seti system 
and it was a long involved encounter finally they returned him to his boat and told him you 
have experienced much this night I will make it so you will be able to sleep the whole day after that you will awake remembering nothing but gradually your memory will return 
which is exactly what happened you'd later upon Awakening did see other boaters who were 
in the area and they said that they saw many quote wonders and tried to approach but they 
said that their boat engines stalled so there were apparently outside witnesses to that case 
but important here is that according to Victor these et's smiled and possessed a sense of humor 
all right here's another unusual case this occurred on September 3rd 1995 this 
comes from the UFO experiences blog spot and involves a teacher by the name of Mark Andrews 
who was woken up after midnight one evening on September 3rd 1995 
when his with his phone ringing and he heard a female voice saying we have some students 
here from another planet would you be willing to help in their Earth orientation so he was clearly 
surprised by this but said okay and the voice said we have one standing in your driveway follow her 
so he exited his house and they're in the driveway he said stood a very pretty short Mediterranean 
looking girl she had ornately woven hair she was dressed in a burgundy wrap-around robe 
and he followed her around the side of his house and the next thing he know there was this flash of light and he found himself being pulled up into a craft well above Earth 
he says this figure was very young she was short five feet tall and looked around 17 years of age 
and once on board the craft she turned to him and said we are going to take a shower 
and that alarmed him at first until he realized that they were actually just shining this sort 
of what he believed a disinfecting light he did not need to take his clothes off so this 
matches what other contact he's have told Betty andreasen described something very much like that 
he found this interesting because as this lady began speaking to him it was clear that her 
English skills were not fully developed and she was making grammatical errors 
it's a long involved case he looked outside a porthole and could see a huge star field 
and it really quite stunned him to see all these Stars so brightly they showed him various 
diagrams and maps and showed him asteroids and comets and stuff that were moving towards Earth 
that they were helping along with this to make sure that none of these would threaten the planet 
yeah that's where they were from and this lady responded we call our world 
leilari that's l-e-l-a-r-i and actually showed him a projection on a screen 
and he says it looked like the Big Dipper the uh constellation so he went from one room to 
another and encountered a tall blonde and very beautiful human looking person 
and then he was taken to a room where he had an examination performed on him uh he lied down at 
a table and after being exam examined the E.T smiled at him and said your exam is finished 
and he was then taken to another room which she said had the feeling of a break room 
and here's where something kind of funny happened a very pleasant short human looking 
man which looked very young to him about high school age 
quickly pointed at him and began laughing and told him I am assigned to be your babysitter 
so he apparently found this funny Mark Andrews the witness was then brought up to the control room 
and looked through the view screen and he talked to the guy who was apparently piloting The Craft 
and asked him if he could he Mark Andrews asked this guy if he could speak in his own 
natural language because he's very interested in language this is when he asked that he felt 
this incredible sense of compassion and that the guy was very curious about him he described this 
person as being very human looking but sort of Native American facial features 
and the guy did speak in his own language which Mark said sounded almost Finnish or Latin 
so at this point he did ask if he could keep a souvenir and he did not get to keep one he was 
overcome with emotions and began to cry at which point they took him back home and he says it was 
such a powerful experience he didn't sleep at all that night and later did report his encounter to 
the UFO experiences blog spot okay I just have a few more cases I'd like to report here's one very 
unusual case I like this one because it involves a healing and it occurred in an area we don't hear a 
lot about which is China it's occurred on December 11 1999 in the fangshan district of Beijing 
and the main Witness is a Headmaster a school Headmaster by the name of cow gong 
this was investigated by a researcher by the name of Zhang jingping at any rate Calgon reports that he had gone to bed when he was woken up by a whirring noise 
and looking outside he saw a man and a woman coming into his room and they were dressed in 
strange attire they stood by the side of his bed he first thought they were thieves or something 
they were short five and a half feet tall they were relatively human looking but though 
their heads were a little larger and their bodies were quite thin they were fair-skinned 
wearing silvery white tight-fitting clothes which reminded him of tin foil 
and they sort of looked him up and down and then the female E.T said to the male one he is the 
one who can cure illnesses let's take him so it turned out that cow gong was educated in medicine 
and at this point he found himself being pulled through the wall above his home and flown for 
quite some distance he estimates 50 miles or so over several cities into this large floating craft 
and it was very large and he was escorted into a small room which reminded him of a laboratory 
and in this room there was indirect soft lighting the ETS were very friendly calmed him down and 
told him they they wanted to uh use him to not use him they wanted to carry out a healing procedure 
and have him help to cure another person of illness so he was in there with the room in the 
room he heard sounds of animals in another room at any rate the female entity left and returned 
with a 16 or 17 year old Chinese girl who appeared to be seriously ill the male entity then patted 
Calgon on the da zui accupoint this is between the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebrae 
at this point Kyle felt a burst of warmth flowing through his body this was extremely comfortable 
and the male entity told him to use that same method that he had just demonstrated on this 
Chinese girl and so he did and meanwhile they were treating her with some weird instruments 
and he cow gong used his hands and began doing the acupressure on this sick girl 
and he could immediately feel heat flowing from his hands into the girl's back so it 
was very pronounced lasted for about five minutes during which his arms became numb 
and at this point the girl woke up she was all full of energy was no longer sickly 
and when the two entities that had taken him on board saw that this experiment this procedure had 
been successful they began letting out quote peels of laughter so they were very much Happy they then 
took him into another larger Laboratory he became frightened because he could still hear animals 
and they were making sounds that frightened him like they were being hurt or something hard to say but the entities seemed to sense his discomfort and so they returned him to his home 
and again the same way they floated through the sky over Beijing and into his home returned in the 
same way they took him and he later reported this whole experience to UFO researchers 
it's quite unusual but again here's an example of et's laughing and there are a lot of them 
just two more cases I'd like to present here's one which occurred in New South Wales Australia 
on February 18 2009. I don't this is a rather large area don't have the exact location 
but this was reported to the mufon case management system the witness is anonymous she had gone to 
take a walk with her dog as she usually does a lot near the local Race Course where there's 
a lake and at this point she noticed a quote small man standing about 600 feet away from her 
she didn't take much notice of him at first but as she got closer he started to 
wave at her so she walked up to this man and started making small talk about the weather 
and this man and asked her if she had seen any shooting stars in the night that night 
she was quite puzzled by the question and she looked at him with curiosity and he started 
laughing as though it was some sort of inside joke and but she told him that yeah well she 
regularly sees them on her nightly walks at this point she threw the ball for her dog to fetch 
and this is when she noticed a craft a blue silver object landed on the other side of this small Lake 
and right after she noticed this this five foot tall man who looks very human picked up the ball 
that the dog had brought back and threw it and she was shocked to see this ball travel 
about 1500 feet quite farther than a normal person could throw it easily at least and 
her dog bolted after it and she looked in shock at this small man and commented on his strength 
and he laughed and thanked her so this is an interesting interaction they talked a little bit 
about dogs at this point this thick fog rolled in obscuring her dog obscuring the craft she started 
to become concerned and ran into the fog to look for her dog and found him and she turned to 
see this man but he was gone and she went over to see where this silvery craft had 
been landed and it was also gone but she did find some crushed Grass Grass at the site 
so there you go another really unusual case involving a laughing E.T 
and one more case which occurred very recently February 10 2015 outside of Los Angeles California 
this again was ported to the mufon case management system the witness is anonymous 
but he woke up to find himself not in his room in fact he was standing with his hand 
is back against this metallic surface but it was sort of soft and was sort of molding to his body 
it says it was totally quiet he saw a few other people there but they seemed to be unconscious
he realized at this point that the room was circular and uh dimly lit and he started 
walking around everyone else there other human looking people seemed to be asleep he felt no fear 
uh but was certain that he was inside some kind of craft it doesn't remember exactly what happened he 
says he lost Consciousness for a second but woke up and realized that he was traveling in some kind 
of vehicle and looking outside he was no longer on Earth he appeared to be on another planet 
he was in this vehicle that was floating along and next thing he knows these findings himself 
inside of this sort of sandstone-like structure with benches and chairs and this was the first 
time he saw an actual E.T which was I believe mostly human looking it's not well described 
but the being began speaking to him telepathically saying be calm everything is okay 
at this point a red ball appeared in front of him twice the size of a tennis ball 
and this E.T began smiling at the witness and the witness was fascinated because this ball 
was floating and he became fixated on it and he followed it and grabbed it and threw it against 
the wall and it bounced in this little kind of motion and it was very enjoyable he says and it calmed him down and he felt that this was actually a toy that he could play with 
so he wasn't sure how long this went on but the alien spoke to him again telepathically 
and he asked him what are you doing and the ET said telepathically this is our 
way of measuring and extracting information about your mental and telepathic abilities 
he said the next step in your human evolution is these mental abilities so he was basically testing 
him on his psychic abilities at any rate he looked at the witness and at this point the witness says 
he got a very enlightened positive feeling and it made him smile and he felt like this ET had very 
good intentions and he said that the ETS that he met have affection and a feeling of humor 
he felt like they were very wise and the ET basically said that he should tell others about 
them and that others should know that they are here at this point he sort of lost Consciousness 
and the next thing he knows he's waking up back in his home okay those are all the cases that I found 
in which ETS do seem to express a sense of humor finding things funny laughing there are a lot of 
other cases involving emotions in fact et's also express love there are many cases of contactees 
who felt intense love both for the ETS and from them I didn't include those cases here I think 
that really deserves its own separate episode but the point is yes ETS do have a sense of humor they 
do find things funny they're very much like us and that is why I wanted to do this episode today 
because there are many people who say oh the ETS have no sense of humor they seem to have 
no emotion at all and I think that's true in some cases particularly when people encounter the little AI Grays but as you can see ETS do have emotions and they do have a sense of humor 
so I hope you've enjoyed this episode today I really enjoyed making it 
thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers keep 
looking for the truth I'm particularly appropriate for this episode keep having fun bye now.
