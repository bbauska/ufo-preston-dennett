It's one of the rarest types of UFO encounters: cases in which people are given alien artifacts by 
the ETs. There are a surprising number of cases coming from across the planet. Crystals, metal 
bars, food, medicine, books, mechanical devices...all have been given to abductees by alien beings. 
What happens when somebody is given an actual alien artifact? The results may surprise you.

This video presents nearly a dozen cases in which people were given alien artifacts. For those 
who'd like to learn more, chapter five of my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three" presents these 
cases in detail, and is now available on Amazon.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett  and today I'd like to talk to you about a  
very rare type of UFO case these are cases in  which abductors have been given alien artifacts  
it almost never happens but there's actually a  surprising number of cases astronomer Carl Sagan  
who was very skeptical of UFO abductions often  complained that no abductees had been given an  
alien artifact physicist Michio Kaku has said  that a object he could obtain a single artifact  
it would prove there's not only their story but  extraterrestrial existence unfortunately it's  
not that easy I couldn't find any cases of anyone  who was able to steal an object off of a UFO but  
I did found find at least three cases of people  who have tried one comes from actually the first  
reported UFO abduction which occurred to a man by  the name of Antonio v/s Boas on October 16 1957 in  
Brazil it was the first publicized abduction case  Antonio was outside in his near his farm when a  
UFO landed and he was taken on board by short  humanoids he was forcibly seduced by a strange  
female humanoid and then was given a tour of the  craft during this time he tried to grab a small  
object shaped like a clock and hide it in his  clothes one of the crew members saw him do this  
became angry and snatched the object back pushed  Antonio and he was escorted off the craft shortly  
later following this incident he suffered from  symptoms resembling radiation sickness so there  
are other cases of people who've tried to steal  from UFOs one case comes from J Allen Hynek who  
interviewed a man by the name of Carol watts on  March 31st 1967 watts came upon a UFO outside  
his home cylindrical-shaped there was a door open  he walked right up to it there was a voice asking  
him to come inside and be physically examined  he refused but about a week later was driving up  
to his house when he came upon a UFO next thing  he knows he's being taken on board by for short  
humanoids they were wearing white jumpsuits that  dark wraparound eyes he was taking on board the  
craft undressed physically examined and the ETS  walked out of the room he was in and began to  
look at apparently screens that were showing the  results of Watts examination Watts got dressed  
and saw a cube like device and put it in his  pocket and at that point one of the crew members  
came up and took the object back and knocked him  unconscious and Watts woke up in his car another  
case comes from Ukraine a man by the name of Ivan  Nicanor ovitch had a pretty typical abduction he  
was physically examined they gave him prophecies  these were human-like aliens and they gave him a  
piece of fruit which he said looked very much  like an apple he tried to put it in his pocket  
but they refused to let him do that and instructed  him to eat it which he did so yeah stealing from a  
UFO is apparently not a good idea it doesn't work  but there are a number of cases which people have  
been given gifts a Betty hill Betty and Barney  Hill were abducted in New Hampshire in 1961 while  
driving through the mountains following towards  the ends of the experience Betty asked for proof  
that this experience was real and the leader was  leading her around the craft agreed and gave her  
a book and Betty held it it was heavy she looked  at it it had weird writing inside symbols she  
couldn't understand and she was very excited about  it and they were escorting her off the craft they  
opened the ramp and we're walking down when one of  the crew members objected and took the book back  
that he was furious she wanted it as proof and  they said that's the whole point we don't want  
you to remember this so the whole Betty and Barney  Hill case could have turned out very differently  
there's another case just like this with Betty  Andreasen whose case was investigated by Raymond  
Fowler he wrote a number of books about her case  in 1967 Betty Andreasen was in her home she was  
visited by ETS they gave her a blue book and said  she could keep it at least for two weeks what she  
did she kept it for two weeks they said don't show  it to anybody else though Beck she did show it to  
her daughter Becky it was a thin blue book she  opened it it had very white glowing pages there  
were some weird symbols on them and she was able  to examine it at her leisure for a period of two  
weeks she only did it a couple of times before  the ETS took the book back but she almost got  
to keep it and some people apparently have kept  their artifacts there's a controversial case of  
Truman veteran a contact D from the 1950s who said  he was in contact with human looking ETS they were  
taken on board his fur craft several times he said  the main person charged was a female by the name  
of aura Raines and at his request she provided him  with a form of if not proof evidence she gave him  
a note which she wrote and signed which Truman  bathroom did provide as evidence and said it was  
genuine this case is controversial but has never  been disproven and it fits the pattern of other  
cases take the case of what happened to William  J Herman an auto mechanic from Charleston South  
Carolina he was also allowed to keep his gift  his case generated a lot of interest it all began  
when he started photographing u.s. foes outside  of Charleston Air Force Base near his home the  
photographs were very clear and he thought they  were government to craft until he started being  
taken on board and examined by gray type eye to  terrestrials this case generated a lot of interest  
from the nearby air force from the police as well  and from prominent UFO investigators such as Jim  
and Cora Lorenzen James harder was also interested  in the case as was Leonard Stringfield and Stanton  
Friedman and also Wendell Stevens who ended up  writing two books about the case important here  
is on April 21st 1979 a gray appeared in William  Herman's trailer and gave him this little bar of  
metal it's about three inches long and inch-high  heavy gray metal like lead it had cymbals crash  
into it has the word man imprinted into it and  some weird star like cymbals and the gray said  
that this bar was a gift of mutual respect and  understanding William Herman took the bar he gave  
it to investigators who gave it to dr. Walter W  Walker who actually analyzed that Liuba tuba metal  
fragments from a UFO that had crashed in Juba  to Brazil he was like engineer and chemist and  
he did a chemical analysis he looked out through  an electron microscope it showed that this object  
was made of lead it was a five percent lead alloy  he said the etchings were cast in their position  
when the malabar was formed but that the letters  man were pressed in with a blade like instrument  
and his conclusions were it was indistinguishable  from normal terrestrial hard lead this doesn't  
mean it's not extraterrestrial and we'll see  that this sort of ambiguous nature comes up in  
a number of these cases another almost identical  case comes from researcher Constance clear this  
case involves a lifelong abductee by the name of  Andrew on March 28th 1997 and had an experience  
which he later recalled under hypnosis he was  taken from his bedroom on board a craft he was  
examined by ETS he met a grey et who said her  name was cedra and that she was the sectional  
district commander one of the few females who  had attained that high of a position which I  
found interesting because it shows that even the  Grays have sexual discrimination in their culture  
at any rate she said the purpose of their visit  was that she wanted to let him know that they had  
completed their experiments with him and wasn't  she happy and he says no I'm madder than hell  
and she said well what why are you mad what's mad  and what's hell and Andrew explained that he was  
unhappy with the experiments because they were  painful and scary and cedra explained that they  
have trouble with human emotions and said that if  you were in our situation you would do the same  
thing she explained that the real purpose of their  visit was that she wanted to give him a gift and  
she held it out to him it was a piece of metal it  was very much the same size as the William Herman  
case three inches long an inch wide it appeared  to be lead and it was silver and very sparkly  
she held it out in front of her and he took it it  was very heavy and she said it was rare on their  
planet and that if we decide to give it to you  you will find it somewhere so about three weeks  
later in April 1997 Andrew woke up and found this  metal bar on his bedroom dresser he immediately  
called Constance clear and told him II told her  he was coming over he grabbed the lead bar in his  
notes and was driving to her office when he was  sideswiped by another vehicle other gentlemen came  
out took his notes took the lead bar threatened  him and he complained you know and said he would  
complain to the government and they said go ahead  threatened him and took they're the typical men  
in black and this turns up in a lot of these cases  actually so there are I know there are other cases  
of metal bars alleged alien fragments supposedly  went from a 1977 incident at Fort Benning Georgia  
which has some similarities to these other cases  which I find interesting another case involving  
sort of metal bar organic material was reported  by Albert Rosalie's who put together a number of  
very important books about the humanoids the case  occurred in 1942 to a Russian fifteen-year-old  
girl named Nellie ax from Rostov Russia who  encountered a gray type ET the et told her  
that Russia would be victorious in the war against  Germany world war ii and asked if she wanted to go  
with them permanently she declined and the gray  ET gave her a crystal type object which he said  
they could use to track her or find her so a lot  of these cases have sort of rocks or crystals that  
supposedly have a function one such case comes  from researcher and experience or carla turner she  
interviewed a lady by the name of Pat from Floyd's  Knob Indiana when that was just a teenager she and  
her entire family were taken onboard a UFO that  landed outside their farm this was in 1954 and  
it was a typical abduction towards the end of  the experience Pat asked the ETS for proof of  
the experience and they said yes they gave her a  green Heelers rock or stone which they had used to  
actually heal her grandfather of a problem in his  legs and they have scored the whole family back to  
their home most of them didn't remember a lot of  it but that remembered all of it because he was  
very young and for whatever reason she remembered  except that day the military showed up and took  
over the home they sequestered the family in their  home for four days in them extensively examined  
all of them examined all the farm animals examined  their entire property searched the house from top  
to bottom and found the alien artifact took it and  left so a lot of these cases do involve rocks or  
crystals another case comes from Thomas Bullard  who wrote a very important book on abductions  
one of the first he talks about a case involving  a man by the name of Arnall ho I known in who was  
given a stone by the beings the ETS and told that  he could summon them with it my reports on another  
case above contactee miguel free who received  three gifts each of us were confiscated by  
the police or the military of course there's the  controversial case of billy meier which I know is  
controversial but it does have a lot of evidence  and he says he was given crystals he says it was  
also given a metal fragment what's interesting  about this case is this metal fragment was studied  
by a scientist Marcel Vogel who found it did have  some very interesting and properties which were  
intriguing because they would be hard to do and  he wasn't sure that we had the capacity to do  
it this piece of metal had a very crystalline  structure and was unusually pure magnesium so  
I don't know there's a lot of cases coming from  all over the world Hungarian researcher Gabor  
Tarr collie talks about a case which occurred  in the summer of 1974 in the Transylvania  
region of Romania when a group of locals came  upon a landed UFO and very tall humanoids who  
gave him 64 gold foil sheets with these weird  symbols and writing on them and unfortunately  
the secret police showed up apparently right away  following this incident and confiscated the alien  
artifacts and threatened all the witnesses and  according to our collie there were at least a few  
mysterious deaths associated with this incident  which isn't unusual you know in cases involving  
physical evidence early French researcher Jimmy GU  reports on the case which occurred in March 1955  
to a painter who had a UFO land a hundred and  fifty feet from his home he said it was thirty  
feet wide he met a beautiful human woman human  looking one and they conversed using hand signals  
the UFO returned three days later with the same  figure inside who this time gave the painter an  
artifact a gift it turned out to be some sort of  telescope or telescopic device and it like many of  
these cases was confiscated by men and black who  showed up after this incident and took it away
another case comes from researcher Robert trail  ends it's a very interesting case of occurred to  
two young teenage boys one by the name of Manuel  Pereira the other by the name of Jose SOI - yo  
they both are residents of la dikenga Ecuador on  September 3rd 1966 they were hiking through the  
mountains when they saw these star-like objects  darting around one of them had a flashlight and  
he knew Morse code so he sends out a code to the  lights saying friends please land and one of these  
objects drops out of the sky they are invited on  board the two boys they meet short humanoids who  
questioned the two boys extensively the boys also  asked questions but the ETS refused to answer any  
of them and started to cut the experience short  the boys asked for proof for a souvenir of this  
experience and the ETS gave them this cylindrical  object which they explained was a flashlight like  
their own except all you had to do was squeeze  it and it would send out a beam of light the boys  
thanked them and gave them their own flashlight  and exited the object and started running home and  
were immediately surrounded by military people  in jeeps and helicopters who confiscated the  
object and took the boys and who were eventually  apparently relocated so there's cases involving  
the artifacts of all different kinds another  category is food and medicine number of cases  
involving medicine one famous one took place in  1954 in Preta palace brazil a famous diplomat his  
daughter was suffering from stomach cancer et's  showed up landed into her backyard and proceeded  
to do an operation on the man's young daughter  and cured her they gave the family a group of  
about 50 pills or so for you and told them  then to feed one to their daughter each day  
which they did so there are a few cases like that  a very famous one comes from wendell stevens who  
actually wrote a book about this case the main  witness is jalla Valerio of brazil Valerio was  
a hospital doorman one day very popular kid in  the village suffered with cerebral aneurysm and  
the doctors knew that ja Valerio was a contactee  so they asked him to ask the et's that they could  
provide medicine which a ja did and the ets said  yes and provided him with medicine to give to this  
boy the medicine was given to the boy he recovered  from his cerebral aneurysm fortunately a portion  
of the medicine was saved for chemical analysis  the chemical analysis was pretty disappointing  
though this medicine looked like brown sugar it  was crystalline in structure it melted at body  
temperature they ran a number of chemical tests on  it and were not able to identify it and ultimately  
came to the conclusion that it was chemically  unique so they don't know what it was one case  
which got a lot of attention is one of the most  famous cases of this kind occurred on April 18th  
1961 to a farmer by the name of Joe Symington from  Eagle River Wisconsin he came upon a landed UFO in  
his yard walked up to it there were three years  short inside they were human looking reminded  
him of Italian descent he said that they looked  very much the same and were good-looking and  
they were apparently cooking something they  asked him for water and handed him the sort  
of alien weird-looking jug which he took into  his house filled it up with water I would have  
pulled the old switcheroo here but he didn't do  it didn't think of it I guess for whatever reason  
he returned with the water gave him the jug back  and in returned they gave him four pancakes he ate  
one he said it tasted like cardboard kind of like  cardboard and kept the other three the object took  
off this case generated a lot of interest because  he had a number he was an upstanding citizen he  
had a lot of character witnesses to vouch for his  character and furthermore there were sightings are  
very close to his home preceding and following  this incident so UFO investigators were variants  
and interested they sent a sample to the Air  Force who was also interested this into sample  
to the Aeronautical Systems Division of the Air  Force command who concluded that this pancake  
was quote low protein flour with small quantities  of sugar and salt cooked in hydrogenated oil so  
in other words a normal pancake another sample  was sent to the Food and Drug Administration  
which reached the same conclusion they said the  microscopic analysis shows the presence of fat  
starch buckwheat hulls wheat bran and soybean  hulls so yeah it's a strange case for sure and  
didn't prove to be alien but you can't prove  it's not now particularly because this guy has  
a lot of you know evidence supporting his case so  I did a study of these types of cases I put them  
together in my book not from here volume 3 there  are a lot of cases coming from all over the world  
separated by wide distances and they follow some  pretty distinct patterns they fell into four major  
cases people are giving you their books or notes  with symbols on them of some kind or they're given  
food or medicine or some sort of organic agree in  green substance like rocks crystals or a metal bar  
or perhaps a mechanical device such as telescopes  or flashlights ultimately these gifts have failed  
to provide The Smoking Gun you know physical  evidence proof of alien visitations at least  
not in the public arena I think probably some of  these cases do have that proof but they're not  
available to us I'm pretty sure we're gonna see  more cases of this kind I'm pretty sure that there  
are contactees abductors out there who do have  alien gifts right now but are wisely remaining  
silent I think these cases are important for the  obvious reason that they do have the potential to  
prove the existence of aliens conclusively which  is kind of why I put together this video I think  
we should watch out for these kinds of cases and  study them more and I think sooner or later this  
kind of evidence we're going to see it we're going  to see alien artefacts available to the mainstream  
public and I'm really looking forward to it  that's it for now thanks very much for listening
