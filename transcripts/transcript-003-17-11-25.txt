PHONE CALL FROM ET
Nov 25, 2017

Summary:
Nov 25, 2017
Have you ever received a phone call from an ET? As fantastic as it sounds, some people have. UFO 
contact comes in many different forms, including by telephone. In this video I present several 
cases in which people have held telephone conversations with extraterrestrials. For more info, 
see my book, "Not from Here: Vol 1."

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and today I'd like to like to talk to you a little bit 
about my book not from here Volume one which is about the more unusual and lesser-known aspects 
of the UFO phenomenon and today I want to talk about my favorite chapter chapter 2 which is called 
phone call from an alien and yeah I know how that sounds but the fact is there are now a number 
of cases on record in which people have received phone calls from apparent ETs.

Jack Sarfatti
Probably one of the better cases is that involving a physicist, a quantum physicist by the name of 
Jack Sarfatti. He's a pioneering quantum physicist. He's championed Bell's Theorem and claims that sub 
atomic particles are connected non-locally, which has turned out to be true. But when Mr. Sarfati 
was about 12 or 13 years old he received what was apparently a phone call from an ET. He heard this 
mechanical sounding voice that asked him if he wanted to learn from him. And Sarfatti said "yes 
sure" and he expected to have a physical contact and gathered all his friends and hoping the UFO 
would show up and it never did. And that's all he really remembers, except his mom says no that's 
not exactly what happened. According to her memory, the phone calls continued. Her son would take them 
and he started to act very strangely. Talking about these very highly scientific and exotic 
topics and she became very concerned. The next time the phone rang she took it from him 
said don't call here anymore and that's when the calls stopped. But Jack Sarfati has told this 
story publicly and it's only one of many in which people have received apparent phone calls from ETs.

Debby Jordan
Another really well-known case would be that of Debby Jordan who is the star client by the Debby Jordan 
Hopkins book, "Intruders". She went by the pseudonym Debbie Kathy Davis. But she has since come out 
publicly about her abductions with gray-type ETs. I would have lesser known about her experiences is 
that she received a bunch of weird phone calls, apparently from ETs. This began in 1980 when she 
was pregnant. Debbie began to receive the series of phone calls. It was always on a Wednesday and she 
would hear these strange noises, hums and clicks and beeps. And occasionally these voices speaking 
of strange seemingly alien language. The calls continued for about nine months. Then suddenly 
stopped after she had her child. After her child was born the calls no longer continued but when 
the child grew up and began to speak he began to speak in words that reminded Debbie Tartan 
of the language she heard on the phone while she was pregnant with him. 

Betty Andreasen
So, I'm not really concerned here. I'm thankfully the child grew out of it. Definitely, there seems to be 
a connection there and not the only case like this Raymond Fowler a very well-known investigator ran 
into this sort of case. Phone call from an alien when you began working with Betty Andreasen an 
abductee from Massachusetts and daily Andreasen in 1977 was talking with her then-boyfriend Bob 
Lucca when an ET broke in on the conversation in an angry voice and she actually heard the words 
it's finished it is done this wasn't the only time she had calls like this she would often 
hear these voices sometimes they did sound angry sometimes not but often they'd be speaking what 
sounded like a foreign language with kind of lots of ELLs and T's in it so yeah this is apparently 
(Whitney Strieber)
a thing who knew whitley strieber talks about something similar that happened to him where 
he was with his wife this is around April of 1977 and suddenly this stereo started talking 
to them and they held a brief conversation with the voice over the stereo which should 
be impossible it's got no transmitter he actually members the blast line of the conversation was the 
smell boy saying I know something else about you so yeah clearly these cases are not I mean they 
(Harold Wilkins)
may be unusual but they're not unheard of Harold Wilkins a pioneering UFO researcher he revealed 
several cases in which strange voices had come over radios John Peel another early pioneering 
researcher said oh this happened many times and he himself received calls like this with strange 
clicks and beeps it says it was not unusual over UFO flap areas where this sort of thing would 
happen over radios and even to televisions I know another case in which a gentleman saw seven UFO as 
he counted them very carefully and raced off his phone rang you didn't answer it but when he looked 
at it to see who had called the person numbered that it showed was all sevens seven sevens which 
he felt was a message from the 80s and certainly very unusual not a bell number so I'm not sure 
to make of these types of cases Donald Kehoe is a pioneering researcher he talked about this as 
well he said that he talked to fighter pilots he said that it was clear to them that the UFOs 
were listening in under radio conversations and I have run into cases of this myself a couple of 
(New York abductee)
times probably the most dramatic is a case that I included in my latest book inside UFOs - and 
it occurred to a New York abductee who I called Kenneth he has had abductions his whole life a 
lot of experiences when he was down in Florida where he lived for a while he started receiving 
these strange phone calls I'm very much like Betty Andreasen and Debbie Jordan described it 
always come on the same day and I usually it was just a deadline or he'd hear strange noises but 
one time he's back up in New York and he's driving along and his phone starts ringing
he looked except it's ringing in a weird tones that he's never heard before that the 
phone normally does not make us not it's normal ringer he looks at the readout and it says it's 
no number or the lines just dead so he doesn't answer it and then it rings again he looks down 
and says no number he answers it and he starts hearing all these weird clicks and noises and 
this voice starts talking and suddenly it says the time has grown closer and shortly 
after that is UFO showed up and the ETS showed up and he had what was perhaps the most profound 
abduction in his life was fully conscious in the ETS told him why they had been abducting him this 
whole time so it's clear that these cases are widespread they've been a crime for a long time 
(Conclusion)
and continued to occur and as unusual as they sound it really fits right into the spectrum 
of UFO contact UFOs are well-known for affecting all kinds of electromagnetic instruments including 
automobiles lights radios televisions uh so it should be no surprise that Bay and effect 
phones as well perhaps this is why there seems so many times over high high tension wires telephone 
wires just a theory all we really know is that these cases are taking place and will probably 
continue to take place so next time the phone rings who knows just might be an ET calling you.
