Oct 24, 2025 (1:03:21)
Most people agree that the chances of humans being the only intelligent life in the universe are infinitesimally small. It is almost inconceivable that humanity is alone. And an examination of reports involving strange humanoids shows very clearly that we are not alone. There is now a worldwide database containing tens of thousands of extraterrestrial humanoids. Cases go back more than 100 years. They involve a wide variety of witnesses and a wide variety of humanoids. This video presents ten incredibly strange cases of this kind, each adding another piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery.

A STRANGE AND INDESCRIBABLE BEAUTY. One of the earliest humanoid reports in the United States occurred one evening in November 1897, in Lodi, California. Colonel Henry Glenville Shaw and his associate Camille Spooner were riding a carriage when they came upon three 7-foot-tall slender, bald humanoids standing in the road. A long interaction followed, ending with the witnesses chasing the humanoids to their craft.

THE LITTLE MEN IN RUBBER SUITS. Late on the evening of October 10, 1954, Willi Hoge (age 42) was driving outside Rinkerode, Germany when he saw what he first thought was a crashed plane. A closer observation, however, revealed it to be a disc-shaped craft, and standing underneath it were four 3-foot-tall humanoids. Willi watched them work on their craft for ten minutes until they entered inside it, and the craft quickly departed.

DON’T THROW ROCKS AT THE ALIEN. On July 18, 1963, four boys were playing near their homes in Fern Creek, Kentucky when a large cigar-shaped craft appeared overhead. It released a smaller disc-shaped craft which landed behind the trees. Moments later, a humanoid appeared wearing a jumpsuit and helmet. The boys threw dirt-clods at it, and the humanoid reacted by pointing a device at the boys, causing two of them to receive minor burns.

TWO LITTLE HUMANOIDS. On the morning of October 23, 1965, 57-year-old Jose Camilo Filho took a walk in the woods on the outskirts of Canhotinho, in Pernambuco, Brazil. Coming around a corner in the path, he saw two 3-foot-tall, little men wearing strange clothes. The humanoids seemed startled and took off in fear. At the same time, other witnesses in town saw a UFO pass overhead.

THE MOST FRIGHTENING MOMENT OF MY LIFE. On November 18, 1967, a young boy was in his home near Greenville, Ohio when two grays appeared. He was unable to move as they examined him then floated off to another room. He chased them and saw them leaving the house, joining three other gray aliens and walking into a large craft which had landed in their cornfield. This turned out to be the first of many encounters.

IT’S TAKEN ME A LIFETIME. Karen was eleven years old when, one summer day in 1973, her older sister called her outside their home in Paramus, New Jersey. Karen was shocked to see a massive cigar-shaped craft with portholes hovering overhead. Through the portholes, she could see three humanoids looking down at them. The craft darted off, and the two witnesses chased it down the highway in their car, where numerous other people also saw the craft.

SOMETHING HAPPENED. JULY 1998. WEST COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. In July of 1998, an anonymous sheriff’s deputy woke up in the bedroom of his home in West Columbia, South Carolina. He was immobilized as he heard a buzzing sound and saw a strange light in his bedroom. Some days later, he woke up paralyzed, but now levitating above his bed, surrounded by gray aliens. A third incident occurred while on patrol and resulted in two hours of missing time.

THEY DID NOT APPEAR HUMAN. On March 18, 2007, Maria was taking a train from Rome to Viterbo, Italy when she noticed two strange women in the train car who did not appear human. They wore wigs, had no visible nose and very strange mouths. They were speaking a foreign language. When they stood, Maria was amazed to see that they had only four fingers.
 
I KNOW WHAT IS OUT THERE. At 3:00 am on June 2008, 16-year-old Tracy was asleep on the couch in her aunt’s home in Spring Creek, Nevada. Waking up, she was terrified to see the front door open, blue-white light filling the room, and three short alien figures standing in the doorway looking at her. Suddenly, one of the grays approached her. It touched her cheek, and Maria’s fear left her. Instead, she felt great love coming from the being.

A VERY PERSONAL EVENT. One evening in 2010, a New Mexico security guard’s life changed forever. As he patrolled his assigned property in his vehicle, he came upon a gray alien standing in front of his car. It was visible for only 10 seconds, but long enough to identify the creature as not human. The incident became shrouded in a screen memory for some time, but the guard eventually recalled the truth.

Ten cases, adding to the thousands of other accounts, making it undeniable that our planet is being visited by extraterrestrials.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs 
and the Paranormal. I hope you've had a great week and are doing well. Very excited about today's 
show. I am continuing my mission to explore the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, 
particularly cases involving humanoids. I find these cases so fascinating. There's so many of 
them. I think all humanity deserves to know the truth that we are being visited by what appear 
to be extraterrestrial humanoids. I've got 10 cases for you today. 10 cases that I think you 
probably haven't heard before, though a few have gotten some publicity. These cases span more than 
100 years. The title of today's episode is incredibly strange. 10 firsthand encounters 
with extraterrestrial humanoids. These cases come from all over the world, including Germany, Italy, 
Brazil, and seven cases from the United States, including California, Kentucky, 
Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, Ohio, and South Carolina. These do involve a wide variety of ETs, 
all kinds of evidence to support these cases. physiological effects, animal reactions, 
electromagnetic disturbances, landing traces. So, this should be pretty interesting. Now, the first 
case I'd like to present to you, I call a strange and indescribable beauty. This is a very early 
case, well before the idea of extraterrestrial visitations was at all popularized. This one 
occurred one evening in November 1897. This is in Lodi, California. And this happened right during 
the beginning of the now famous airship wave which started in California and swept across the United 
States and the world. And this is a very unusual case which was suggested to me by one of you 
viewers out there. So, thank you for that. This case is amazing. This case is one of the earliest 
modern accounts of extraterrestrial contact and it has enjoyed some moderate publicity. Although 
this story is somewhat apocryphal, it's only coming from one source, the witness is a very 
high credibility. And the witness is Lieutenant Colonel Henry Glennville Shaw. He was born in 
1843. In fact, when he was 19 years old in 1862, he joined the 125th Ohio Volunteer Infantry and 
served as a first lieutenant. He rose in rank, eventually becoming a lieutenant colonel. He 
fought in the Civil War. He was a member of the National Rifle Association's board of directors, 
president of the California Rifle Association, and a prominent journalist in his own right. So, 
a pretty good witness. And long before people were talking about extraterrestrials, he claims that he 
and his friend, a Mr. Camille Spooner, had a very profound face-to-face encounter with what appear 
to be beings from another world. At the time he was married, he had a six-year-old child. And 
the famous airship wave of 1897 had just struck California and was spreading quickly across the 
world with thousands of people reporting strange zeppelin like objects. And as a California-based 
journalist, he must have certainly been aware of these reports. So this is when his encounter 
occurred. It was one evening around 6:00 p.m. in November 1897. He and his associate Camille 
Spooner had departed Loi by horse carriage and were traveling on a country road along the nearby 
Woodbridge Canal as you can see here when the encounter occurred. And I'll just quote Henry 
directly as he says, "We were jogging along quietly when the horse stopped suddenly and 
gave a snort of terror. Looking up, we beheld three strange beings. They resembled humans 
in many respects, but still they were not like anything I had ever seen. They were nearly or 
quite 7 ft high and very slender. We were both somewhat startled, as you might readily imagine, 
and the first impulse was to drive on. The horse, however, refused to budge, and when we 
saw that we were being regarded more with an air of curiosity than anything else, we concluded to 
get out and investigate. I walked up to where the strangelooking persons were and addressed them. 
I asked them where they were from. They seemed not to understand me, but began, "Well, warbling 
expresses it better than talking." Their remarks, if such you could call them, were addressed to 
each other, and sounded like a monotonous chant, inclined to be guttural. I saw it was no use to 
attempt a conversation, so I satisfied myself with watching and examining them. They seemed 
to take great interest in ourselves, the horse and buggy, and scrutinized everything very carefully. 
So as interested as the strange beings were in Colonel Henry Shaw and his friend Camille Spooner, 
the colonel and his friend were equally interested in these strange beings. As Henry says, "While 
they were thus engaged, I was able to inspect them as well. As I have already stated, they were 7 ft 
in height and very slender. I noticed further that their hands were quite small and delicate, 
and their fingers were without nails. Their feet, however, were nearly twice as long as those of an 
ordinary man, though they were narrow, and the toes were also long and slender. I noticed, too, 
that they were able to use their feet and toes, much the same as a monkey. In fact, 
they appeared to have much better use of their feet than their hands. I presently discovered that 
this was probably a provision of nature, because it was at this point that the colonel proceeded to 
satisfy his curiosity by actually touching one of the beings and thereby discovered something 
very unusual about them, not just their feet. As the colonel says, as one of them came close to me, 
I reached out to touch him, and placing my hand under his elbow, pressed gently upward, 
and lo and behold, I lifted him from the ground with scarcely an effort. I should judge that 
the specific gravity of the creature was less than an ounce. It was then that I observed him 
try to grasp the earth with his toes to prevent my lifting him. You can readily understand that their 
slight weight made such a provision necessary or they might be blown away. They were without 
any sort of clothing, but were covered with a natural growth hard to describe, was not hair, 
neither was it like feathers, but it was as soft as silk to the touch, and their skin was like 
velvet. Their faces and head were without hair. The ears were very small, and the nose had the 
appearance of polished ivory, while the eyes were large and lustrous. The mouth, however, 
was small, and it seemed to me that they were without teeth. That and other things led me to 
believe that they neither ate nor drank, and that life was sustained by some sort of gas. Each of 
them had slung under the left arm a bag which was attached to a nozzle, and every little while one 
or the other would place the nozzle in his mouth, at which time I heard a sound of gas escaping. 
It was much the same sound as is produced by a person blowing up a football. So, while it was 
clear to Colonel Shaw that these beings were probably not from Earth, he still found them 
to have a very beautiful appearance. As he says, "From the description I give, I do not want you 
to get the idea that these creatures were hideous in appearance. They were markedly contrary. They 
were possessed of a strange and indescribable beauty. I can express myself in no other way. 
They were graceful to a degree, and more divinely beautiful than anything I have ever beheld." Now, 
while Henry and his friend Camille were deeply impressed by the beauty of the strange creatures, 
they were about to be even more impressed by the technology they displayed. As Henry says, 
"The strangest part of the story is yet to come. It is the lights they carried. Each held in his 
hand something about the size of a hen's egg. Upon holding them up and partly opening the hand, 
these substances emitted the most remarkable, intense, and penetrating light one can imagine. 
Notwithstanding its intensity, it had no unpleasant effect upon our eyes, 
and we found we could gaze directly at it. It seemed to me to be some sort of luminous mineral, 
though they had complete control of it. Remember, this was at a time when electric lights had just 
been invented and they were not widely in use in people's homes. So, this must have 
been very impressive. It was at this point that something even more extraordinary happened. The 
beings apparently tried to abduct the colonel, as he puts it, and as it turns out, not successfully. 
The witness says, "Finally, they became tired of examining us and our horse and buggy. And 
then one of them, at a signal from the one who appeared to be the leader, attempted to lift me, 
probably with the intention of carrying me away. Although I made not the slightest resistance, 
he could not move me. And finally, the three of them tried it without the slightest success. 
They appeared to have no muscular power outside of being able to move their strange limbs. Now, the 
beings also tried to lift up the colonel's friend, Camille, again with no success. And this appeared 
to mark the end of the encounter as the beings decided to depart. And this is when the witnesses 
were able to view the craft in which the beings had apparently arrived and were about to return. 
As the witness says, "Well, after trying in vain to move either of us, they turned in the direction 
of the Woodbridge Canal near which we were, and as they flashed their lights towards the bridge, 
we beheld a startling sight. There, resting in the air about 20 ft above the water, was an immense 
airship. It was 150 ft in length at least, though probably not over 20 ft in diameter at the widest 
part. It was pointed at both ends and outside of a large rudder. There was no visible machinery. 
The three walked rapidly towards the ship, not as you and I walk, but with a swaying motion, 
their feet only touching the ground at intervals of about 15 ft. We followed them as rapidly 
as possible, and reached the bridge as they were about to embark. With a little spring, 
they rose to the machine, opened a door in the side, and disappeared within. I do not know of 
what the affair was built, but just before it started, I struck it with a rock and it gave no 
sound. It went through the air very rapidly and expanded and contracted with a muscular motion 
and was soon out of sight. So ends the colonels and his friends encounter, but he did have a 
few concluding thoughts about it. As he says, I have a theory, which of course is only a theory, 
that those we beheld were inhabitants of Mars who have been sent to the Earth for the purpose of 
securing one of its inhabitants. The colonel ended his account by asserting his skepticism of some of 
the recent reports coming from some lawyers who claimed to have clients who had invented and were 
responsible for testing the airship. The colonel wrote, "I feel safe in asserting that the stories 
being told by certain San Francisco attorneys are clumsy fakes and should not be given credence by 
anyone." Now, Colonel Henry Glennville Shaw was the former editor of the Stockton, California, 
The Evening Mail newspaper, and it was to them with great reluctance and apparently 
some persuasion he submitted his story, which was published on November 25, 1896. And as the current 
editor wrote, the gentleman, meaning Shaw, was very reticent about relating the circumstances, as 
he said he had no idea that it would be believed by anyone, and he was loathed to appear before the 
public as a romancer, or as a man who had looked upon a shoestring when it was read. Meaning, 
I think he didn't want people to think he was trying to get attention or make money from his 
account. And as Colonel Shaw wrote, "Were it not for the fact that I was not alone when I witnessed 
the strange sight, I would never have mentioned it at all." Now, Colonel Shaw never spoke publicly 
about this encounter after this, or if he did, it was not recorded. He passed away 9 and a half 
years later at age 63 on March 10, 1907 and is now remembered more for his remarkable story than his 
illustrious career as an army officer and a newspaper journalist. What an unusual case 
that is. And although this there's really only one source for it, this one newspaper article, 
the witness is almost unimpeachable in terms of his resume, a very credible witness. And in fact, 
there's two eyewitnesses. So that's a multiple witness case. What's so interesting to me is there 
are many details that really echo modern-day cases with these very slender humanoids with large eyes, 
bald heads, you know, the lights they had in their hands, the description of the craft. 
One of the most unusual aspects to this case is that the gentleman, the witness, actually tried 
to lift one of these beings and was able to do so quite easily and said that they weighed only a few 
pounds. I suspect that perhaps they were wearing anti-gravity devices. There's a number of cases 
with ETSs floating around this sort of thing. So perhaps that would explain that. At any rate, 
it's an amazing case and I think it deserves to be well known because again it's very much like cases 
that we see today. Now let's move to the next case which is also very unusual. I call this one the 
little men in rubber suits. This case occurred on October 10, 1954 in Rinker Road, Germany. 
This case is interesting to me because this one occurred during the middle of a huge wave 
of sightings that was centered particularly in France but really all across Europe and of course 
not just sightings but humanoid encounters as well and this is one of them. This case first appeared 
in newspapers and was later investigated by Ilbrand Van Ludwiger and Jacqu Valet. 
It occurred during the midst of the massive wave in France and the surrounding areas. And in fact, 
several other French cases occurred on the very same day. This event involves one witness, 
a film projectionist from Müster, Germany by the name of Willie France Hogal or Hogue according to 
some sources. He was 42 years old at the time of his encounter. And on October 10, 1954, Willie was 
on his way home from a late night performance and was driving near the small town of Rinker Road, 
Germany. As you can see here, he was on his way back home to Müster when he noticed a brilliant 
light in a field. He first thought it might be a crashed airplane. So, he approached to about 60 m, 
180 ft, and he could now see that it was in fact a cigar-shaped craft hovering just a few feet 
above the ground. He said it was surrounded by a blue illumination, blindingly brilliant, he said, 
and he could see it had an opening with a ladder leading down to the ground. Even more astonishing, 
standing beneath it were four humanoid figures, 1.2 m tall. That's just over 3 feet. 
He said they seemed to be working busily beneath the craft. They each wore suits that looked to 
him like they were made of rubber and they were working in complete silence. He describes these 
beings as having quote thick set bodies, oversized heads, and delicate legs. So, this could be Grays, 
but he wasn't close enough to see. In fact, Willie was too afraid to approach any closer, but he 
remained watching them for a good 10 minutes, at which point the humanoids re-entered the object 
via the ladder. The craft then tilted to one side and shot upwards at an angle. A few seconds later, 
high in the sky, it took on the appearance of a bright disc and darted off into the night 
sky. Again, at that time, there was a massive wave of encounters sweeping across Europe, but mostly 
centered in France. That case is admittedly brief on details. There's not a whole lot to it. It's a 
fairly typical case, but it's interesting to me because there are so many cases where people are 
driving along on a remote highway at night and that's when their encounter occurs. So, 
this happens. I mean, it looks to me like he just got lucky, was able to see this. It's there's so 
many cases. Uh you know, you can dismiss one or two cases, but there's always another to 
take its place. And here's a good one that is very unusual. This next one I call don't throw 
rocks at the alien. This occurred on July 18, 1963 in the very small community of Fern Creek, 
Kentucky. This is a multiple witness case. It does have physiological effects and apparent landing 
traces and a very unusual humanoid as well. The main investigator to this case is Colonel Vern 
Yan of the Era National Guard. It's quite a brief case. It was also investigated by William Terry 
of Muon and William Earl of NIKAP. And although there are not many details, it's certainly an 
interesting case which involves four witnesses and again landing traces and physiological effects. 
It was 200 p.m. in the afternoon on July 18, 1963. The witnesses are four boys, all eight 
or nine years old, and they were playing in a field by their homes near Fern Creek, Kentucky. 
This is just southeast of Louisville. Suddenly, they notice strange white flakes falling to the 
ground and disappearing. This appears to be angel hair, which is a substance released by UFOs or 
perhaps caused by their hot plasma fields reacting with our atmosphere. But given what happened next, 
this appears to be the case because looking up, they saw a large cigar-shaped blimp-like object 
hovering overhead. And as they watched, this large object ejected a much smaller disc-shaped object, 
which proceeded to swoop down and disappear behind the woods surrounding the field, 
apparently coming in for a landing. Because it was just a few minutes later, the boys noticed a short 
figure. They said it was about 3 and 1/2 to 4 feet tall standing at the edge of the woods. They said 
this being had a larger head than normal and was wearing a tight-fitting full body jumpsuit. 
It had what appeared to be a helmet on its head with goggles where the eyes would be, and they 
could see two tubes leading from the helmet to the back, perhaps breathing apparatus. Now, amazed, 
the boys approached close enough and began, like boys will do, throwing dirt clouds at the 
figure. At this point, the humanoid, apparently in self-defense, held a black cylindrical object 
in his hand and pointed it at the boys. Two of the boys immediately felt that they were hit by 
some kind of beam. All four boys ran home. The two boys who were struck by the energy beam found that 
they had suffered from 6in circles of firstderee burns very much like a sunburn on their bodies. 
These wounds took a couple of weeks to heal. Now the investigator did go to the site the next 
day and found small deep footprints that were certainly different from the boy's footprints. 
He said he also found three impressions on the ground 15 ft apart in the same field along with a 
30 foot wide circular area of crushed vegetation. There was supposed to be a follow-up on this case, 
but if there was, the investigators never made it public. I think the important takeaway from 
that case is don't throw rocks at the alien. You know, kids will be kids, so I kind of understand 
them reacting that way, but they paid the price. I think if an ET becomes threatened, they will 
certainly take action just like any other normal person would. It's a fascinating case. I wish we 
had more detail on it. I'd love to speak to all of these witnesses personally. I believe the 
investigators were supposed to follow up on this case, but I couldn't find any other information 
on it, which is such a shame. So many of these cases are being lost to posterity. This is one of 
the reasons I'm putting out these episodes because there are far more cases than most people realize. 
If skeptics had any idea, I think they would change their tune very quickly. And here's another 
case also fascinating. I call this one two little humanoids. This one occurred on October 23rd, 
1965 in Canotino, Brazil. To me, what's super fascinating about this case is the description 
of the humanoids, because these are not grays by any means. This case took place on a cold, 
rainy day, October 23rd, 1965, in the town of Can Hotino, Peramuko, Brazil. This is a small town 
which at that time had about 2500 residents. The sole witness to this case is Joseé Camilo Felo, 
a 57year-old mechanic. At age 19, he had lost his hearing. So, the investigators of the case had to 
use an interpreter, but they learned that, quote, "The people of his town like him for his honest, 
open, and righteous actions." So, apparently, he's a good witness. On the day of the encounter, 
around noon, Jose was taking a walk on a small pathway through the forests on the 
eastern outskirts of the town. And he had been walking for about 15 minutes when he came around 
a turn in the path. And this is when he saw two very small men sitting on a fallen banana tree. 
This immediately surprised him because everyone in this area apparently knows you never sit on 
a banana tree because these trees leak a sap that easily stains your clothes. So Jose at this point 
immediately noticed a small brown cylindrical object between the two men. Upon seeing Jose, 
the two men's eyes widened and they jumped up, clearly frightened by Jose's sudden appearance. 
One of them leaped backwards two feet at the same time grabbing this cylindrical object which Jose 
wondered could this be a weapon of some kind. Jose could see that these beings were just over 
2 and 1/2 ft tall. So very short. This brown cylinder between them was actually slightly 
taller than they were. Jose also noticed that the two men did not look quite like normal humans. 
They had an oversized head, Asian-looking eyes, and very, very short arms. They had tanned, 
wrinkled faces, and white hair. One had a slight beard. One was wearing a hat with what appeared to 
be a face shield attached to it. They were wearing blue shirts and brilliant olive green pants and 
unusual shoes, which kind of reminded him of tennis shoes. One of the figures shirts had a band 
stretching horizontally across the chest which glowed or reflected a rainbow of colors, green, 
blue, yellow, and red, which were so bright that it looked to Jose like quote an electric solders's 
ark. It was so bright that he couldn't look at it directly. But seeing how strange these men look, 
Jose immediately quickened his pace, running along the trail, which actually took him closer to the 
men, who he hoped to pass by on the trail and get quickly away from, but this caused the two little 
men to become even more afraid, and they actually ran backwards into the forest. Jose says that the 
men were so clearly shocked by his appearance that they stumbled and collided into each other 
and nearly fell to the ground. Seeing this, Jose stopped to watch. But the men quickly disappeared 
into the thick foliage of the forest and were gone. Investigators later learned that at the 
exact time of this encounter, two other residents of the town, Oscar Pasos and the Miss Lindon Alva, 
reported seeing a quote luminous object which was flying in the sky just north of town. A 
very strange and unusual case. And yeah, the description of the ETSs is one I don't think I've 
heard before. Not precisely. It's very unusual that people describe exactly the same ETSs. It 
appears that they have a very varied ethnicity, very much like we do have here on this planet. So, 
I guess that might explain the huge variety of ETs we see. Also interesting to me about this case is 
that the witness apparently frightened these ETs who reacted in a way that they were clearly scared 
and took off into the forest there. Another fascinating case. It's amazing how many there 
are. Here's another one which I call the most frightening moment of my life. That is certainly 
a common thought that people have. This is often how they describe these encounters as being 
one of the scariest things that they have ever experienced. This case occurred on November 18, 
1967 in Greenville, Ohio. And this is a multiple witness case. It's really fascinating because 
there are quite a few witnesses and quite a few events. This rather complicated multiple 
witness case involves a series of unusual events including sightings and of course humanoids and 
landings. It involves an entire family, one member who submitted this report to MUN almost 45 years 
following the event. I'll call this witness Oliver. That is a pseudonym. At the time of 
the encounter, Oliver and his sister were living with their mother with their grandparents because 
at that time their own parents had recently gotten divorced. They lived in a rural area of 
Dark County about 3 miles south of Gettysburg, Ohio and 6 milesi north of Pittsburgh, Ohio on 
the Pittsburgh Gettysburg road, which you can see here. So this is pretty much the exact location of 
the encounter. Was late one clear November evening that Oliver and his younger sister were amusing 
themselves by taking pillows and sliding down the stairs from the second story of their home 
down to the ground floor. Oliver's younger sister at some point tired of this game and decided to 
stay downstairs, but Oliver still wanted to play, so he went upstairs and that's when his encounter 
began. As Oliver says, I climbed back to the top of the stairs to ride down again when these two 
gray-colored beings appeared in front of me, and I was frozen, not able to move. They touched some 
kind of small box on the front of their bodies at waist height. They appeared to have some type of 
clothing, like a jumpsuit, and it was the same color as their skin. Only this box thing was a 
different color and was the size of two cigarette packs put together. Whatever it was, it caused me 
to become frozen in the position I was in. I tried to scream, but nothing happened. These beings were 
about my same height, but had large heads, large eyes like a deer, a small nose and mouth. They 
were both looking me over, bending their heads to the side as they looked me over. They were able to 
communicate with me through my mind. I could hear them talking to each other and with others also. 
I am not sure how long I was frozen. All I could do was move my eyes around. I even closed them, 
hoping that upon opening them, this would be just a bad dream or something. But they were still 
there. I have never been frozen like this before. And it was frightening. Trying to scream for help 
and nothing happening. These beings looking me over was the most frightening moment of my 
life. Now, to Oliver's relief, the aliens finally moved away from him. And as he says, they seem to 
be able to float in the air as they moved to my mother's bedroom and went out through the south 
window. They floated, I assume, to the ground. About one minute from them leaving, I was able to 
move again, and I went to the window and looked out and down, seeing the two beings now meeting 
up with three others. So Oliver now watched in amazement as the five aliens moved among the bare 
cornstalks of the 20 acre field that he and his grandfather had just finished picking earlier that 
week. He could now see that the ETSs were walking towards a craft sitting on the ground about 500 
ft from the house. This was just north of their neighbor's woods. And as Oliver says, they were 
walking southwest to the corner of our farm. In the corner was a saucer-shaped craft lit up in a 
metallic color. They seemed to climb a walkway and entered the craft. It changed color and rose off 
the ground and left in a southerntherly direction, changing to all types of colors as it traveled. It 
seemed to go supersonic and was gone in about 30 to 40 seconds. There was no sound that I could 
hear from the craft. Now, immediately following the encounter, Oliver reacted in a pretty 
interesting way. He went back downstairs and just sat down on the floor and watched TV, not saying 
anything about the incident until years later. And when he finally did start to speak to the 
family about it, he learned to his amazement that all of them and in fact their neighbors not only 
believed him, they themselves had also experienced visitations. As Oliver says, our family was quite 
involved with the church, so a lot of time passed before we could begin to tell the stories without 
the ridicule of being called crazy and many other things. This was the beginning of several 
sightings of these beings on our farm and also at the neighbors also. There are four other adults 
besides me who saw these and experienced several sightings the next 10 to 20 years. I finally went 
around to my old neighbors and I told them what had happened to me and what I saw. All of them 
agreed with what I had seen. They each had many stories to tell themselves. They all thought that 
no one would believe what they saw and say they were crazy, so they've kept quiet up until now. 
The most common thread of all the stories is how frightening each instance was. Even as adults, 
none of us wanted to see what we saw. It still haunts a couple of us. It is like we are marked 
and they know how to find us because of the many times they have visited us. Really amazing. One 
fascinating thing about that case is that this is another example of so many of ETSs and humanoids 
visiting farms. Seems to be something about farms that is very attractive to the ETs. Maybe it's the 
animals, maybe it's the plants. Hard to say for sure, but it's clear to me that there this area 
has something that is attracting the ETs simply because there was so many cases over a long 
period of time. Could be that this this family is probably just contactees. I suspect they probably 
are. And I bet that witness could write a whole book about the experiences he's had and his family 
has had. So interesting. Now, let's move to the next case. This one shows how profoundly a witness 
can be affected. And in fact, I call this case, "It's taken me a lifetime." That's a direct quote 
from the witness. This one occurred one afternoon in the summer of 1973 in Paramis, New Jersey. This 
is a multiple witness case involving humanoids. And I think it illustrates a very interesting 
aspect to UFO encounters, as we'll see. It was around 5:00 p.m. one summer evening in 1973 
when two sisters from Paramis, New Jersey had an encounter with a UFO and humanoids that they would 
remember for the rest of their lives. Karen was 11 years old at the time of the incident and her 
older sister was 21, a college student studying to become a chiropractor. Both of them are anonymous, 
so that is a pseudonym. Now, suddenly Karen's older sister started shouting from outside. Karen 
joined her outside and beheld an incredible sight. As she says, "Hovering above our twocar garage, 
I saw a large dull gray object hovering. It did not have airplane wings or a propeller. 
The object was very, very long and big, like a long cigar- shape, and it was high up, about 
3 to four stories high. I wondered why it was so quiet. It simply hovered in one spot. I did notice 
very tiny windows across the side, a little higher than halfway up. I wondered if there were people 
inside. And right after I thought this, I noticed slight movement. Suddenly, there were three dark 
shapes in the window just to the left. I saw a small dark-shaped figure. To the right of this 
figure was another taller dark-shaped figure, and to its right was another small dark figure like 
the first. I tried to see if the figures had a face or hair or clothing, but I couldn't tell. All 
I could make out was the outline of what looked like shoulders with an outline of a head shape. 
Now, Karen could clearly see that this wasn't an airplane or a blimp or any conventional craft. It 
was far too large. In fact, it stretched over the entire house. The separate garage, the driveway, 
and the yard. As Karen says, that was the moment I suddenly wondered if it could be a real UFO. I 
asked my sister if she thought it was a UFO, and she quietly whispered, "Yes." As soon as 
she replied to my question, small lights turned on. They started blinking faster and faster in a 
steady pattern from left to right, green, red, and white. I quickly looked for the dark figures I had 
seen seconds before in the tiny windows. They were gone. Without a sound, this object took off in a 
southwest direction. It moved so fast I stood in shock. Looking around, Karen and her sister 
now saw the object way off in the distance. Her sister yelled, "Get my keys." Karen ran inside, 
retrieved the car keys, and the two sisters hopped in the car, and drove onto the on-ramp to Highway 
4, where the craft had moved over. You can see it here. They tried to get closer, but the traffic 
was very heavy. They did see cars stopping on both sides of the four-lane highway to watch 
this object. The object then moved off, and they returned home and immediately told their mother, 
who was initially skeptical, but her daughters quickly convinced her that it had truly happened. 
And as Karen says, we never spoke about this event to anyone. I knew no one would believe 
me. I didn't want anyone to think me or my sister were crazy, so I kept quiet. It was decades later 
when her sister was in her 70s. Karen finally asked her again about this incident and if her 
sister remembered and her sister said yes and that it was quote a UFO. You saw it, I saw it, it was 
real. So this affected Karen profoundly. As Karen says, I pray someday somehow mankind will come to 
understand the unexplainable. I hope sharing my experience will give the others the courage 
to come forward and share theirs without fear. Sadly, it's taken me a lifetime. The question 
I have about that case is why did the UFO come down so low over this particular home, over these 
particular witnesses? Looks to me like this is the type of behavior we call a display where ETSs and 
I'm speculating here are doing this intentionally to sort of publicize their presence. There are 
enough cases where it certainly looks like that's what they're doing. Another interesting aspect 
to this case is that one person's sighting of humanoids is another person's close encounter 
of the first kind. a simple sighting cuz this was a very widely viewed UFO. Though apparently it was 
only these two witnesses who saw the humanoids. That alone makes this case to me very fascinating 
and very important. All right, let's move to the next case which I call something happened. This 
one occurred one evening in July of 1998 in West Colombia, South Carolina. This actually involves 
three events, which is not unusual. Sometimes a close encounter involves several events. Often 
they'll start with a sighting perhaps and then the witness has a direct face-to-face encounter with 
humanoids. This one kind of fits that pattern, but yeah, multiple events involving a very 
credible witness. This case involves a sheriff's deputy who had three separate encounters all in a 
row in the summer of 1998. It took him almost 20 years to come forward. But in 2017, he decided 
it was time to share his experiences. The first encounter occurred one evening when he was in 
his bedroom in his home in West Columbia, South Carolina. He and his wife were asleep in bed when 
the deputy was awakened by quote a very bright light and a worring sound. As the witness says, 
the light came through the bedroom window next to me. I heard this low-pitched worring sound 
unlike anything I was familiar with. There was no other noise, which seemed strange because I had 
dogs in the yard. As I tried to get up and look out the window, I realized I was paralyzed. Now, 
the deputy says he remained immobilized in his bed for about 15 full minutes while this sound 
and light continued. His wife never woke up and at some point the deputy fell asleep. He awakened the 
next morning and told his wife what happened, but it wasn't long before his experiences 
escalated. And the second encounter was far more dramatic. Again, it was late at night and he and 
his wife were asleep in bed. As before, he was awakened by unusual activity. As the deputy says, 
I awoke levitated approximately 2 ft above my mattress. On my wife's side of the bed, 
I observed two small figures. There was also a third figure at the foot of my bed. All three were 
wearing hooded cloaks and appeared to be about four to 5t tall. As I levitated above my bed, 
I could feel my body being examined. There was no pain and the figures remained motionless. After 
about 30 minutes, my body abruptly dropped to the bed. Now, the witness was still awake. He says 
he had no apparent lapse of consciousness. He was covered with sweat and was breathing heavily. Now, 
able to move and cry out, he immediately woke up his wife and told her what happened. Strangely, 
she seemed very unconcerned. Now, the third and final encounter happened just a few months later 
during the winter months. At that time, he was actually on duty in his patrol car, driving on 
a well-lit, well-traveled road, he said, and approaching a railroad crossing. It was a dark, 
clear night with no moon or stars around 7 p.m. And as he says, "As I approached the crossing, 
I noticed a bright light to my right. The light was a great distance away and was not moving. I 
kept my eye on the light looking for movement or something to help me identify it, but it never 
moved and it was definitely not an earthbound light. Getting to the railroad crossing, 
my vehicle stopped. I was still trying to figure out the light source. The next thing I remember 
was being at the railroad crossing, looking at the clock on my dash. It was approximately 900 p.m. So 
the deputy was understandably shocked. It seemed impossible to him that he could have been sitting 
there at that railroad crossing on a welltraked road for two full hours. The light was now gone. 
It appeared that he was missing two hours of time. And as he says, I have no memory of what happened 
during those two hours and can only speculate on a possible abduction. These three experiences all in 
a row were enough to prompt the deputy to report them officially. He remains somewhat ambivalent 
about what they might mean. As he says, I have had no other encounters and I have shared these 
with many people. The encounters were interesting but not alarming. Do I believe in aliens? I can 
only tell you my experiences and let you decide. I had three separate alien encounters. something 
happened and I have relayed the information. Maybe I'll have another encounter that will prove they 
exist. That to me is an interesting case for a number of reasons. I love cases involving 
police officers because I think they make very credible witnesses. They're trained observers. 
There's a lot of police officers who are in the contacty population, which makes sense because 
let's face it, they are often outside at night. It is their job to basically patrol the area. So, 
it would make sense that they are far more likely to see UFOs or have a UFO encounter. Interesting 
to me is that he had three encounters and the one involving the humanoids with him levitating above 
his bed for almost 20 minutes. That's amazing. You don't often hear people describing that. Perhaps 
it just felt longer than it was. Hard to say for sure. He was the witness. he would know best, 
but certainly a fascinating case. And now let's move to the next one. There are quite a few cases 
of people describing ETS living and walking among us. And that appears to be what's going on here. I 
call this case they did not appear human. This one occurred on March 18, 2007, right outside of Rome, 
Italy, in which the witness saw ETSs in a very public place or what appear to be ETS. This 
one is quite unusual. The witness in this case is anonymous, so I've given her the pseudonym Maria. 
This is a very unusual encounter with what appears to be two humanish looking ETS in a very public 
place. was around 9:30 a.m. March 18, 2007, and Maria was traveling by train from the Rome Termin 
station, which you can see here, to Vurbo. Maria boarded the train and took a spot three 
rows from the back of the car. While the other passengers got on board the train, Maria busied 
herself by reading her travel guide book. After a few minutes, the train started moving. 
There were about 10 people on board and looking up, Maria noticed two very unusual looking figures 
sitting in front of her. As she says, two short, stocky girls were sitting in front of me wearing 
obvious wigs. The one on the left had a blonde wig and the one on the right had a brunette wig. The 
two girls were talking and I heard a language I did not recognize. I told myself to keep reading 
and not be nosy. The girl with the blonde wig was really talking the whole train trip and she 
faced sideways talking to the girl sitting next to her. I looked up from my book and I saw the 
blonde being's profile. I was shocked. She had no nose. She had only holes that went back into her 
head. Her mouth was completely round and had deep wrinkle lines radiating from the center to the 
edge like a wagon wheel. The mouth was light brown in color. Her skin was white but normall looking 
with very small narrow eyelids and no eyebrows. I was shocked. Maria tried to rationalize what 
she was seeing. She wondered if the reason for the woman's unusual facial appearance could be 
because she had had an accident or had a very bad facial reconstruction. None of it made any sense 
because there was no evidence of scarring that she could see. Maria tried not to stare, but the 
girl looked so unusual she couldn't help it. As Maria says, I told myself to look away and keep 
reading my book. I was disturbed by what I saw and had trouble concentrating. Now, at this point, 
Maria still believes she was probably looking at someone who's just very unusual looking, but 
probably human. Then something happened which made her change her mind. as Maria says. A few minutes 
later, the girl with the brunette wig on the right turned her head to face the blond-headed being, 
and when she turned her head to speak, she had the same features. I knew at that point that these two 
were very strange and did not appear to be human at all. I was shocked seeing them. I couldn't 
even pretend to read my travel guide. I couldn't concentrate on it at all. I had a very hard time 
looking away out of fear. I kept thinking, "What were they?" The train began making its scheduled 
stops, and people began to exit the train. After three stops, Maria and the other two strange women 
were the only passengers left on the train car. Being alone with the strange figures scared her, 
and she became even more frightened at the thought that they were going to exit the train at Vurbo, 
like her, there were only two stops left, including hers. Finally, at the last stop before 
Maria's, the women got out of their seats to exit the train. That's when Maria got another shock and 
further indication that these two figures in front of her were not normal humans. As Maria says, the 
being with the brunette wig got up from her seat and walks towards the front of the train car and 
was having trouble getting her suitcase down from the overhead shelf. She was about 4' 8 in tall 
and had trouble wheeling the suitcase in front of her and I could see both of her hands around the 
handle. Then I noticed she had no thumbs. She had four fingers. They got off at the last stop before 
Vurbo in the nature reserve Lago de Viko area. Maria was so stunned by what she had seen that she 
just pushed the event from her mind. And it wasn't until a few months later that she happened to come 
upon a drawing of a hairless alien. And that's when she recalled what she had seen. As Maria 
says, I didn't understand what I saw at the time. I realized they looked exactly like the drawing 
of the alien except for the wigs. It took me a few months to report it because of job pressures 
and disbelief. Now later, Maria would have two other sightings, but as she says, I don't know if 
these incidents are related to this, but she does believe that these were ETSs because not only did 
they look unusual, they were apparently wearing wigs, also they were speaking a foreign language, 
also they only had four fingers. So, these details began to really add up to make her realize these 
people were not normal. Again, there are more cases of people seeing what appear to be ETS 
in public places. Far more, I think, than even is known within the UFO community. I know Bud 
Hopkins had a case where a lady saw a gray on a subway. But yeah, there are cases of ETSs being 
seen at gas stations and bus stations and all over the place, convenience stores, of course, 
schools. This happens more often than you might think. Suppose it's possible that this witness saw 
two people who were very unusual in appearance. Perhaps a genetic disorder or injury of some 
kind. Suppose it's possible, but the witness doesn't think so. And again, you have I always 
give the witness the benefit of the doubt because it's their experience. It's always funny to me 
when someone outside passes judgment on someone else's experience when they weren't even there. 
So yeah, another fascinating case of what appeared to be ETS walking among us. Now let's move to the 
next case which I call I know what is out there. This one occurred one evening in June 2008 in 
Spring Creek, Nevada. Beautiful little town. This witness is a teenager the time she had her 
encounter, but it's such a close-up encounter. It's really quite poignant and it illustrates 
some really interesting aspects that do occur when someone has a face-to-face encounter with 
a humanoid. The witness in this case is anonymous and I've given her the pseudonym Tracy. In 2008, 
she was 16 years old and living in the very small town of Spring Creek, Nevada. That's located about 
10 miles from Elco. This was actually her aunt's house because there were only a few rooms she had 
to sleep on the couch. It was one June evening in 2008 that Tracy found herself waking up at 
3:00 a.m. for no apparent reason. She looked at the clock in the kitchen and noted the time. 
And that's when she scanned the room to the left and saw something so unusual she froze in fear. 
She saw that the door to the living room was wide open and a brilliant white blue light was shining 
through the door. And standing in this light were three weird alien figures. As Tracy says, 
there were three 4-ft tall beings with heads too large for their bodies. One was standing in front 
and the other two were about one foot behind the front one on the left and right side. I 
was unable to make out their facial features due to the light coming from only the back of them, 
but there was no question that they were standing there clear as day. As soon as I noticed them and 
jolted from fear, the front one zoomed over to me on the couch. I didn't notice how it moved because 
it was so quickly standing over me as I remained lying there. I looked up at it and of course my 
adrenaline was pumping. I felt a little hand rub my cheek in a comforting way. Now at this point, 
Tracy heard her own voice echoing in her head saying, "It's okay." And immediately her fear 
evaporated. As Tracy says, "Not even kidding. The second it touched my cheek, my adrenaline 
stopped and my heart rate went back to normal almost instantly, which I still don't know how 
that is even possible. It's like it controlled my emotions by touching my cheek. The feeling I got 
when it touched my cheek was overwhelming love and comfort and happiness. It was like it was 
telling me not to be worried and that it meant no harm. The weirdest thing is I even looked up 
at it and smirked with comfort and knew it was okay to go back to sleep. Who would go back to 
sleep with some foreign being standing right above them? Tracy says that the encounter lasted no more 
than 30 seconds. Interestingly, it was around this same time, either right or before or right after 
that Tracy did have a remarkable UFO sighting. She said she was at a gas station in Spring Creek when 
a UFO showed up and maneuvered in a way that was quote defying all physics. And this turned out to 
be the first of five other UFO sightings that she would have over the next 10 years. She did report 
her humanoid encounter in 2017, about 8 years after it happened, as she felt a compulsion to 
share it with others. Ultimately, she feels it was a benevolent encounter. As she says, "I still have 
a neverending curiosity and still feel blessed to have had the experience with extraterrestrials 
that I have. It feels great to make others aware that they are not alone and I too know what is 
out there." Quite a few cases of people waking up to find ETS in their home. I've said this before, 
but I think it bears repeating. One of the most common places to see a humanoid is within your 
own bedroom. While this technically occurred in a person's living room, that was where she was 
sleeping. I can only imagine how frightening that would be to suddenly wake up and see something in 
your bedroom like this. But what's fascinating to me about this particular case is that this 
gray seemed to be very compassionate and also the witness felt this absolute sense of calmness once 
the ET reached out and kind of touched her cheek. That's also not terribly unusual. It's very really 
interesting to me that they have this reaction sometimes on people because some cases or many 
cases I should say are very frightening for the witness. But that's not always the case. 
And she herself was fascinated by the fact that she just fell asleep after this encounter. Not 
terribly unusual again. All right, let's move to the last and final case in this compilation. This 
one's also very interesting. I call this one a very personal event. This one occurred one 
evening in 2010 in New Mexico. The witness does not describe the exact location. Witnesses are 
often quite cy or wary about revealing details or even their identity because of course there's so 
much fear and confusion surrounding the subject. and witnesses expose themselves to all kinds of 
gaslighting and skepticism and ridicule if they come forward. It's funny to me that skeptics will 
say, "Oh, people are just seeking attention." When really the opposite is true. Witnesses 
don't want their name to be used. They absolutely are very wary of going public and most will keep 
their encounter secret for a very long time, if not forever. So, this case clearly did affect 
the person very profoundly. It's interesting to me because it involves a security guard. Quite a few, 
like police officers, quite a few security guards also have encounters. The witness in this case is 
an anonymous security guard who was patrolling an old tower building at the time of his encounter. 
The property was large enough that he had to patrol it by driving his car around the area. 
And it was 2 am on the evening of June 16, 2010 that he had an encounter with a humanoid which 
had a profound effect on him. As the witness says, I had a sighting of a gray. As I turned the corner 
in my vehicle, my headlights shone on the being. It turned and ran. Its back was to me almost the 
entire time. Its height was approximately 5 ft. Its skin was a muted gray with a texture like 
tough skin or rough leather. The body was thin, yet the head looked to be too large for the neck 
and the body to hold. Small wrinkles near the base of the skull where it met the neck could be seen. 
I saw the back of it mostly. Its arms didn't swing much as it ran away. However, it did lean into the 
left hand turn in an odd way. Its fingers on its right hand were closed as if carrying something, 
but the left hand was open. The fingers seemed to be longer than a human's hand, but the palm 
looked to be the same size. The legs and torso met cleanly with hardly a waist to be seen. Now, 
the security guard did say that he did not see any hair on this being. He said it was either 
not wearing any clothes or was wearing a full body skintight suit of some kind. 
He said it was in view for only about 8 to 10 seconds, at which point it ran around the 
corner of the building ahead of the witness and moved out of sight, but he says it was quote, 
"Long enough for me to register what it was." The witness immediately stopped his car, 
grabbed his flashlight, and ran after the being, but coming around the corner of the building, 
it was gone. He did immediately replay the strange event in his mind. And as he says, 
the entire incident seemed as if I had startled the being. It saw me turn the corner and ran away 
from me around the building. It was facing me at first with its back to the building. Then it 
turned to the west, running around the building, made a left-hand turn to run south along the west 
side of the building. Now, immediately following the encounter, something equally strange happened. 
The witness says his memory of the event became overlaid or clouded with a false screen memory 
which felt almost as though it was implanted into his mind. He said he became convinced at least 
temporarily that the whole encounter actually involved kids wearing motorcycle helmets and 
riding quadwheelers around the building. But something about this memory seemed off because 
he could see no tire tracks, no dust had been kicked up. And when he had run around the corner, 
there were no kids to be seen. So something wasn't right and he knew it. Unfortunately, he was the 
only witness and there was no security camera in the area. So he was quite puzzled. Finally, 
he spoke privately to a deputy about it and that's when he kind of broke through the screen memory of 
the kids on the quads and recalled the actual encounter. Even then, he was hesitant to talk 
about it. As he says, I never made a report about this. No one would have believed me had I actually 
made the report. I have held this story for a long time. It has been a very personal and profound 
event for me. The witness does report seeing UFOs on a few occasions, but it was the sighting of a 
gray alien that had the greatest impact on him. There you go, another humanoid case. It's amazing 
how many there are. for this case. What really intrigues me is how this witness described the 
screen memory and how he was managed to break through it by realizing that this screen memory 
didn't quite fit the facts. That really makes me wonder how many cases there are where people 
never quite get to the truth of what happened to them and accept the screen memory as real. 
I'm glad he broke through it and figured out that he had an encounter with a gray. It's interesting 
to me he calls it a very personal event because this just goes to show how it affects a person so 
profoundly. A really astonishing case in a lot of different ways. One question I have is what were 
the ETs doing there at this factory? I know we don't know exactly where it is, but I'll be very 
interested to know what exactly this factory is all about because there's a lot of cases of ETSs 
showing interest in our technology and things like this. So perhaps that's why it was there. 
Hard to say for sure, but an absolute fascinating case. I find all these cases fascinating. There's 
10 cases for you and as you know if you watch this show a lot more where that came from. So, 
there does appear to be a very prominent extraterrestrial presence on our planet. I know 
this subject has yet to go fully mainstream, but it's finally getting a lot of publicity. Really, 
it's a new era dawning for humanity as this subject is now being discussed officially 
in places like Congress, among senators and representatives. And let's face it, 
ETSs contact all levels of society from world leaders, scientists, astronomers, police officers, 
doctors, nurses, all kinds of professionals, white collar workers, blue collar workers, 
it doesn't matter. All the way down to even homeless people. Everybody is having contact 
at all levels of society. And that speaks volumes. So, I think it's time that this subject is taken 
seriously. Again, one of the reasons I do this research, we all deserve to know the truth about 
what's going on. And I think we have enough cases to prove conclusively that we are not alone on 
this planet. And I do think personally that we are dealing with extraterrestrials. But again, 
I'm just reporting the facts as we know them. It's up to you to make your own minds about it. Do your 
own research. So, thanks again, guys. I hope you've enjoyed this show. And until next time, 
keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. Most important of all, 
keep having fun, have a great weekend, and I will see you next time. Bye for now.
