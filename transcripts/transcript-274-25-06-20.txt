Summary:
Jun 20, 2025
The UFO phenomenon is incredibly complex and varied. There are many different types of encounters, and much confusion and fear still surround this subject, which makes it very difficult to categorize and comprehend extraterrestrial contact. This video presents twelve different types of cases: sightings, landings, humanoids and more. Each case contains the trademark high strangeness that accompanies UFO contact.

THE END OF THE WORLD. At 5am on April 14, 1946, Paul Cummings Jr and his friend, Douglas Gowd drove along a remote highway outside Havana, Illinois when a brilliant glowing object appeared in front of them on the highway. Suddenly it zoomed forward causing them to veer off the highway, flee their car and lay face-down on the ground.

THE PERFECT CASE? At 3am on October 23, 1954, farmer Carmelo Papotto went to check on his fields located in Tripoli, Libya. He was amazed to see a strange craft land. It had a metallic base with wheels on the bottom. The top had a transparent dome with six human-looking men inside. He tried to touch the craft and received a bad shock. Was this craft ET or something else?

PANIC AT 8000 FEET. On the night of November 21, 1954, a Brazilian passenger plane with 13 passengers was flying over Paraiba River, Brazil. Without warning, the inside of the plane filled with light. Looking outside, the passengers saw 19 flying saucers pacing the plane. The passengers panicked and chaos reigned in the cabin. A few passengers had to be physically restrained.

SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG. Early on the night of May 12, 1963, three boys were rowing on a small lake in Sawyer, Michigan when they noticed two shadowy figures by the side of the lake. At the same moment, a large glowing craft appeared over the lake by their boat. The boys rowed away in fear and ran home. But arriving home, they were missing more than 1 hour of time.

THE SHOCKING UFO. At 9pm on June 14, 1964, Charles Englebrecht was watching TV in his home when a weird light appeared outside and the power in his house went out. Going outside, he saw a strange object landed in his yard. He tried to get close but was held back by a forcefield. The object took off but caused many strange and unique effects. Others also reported seeing the UFO.

SOMETHING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. At 1am on June 29, 1964, Beauford Parham was driving near Lavonia, Georgia when a top-shaped craft dropped from the sky and hovered above his car. It followed him for 2 miles before coming right at him and blasting him with heat. Both he and his car were burned by the craft. It was one of several similar incidents in the area at that time.

THE UFO FORCEFIELD. On the night of December 31, 1972, two young women were walking near their homes in Pulkkinen, Finland. Suddenly a red orb kept appearing and disappearing near them. Without warning, a large craft appeared in front of them. One of the women was thrown to the ground by a strange force, and the other was immobilized. Both broke free and fled the area.

UFO GOES POSTAL. On the night of October 2, 1976, Albert Young was in his home in Palestine, Texas when he heard a squeaking noise outside. It sounded like his neighbor’s mailbox being struck by a car. Looking outside, he saw that instead it was a UFO. The next morning, the mailbox was found a long distance from its original location.

PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING. On the night of June 1983, hundreds of people were enjoying a movie at a drive-in theater in Mobile, Alabama. Suddenly two UFOs showed up, causing the crowd of movie-goers to panic. Strangely, after the incident, many of the people there had no memory of the event.

THE ALIEN SKELETONS. One day in March 1987, a medical doctor was walking on his 400-acre farm in rural western Kentucky and came upon a perfect circle of burned vegetation. Much weirder were two humanoid skeletons lying nearby. He called the police. The Air Force soon showed up, gathered the evidence, covered up the landing traces, and threatened the witness.

WE WERE BEING WATCHED. Late at night on November 19, 1989, Officer “Dale” was patrolling the backroads of his town in rural Arkansas. Coming upon four teenagers in a pickup, he was ready to warn them about staying up too late. To his shock, there was a flying saucer blocking the road. At that point, the engine of his cruiser died. Like the kids, he was stranded.

THE FLOATING CAR. On the night of February 26, 1996, Andres Landiera was driving to his home in Guitiriz, Spain when his car engine starting to fail. Suddenly he realized that his car was floating in the sky 30 feet high. It was set down after just a few moments, but the incident scared him badly. Unknown to him, many people in the area were seeing UFOs.

Twelve cases, each showing how UFO encounters can manifest in many different ways and cause many different reactions. Each adds to our knowledge of these strange visitors to our planet.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. Today's episode
is called Things Are Getting Weirder: 12 Truly Odd UFO Encounters. Really excited
about today's episode because I'm going to cover all different types of UFO encounters. Close encounters of the
first, second, and third kind, and really more than that. So we have sightings, we have landings, we have
humanoids, missing time, even one apparent UFO crash. These are cases
which reach from 1946 up to 1996. So that's 50 years of encounters. And of
course, these are cases that have something to offer to our understanding
of what UFOs can do, who these occupants are, where they come from, and have some
really unique and strange elements to them that you probably haven't heard before. I mean, some are truly odd, very
weird. Again, cases from all over the world, including Finland, Italy, Spain,
Brazil, and eight from the United States, including Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and finally, Texas. I think
you'll find this one particularly interesting because some of these cases are just off the charts strange. So
let's just get started with the first one which I call the end of the world.
This is a very early case which occurred on April 14, 1946 in Havana, Illinois.
And yeah, I gave it that title because this is what the witnesses thought was happening. This is at a time, of course,
when UFOs were unheard of. So, this was an incredibly shocking experience for
these two witnesses and just a really unusual case. This firsthand account
comes from the witnesses Paul Cummings Jr. of Quincy, Illinois, and his friend.
Now, due to the strangeness and fantastic nature of his experience, he actually waited 20 years to report it.
It was 500 a.m. on April 14, 1946. as he and his friend Douglas Gaudy were
driving from Canton, Illinois to Lincoln. And they were about 10 mi east of Havana, Illinois, near the
intersection of Highway 10. You can see it here. It was still dark at that time.
And theirs was the only car on the highway when, without warning, about one
mile ahead of them on this perfectly straight highway, they both saw a massive bright glowing sphere. was right
above the road and almost immediately it began to zoom towards them. As Paul
says, the object seemed to glide straight down the highway towards us about 1 ft above the pavement and
occupied the entire roaded possibly touching both shoulders of the highway.
So that's pretty big. This highway was about 20 ft wide and the object appeared
to be on a direct collision course with their vehicle. And in moments, this
thing, whatever it was, was only 200 f feet from their car. So, fearing a
head-on collision, Paul swerved the car off the highway, jammed on the brakes,
they opened the doors, and both men jumped out of the car as fast as they could and threw themselves into the
ditch alongside the highway. They lay face down and covered their heads with their arms to protect themselves from
what they were sure was going to be a collision. In fact, Douglas shouted out, "It's the end of the world." Now, this
object moved directly overhead, at which point they heard no noise. They felt no heat. They were face down, so they
didn't actually see it at this point, and they remained lying on the ground for about 2 minutes before finally
gathering the courage to get back up. They looked up and down the highway all around, but the object was gone. They
discussed what they had seen, briefly discussed the possibility that maybe they had seen the rising sun, but they
knew that was not the case. It was still dark. They could not come up with any explanation. Looking at the car, they
saw that the headlights were still on. The doors were open just as they had left it. They got back into the car and
drove on to the nearby town of Mason where they had breakfast and excitedly discussed what they had seen. But as
Paul says, it was certainly a very frightening experience and I have been very reluctant to repeat the story to
others due to what I considered a fantastic episode at that time. Now, I
would classify that case as a simple sighting, a close encounter of the first kind. And yet, you can see that even a
simple sighting, if there is such a thing, can be an incredibly traumatic experience. UFOs do seem to have this
penchant for chasing cars down roads. And this is a very early example of
that. I can only imagine what it must have been like for these two witnesses to actually jump out of their car and
lie in a ditch wondering what was going to happen. A really amazing case. Now I
want to move to the next one which got quite a bit of attention. This one is really, really unusual. I call this one
the perfect case that ends with a question mark because this case does
have some extremely unusual elements to it. It occurred on October 23rd, 1954
in Tripoli, Libya. This was misreported by a number of sources saying it
occurred in Italy, but no, it did not. This was in Libya. But as you'll see, it
has some really strange elements to it. This involves a landing with humanoids.
Again, this case got a lot of attention. It was widely published, but as far as I can tell, it was first published in
Clipius magazine in an Italian newspapers, but was in Jacques Valet's
book, Passport to Meonia, which really popularized this case. The witness is an
Italian farmer by the name of Carmelo Papato, who at that time lived and worked in Tripolitania, Libya. Again,
not in Italy, as several sources report. It was 3:00 a.m. on October 23rd, 1954.
As Carmelo was checking the fields, as he did each morning, these fields had
been freshly plowed. In the darkness, he suddenly saw a small craft descend from
the sky slowly to the ground, he says, drifting down like snow does, and actually landed 40 to 50 feet away from
him. Now, his first thought was that this was a military helicopter, but it
didn't sound like one, and he soon saw that it wasn't. It was ovalshaped, like an egg on its side. The lower half was
metallic. On the front sides, there were two ports. In the center, there was a
ladder. On the outside of the craft, the undercarriage had two cylindrical tubes
extruding downwards. The back had two single wheels and the front half had two
sets of double wheels. The back part of the craft also had a group of tubes
facing backwards that looked to Carmelo much like gun barrels. So you can see
the drawing of this craft here. Very odd. Now the top half was a transparent
domed fuselage lit with a brilliant white light. And inside there were six
men seated. Each of them were wearing yellow coveralls and what appeared to be gas masks. And as this craft came in for
a landing, it made a sound that Carmelo described as being like a compressor, or as he says, like those used for
inflating car tires. Now, on top of this dome, there were two what appeared to be antenna. The whole craft was about 18 ft
long and 9 ft wide. Not terribly large, but he said it had the silhouette of
quote an aerodynamic automobile. Now, after the craft landed, Carmelo saw one
of the men immediately remove his gas mask, and he could now see that this man was definitely humanlooking, this man
began to blow into some kind of tube that was inside of the fuselage. Now,
Carmela was very curious, so he approached and actually walked right up to this craft, went to the ladder, and
placed his hand on one of the rungs, intending to climb it. But as soon as he
did this, he instantly got a strong electric shock which actually threw him to the ground. It was at this point that
one of the men inside the craft gestured at Carmelo, warning him to keep away
from the craft. Another occupant inside this covered dome, pulled out what looked like a wheel of some kind, then
replaced it, and pushed a button which caused a container to cover this wheel. Carmela could see what looked like a
radio set complete with wires being operated by a man who was wearing earphones. All six of the occupants were
very busy observing and working with various instrument panels in front of them. Now Carmelo watched this for quite
some time and this craft was on the ground he estimates for about 20 minutes
when suddenly it took off now in perfect silence. It rose vertically to a height
of 150 feet and then per carmelo darted off at dizzying speed towards the east.
Afterwards there were imprints about 2 ft long left on the soft ground. These were allegedly verified and
photographed. Now again, this case took place in the middle of the very intense
French wave of sightings in October, November of 1954 and involved not only
sightings but landings and humanoids. And in fact, there were several other landings reported on this very same day
in France. Jacqu Valet calls this case quote the perfect case. And he calls it
this because it illustrates his theory that UFOs are not extraterrestrial craft, but instead are, as he says,
physical eyes, quote, threedimensional holograms with mass projected through
time. As Jacqu Filet says, I would say this is what the farmer saw. It is
tempting to assume that the farmer, far from witnessing by chance the maneuvers of interplanetary visitors, was
deliberately exposed to a scene designed to be recorded by him and transmitted to
us. Hence, the gas masks, the instrument panels, and the radio set complete with
wires. I personally not so sure about this because if you do
some research into this time 1954 this appears to be the time we were doing
anti-gravity research. So Jacqu Vali's theory is certainly interesting but to
me it seems to be far far more likely that what this witness saw was a secret military craft piloted by humans from
Earth. So by any measure that's a truly unusual case. I honestly do think this
is a perfect example of reverse engineering. Yes, it did take place
during this massive UFO wave over France. All kinds of landings and little
humanoids being seen. But this witness described what appears to be humanlooking people. I mean, they were
wearing yellow jumpsuits and gas masks and had headphones and radios. It really
does look like a case of reverse engineering, particularly because there are wheels on the craft. I have yet to
hear of a genuine UFO that has wheels. I really don't buy into Jacques Filelet's explanation that this was an
orchestrated event for the witness put forth by an alien intelligence, but you can make up
your own minds about it. And again, definitely an interesting case. Now, let's move to the next one. Boy, I wish
it was there for this one. At least I think I do, cuz this one is a very dramatic case. I call this one panic at
8,000 ft. This occurred on November 21st, 1954 as well over the Pariba River
in Brazil. And this is one of many, many cases involving UFOs seen from aircraft.
But to me, the most interesting aspect of this case is how the people in the aircraft reacted. This very dramatic
case is virtually unknown in the United States, but apparently was published in newspapers both in South America and the
UK. It did have a brief mention in Richard Hall's book, The UFO Evidence.
And this case involves a Brazilian airliner that was cruising at 8,000 ft.
This was on the night of November 21st, 1954. again over Pariba River, Brazil. This
plane had a crew and 13 passengers. So, there they are flying at 8,000 ft when,
without warning, a brilliant light illuminated the plane. And looking outside, everyone on the plane saw 19,
get that, nine, 19, circular craft. They estimate these craft were about 100 ft
in diameter. They were moving at very high speed in formation and were at the
same elevation of the plane and very close to it only 300 ft away. In fact,
the craft appeared so quickly that the pilot had no time to react in terms of maneuvering the plane and instantly
there was complete pandemonium in the aircraft. The passengers were unified in
their panic and terror at the sight of these 19 mysterious objects. In fact,
one female passenger started screaming and in a complete panic rushed into the
pilot's cockpit and had to be physically subdued. Another frantic male passenger,
quote, lost his mind, and he actually tried to open an exit door in mid-flight. One of the crewmen had to
fight with this passenger to subdue him and restrain him. Finally, these UFOs
moved off. Calm was finally restored. This plane landed at Rio where, as you
can imagine, news of this incident spread quickly, reaching the United States. Researcher Donald Kho heard
about it, and when he did, he felt that he finally understood why Brazil was
expressing such concern over what they called, quote, the UFO problem.
Admittedly, that is a very short case, very sparse on details. I understand
that it was published in a number of places and there's probably some more information about it out there. I
couldn't find it, but I thought it was an important case because it shows how profoundly people can react in fear to
even a simple sighting. I mean, let's face it, these people weren't taken on board or anything like that. They just
saw UFOs outside the plane. Yeah, there were 19, so I can certainly understand
how that would be quite traumatic. But a really interesting case. Now this next
one, this one has missing time. This one has an almost landed UFO humanoids. This
one's really unusual. I call this one something was very wrong. This occurred
May 12, 1963. That is approximate but pretty close in Sawyer, Michigan. There
are three witnesses to this one, but some very unusual elements. I think it's
an important case. This case was reported to Muon and it comes from a gentleman by the name of Rick. I believe
he was a teenager at the time of this incident was around 9:30 p.m. May 12,
1963. And Rick was fishing alone in his little rowboat on a little man-made lake
directly off of the I94 not far from his home in Sawyer, Michigan. Now his
friends, two younger brothers, were standing on the shore of the lake and waved to him, asking him to take them
for a ride in his rowboat. Rick agreed. He rode to the shore, picked them up,
and they began to row around the lake. Now, at some point, Rick noticed two people standing at the edge of the lake
close to the freeway side, and he immediately assumed that they were his two friends who often met him there on
the lake to go fishing. So he began to row over towards them and this is when things began to get weird. I'll just let
Rick describe this because he describes it in really interesting detail. As Rick
says, I rode up to them maybe 15 ft away and started calling their names. No
reply. It was dark and I couldn't make them out except in silhouette. I was
about to roll closer when the kids in the back started screaming and crying. I
turned to them and they pointed to my left and I saw this object floating maybe 2 feet off the water 100 ft away.
The object was oval with a flattened bottom and maybe 10 to 20 ft wide. Its
color was an opolescent white that did not reflect on the water. It didn't make a sound or disturb the surface of the
water and it seemed to be slowly coming towards us. When I realized something
was very wrong, I turned the boat around and headed for the opposite shore where we kept the boat. I did not bother to
look at the object again. I was scared and rowing my heart out. We were all scared to death and ran for the kids'
house as soon as we hit the shore. When we came into their house, their mother and father started yelling at the three
of us, asking, "Where the hell were you?" So Rick told them, "I took the
boys for a ride." And he tried to explain what happened, but the father cut him off and said, "Bull crap." He
actually swore. He explained that they had combed the area by the lake thoroughly, actually walked around it,
calling for them for the last hour, and they were not there. They found nothing. Rick, of course, protested and said, "We
didn't see you or hear you." And that's when the father pointed to the clock and said that it was 11:15 p.m. Rick stared
at the clock in amazement because he thought the time should have been no later than 10 p.m. was clear to them
that they were missing about 1 hour of time or more. And as Rick says, there's
more to this, but it's hard to explain here. This has bothered me since that day, and I simply had to get it off my
chest. I really really would like to talk to the witness on that case because he hints that there's quite a bit more
to it and I think there probably is. I want to know if they had any dreams following this encounter, any physical
effects, anything else that was going on at that time that was unusual because with that kind of missing time, I mean,
that's a red flag that this was more than just a sighting, even more than just humanoids. Probably an onboard
encounter. Hard to say for sure without talking to the witnesses. But it's an important case because there are many
people who claim even now that UFO events, particularly on board cases, are
psychological. No, these parents were looking for these kids for an hour. They were not where
they were supposed to be. It's one of many cases where people are missing from the location where they're supposed to
be. So where were they? Presumably on board a craft. So definitely in that
regard, I think it's an important case. And now we move to another case which has got some of the most unusual
elements to it I think I've ever heard. And it's got a lot of verification to it. Quite a few corroborating witnesses,
landing traces, physiological effects, and more. So I think you'll find this a
truly compelling case. I call this one the shocking UFO. This occurred on June
14 in 1964 in the very small town of Dale, Indiana. And boy, I'm telling you,
this is quite a case. This case comes from NIKAP, the National Investigative
Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and also from Project Blue Book. It involves Charles V. Engelre, an 18-year-old
factory worker. He was in his home outside of the small town of Dale,
Indiana, watching television. And at 8:55 p.m. on June 14, 1964,
he saw an oddlooking light pass by the kitchen window outside. So he went to
investigate. And as he did so, the television set failed and all the house lights went out. And going outside, he
saw a glowing basketball-sized or larger orange object resting on the ground in
the backyard, not too far from the back steps. He said it was sharply defined,
self- luminous, and may have been as big as 3 or 4 feet in diameter. So he walked
up to it. He tried to approach it, but he felt this strange static electric
force field blocking his forward progress. And as he calls it, it was
some strange power. This held him back. It froze him in his tracks. And as he
says, I was numb. I didn't know what to do. So he called out to his parents. And
at this point, this object rose up into the air, moved west over the barn, and
darted away. As it moved off, he heard it making a strange whistling sound, and
its color changed to bright red, then to blue purple, then to white, and finally
bright red as it darted away. He estimates that this encounter lasted for about 5 minutes. And as soon as it was
gone, the lights in the television went back on in the house. Now, Charles
immediately noticed several very odd things. There was an extremely strong
smell of sulfur where this object had landed. He described it as quote, "As if
thousand matches were being lit at once." He also noticed a few other things. The power lawn mower that they
had had actually rolled 10 ft from its normal location directly towards this
landing site as if pulled by a powerful magnetic force. Also, a metal can placed
on a nearby table that was used for chicken feed fell off the table again moving in the direction of this object.
There was also a metal hoe that had been leaned up against the house and this was pulled 50 ft from its original location
again towards the object and finally there was a water trough for the chickens which overturned. So there
appears to be some sort of magnetic force surrounding this object that not only pulled all these metal objects
towards it but stopped Charles Engelre in his tracks. And now looking at the site where this
object landed, he saw that there was a six- foot wide area of swirled grass.
And in the center of it was a small burned area about the size of a dinner plate with three indentations in the
form of a triangle. Each of these indentations were about an inch in diameter and 1 in deep. And the soil
appeared to be quote hard caked ground as if exposed to tremendous heat. Now,
Charles parents were in the house next door, but they did notice that the power had gone out. They also saw this strange
glowing light. And going to the scene, they also smelled this powerful sulfur
odor. They did say that they also had seen an unusual light one week earlier,
but just assumed it was a shooting star. Now, Charles did report his experience to the police and Dale Police Chief
Leroy Musgrave arrived on the scene. He verified the odor. He said he could
actually smell it a quarter mile away. He saw the burn spot. He spoke with
Charles and his parents. And regarding this object, he said, "I have no idea
what it could have been." Now, this case really started to attract attention and Project Blue Book officers were
contacted and they agreed to investigate. William T. Powers of
Project Blue Book came to interview Charles firsthand. He verified the burn
spots on the ground and the indentations in the ground. Now, he had come to this site thinking Charles must have just
seen ball lightning. But seeing these indentations in the ground, he discarded this theory.
This is what he told Charles and his parents. He said that it did not look like lightning nor a meteor. He did tell
them that he found what appeared to be a piece of metal on this landing location that had a grooved surface and was light
in weight. Now, nothing more was heard of this piece of metal other than the angle said that William T. powers told
them that it was quote like a walnut and had quote properties of a meteorite and
that it was quote radioactive as it turned out was this whole circular
area. Now later NIKAP did bring Geiger counters that apparently showed no
radiation though this was sometime after the encounter. Some of the reports on this case also mention an oily residue.
Night researchers did take samples of this, but the samples that they took turned out to be of insufficient
quantity for analysis. Now, when this case really started to get a lot of attention, William Powers of Project
Blue Book did some serious backtracking and he said that this UFO, get this, and
I quote, may be nothing more than a burning newspaper that fluttered into the yard. Then he said that quote
somebody played a prank on the Engle family. And then he said that it could
possibly be quote swamp lights caused by marsh gas. And despite his earlier
denial regarding ball lightning, he said that this object could have been quote a ball of lightning. Finally, in the file
for Project Blue Book, he called it quote a hoax. That's Project Blue Book
for you. That's what five debunking explanations that themselves are contradictory of each other. Crazy. Now,
this odor persisted for several days. Soon after the sighting, the cherry
trees and other garden plants next to where this object had landed all died.
Immediately following this incident, Charles had firstderee burns on his arms and face, very much like a sunburn. And
following this incident, he had no appetite. He started to suffer from diarrhea and he ended up losing about 18
pounds. He says he did not feel his normal self until the end of that summer. And there were other weird
effects. The family said that the water from their sistern was quote odorous and
distasteful. Also later, it was discovered that about 15 ft away from this landing site, the
family found a 150 to 200 foot diameter area where the 5- foot tall corn plants
were mysteriously discolored, turning much darker green than the surrounding areas. Now, whether this was directly
affected by the UFO is hard to say, but one other thing, this a very strange animal effect. They noticed that their
cows produce much more milk than normal. And they also noticed that their chickens laid many more eggs. Now, it
wasn't only Charles who saw this. It turned out there were quite a few other witnesses because at 1:30 a.m. that
night, some brothers, Paul Selner, age 19, and his little brother John Selner,
age 16, were driving along the River Road. This is by the Ohio River,
approaching Rockport. This is about 23 miles south of Dale when they saw what
they described as a glowing object on the other side of the river. They said it came directly towards them at about
treetop level approaching almost to within 600 ft and then veering off. To
them it appeared quite large, 30 to 45 ft in diameter. And they said they watched it for a full 10 minutes until
it went out of view. They were very frightened by it and they left the area at high speed and they listened to the
radio and per them heard on the radio that this object allegedly hit a
farmhouse causing a television to blow up. Researchers were not able to confirm
this and this could perhaps be an exaggeration of Charles Angel's
sighting. Now, this was not all that went on. Four nights later on June 28,
four girls in this same small town of Dale said that at 15 minutes after midnight, they were actually chased by a
white ball of light for a full 5 minutes. Also on that day, 35 mi to the
southeast in German Town, the James E. Stow family said that they found a quote
perfect circle. This was 5t in diameter in their alpha alpha field. And in the
center of the circle were three burned circles in a triangular shape, each about 3 in in diameter. So something's
going on here. There is one more witness who deserves mention. She heard about all this sighting and she decided to
speak out. Her name is Iva D. McCoy. She lived in Grand View. This is located 21
miles approximately south of Dale. And she said that as a child she and her
family frequently saw strange lights that quote don't look like any other lights you ever saw. She said that when
she was a kid, mind you this is in the late 1880s. She would watch these balls of light
come up out of the ground. She says that once she saw more than a dozen of these
objects in the fields and says that over the years she'd probably seen hundreds of them. And she says that they also
sometimes left circles in the field anywhere from three to six feet wide.
Once she said her she and her husband were followed home in a horsedrawn carriage. She says that they have struck
her house at one point and even trees and she calls them quote mineral lights
and thinks that the minerals in the ground are probably drawing them or
creating them somehow. She says that she noticed one other details that lightning will often strike the area where these
objects come out of. At any rate, quite a few witnesses to the Charles Angelre
sighting and hearing about all these other witnesses, Charles said, "I don't feel so bad now that others have
reported it." Truly amazing. And how about the antics blue book went through
to try to explain this away as everything from ball lightning to swamp gas to a burning piece of newspaper.
Honestly, that's so disingenuous. A burning piece of newspaper does not
leave imprints in the ground or you know has a smell that carries for a quarter
mile. Come on, that's a ridiculous debunking explanation. Also, when you
consider how many other witnesses there were, this was clearly part of a pretty large
and active UFO wave. What an experience that was for the witness. Amazing. Now,
let's move to another case. This one got quite a bit of attention from UFO researchers who found the witness to be
quite credible. This one is called Something from Another World. This occurred on June 29, 1964 outside of
Leavonia in Georgia. It is a single witness case, though there's quite a few
corroborating witnesses. And this does have physical evidence, quite a bit of it, actually. And it's a really unusual
case, again, of someone who encounters a UFO on a lonely highway at night. It was
1:00 a.m. on the evening of June 29, 1964 that Bofford E. Pman, a 47-year-old
businessman and former military officer from Welfford in South Carolina, was
returning home from a business trip in Atlanta, Georgia. He was driving late at night on this lonely highway between
Karnsville and Leavonia, Georgia. He was moving at about 65 70 mph in his Chevy
Impala when he noticed a brilliant light in the sky. Now, he first thought
briefly that it might be a meteor, but he immediately discarded that theory when this object zoomed down and started
coming directly towards him. As Buffford says, it came straight down towards my car. And the next moment, it was right
in front of the headlights, spinning like a giant top. It was shaped like a top, and it made a hissing sound like a
million snakes. The top of the object moved clockwise, the bottom counterclockwise.
Clear lights seemed to be sucked in through small openings in the object. Now, Bofford says that as this object
approached, it quote stopped in the air like a hummingbird. Immediately, his car engine started to
skip and slow down. He kept driving, but as he did so, this object hovered right
in front of his car, only one or two feet above the road and 5t ahead of him.
He could now see that it was about as wide as the top of his car. He estimates 8 feet wide, 6 feet tall, and as he
says, big enough to hold a man. It was very close to him. He got a really good look at it. As he says, "I saw it so
clearly, I believe I could build one of the things." He could see a sort of tower-like projection on the top, small
what looked like port holes on the bottom from which orange lights, maybe flames, were issued. He said the object
was ambercoled and brightly illuminated by these yellow lights coming out of these port holes or these holes. Now
after just a few seconds this object whooed over the top of his car at very low level, lifted back up into the sky.
Bford again was still driving and this object now dropped down for a second time right in front of his car, pacing
him for one or two miles right in front of him, never touching the car, but flying right in front of it. He said it
was tilted towards him and he said he followed this UFO almost in a translike
state. Then without warning it went back over the roof. This time leaving a very
strong odor which he said was like inbalming fluid. It emitted a gaseous vapor which coated the front of his car
with this weird oily substance. He felt a very strong heat as it passed overhead. At the time his windows were
open, but the smell was so bad he closed them. It disappeared for only a few
moments and then reappeared again a third time right in front of his car.
And as Buffford says, at that moment it hit me that this object was after neither me nor my car, but after the
light from my headlights. Then I stopped the car and turned off the lights. I looked up again and this object spun
wildly, turned and flew back into space in a fraction of a second. At that
moment, I felt my arms start to burn, and my only thought was to get out and let someone know what I had seen. I
drove on to Leavonia, and by this time, my arm was really burning. I don't mind telling you, I was mighty frightened. It
left me so shaken, I could hardly continue driving. So, it took him about 15 minutes to reach Leavonia. He
immediately spoke to a military major who advised him to proceed directly to Anderson Air Base in South Carolina,
which he did, and he shared his account. And FAA officers, including Albert Mrick
and Dean Carpenter, interviewed him and examined his car and actually used a
civil defense geer counter to see if there was any radiation. And as Buffford
says, they recorded where the paint on the car had been damaged by the oily
substance the flying object had left behind. They also examined my arms from the elbow down. I still had the burning
sensation in them after I had washed them thoroughly. Now I was no longer the
only one convinced that I had encountered something from another world, for my entire car was
radioactive. Now, FAA officer Albert Mrick later disputed this claim, but he
did confirm the strange spots on Buffford's car, and he also described Bofford as intelligent, sincere, and
sober. Wolford later said he had his car washed, but the oily stains remained,
and in fact, the car hood was somewhat warped and the paint bubbled up. This was also verified later by researchers.
And as Buffford says, even today the stains are there for everyone to see.
Before my experience with this flying top, I had always been quite skeptical of the reports of unidentified flying
objects. But now I am completely convinced that they exist. Also, one
month after this encounter, Bowford said his radiators had all kinds of problems.
Now, he did give interviews to reporters about his experience, and this is when the Air Force released a statement
saying that Bowford had probably seen the phenomena known as quote ball lightning, that the odor he detected was
ozone, and that the damage to his car was caused by heat from the lightning.
Now, never mind that Bowford had described a structured craft. This was their explanation. Bowford, of course,
heard about it and vehemently disagreed and said, quote, "There was not a cloud in the sky. Lightning would not rotate
at the top and bottom as this object did. It was definitely not that because
ball lightning could not have followed my car at least 2 miles. I saw it with my own eyes." Now, a researcher soon
learned that there were apparently other witnesses, and in fact, some claimed to have been burned as well. About 25 miles
northwest of Leavonia in Turnerville, Georgia, a group of people saw what was
apparently the same craft on the same night. And one of the witnesses reportedly also was burned and said that
a bag of groceries in her car also showed exposure to heat. I couldn't find any real confirmation other than one
sentence. So, I don't know about that. But the next night on June 30th, a Mr.
De Welfford said he was driving along Highway US 29 near the South Carolina
border, not far from all this, when he saw the same kind of object. He said it
was a spinning top-shaped object about the size of a car. It swooped down right
over his vehicle and also gave off an offensive odor. And he said also that
his car showed signs of radioactivity. And things weren't over yet. One week
later, July 7, near Tula Falls, Georgia, Jimmy Ivester was visiting his parents.
They were in the living room when interference on the TV got so bad that they just turned it off and went
outside. Now, there were quite a few people there. Not only Jimmy Ivester and
his wife, but his parents, Henry Ivester and his wife, three sisters, Judy,
Janie, and Joanne, and their neighbor. saw quite a group of people here. And stepping outside, they immediately saw
an object moving at treetop level about 300 feet away. They said it was fiery
red, bull-shaped. It had a row of three lights on the bottom, totally silent,
not far. It came down and hovered a mere three feet above their neighbor's house, Russell Hickman's house. It rose up,
emitted a green light, and left behind, they said, a terrible odor, which they described as quote, something like
imbalming or brake fluid. And as Jimmy says, we thought it was a plane about to
crash, but it wasn't. Now, it turns out Diane Hickman was in the house near
where this object was hovering, and she also saw it. And in fact, the next
morning when she woke up, her face was red and her eyes were swollen. Now, her
mother was also in the house. She didn't see the object, but she says she felt this stinging and burning sensation on
her arms and face. As you can imagine, the police were called. Herssham County
Sheriff AJ Chapman arrived on the scene, and although he didn't see the object,
he did smell the terrible odor and as he called it, quote, "The most peculiar
odor I've ever smelled." Another witness was the neighbor, Mrs. Fred Rodacker.
She saw this object coming down and could see that it was quote not a plane. I just don't know what it was. I believe
there was a man in that thing. She tried to convince her husband Fred to come out, but he said, "Ah, you're just
seeing things." So, he missed out. Events were not over yet. One week later
on July 14, the UFO returned, and this time the witness was a reporter, Tom
Winfield of the Atlanta Constitution. In fact, he was called to the scene, a
Gainesville motel, by an employee of the hotel, Wit Embry, um, who said this UFO
was hovering in the sky. Tom arrived at 11 p.m., and sure enough, this object
came swooping down. Tom described this object as bull-shaped. He watched it
stop, hover, and then shoot straight up into the sky. And that same night,
another witness, Patty Upton, a little girl, was bicycling with her friend into
Lula Falls and tearfully told her parents running into the house that she
and her friend had just had an encounter with a lowflying object that she said
was stunk real bad. So, this is an amazing series of events.
Bowford, his sighting is really the most amazing of all of them. Sadly, Bofford
Parham passed away on January 13, 1966 at age 49, only 1 year and 6 months
after his encounter with the UFO. I do think we have to consider the possibility that this is another case of
a reverse engineered craft. But if so, what the heck is it doing harassing this
witness the way it did for miles and miles? I mean, it is crazy. But given
that it did leave some residue on his car, I wish we had gotten the results of
that. It's funny how these Air Force studies, they just kind of fizzle up and dry out and we never hear anything about
it after that. But apparently, yeah, it did involve radioactivity.
Certainly a compelling case. Now, let's move to the next one. I love finding
these cases that are outside of the United States, and this is one of them. I call this one the UFO force field.
This occurred on December 31st, 1972 in Pulkinan, Finland. This does involve
two witnesses. And this, I think, would probably be categorized as a close
encounter of the second kind because it did affect the environment, particularly the witnesses, and in fact, it affected
them in a very unusual way, as we shall see. This short but very unusual case
was published in the quarterly report of the UFO researchers of Finland. It involves two young women, Retita Kalho,
aged 21, and her friend Circa Pulkinan, aged 22. They had just enjoyed a dance
to celebrate the upcoming new year again December 31st, 1972.
And they were taking a walk outside the village of Pulcanin in Finland. They had
only just left when Rita noticed a bright red sphere bigger than the moon, she said, flashing in the sky. And just
moments later, both Rita and Circa saw this small red orb about the size of a
tennis ball moving nearby at only about 6 ft off the ground, and it moved
quickly forward, appearing and disappearing. In fact, when a car drove by, this light quickly took off. The
ladies continued to walk hand in hand when suddenly out of nowhere, Rita was
struck by some kind of force field, very powerful, and it actually threw her about 9 ft down to the ground, knocking
the breath right out of her. In fact, it took her a few seconds to free herself from whatever force had thrown her to
the ground. and looking around. This is when she saw a black object about 6 feet
wide floating 3 ft off the ground right in front of them. It had a bright white
light on the top of it. Rita jumped up and ran screaming for the nearest house.
Now, at that same exact moment, Circa saw this red orb again and it came zooming up towards her and in fact went
right below her right shoulder. She could feel heat and energy radiating
from it. And she also got caught in this strange force field which she said enveloped the environment around her
with complete silence and made moving very difficult. In fact, it took her
several moments to free herself from this force field apparently exerted by this orb. But she did free herself and
she ran directly towards the same house that Retita had fled to. Now both safe
in the house, both ladies were covered with mud. Rita was missing one of her shoes and it turned out her feet were
black and blue with bruises. So strange. I keep running into cases where UFOs do
have this kind of force field with them as happened with the witness Charles Angelre in Dale Indiana. Same here with
these two ladies in Finland. There's some sort of perhaps powerful magnetic
field around these craft that can have these kinds of effects. but certainly
unusual. Now, let's move to the next case. And I wanted to include this one just because
I think it's unique as far as I know. I don't know of any other single case quite like this. And I call this one UFO
goes postal. I only found one source for this case. So, take it for what it's
worth. It does appear to be an absolute legitimate report. The witness is very
credible. It occurred on October 2nd, 1976 in Palestine, Texas. And yeah, wait
till you hear this one. I bet you've never heard anything quite like this one before. The sole source for this case
comes from the Herald Press in Palestine, Texas. The witness is Albert Young. He was in his 80s at the time of
his encounter. He's a former military officer. He was in his home when he
heard this weird quote squeaking sound. Again, this is October 2nd, 1976.
And hearing the squeaking sound, it sounded to him like it was coming from the house of his neighbor, Ray Bullard,
300 yards away. In fact, he first assumed that a car must have struck Ray
Bullard's mailbox. But that's not what he saw when he looked in that direction.
Looking outside, he saw a single blue light surrounded by yellow lights rising
up over the trees. It appeared to be less than a foot in diameter. It immediately began to move towards him,
then went directly over Ray Bullard's mailbox, rose upwards, turned sharply,
and vanished behind Albert's house. And as Albert says, it was a UFO. It was in
my view no more than 10 or 15 seconds. It made no sound after it left Ray
Bullard's mailbox until it went out of my sight behind the trees back of my house. So, that alone was strange
enough. But the real twist came the next morning when Ray Bullard's mailbox turned up missing. They found it later
was uprooted a half mile east of Crockett Road. This is a considerable
distance away. The mailbox was deeply dented on its front side. Apparently
believes Albert by the UFO. Now the Bullards said that they neither heard nor saw anything unusual. The pole
holding the mailbox was undamaged. Albert was very reluctant to report what he saw. But after talking with his
neighbors and seeing this mailbox missing, he decided to come forward and
he talked to a reporter from the Herald Press. And regarding the subject of UFOs, says Albert, I've heard about
those things, but I never saw or heard one before. I suppose it's possible that
one was ball lightning, but how would it carry a mailbox that far away from its
original location? I'm thinking it's this magnetic field or something again that lifted this mailbox
up and carried it for quite some distance. I don't know. Really hard to say for sure without a more thorough
interview with the witness, but certainly worthy of being wellnown, I
think, because it's another example of these strange effects UFOs can have.
Now, let's move to the next case. This one is actually pretty special for me personally because I've investigated
quite a few cases of UFOs at drive-in theaters. In fact, I wrote a whole book
about it. I found over a hundred cases. This case I found afterwards, so it's
not in the book. I That's one of the reasons I really wanted to include it.
You never close an investigation. The more I look into UFOs at driving theaters, the more cases I find. And
this is a really dramatic example of one which occurred in June 1983 in Mobile,
Alabama. And I call this one people were screaming. It was one evening in late
June 1983 that some 300 to 400 people were gathered together to watch a
drive-in movie at an unnamed theater in Mobile, Alabama. Now, according to at
least two of the people there, independent witnesses who do not know each other, at some point during this
movie, UFOs showed up. One of the witnesses was Larry B. Casherman, a
28-year-old offduty fireman. He was at the theater with his wife and three children, when he noticed what looked to
him like two unusual craft swooping and hovering at very low elevation directly
over the theater. The only sound he could hear coming from them was a low hum, but per Larry, they were huge
luminous spheres with colored lights shining from what looked like port holes or windows going around the
circumference of the craft. Now, strangely, Larry at first didn't even remember this sighting, nor did his
family. They drove home with no memory of it. But he did eventually remember.
As Larry says, I didn't remember at first, but I had these crazy dreams for
a while about spaceships. Then it started to come back to me. My wife and the kids don't remember a thing. It's
like they were never there. There had to be 300 to 400 people there screaming and
trying to get their cars out of the exits. They just took off. Speakers were laying all over the ground. Now again,
Larry is not the only witness. for a newspaper article by Lewis Clifton titled Shining UFOs panic drive-in
movie. There was another witness. Her name is Sandra Padet, age 17, and she
remembers seeing these objects. As Sandra says, we didn't know it was
real flying saucers at first. We thought it was just something they were doing for a promotional stunt, you know. Then
people started screaming and all the cars started up and everything. My boyfriend and I were really scared. But
this is where it gets even more interesting and weird. Like Larry Casherman's family, Sandra says that her
boyfriend has no memory of this event. Says Sandra. My boyfriend still doesn't
believe me. Even when he admits he can't remember the end of the show. He says he
just fell asleep or something. But I remember. I know what happened. I was there and I don't ever want to go
through that again. Unfortunately, no other witnesses have stepped forward, and whatever happened that night at the
drive-in theater remains a mystery. How amazing is that? Another case at a
drive-in theater. I keep getting new ones. There is definitely something going on with this. What's really
interesting to me about that particular case is that some of these witnesses have amnesia of the event. It's not that
unusual. I've got a number of other drive-in theater cases with that same thing. Don't think this necessarily
indicates that there was an onboard experience or anything like that because even a simple sighting people will have
memory problems with it. Not quite sure what's going on there. Um I don't know.
It's just a really odd case. That's why I wanted to include it because it adds to that catalog that of driving theater
cases. There's so many of them. All right. Now, let's move to the next one.
This one, I'm not sure how you would categorize this other than a UFO crash retrieval, but I call this one the alien
skeletons. This occurred sometime in March of 1987 in an unidentified
location in western Kentucky. The witness insisted on absolute anonymity
and definitely did not want the exact location named either. And I think once you hear this account, you'll understand
why. And it only came to be revealed by pure synchronicity, by pure lucky
coincidence, which makes me wonder how many other cases like this there are out there. This is a very unusual case of an
apparent UFO crash retrieval, which again was publicized by Leonard Stringfield and comes from a retired
medical doctor who had an amazing story to tell. It was first publicly revealed
by researcher Bill Boars in his radio show and then published in part in the
Muon Journal issue number 249 and in Timothy Good's book, The UFO Report and
the Kentucky MUN newsletter and in Leonard Stringsfield's status reports.
It's so strange. This case definitely deserves to be well known. Now the witness is a doctor whose name is known
by Leonard Stringfield and Bill Boars and he told them that in 1987
he was taking a stroll on his 400 acre farm property. He does not want the location known. All we know is in
western Kentucky uh March 1987. So he's walking on his farm when he
comes upon a mysterious burn circle. He said it was about 4 feet in diameter in
an open grassy field. So that's strange enough. But right next to this circle,
he found two humanoid skeletons, each lying about 4 feet apart from each
other. There was no evidence of any clothing. Predators had already caused some damage. He could see again he's a
medical doctor. He can see some residual tissues such as ligaments. And as a
medical doctor, he was certain that these skeletons were not any known animal. And in fact, on closer
examination, he could see that they were definitely bipedal, about 4 feet tall.
They had large skulls, a jaw much like a cat, a barrel-like rib cage, and very
long arms. And he also noticed another very interesting detail. Each hand had
only three fingers. Judging by the rate of decomposition, he estimated these
skeletons had been there for some time, likely about 100 days, but not much
longer than that. Now, alarmed by this discovery, as you can imagine, he immediately called the sheriff, who
immediately contacted the Air Force, and to the doctor's surprise, they were there the very next morning. Three Air
Force helicopters arrived and landed on his property. A large group of people, some in uniform, some not, were deployed
over a very large area exploring his entire farm. One of the men approached the doctor. He's an Air Force colonel,
and he was very kind. Stated clearly and cordially that it was his mission to remove the skeletons and the soil
beneath them, as well as remove the soil where this burned circle was, and to
search the surrounding terrain for any evidence related to this discovery. So
by the end of the day, all the evidence had been removed and in fact fresh soil
was placed over the excavated area and the doctor was informed that the burned circle in fact showed evidence of having
been exposed to a heat source of some 3,000 degrees. The doctor himself was
escorted to a nearby military base for further questioning. And he says that
the military officers showed him photographs of other alien bodies that
they had recovered. And he says that they then quote, "Put the fear of God
into me and warned him to never talk about it." But thankfully he did. It
sounds like that witness was threatened pretty badly by these government folks. It's really interesting that he says
that they actually showed him photographs of other ET bodies. That
does turn up in other cases. And I like the case because this is a medical doctor. He knows what he's looking at.
Such a shame that he called the police right away and turned this over to the Air Force. If this had gone public, it
could have really helped to bring this subject much more to the forefront. But
I'm glad that this witness was friends with Bill Boschers, who I met, by the
way. He's a fantastic guy. It turns out he was a witness in the Tanga Canyon UFO
wave, which I researched, and he saw something in Tanga Canyon on that one
night, June 14, 1992. He's a terrific guy. I absolutely think he's sincere.
So, if he says he met this doctor, I believe him. And Leonard Stringfield as well is a very wellrespected researcher
and God bless him for bringing these kinds of cases to light and having
people take them more seriously certainly than they were for years and years and years. Nobody would even look
at UFO crash cases for a very long time.
So yeah, Leonard Stringfield has done a huge service for this field.
Now, let's move to the next case. I think of all the cases in this collection today, this one is my
favorite, there's just something really poignant about it, just something real
sincere. Uh, this one I call we were being watched. This occurred on November
19, 1989 in Arkansas. Again, an undisclosed
location. The witness again wants to remain anonymous, but there are five witnesses to this case. One is a police
officer. There's no possibility of misidentification or misperception in
this case because they came upon a landed UFO and watched it for quite some
time. It's an extraordinary case and incredibly detailed. This case comes
from longtime UFO researcher Sam Upgrov. This is a very close and profound
encounter involving four teenagers and a gentleman by the name of Dale, a deputy
sheriff. It was after midnight, November 19, 1989, again somewhere in Arkansas.
It was a slow night for officer Dale, so he decided to check out the back roads and make sure that there were no local
teenagers out there drinking beer or misbehaving in some way. So, he was
driving around for a while. at about 1:35 a.m. came around a corner on a
remote gravel road and nearly struck collided into an old Chevy pickup parked
in the middle of this road. All four doors were open and he immediately saw four teenagers, two boys and two girls
standing alongside it. And it was odd because even though he stopped only 15
ft from them, none of the kids turned around to look at him. Instead, they were staring intently at something down
the road in front of them. So Dale looked and he could see a dark, bulky
shape of some kind in the dim light. So he turned on his police spotlight and
shone it on the object and he could hardly believe what he saw. I'll just let Dale describe it in his own words.
As he says, it was dark gray and dull looking, sort of like galvanized tin or
something on that order. The shape was well, I hate to say it, but it was just
exactly like you would expect a flying saucer to look. Two saucers really, with
one of them turned upside down on top of the other. I remember noticing that I couldn't see any joint where the edge
was, which really struck me as being odd because it looked like two halves joined together, but it was just smooth with no
line. What really got to me though wasn't the looks of the thing. It was what it was doing. It just sat there in
the air, not touching anything. It was absolutely motionless except for a sort
of wobbling motion and not much of that. The bottom of it couldn't have been more than three or maybe 4 feet above the
road, if that much. So, this object was large, about 30 ft across, smooth. There
was no dome, no markings, no windows. And Dale's spotlight was on this object
for about three seconds when suddenly the spotlight went out. And in fact, so
did the entire electrical system of his cruiser. The headlights, the radio, engine, all of it cut off. And as Dale
says, I'm not ashamed to tell you, I was a bit scared. Then I heard one of the girls who was standing up by the other
car sort of sobbing, and she said, "Oh my god, it got him, too." That didn't
help matters any. So, Officer Dale learned from the kids that they had just arrived a few moments before. They had
shown their high beams on this object and immediately their truck engine and the entire electrical system also died.
They got out of the truck and were standing there wondering what to do. And this is when officer Dale arrived. Now,
he noticed that the entire environment around them was blanketed in complete silence. Noises whatsoever, no insects,
nothing. So he moved forward to stand next to the teenagers, and he could now see a soft bluish glow coming from
beneath the object. The five witnesses whispered softly back and forth, asking
each other what this object could possibly be. As Dale says, we just stood there like we were waiting for something
to happen, but we didn't know what. I tell you, a lot of weird things went through my mind. I was scared, but not
because it had really done anything to be threatening. I thought that maybe when the cards shined bright lights on
it, while it was just minding its own business, whatever that was, maybe whoever or whatever was in that might
have felt like they were the ones being threatened. After a while, I was almost
wishing something would happen. The waiting was starting to get to me. And then finally, something did happen. The
blue glow below the craft started to increase while at the same time the craft rose silently and vertically
straight up. It rose about 20 ft upwards. The witnesses could now see
that there was a thick ring of blue light about 1 ft wide on the bottom of the craft. The craft continued to rise
up to about 100 ft high just above the surrounding treetops. It hovered there
for a few moments and then darted away at quote impossible speed. As Dale says,
one second it was just sitting there and the next all you could see of it was a bluish green streak across the sky
towards the northwest. Now, at that exact moment, loud rock
music instantly began blaring from the car radio inside of the Chevy pickup. All the lights came on at once. All five
of the witnesses jumped up in shock. If this was an encounter that convinced them all, as you can imagine, of the
reality of UFOs. And as Dale says, I was always one who took all these flying
saucer stories with a big grain of salt, but I know what I saw. And others were
there who witnessed the same thing. What I saw was as real and solid as an airplane. And I looked at it in the
spotlight from no more than 100 ft away at the most. How interesting is that? I
mean, that's a scene straight out of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I can only imagine what it must have been
like to be that close to a craft. But it's got all these really interesting effects. We hear so much about the Oz
effect, this eerie silence that settles over the environment when a UFO is near,
as well as electromagnetic disturbances. And when you have two cars that are shut down by
the close presence of a UFO, that's not a coincidence. There's clearly some sort of field surrounding these craft that is
affecting automobile engines and lights. It's pretty funny that one detail where
after the UFO leaves and the rock station starts playing at full blast, making them all jump a foot in the air.
That's almost as scary as the UFO sighting itself, but certainly a fascinating case. And now let's move to
the final case. This is another one that really surprised me because I did a whole bunch of research on cases that
are called car lift cases. These are cases in which automobiles are lifted up
into the air presumably by a UFO. Now, a UFO was not
seen by the witness in this case, though someone else in the area did see a UFO
in this area at this time. So probably that was the effect. But yeah, this
gentleman claims that his car was lifted up. I call this one the floating car. It occurred on February 26th, 1996 in
Guier, Spain. And this is one of many, many cases involving car lifts. I
included a whole chapter in my book, Not From here, about carlift cases because
they're not unique. But this one does have some really interesting details to it. This case comes from researcher
Manuel Carbal. The witness is Andre Landera. On the evening of February 26, 1996, he
had gone out to play some pool and drink coffee at the Romero Bar in Guierz, Spain. Then he got in his Renault 18 and
began the drive to his home in Guutierz. This is in Lugo, Spain. It was about 2:10 a.m. and he was attempting to
ascend a hill and go over a bridge near the small village of Friba. And this is
when he noticed that his car appeared to be malfunctioning. It seemed not to have enough power to make it up the hill. So
Andre changed to a lower gear, reduced his speed, but then the car would not move forward at all. And then without
any warning, he felt an immense acceleration and he could no longer see the bridge that had been ahead of him
moments before. Now confused and afraid, he turned off the car engine and this is
when he heard a strange sound which he says was quote like a strong wind blowing. He also noticed that the hood
of his car was lifting up and the entire vehicle was quote oscillating. It was
shaking back and forth. It felt to Andre almost as if his car was floating. So he
opened the window, looked down at the road, and his confusion turned to fear. He was incredibly shocked because his
car he saw was in fact floating a full 30 ft above the ground. As Andre says,
"I held on to the steering wheel with all my might." He would later tell UFO investigator Emanuel Carbal, "I forced
myself back into the driver's seat, and I thought I was going to die, being taken to god knows where. Hell, I was
really scared. But after several moments, his car was placed gently back on the ground, and
whatever force had lifted his car, released it. Now back on the ground, his
car was slightly ahead of its original position, was now sideways on the road.
He could now hear a very loud humming noise, which he says was comparable to a haird dryer. And he was able to
determine the exact moment of this encounter because his dashboard clock froze at that moment. So, it read 2:10
a.m. Later, an employee at the nearby telephone exchange said that he had observed strange lights in the sky at
that location at that time. So, this is independent confirmation.
The local civil guard detachment was notified of Andre's encounter and
apparently they were not able to explain this incident, but more interesting
information was uncovered when it was discovered that there were power outages and brownouts near that area. And both
before and after this incident, there were a number of other sightings in this area. So, this appears to be a fully
legitimate case despite its unusual nature. In fact, Andre's friend Pablo,
who is the owner of Romero's bar, confirmed that Andre had not consumed
alcohol that evening and that he was an honest man. He told researcher Emanuel
Carbal, "If Andre says that his car flew through the air, then it flew through
the air." How about that? does not appear that this gentleman was taken on board or anything like that. Certainly,
he does not report that. Doesn't mean he wasn't because as we know, this can slip
by a person. They can have missing time and not even know it. But certainly a
fascinating case and it's super interesting because there is outside corroboration. There are character
references supporting the credibility of this witness and the fact that so many
other people report having their cars lifted up into the air. How scary is
that? Looking down and seeing you're 30 feet up off the ground. Amazing.
So there you go. That's 12 cases coming from all over the world. 1946 to 1996.
All different kinds of cases. First, second, third kind. This just goes to show how varied the UFO experience can
be. For some people, it's a simple sighting. For others, it's an onboard experience, even coming upon a crashed
UFO or alien body. I mean, just about anything can happen on this planet
apparently. And I think all these cases show once again what we already know by now. We are not alone. We are being
visited. The Earth is not the only planet in this universe that is populated. It's a busy populated
universe out there. That's exactly what this evidence is showing us. I think it's the simplest explanation that
extraterrestrials are out there. So, yeah, really, really interesting and
always something new to learn on this subject. So, thank you guys so much for watching. Hope you found this episode
interesting. I truly appreciate all your guys' support. It means a lot to me. So,
thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth.
Most important of all, keep having fun. If you're not having fun, probably doing
something wrong. Do something else. Do something that brings you joy. That's it
for now. I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.
