Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and today I want to talk to you a little bit about my 
book, "Not From Here Volume 3" which covers the strange and unusual aspects of UFO contact. The 
kind you don't often hear about. That most investigators won't talk about. That don't fit the 
standard model of UFO contact. 

First chapter is called "Caught in the Act". This covers cases of people who have observed abductions. 
The vast majority of abductions, hundreds of thousands, do not have any outside observation. I found 
about 20 cases where people have observed abductions occurring in Brazil. Two young sons saw their 
father get abducted. In Florida, Diliberto Cardenas happened to Martin. In Leeds, England abduction 
happened. All over the world it's occurring. I've got a case in Arkansas, a case of a farmer in
New Mexico, a lady in Hawaii, Ukraine, Australia, and many other cases. Many pilots have been taken as well. 

Chapter 2 is "See a UFO Lose Your Job". This covers cases of people who have had severe discrimination 
as a result of a UFO encounter. Like Travis Walton. His whole crew lost their job as a result of their 
encounter. Another example is Leah Haley, an abductor from Alabama. Many police officers have suffered 
this sort of discrimination Alan Godfrey of England saw UFO was ridiculed mercilessly pressured by his 
superiors to resign he refused so they took away his police car and gave him a bicycle he eventually 
resigned other police officers have been passed over for promotions one police officer Jeff Green. He 
went public after photographing actually apparent ETs and received threats. His house was burned down. 
His wife left him and he lost his job. He was basically chased out of town. Look what happened to John Mack 
a doctor you know fueled surprised winning author very nearly lost tenure and his job as a result of just 
investigating the subject. So, it's definitely something to watch for here and be careful of Alien Gifts.

Chapter three is called "Alien Gifts". This is something that almost never happens. People are given objects 
from UFO as basically gifts. It nearly happened to Betty Hill. They gave her a book but as she was leaving 
they basically took it back. Betty Andreasen reports that she did receive a book and was able to keep it 
for up to two weeks and observe it at her own time. This has happened in a number of cases. William Herman of 
South Carolina was given a bar of metal. This happened to a another gentleman investigated by researcher 
Constance Clear. He was also given a bar of metal. both cases turned out to be the Herman
case turned out to be tres trio led the
other bar was stolen by apparently men
in black but there are a number of cases
like this there was a case from Russia
of a lady who was given a crystal there
was a painter in France who was given
what appeared to be a telescope um again
man in black took that one this happens
in a number of cases where the
government shows up or some aspect of
them and steals these objects back but
there's a surprising number of cases
where people had actually been given
gifts by the ETS I tried to find any
cases where people have been able to
steal an object and I couldn't find
anyone who was successful
Antonio Villas Boas one of the first
advic T's tried to steal one and they
basically took it back and there's
another case from J Allen Hynek a
another gentleman in the Midwest tried
to steal an object and was unsuccessful
Two Errors
chapter four is called two errors alien
and asked the question do aliens make
mistakes and yes apparently they do
there's a lot of cases where people have
been returned to the wrong position
there's the case paddy price in the
Midwestern u.s. in 1973 where the whole
family was abducted and the kids were
returned to different beds sandra larson
and her daughter Jackie and their friend
Larry had an abduction in 1975 in North
Dakota and they were also put back in
different seats in the car I have a case
like this myself which I also included
embalming her gentleman was driving
along the central highway on Interstate
five and had an abduction experience and
again they were returned to different
seats so this happens quite a bit people
have been actually locked out of their
houses
this happened to Stan Romanek another
case in England and Andrews the Andrews
family they had an advocate actually
appear in their home a complete stranger
who was very quickly taken back by the
ETS who had apparently made a mistake
so yeah et's do apparently make mistakes
but it's pretty darn rare chapter 5 is
Ouija Board
called can we contact UFOs with a Ouija
board and the surprising answer is yes
there's a number of cases one case comes
from Frank's Alice Barrie in the Utah
UFO display two children summoned a UFO
using a Ouija board in February 1976
which appeared over the local Roosevelt
Hospital this happened to Jay Z night
most famous for channeling Grantha there
are a number of cases like this remember
the Gulf Breeze 6 in 1990 who used to
EEG Bart and contacted ETS and ended up
going AWOL and going to Gulf Breeze
Florida which was having a major UFO
flap at that time so yeah it's a very
strange aspect of UFO contact a lot of
people don't talk about but I think it
points towards the complexity of this
phenomena chapter 6 is called UFOs over
prisons and I've never heard anyone
talking about this but yes prisons are
targeted I think because there are very
powerful installations and UFOs seem to
be attracted to that there's cases all
over the world where this has happened
England this is happens in Iowa
New York Alabama got cases all over the
world the in Colorado there's one prison
that was targeted over and over again
probably my favorite case is the Red
Bluff case which occurred in 1960 in
which there was a huge wave of sightings
one right over the Red Bluff prison and
to get more witnesses one of the guards
actually marched out all the prisoners
onto the roof of the prison so they
could all see this UFO that was hovering
overhead so yeah prisons and UFOs are
definitely a thing I did not find any
cases in which prisoners have
experienced an abduction but given that
there are problem people in jail or more
Jesus An Alien
it's very likely that some of these
people are abductees chapter 7 is called
is Jesus an alien and this covers a
subject in which people have seen
religious figures aboard UFOs
again this is statistically
insignificant almost never happens but
there's enough cases that warrant an
analysis and yeah I mean it happened to
Howard min jure it happened to Jose de
Silva of Brazil
Don ibattz of Ohio's had this experience
there's a case in Italy in which a
gentleman was having religious
apparitions along with UFO sightings so
yeah sometimes these phenomena do come
together this has been written about
pretty extensively by Jacques Vallee as
well this covers actual cases in this
book
Betty Andreasen remember she referred to
her contacts as angels Denise and Burt
twigs contact Dee's from Oregon actually
said they flat out saw Jesus aboard a
UFO and yeah there are other cases like
this interestingly throughout the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance period there
are many many paintings depicting Jesus
and UFOs together so yeah something is
clearly going on here it's just
difficult to say exactly what it is
chapter 8 is called is Bigfoot
Bigfoot An Alien
an alien and what is this connection
between Bigfoot and UFOs it's hard to
say but there's a lot of cases like this
most UFO cases do not involve Bigfoot
most Bigfoot cases do not involve UFOs
but a small smattering of cases do this
happened during a pennsylvania outbreak
in 1973 when a bunch of UFOs were seen
in conjunction with Bigfoot in 1974
frederick Bozak of wisconsin saw UFO
looked through the porthole and saw a
bigfoot-like creature Don Worley a very
famous investigator had a case like this
in 1981 in a whole Ohio which a family
had a UFO hover over their house and at
that time they had a number of Bigfoot
sightings a lot of cases like this there
was a case in Brownsville California
pretty recent 20:17 in which two people
saw a UFO land in the forest and this
was found almost immediately by a
Bigfoot sighting so yeah this definitely
does happen it's hard to say exactly
what it means but I think it's a mistake
to ignore these types of cases chapter 9
Secret Behind Alien Anal Probes
is called the secret behind alien anal
probes an in-depth analysis because the
media seems to have latched on to this
particular aspect of the contact
experience and I decided fine
let's just cover it and I found
surprisingly few cases in which people
actually described this procedure
instead just seems then that the media
is really obsessed with it and if you
look on advertising you'll see it's true
I mean there's alien anal probe hot
sauce you can get stickers and shirts
with this phrase on it
whatever reason the Publix has seemed to
latched on to this one particular aspect
of the UFO contact experience when
really just one of many kinds of
procedures that ETS
perform on people and seems to be a
simple colonoscopy and the last chapter
If You Build It
chapter 10 is called if you build it and
this is probably my favorite chapter he
discovers cases in which people were
shown in the engine room of a UFO
basically and told how it works and were
inspired to build their own UFO engine
not all cases have all these elements
but it's basically a collection of about
a dozen cases and because people have
been inspired by their encounter to
build a free energy motor this happened
to a lady named Talon in 1968 this lady
was investigated by Jacques Vallee and
this was her life mission she hadn't
encountered an abduction and after that
became obsessed with building a motor on
something very very similar happened to
Whitley Strieber in 1958 and where he
tried to build an alien motor I've got a
case from 1959 virtual Atkinson was had
an encounter with the coos head Naval
facility in Oregon which inspired him to
start building magnetic motors I've
covered a case extensively in my book
inside UFOs involving a gentleman by the
name of Jim Kubek quite an encounter in
1960 in the Mediterranean Sea which
inspired him to build a free energy
motor there's many cases like this a
farmer in 1985
Yvonne Smith has a case John long mm OH
tooth started becoming obsessed with
physics and building magnetic motors so
there's clearly something going on here
it looks like a grassroots movement on
the part of the ETS trying to get this
information out there are the cases that
are very similar Stan Romanek Charles
James Hall both started producing
complex physics equations
inspired by their encounters of course
there's the integratron and a number of
cases involving people who were told how
to build UFO detectors so that's
basically this book in a nutshell thanks
very much for listening and I hope you
get a chance to take a look at it bye
for now
