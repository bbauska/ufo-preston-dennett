UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE NINE
Mar 28, 2025

Summary:
Mar 28, 2025
Welcome to Episode Nine of UFOs in Your Hometown. Name any town or city on this planet, and you 
will find a history of UFOs. So far I have examined almost 100 locations, and every single one of 
them has been visited by UFOs. The implications of this are profound; this shows that UFO 
encounters are far more common than previously believed. It appears that the UFO occupants are 
conducting a  publicity campaign and want to be seen. This latest episode of the ongoing series 
presents nine new locations including: Katwijk, Holland; Nanjing, China; Pakistan; Quapaw, 
Oklahoma; Salinas, California; Dubque, Iowa; Daytona Beach, Florida; Statesville, North Carolina; 
and Annadale, New York. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters and more…they are occurring 
everywhere on Earth.

KATWIJK, HOLLAND. This small town of about twelve square miles has a couple of very interesting 
encounters. At 3:30 am on July 8, 2003, a woman noticed a spinning disc-shaped craft over her 
home. It remained in place for an hour. Afterwards, she had a terrible headache. On September 
2, 2023, a witness not only saw a UFO, but photographed and filmed it.

NANJING, CHINA. One of Nanjing’s earliest sightings occurred in 1892 and was widely-viewed and 
memorialized in a painting. In 1999, a glowing red cylindrical object hovered for four hours 
over the city. In 2002, three separate pilots witnessed an unidentified craft moving through 
the skies. In 2009, during a solar eclipse, scientists observed and photographed a glowing object.

PAKISTAN. In 1952, the Reuters News Service reported on a sighting in Karachi involving four 
flying saucers. Per a CIA document, UFOs were seen in 1953. In 1955, UFOs hovered over an 
airport. Also in 1955, thousands of witnesses who saw a craft with humanoids inside it. A 
sighting of a bright red disc occurred in 1956, and in 1969, Army intelligence officers in 
Peshawar saw three discs in the sky. They were sworn to silence. In 1986 a group of witnesses 
saw 8 objects. In 2002, Pakistani pilots had a close encounter with a UFO.

QUAPAW, OKLAHOMA. This tiny town is well-known for mysterious spook-lights. It also has UFO 
encounters. In 1972, a couple witnessed three UFOs hover over their home for over an hour. 
In 2006, a witness driving through Quapaw saw a silver cigar-shaped object hover and dart 
off at high speed. In 2014, a witness saw a UFO so close, he heard it humming.

SALINAS, CALIFORNIA. In 1945, an army officer  at Salinas Army Airbase saw three flying disks. 
In 1947, a farmer saw a metallic disc-shaped craft in his field. It was quickly nabbed by the 
US military. In 1950, a mini-wave caused many people to call the police. In 1950 and 1952, a 
UFO hovered over two different factories. In 1967, a couple saw a  disc with portholes. In 
1972, a man saw a gigantic UFO which prompted memories of being visited by humanoids. 1978 
brought a multi-witness case of UFOs over the airport; a 7-year-old who saw a UFO and had 
missing time; five boys who had a close-up sighting; and a landing of a UFO at a high school. 
Cases in 1981 and 2002 involved communication with the UFO occupants. In 2013, a filmed UFO 
sighting and crop circle brought wide publicity. More sightings occurred in 2014 and in 2019, 
a weird humanoid encounter.

DUBUQUE, IOWA. So many cases here! In 1880, a woman claimed a bizarre encounter with fairies. 
In 1947, a couple saw metallic discs over their home. In 1952, a man had an odd encounter 
while driving outside the city. In 1960, a pilot filmed three UFOs over Dubuque. Many others 
saw the objects. In 1967 two families saw an egg-shaped craft. More sightings occurred in 
1972, 1977 and 1982. In 1996, a teenage boy had a closeup UFO sighting and missing time. 
2002 brought two more sightings, including one by two pilots.

DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA. Sightings of metallic discs occurred in 1950 and 1952. In 1957, a 
lady says a UFO paced her car. In 1959, two pilots had a near-collision with a UFO. In 1964, 
a man saw a UFO with twelve humanoids inside it. In 2008, a father and son saw strange orbs 
hovering over the ocean. In 2023, a couple saw and filmed V-shaped craft over Daytona Beach.

STATESVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1955, a trained observer saw three discs cavorting playfully 
in the sky. In 1986, a father and son saw a massive metallic craft land in their corn field, 
and through the windows they could see many humanoid figures.

ANNADALE, NEW YORK. In 1975 two boys walking in the forest saw a glowing object hovering over 
some trees. Returning the next day, they found strange burn marks in the trees. In 2004, a 
young man saw a glowing sphere appearing and disappearing over his home.

Nine new locations: each with a history of UFO encounters. These encounters are supported by 
multiple witnesses, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, photographs and 
more. The huge number of cases make it undeniable that we are being visited.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
Guess what? It's time for another UFOs over your hometown episode. I've done a
bunch of these already. As you may know, I put out a challenge some time ago. Name any town, any city, any location on
this planet, and I bet you I can find a UFO encounter there. I've gotten over
800 responses, covered about a hundred of them so far, and yeah, I'm finding
UFOs in all of the locations you guys have provided. So, thanks for being a part of this. I'm learning so much doing
the research for these cases. This takes a lot of time and research to do, so
I've been putting them out pretty slowly. But yeah, this is now episode 9. The title of this episode is UFOs in
Your Hometown, episode nine. Pretty excited. I've got nine new locations
coming from all over the planet, cases reaching back well over a hundred years up to the present day, and covering not
only sightings, but landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids, some UFO crash retrievals,
actually all kinds of evidence as well. electromagnetic effects, physiological
effects, animal reactions, landing traces, some really wonderful
photographic cases as well. So, yeah, a lot of multiple witness cases, too.
Really interesting cases. Lots of humanoids in this one cuz I know you guys love hearing about humanoids
encounters. They're my favorite as well. A few onboard cases as well. So, yeah, I
think you'll find this pretty interesting. And the nine locations I am covering today provided by you guys
include Katwick Holland, Nanjing, China,
uh the whole country of Pakistan, Quapaw, Oklahoma. You tried to
stump me on that one, but I found some cases. Selenus, California. Boy, Selenus
really delivered. Uh Deuke, Iowa. Daytona Beach, Florida. Statesville,
North Carolina, and finally, Annadale, New York. So, yeah, a lot of locations.
This is going to be a pretty long episode, but I hope you'll find it really interesting because, man, oh man,
some of the cases in this one are just off the charts. Amazing. Let's get started. The first location I'm covering
today is Katwick, Holland. This comes from Anna. Thank you, Anna, for
suggesting this location. Didn't find a whole lot. This is a pretty small area,
about 12 square miles, but I found two really interesting cases, and one in
fact does involve some great photographs. So, I think you'll find it interesting. I certainly hope so. The
first case that I could find in Catwick Holland occurred on the night of July 8, 2003.
The witness is a 63-year-old retired officer from a Dutch sea resort who had
an excellent and very close view of a classic flying saucer. As she says in
her own words, "It was 3:30 a.m. when I saw this strange saucer-shaped object,
round and flat, that looked like a sort of white button with four dark holes in the middle. Somewhere outside of it,
there were small square lights that didn't diminish real light, but a kind of hazy shine. The object was about 10 m
in diameter, 30 ft, and hovering 6 to 7 m above my garage, about 20 ft. The
object itself was twirling very fast, like a bicycle wheel. It was striking
that the object made the same half circle over and over again, northwards, and then back to my house. I watched it
for quite some time, but I didn't dare go outside. I opened the window and found it quite remarkable that I could
hear no sound from such a big object. About 4:15 a.m. It got lighter outside
and I could merely see the curves of the object. It became blurry but still
visible. It didn't fly away. But as it became lighter, the contours of the object faded until I couldn't see it
anymore. So this sighting clearly impressed the witness deeply. She also
reports something interesting. The day after this encounter, she suffered from a terrible headache, which she links to
this close-up sighting. The only other case I could find in Catwick occurred on September 2nd,
2023, and this was actually posted on Reddit. This involves two photographs
and a very short video clip. As the person who posted this writes, "My
friend spotted this UFO today." He said it flew at around 300 m and at a given
moment even dropped in height. He said it couldn't have been a balloon because of its movements. He said it looked big.
It was very strange to him. So you can see the photos here. And here also is a
very very short 2C video clip of a silver gray roundish object floating
just above the rooftops. You have to be quick to see it. It's right above the roof heading downwards and disappearing.
There you go. I'll admit that two cases is not a lot analos, but you didn't
stump me. I found some activity there. I keep saying it. UFOs are seen everywhere
on this planet. That's the whole point of this series of UFOs over your
hometown. No matter where you check, there is a history of UFO encounters.
That's absolutely true of Nanjing, China. This was a difficult location to
research here in the United States. I don't have a whole lot of access to reports in China, but I absolutely found
some amazing ones, including ones that go way, way back to
1892, some current ones, some really interesting photographic cases. So,
Nanjing, China was suggested by Alfredo. Alfredo, this is for you. I found some
really cool cases. Nanjing is a big city. So, yeah, this one is really
interesting. Nanjing is a pretty big city, 2,500 m wide. It's the capital of
the Jang Soo province in China, and it definitely has a few very interesting
cases, including one way back in the 1800s, September 28, 1892. It's one of
the most spectacular sightings here. It's also one of China's earliest recorded UFO sightings and it was
memorialized in a painting called Soaring Scarlet Flame in the Sky by Woo
Yoru and it shows dozens of people on the Zuk Bridge staring in wonder up at a
massive glowing object. You can see the painting here. There's an inscription on it and I'll just read the inscription.
As the inscription says, at 2000 on 28th September, a fireball appeared suddenly
in the northern sky of Nanjing. Its shape resembled a gigantic egg and it
traveled slowly from east to west, clearly visible in the night sky. Its
color was red, but it had no luster. Hundreds of civilians stood on the Zuk
Bridge, jostling for a good view, standing on tiptoe, craning their necks upward while the fireball appeared to
float slowly in the air. It lingered for the duration of a meal, fading little by
little into the distance. Some said it was a meteor, but that would disappear in an instant. This ball's movement from
its first appearance in the near sky to its final disappearance in the distance was quite sluggish. It cannot have been
a meteor. Others said that it was a lantern kite that children flew. But the
wind was blowing to the north that night while the object was heading east, so it cannot have been a lantern kite either.
For a while everyone nattered, but no one could solve the mystery. None of the theories made sense. An elderly man
said, "When it first arose, there was a slight noise which was hardly audible,
like the buzzing approach of men darting across the south gate. The sound was so soft that most people would have missed
it." And he added that the object soared up into the sky from the southern outskirts of the city. It was so
strange. So very interesting. It's got a lot of elements of modern-day sightings,
and there are quite a few modern-day sightings, of course, as well. Here's one from January 14, 1999. It's a brief,
but nevertheless interesting account involving a very long rod-shaped UFO
that reportedly remained in view for 4 hours. This would be the longest recorded sighting over Nonjing. It was
described by witnesses as a shiny red object 10 km high, very long, moving
slowly across the sky over the city and gradually fading away. 3 years later,
November 8, 2002, another remarkable encounter was witnessed by the pilots of
no less than three separate airlines. The first was by a Yemen Airlines pilot
who described a light blue object which hovered past his plane at about 80 km
north of Nanjing. But at the same time, the pilots of a Shandong airline plane
about 120 km away saw what was apparently the same object which they
described as white blue and having the shape of a skateboard. And finally, a third pilot called the airport control
tower in Tonglu X Jang about 300 kilometers away to report apparently
this same object. The next encounter occurred on August 17,
2006. And on this day, a UFO was allegedly cited and videotaped over
Nanjen. But there are, of course, some doubts about the authenticity of this
video, which could very well be CGI. But I presented here for what it's worth. At
any rate, it was about three weeks later on September 7, 2006 that there was
reportedly a sighting of a V-shaped object over Nonjing. Again, I was not
able to find any firstirhand eyewitness testimony to confirm this. But here is a really interesting
case which occurred on July 22nd, 2009. It's an excellent and well-verified
photographic case which occurred during the solar eclipse on that day. As the
eclipse passed over Nanjing, China, scientists at the Purple Mountain Observatory, which you can see here,
observed and filmed a UFO for a total of 40 minutes. You can see the photograph
here of this strange object. The director of the observatory, Xi Haien,
refused to speculate publicly on the nature or origin of this object and
stopped short of saying it was a UFO, only that it was unidentified, which I
guess is what a UFO is. As can be seen, UFOs are certainly not unknown in China
and are apparently quite popular because in 2015, an exhibit opened up to the
public in Nanjing showing a lifesize model of a UFO, which you can actually
go inside and experience what it might be like to have a ride inside a flying saucer. So, if you ever get to go to
Nanjing, that might be pretty interesting to experience. How cool is that? China does take this subject very
seriously and you can tell that there's a lot of interest in UFOs and
extraterrestrials. It's one of the things I like about this subject is it's bringing the whole world together. I
think pretty much everyone on this planet now knows what the term UFO means
and our it's really going mainstream this subject. It's now being taken much
more seriously than it has in the past. Now we move to a new location. I was
very excited to explore this. Thank you Khan Aif. Today I will be exploring the
country of Pakistan. You were really wondering if there were UFO encounters there and I was almost certain I could
find some and sure enough I did and some really good ones too. I think you'll be
really impressed at some of these cases. So thank you Khan. Let's move forward with UFOs over Pakistan. Pakistan is
actually the fifth most populous country in South Asia with 240 million people.
It contains more than 340,000 square miles and has a very long
history going back well over 8,000 years. Now, a country of this size
should have thousands upon thousands of cases. But it's hard for someone like me here in the US to find cases there. But
I did find some. And here are a halfozen pretty solid UFO cases. The earliest I
could find occurred on December 11, 1952. This case came from the Routers
News Service, which writes as follows. Four flying saucers were reported
sailing in formation high over Karach today. Witnesses said they saw four
translucent white discs trailing smoke. They said they suddenly shot up vertically and disappeared. Was one year
later, almost exactly December 21st, 1953, when another really interesting
case surfaced. This was actually mentioned in a CIA report. And as the report reads, two brilliant objects
flying at an altitude of more than 4,700 meters were seen over Peshawar on
the night of 21 December. The objects coming from the southeast and thought to
be flying saucers disappeared in the direction of Afghanistan. This very interesting and unusual case comes from
Graham W. Birdsaw, a British researcher. It was published in UFO magazine in the
May June 1999 issue. And yes, this is a very unusual case. This occurred on the
afternoon of March 20, 1955 in the city of Karachi,
Pakistan. There are actually thousands of witnesses to this case, but the main one is John Parker, a British Air Force
officer. He was flying over the city into the city with a number of other officers and they all saw this very
large kind of bronzecoled craft hovering over the city at very low level. So they landed, went
to the city and sure enough this object was still there and was hovering quite low, some 300 ft above the ground. So as
they got towards this thing, they realized that there were thousands of people on the ground looking up at this
thing. It was really crowded. People were sitting on the ground praying.
Others were looking up in wonder at this craft. So they joined the crowd, walked
about 60 yards away from beneath this disc, which they estimate was about 150
ft across, 2 or three stories high, and now it was hovering only 125 ft off the
ground. This was not your average flying saucer by any means, cuz they could see
what looked like rivets, catwalks, and ladders, port holes, aerials. Uh, they
saw what looked like a large black hole underneath it. There was a whooing
sound. There was sort of laser-like effects coming off of this craft. The
craft was swinging back and forth a little bit. So, it looked to John Parker
like it was experiencing engine problems of some kind. So, as he's looking at this, he can see that there are port
holes. And through the port holes, he sees what looks like the shapes of people. There was a translucent dome on
top. It was lit up with a pinkish red light. There were also red, green, and blue flashing lights inside the dome.
And they watched this for some time. Uh, and finally just left the area to get a
drink. They did not see this object depart. It was still there when they left. But an an amazing case, which
honestly sounds to me like it's probably a human reverse engineered craft, but
you can certainly make up your own minds about it. Quite a few cases, actually. Here's one from November 9, 1955, 2
years later, also from the Routers News Service. This involves UFOs over a
Pakistani airport coming originally from the Karachi Morning News. The report
reads, "Bluish dimminionive saucers about 6 in in diameter were cited one
night in recently over the Tan airport in East
Pakistan. Engineers of the Pakistan International Airlines and Airport
meteorologists said the tiny saucers were traveling at roughly 1,000 m an hour at a height of about 1,500 ft. Now,
per the newspaper quote, "The saucers were seen for a total of 17 minutes and
lit up the whole airport." Now, obviously, these discs are larger than 6
in in diameter. That would be the apparent size or they wouldn't be able to be seen at 1500 ft altitude. One year
later, July 4, 1956, as reported by the news dispatch from Peshawir, witnesses
described their sighting of a deep red circular object trailing brilliant
sparks in its wake as it moved across the midnight sky was visible for a full
2 minutes at which point it drops down behind the Kyber Hills. Here's a very interesting report which occurred on
June 17, 1969, also from Peshawar. This actually comes from a US Army
intelligence operation in the Army's USA SOU-23 assigned to a USAF radio research
site on a classified mission in the area. The witness says that it was 11:30
p.m. as he sat with a co-orker on the patio outside his barracks. And as he
says, and I quote, "We noticed out over the desert three white discs. Other USAF
personnel were also watching them. Some had cameras. There was no sound, no
disturbances from the objects. Complete silence. After several minutes, the
objects shot straight up and out of sight. Again, no sound. The USAF
commander over the next few days asked that no one mention this. It actually
took the witness more than 50 years to break his silence and he eventually reported this encounter to Newark, the
National UFO Reporting Center. Here's another one from Newark which occurred in July of 1986 over Raal Pindi. It was
around 11:30 a.m. a daylight sighting one morning in early July 1986 that the
witness was playing cricket with some friends when they all saw eight objects
hovering one above the other. They thought at first that the objects might be kites, but they didn't look like
kites. They were metallic gray in co color and were hovering in place. They
continued playing but keeping an eye on these strange objects when suddenly they began to move slowly upwards and then
very quickly darted straight up into space. The witness would have reported
it but as he says there are no UFO reporting centers in Pakistan and it
wasn't until he came to live in the United States and saw all these UFO programs on TV that he decided to report
it. Here's another case from New Fork. It occurred November 5, 2002. Newfork
has a few dozen reports, mostly of anomalous lights, but this case rises above the rest and comes from a
Pakistani Air Force pilot who reported his case only 4 days after it occurred.
He was one pilot of three Cobra gunship helicopters that were performing
maneuvers at night in the Molttown area. As he says, it was a pitch dark night
when something resembling an illuminated round of artillery shells appeared. It
was faster than a helicopter, but slower than an airplane. Its movements were very
wellcoordinated. The strange thing was that it didn't have any engines, and its aerodynamic shape was not like an
aircraft, but it was flying like an aircraft. was far superior than us and
was capable of making abrupt changes in altitude and direction. It was elongated
in shape, 15 ft in length, and it had a dim amber light towards the bottom. So,
seeing this, the witness radioed the air traffic controller for permission to follow this unknown craft. Permission
was granted and the witness tried to follow it in his Cobra helicopter, but as he says, and I quote, "It dodged me
in speed and maneuvers and then it turned towards us and passed from a distance of 50 ft." Wow, that's close.
Now, some thought it might be a drone, but as the witness says, we six pilots
who were airborne at the time know in our hearts that it was nothing close to
an aircraft in shape. I don't know what it is. I have heard a lot about UFOs,
but I saw it for the first time in my life. So, so interesting. I know that
wasn't a whole lot of reports. I can almost guarantee you that that is just the tip of the iceberg. The vast
majority of people don't report their sightings. And in a country like Pakistan, which as far as I know doesn't
have an official UFO reporting service, well, the vast majority are definitely
going to go unrecorded, unreported, undocumented, uninvestigated really in
any way. So most of what we know about UFOs, it's really again just the
surface. Almost all the information about this is sliding right under the radar. We just don't hear about it. But
it's definitely changing for the better and people are again taking the subject
much more seriously. So now let's move to our next location which is the tiny little town of Quapa,
Oklahoma. Thank you Ton Pro for suggesting this location. I was pretty
worried. This is a very small town about 800 people. So, I wasn't sure if I was
going to find anything, but it turns out it's a pretty interesting place. Has a
history of what we call spook lights or earth lights, uh, which aren't
technically UFOs in terms of being extraterrestrial craft, but all
definitely related. And I think I found some good cases of actual UFOs as well.
So, yeah, Quapa, Oklahoma, here we come. Guapa is, as I said, a tiny little rural
town, a population of about 800 people, not far from Joplain, Missouri. It
serves as the capital of the Quap Native American Nation. And as it turns out,
it's one of several locations in the United States known for what we call spook lights or Earth lights. Other
locations are the Marfa lights in Marfa, Texas, or the Brown Mountain Lights in Brown Mountain, North Carolina. And
there are quite a few reports of these earth lights which some people categorize as UFOs but are certainly not
ET craft as we would think of them. However, there are a few impressive cases which could be categorized as a
UFO in Quapa. One occurred on September 19, 1972.
It was around 5:30 to 6:00 a.m. George McWaters looked outside the kitchen
window of his farmhouse and noticed a brilliant light over the Devil's Prominade area. And as George says, it
seemed to be coming up over the river, and it was a bright blue white. At first, I thought it might be some sort
of reflection off the river. And I went to another room to drink a cup of coffee. When I came back to the kitchen
though, I saw it had moved to the east and was getting brighter. So, as he
watched it grow brighter and moved towards the east, he woke up his wife to take a look. And as he says, it was the
oddest color, sort of a bluish green and white, and too bright to look at directly for very long. As his wife
says, it was bigger than any star I've ever seen. So, they watched it for about
an hour when two more lights appeared. They were the same strange color, but dimmer and to the south. And as Mrs.
McWaters says, we could see all three together. Then the two smaller ones
vanished. So they continued watching the big one when, as George says, it seemed
to be hanging there about 6 to 10 miles away, and it got very bright before it
disappeared. Phone calls to the Joplain airport revealed that no weather balloon or aircraft were known to be in that
area at that time. Now, here is a less ambiguous report which occurred on April
9, 2006 and seems to involve a solid craft. It was reported by the witness to
Newark who said that he was heading south through Quapaw when he saw this
UFO. As he says, "I saw one silver cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky.
I thought to myself, what the heck is that?" And before I was able to finish the thought, it took off from the east
to the west faster than anything could possibly go. There was no vapor trail or
anything left to indicate what propulsion it used. Definitely sounds like a classic
UFO. Here's another one that's pretty interesting. November 6, 2014. As the
witness says, "While driving home tonight, we saw a super bright white light with blinking blue and reddish
lights moving in different directions above the treeine. We thought it could be a helicopter, but got closer and it
was circular and made a humming sound. So, clearly not a spook light. But I
will say reports of the quapa spook light go back more than 100 years, usually involving a glowing ball of
light seen bouncing around in different areas. And many people have taken photographs of these. As you can see
here, people come here from all over the world to the best alleged viewing spot
along East 50 Road near the Missouri state line to view this light. One
witness is Raymond Barnett who lives in the area and said he and his friends saw it and that the light came right up to
his car. As he says, "It scared the devil out of me. It got right on the car
hood and it looked like daylight out there. It just looked like a ball of fire that came out of nowhere, then all
at once disappeared." Another witness is Tom Jackson of Joplain, Missouri, who in 1993, thinking
that the reports of the spook light were bogus, went to visit the area on Halloween night and got a very close-up
view. As he says, I remember it started out at the end of the road, got about 10
yards from the car, and then shot back. It looked like it was going to shoot into my truck. I think that's the
scariest thing I've ever seen. I screamed so loud I probably woke up every person in 20 miles. You couldn't
pay me enough to go out there again. I don't know what that is or what causes
it, but there's no way. That's out of this world. So again, it's been photographed on many
occasions and theories range from ghosts of soldiers to the wandering spirits of
two young quapa lovers who forbidden to marry took their own lives to reflecting
headlights from distant cars, flashlights, campfires, all kinds of
theories and it doesn't appear to be any of those. Certainly can't be headlights as the reports go well back before the
invention of the automobile. Now, the area is known to be rich in minerals, silica, calcium, magnesium, other
minerals, which more than likely is the cause of the phenomena of earth lights in this area and in many other areas
across the United States and the world. Very, very interesting. And I think I might do an episode on just spook lights
because again, they're seen all over the world, not just in the United States.
Hezdellin, Norway, for example, is another really good example of an area where these strange lights are being
seen. But yeah, it appears that UFOs have been seen over QuapA, Oklahoma as
well. So, thank you very much, Ton Crow. I truly appreciate the suggestion and I
hope you found that segment interesting. Now, we move to another location,
Selenus, California. I've been there. It's a beautiful place. It's not a huge
huge city, but boy oh boy did I find some amazing cases. A lot of them
actually. This location was suggested by uh three of you people out there. So
that includes Jovan Lopez, Raul Duke, and Haimey. So three of you out there.
Thanks guys for suggesting this location. I learned a lot on this one. This one was really interesting. And I
have to tell you, a couple cases in this city are unlike anything I have heard
before and are super fascinating and so unusual. And yeah, an apparent crash
retrieval as well, which I found super fascinating. So yeah, this was probably
my favorite location in terms of UFO history in this particular episode. So I
think you'll find it pretty interesting as well. Thank you, Jovon. Thank you, Raul. Thank you, Haimey. Let's explore
the history of UFOs over Selenus. This amazing report from June
1945 definitely shows that our military knows more about UFOs than they're
saying. It comes from a man whose father had a very interesting confession regarding an experience he had while
working at Selenus Army Air Base. says the witness, and I quote, "My father,
Lbert L. Doss, was mustered out of the Air Force and trains to home were
scarce. In his free two weeks before leaving California, he chose to visit
Selenus Air Force Base. After visiting friends there, he accidentally wandered
into a restricted area. In a large hangar labeled top secret, he observed
and examined three flying discs. All had USAF markings and tripod landing gear.
No obvious method of propulsion could be found. He was arrested, interrogated,
and forced to sign a secrecy agreement. Some of this was done at pistol point.
He deeply resented being treated that way by his government. and he told me of
this incident before he died in 1990. He said, "There aren't aliens flying those
UFOs. They are ours." And I will agree that definitely
some are ours, but I'm absolutely convinced most of them are ET. Consider
this one from summer of 1947. This very unusual case of an apparent
UFO crash retrieval comes from Mufon Western Regional Director Paul Cerny, a
wellrespected researcher. This case took place on a farm outside of Selenus on a
summer morning in 1947 July or August, really close to the same time as
Roswell. The main witness today is a successful businessman. He was 19 years
old at the time of this encounter. He and his fellow workers were cutting hay
when the ranch foreman told them that a strange object had come down in a nearby cabbage field and it was still there. So
curious, the witness and his coworker went to go see this object. And sure
enough, it was still in the field. Keeping their distance from it, they cautiously approached and began to walk
around it. They could see that this object was a large metallic disc 9 ft in
diameter, 4t high, made of a dull gray metal. There were small rectangular port
holes around the rim of the craft. Otherwise, there were no markings, no evidence of any damage, nor was there
any visible means of propulsion. So his curiosity growing, the witness finally
mustered up the courage to run forward and quickly kick it with his foot. There
was no reaction other than a hollow metallic clang. And around that time, the US Air Force arrived on the scene in
a truck with a long flatbed attached and a contingent of officers. And as
researcher Paul Cerny writes, they instructed the two men to quote get lost
and warned them not to breathe a word about what they had seen. Now from a distance, the witness and his companions
observed the military group proceed to struggle this metallic disc onto the
truck bed, cover it up with a tarp, secure it, and drive off. And that was
the last they saw or heard of it. They did inquire of the foreman later. They
learned that the ranch owners had informed the military authorities of the object's presence. On March 11, 1950,
there was a little mini wave over Selenus. It started around 8:00 p.m. when more than 20 residents of Selenus
called the local police department to report an unidentified flying object over the city. Others called the local
newspaper. The first to call the police was a lady by the name of Constance
Ragwindon. She was driving her car with her two children and her mother when she saw what she first thought was a
shooting star. She immediately changed her mind, however, when the object quote swooped down right over her automobile.
As she says, "I got scared and stopped the car. It looked like two dinner plates put together. It came down to
about 2,000 ft. And as it came close, it gave off a strong bluish white light
that hurt our eyes like a welder's torch. It made a series of looping motions, swoops down. It seemed to be
right overhead. There was no noise. Then it disappeared over the mountains. So
yeah, she said that this object performed loops over her vehicle, then sped off to the south at very high
speed. And as she says, I'm still scared. It was a weird experience. I was
frightened. I hope I never see anything like that again. Now, the next call to
the police came only 5 minutes later. It was from Hyram S. Don, the owner of a
Chinese market, who said that he saw it when he left the store to take some groceries to his car. He said it was
bright, shaped like an egg, and moving so fast that it had a trail behind it.
It was real close to the ground, he said. A third witness said it looked like a shooting star, but quote, "Not
quite the same." These reports reached astronomer Olan J. Egen at the nearby
Lick Observatory, and he speculated that the object may have been a meteor,
apparently unaware of or ignoring the details of the firsthand witnesses, which absolutely contradict this
explanation. This could not have been a meteor. And in fact, in support of the above case is another one which occurred
two days later on March 13, 1950 when Mr. Potter, the head engineer of a
factory in Selenus, and four of his co-workers were on the loading dock busy
at work when a shiny potato-shaped object appeared overhead. It looked to
Mr. Potter like it was just pulling out of a dive when he first noticed it. It
darted off real quickly, but impressed him enough to call the local sheriff. The sheriff called the Civil Aviation
Authority, who said that they knew of no aircraft in the vicinity. Mr. Potter was
interviewed by reporters, and he said that his co-workers ridiculed him mercilessly, but he refused to back
down, saying he saw something, but stopped short of saying it was a genuine flying saucer. It was just 2 years
later, December 12, 1952, a cold morning, just before noon, when a work
crew at the Spreckles Sugar Plant noticed a glowing object moving
overhead. Among the witnesses was Virgil Wallace, who said that it had the appearance and size of quote, "an
automobile headlight." Turned out that other people in town saw it too and said that it passed over Selenus towards the
south and was observed hovering for about 7 minutes over Mount Toro. As they
watched, a military aircraft apparently from Fort Or was seen approaching the
craft, which scared it off. There was apparently no follow-up investigation,
but decades later, this sighting continued to cause interest. There's almost no information about this next
case which occurred on April 6th, 1967, which is unfortunate because it
sounds like a good one. It was about 8:45 p.m. when a couple in Selenus said
that they saw a red disc with windows flying at low altitude over the city.
That's all the information I could find. But here is another case which
involves humanoids. This occurred in March 1972 and it comes from Newark as
the witness says. My sighting took place in the early 70s in Selenus. I think I
was about 15 or so. It was late and I didn't feel like going to bed, so I decided to do some stargazing. I grabbed
a soda and tossed a folding chase lounge chair up onto the garage roof to lay
back on. And after being up there for a short time, I noticed movement in the eastern sky. was not a moving point of
light that I saw, but rather an area of stars being blocked out by a huge object
moving slowly across the night sky. At first, I thought it was a blimp, but quickly dismissed this when I realized
that it was much too large. The best way to describe this object is to say that it looked much like a naval battleship
turned upside down, only a little more rounded at the ends. It displayed no
lights of its own, but I was able to observe the underside as it had become dimly lit by the city lights. The thing
that was really weird about this craft was the fact that it moved in total silence. At one point, it was no more
than 500 ft, almost directly above me. I heard nothing from it. The object
continued moving slowly in a westerly direction towards the ocean and disappeared from sight. I'm 42 years
old, married 18 years, and the father of six. Up until now, the only people I've
told of this were my parents, my wife, and kids, and my best friend. Now, I'm
not saying that I've ever been abducted, but when I think back, there were some pretty weird things that happened to me
during my childhood. I can remember being scared in the middle of the night and getting out of bed. I remember
looking down the darkened hallway and seeing a small figure backlit at the end of the hall. I remember the figure
appeared startled. I didn't recall anything after that and dismissed it as a dream. Another time I woke up in the
middle of the night to see a small hooded figure kneeling by my bed. When I moved, the figure stood up, was wearing
a long hooded robe, much like what a monk would wear. In the darkness, I
could not see a face. That really freaked me out. I snatched the covers up over my head. And the next morning, I
asked my parents of if either of them had checked on me during the night. They said they had not. My mom said that
maybe it was an angel. So, that's what I told myself to keep sane as I grew up.
The last thing I'd like to mention about my childhood is a small metallic object I noticed under the skin of my outer
thigh. I say it was metallic as it was just under the skin to the point where I could tell it was a gray metal color. I
don't remember how it got there. I remember telling my friends that it was there from getting shot with a pellet
gun and that the pellet was still there, although in fact I was never shot. The
small thing is gone now and there is no scar. A rare case of a possible UFO
crash landing occurred on February 27, 1968 in Selenus was 7:10 p.m. as air
traffic controllers Richard Lockwood and his partner Bev Taylor were at the
Selenus airport tower. Suddenly, Bev called out, "What the hell is that?" And
as Richard says, I jumped out of the chair and it was a This sounds dumb. It
was a big green ball. It appeared to Richard that this object was about three
miles away, just 200 feet above the ground, and it was crossing the runway
at such high speed that it disappeared in about 3 seconds. Now, a plane was
about to take off. So, Richard asked the pilot to fly over the area where this object had gone, but the pilot didn't
see anything. As it turns out, there were three people near Alisal High School, one mile north
of the airport around the same time, and they described what was apparently the same object. They said it had four quote
very, very large green lights surrounded by a solid mass of green. They said it
appeared to crash land somewhere between the high school and the airport. Though they heard nothing and saw no explosion,
the police were informed and police Lieutenant Ray Jackson headed a five
square mile search of the area, checking with geer counters, infrared devices,
and fire trucks with search lights. Nothing was found. There was an
interesting aftermath though when the nearby Fort Or was contacted about the sighting and they said that the objects
were probably flares and that they would agree to do a public display of flares to establish this theory. And in fact,
public affairs officer Don English told reporters it is a definite go. It will
be done. It will depend somewhat on the weather, but it will be done. Needless to say, it was not done. or if it was,
there was zero publicity about it, which would have been the whole point. Meanwhile, sightings in Selenas
continued, including one just a few months later. It was June 1978, and this
one involves apparent missing time. As the witness says, I was only 7 years old
when I had a strange experience. This is what I remember. I was playing little league softball and a home run was hit.
I jumped on my bike and ridden to a wooded area where I saw the ball fly into. I got off my bike and went looking
for the ball in the woods. After entering the woods, I remember a bright light shining through the trees and an
awful smell like burnt rubber or sulfur. After that, I remember I was laying on
the ground looking at the sky with my hands across my chest and the softball in my hands. I don't remember finding
the softball, so I don't have any idea how I ended up with it. I guess I passed
out from the smell. And then someone or something put the ball in my hands. So
that's all the information in that case. It's certainly interesting because there was another sighting around that time.
This one occurred on June 11, 1978. And it's an impressive multiple
sighting by five young boys including Don Ogawa, Bill Bakis, Tim Price, Randy
Moger, and Brian Classmire. They were all between the ages of 10 and 14. Was
around 1:20 p.m. and the boys were in the Pine Canyon area when Bill Bakus was
the first to point out a weird shiny bright white object in the sky. As Don
Ogawa later told reporters, "We thought it was a jet at first. There was no
smoke, no sound. It looked like a big wedge." So, this object was flying a
straight level course, but then it disappeared behind a a hill. It reappeared and then darted straight up.
This is what really impressed the witnesses. As Don says, it was quote, "Really hauling." So, seeing all of
this, all the boys were convinced that this was a genuine UFO. Here's another
case still in June of 1978, 2 or 3 weeks later, June 30th.
This is a rare case of a UFO landing with actual landing traces. As the
witness says, I was outside playing with my dog and it flew over my street, Toro
Boulevard, towards the school down the road. I ran in, told my mom, and we
walked together down to the school. The whole time, my dog was going nuts. I remember I could barely hold him. When
we got there, it was gone, but it left a burnt smell. And apparently where it landed, it left a ring around the school
field where it landed. I remember it clearly. The ring was incredibly big,
meaning the craft was big. Guessing the size now 40 years later, I'd say it was
100 ft in diameter. It was a perfect circle, and it was still warm to the touch. When it flew over, it had to blue
to greenish lights underneath it. And thinking about it now, because I was young, it could have been its propulsion
emitting the colors. It was only above the roofs of the houses by about 20 ft,
if that. It was close enough you could hear it. For lack of a better word, it sounded like a metallic whistle. Hard to
explain, and more people than me had seen it that day. I remember people
standing in the street looking at the direction of the school, and there was actually a Selenus newspaper clipping
that my mom saved for years talking about this UFO sighting. Many people had
seen it that day, but I don't see any mention of it anywhere now. Must have
been real, otherwise we would see media on the sighting. It can be hidden from the people, but I know what I saw, and I
will never forget it. I could not find this newspaper clipping, but certainly an interesting report and one of many.
Get this one. This is so interesting. This occurred on August 10, 1981. It's a
very bizarre case involving three witnesses. It was approaching evening that night, and they decided to get some
parts at the local auto shop store in Selenus. And as the witness says, as we
approached the turn to the intersection, we saw some strange lights that were going through some midsize camper trees.
We thought it was some carnival at the school. As soon as we made the turn on the intersection, my son's eyes were as
big as large olives, and he said, "Dad, we have finally seen one." I knew what
he meant. I decided to park right below it, and we could see it. It was aluminumike and it had a row of windows
on the bottom half and a complete circle of windows on top with a blue light
always rotating. I told my son to check the bottom and I would check the top.
The bottom windows were like frosted and we couldn't see anything inside. It was there hovering about 10 to 15° front
down. It was just as clear as observing a plane at the airport. Now, when all of
this happened, the object changed to a rotating platform with rotating yellow letter signs about 7 ft long. It was
garbled at first, but it started going around with English letters telling us
to tell the world. We decided not to tell anyone as we might look and sound
like fools. My son, my wife, my two girls and I talked about it for years.
And the lights were coherent lighting of different colors, not just any lights.
The bottom was covered with antenna-like sticks and also a lot of lights. Now, the final strange thing is that it took
them about 20 minutes to get back from the store, but this store is only one
mile away, so there's a possibility there was missing time. Here's another very interesting case from Selenus.
August 25, 2002. This sounds like a sighting, but apparently there are
deeper levels of contact. The witness is anonymous. He reported his sighting to New Fork. Z says, "I was driving home
from Selenus Valley to Chilar when I saw an eggshaped object that glowed baby
blue in the dark open sky. I was in the back roads. The object didn't look that
high from the sky, maybe a/4 mile high when I first saw the object. Somehow, I
was so into the beautiful light that I don't even remember how I stopped in the side of the road with my car turned off.
I got really scared because I didn't know what had happened. Someway or
somehow, while I was looking at the object, I received some type of input.
Input that I would rather talk about in person. But I swear to God that I am not
joking around. I now know the truth and I know it's time to let everybody know
why we are here and how we got here. Certainly an intriguing report. Here's a
very interesting case involving an apparent crop circle. This occurred on December 30, 2013 when two young men
were driving outside of Selenus and saw weird green flashes of light in a field.
They quickly pulled out their camera and captured some videotape of this. You can
actually see the pictures here. They posted this on YouTube anonymously. They
could not explain it and it was quite brief, but boy were they shocked to find out the next day that a mysterious and
large crop circle had appeared in apparently this exact location where they had seen the lights. And this crop
circle attracted so much attention that the farmer who owned the property had to hire security guards to keep people out.
Weirdly, this crop circle was plowed over shortly after it was discovered,
but not before a photographer by the name of Julie Banganger flew over it in a helicopter and took several photos of
it. You can see it here. It's beautiful, clearly meaningful, and in fact an
expert in braille so that the center of the circle displays the number 192
repeated several times. What this means is hard to say. Uh it does look like a
computer chip. Several people noticed this and it was shortly after this that the Nvidia Corporation who makes
computer chips said that they did it and it was actually a publicity stunt. I
don't know. I mean, I tend to believe this explanation, but there's still some questions about all this because there's
no word on how they made this crop circle, why nobody saw them
making it, what those green lights were, did the farmer allow it, was he a part
of it, and if it was a publicity stunt, why was it so quickly plowed over? So,
there are still lots of questions surrounding this, but it's certainly an interesting event that got a lot of
publicity in Selenus at that time. Here's another case, February 2014. This
comes from a young couple, a law student and a construction worker, and another couple, a mechanic and his retired wife.
As the law student says, it was approximately 500 a.m. I noticed a very
large, very bright light outside my window. I looked at it with my naked eye for about 10 minutes and observed that
the light was staying in one place without moving. I went and got my boyfriend. He suggested that we get my
binoculars and look at the light with them. What we saw was so clear through the binoculars that we both had to sit
down for a minute out of pure shot. It was a saucer-shaped craft, more like an
egg laying on its side. There were windows all across the center of the craft where the light was shining
through. The light was super bright and white or yellowish in color. The craft appeared to be brown or grayish in
color. We both took turns watching it for over two hours during which time the
sun came up over the horizon and the craft did not move from the one spot except very slightly coming closer to us
and then going back to its original position. I tried to film it on my cell phone, but my camera on my phone was not
able to zoom in enough to get a clear image. We both watched the craft change shape before our eyes into some sort of
leafike shape. And then ever so slowly it moved directly up into the sky until it was a small bright light too high up
to identify anymore. But the most amazing part of this thing is that we have now seen it every morning for seven
days in a row. So they're very much convinced that this is not a planet or a star cuz they watch the stars move past
this craft while it remains stationary. They also saw several planes come within range of this craft but fly right by it.
And compared to the planes, this object was huge. They said about 50 times the
size of this plane. And they did get two other witnesses. They brought over a
really good camera and they're trying to videotape it and that's the last I could
find on this case. One final case from Selenus occurred on April 5, 2019. A woman who
lives high on a hilltop in Selenus, surrounded by eight acres, said that she had a humanoid encounter. She said she
woke up in her bedroom to see something highly unusual. And she says, "This orb
of bright white light, it had eyes and a slit that represented a mouth. It was
approximately 18 in from my face. It illuminated my face as it seemed to
assess me while I was trying to assess it." I remember thinking, did someone
break into our house and is in the bedroom? The door was closed, and this orb did not have a body, nor did I see
any hair. It appeared to have somewhat of a face. The eyes were staring through
me, and it was not a friendly gaze. I remember being frightened. However, I could not break my gaze. Then it
disappeared. Now, her husband was there. He never woke up. Her dogs were in the other room and did not react in any way.
How amazing is that? I mean, Selenus has everything. UFO crash retrievals,
landing cases, humanoids, a UFO basically putting out a sign for the
witnesses. That case was really strange. Super interesting. It's amazing how many
cases there are when you consider that most go unreported. Selenus is definitely there must be
something about that area that is attracting UFOs because that's a a lot of cases for a town of that size. Now
let's move to the next location of Deuke, Iowa. Got to thank Coley Weber
for suggesting this. Thank you, Coley. Really appreciate it. Uh we've spoken
several times. I hope you find this interesting. Uh because some of the cases I found here, wow. I mean, there
was one guy who had missing time, but some really, really interesting cases of
all different types as we'll see. Here we go. Exploring Deuke, Iowa. Deuke
definitely has some crazy UFO cases such as this one, which occurred way back in 1880. I'm not sure that this is UFO
related, but is somewhat interesting because it involves strange humanoids.
It's a wild case involving supernatural beings and was published in 1880 in the
Cleveland, Ohio Plains dealer newspaper and it involves a young girl who went to quote live with the fairies. So this
story comes from a Duke farmer by the name of Andy Crowe whose teenage daughter Kitty had become deathly ill.
Doctors couldn't heal her, so he took her to Father Bernard of the New Meer
Monastery who had a reputation for psychic healing. Now, after seeing the father, the daughter, Kitty, said he
couldn't help her and that she was going to leave home for a year and go live with the fairies. Now, her father, Andy
Crow, dismissed this as just a child's imagination and forgot about it until one morning, a year later, he went to
his daughter's room to wake her up, and she was gone. Police were called. A search ensued, but no trace of her could
be found. So, suspicions began to fall on Andy Crowe, her father. But one year
later, she returned and she said that she had in fact been living with the fairies, riding in their invisible
vehicles, living in style. Everyone rejoiced. A feast was held to celebrate her return. She shared her story with
everyone, not going to visit her sister later, Mary Anne Hayes. She told her
that the fairies had returned for her and that she would be leaving immediately. So her sister followed her
upstairs and saw two strangel looking men dressed in weird dark clothes. So
Kitty Crow left with the two men, alarmed. Miss Anne Hayes followed and
watched them walk up the street a few blocks and just boom, disappeared into thin air. And Kitty Crow is never seen
again. While this does sound like a wild story, apparently these people did exist. And author Chris Woodyard traced
the story and confirmed that this family was a real family and that Kitty Crow allegedly did disappear. There was a
monastery in the area. He confirmed a number of the facts of this story. So, I
don't know. It remains a mystery. It was on July 4, 1947 that Lewis and Olga Korn
of 879 Rush Street reported seeing UFOs. But it was Olga's sighting two weeks
later on July 17 that made the local newspaper because on that day she said
that she saw six identical looking objects hovering for about an hour over
the Mississippi River. She said they appeared to be ovalshaped, 2t long, 1t
wide, and as she says quote deeper than a saucer, more like a shallow cup with a
broken handle. Strangest of all was that they appeared to be somewhat vaporous,
kind of like a cloud, and floated gently through the air before finally disappearing. Of course, at that time,
there was a huge super wave of sightings sweeping across the country, including the Kenneth Arnold sighting in Mount
Reneer and just days earlier, the Roswell UFO crash in New Mexico. The
next sighting to get any attention comes from Morton P. Paradise, who had a very interesting encounter. He wrote it up
for the local newspaper. As he says, "On the night of December 22nd, this is
1952, Wednesday, at approximately 7:30 p.m. I was traveling in an easterly
direction on Route 151 between Cedar Rapids and Deuke, Iowa. Suddenly to my
left, but ahead of me, I spied a bright luminous green light in the sky. My
first impression was that there had been a collision of two airplanes in the sky. Then I noticed that the light didn't
waver or move. And I discovered that it seemed to be hovering and pulsating, getting dimmer and brighter. It lost
some of its brilliance and got brighter. So bright that I could scarcely keep my eyes on it. It had no definite shape,
but seemed like its edges were ragged and it was a slant. So you can see his drawing here. And as he says, by this
time the hair on the back of my head was standing up. I swerved off of the road
and brought my car to a complete stop and turned off my lights so that I could see better. I got out of my car. The
light was still there, pulsating luminously. Within 3 to 5 seconds after I got out of my car, it seemed to rise
straight up and disappear right in front of my eyes. That's all there is to the story. I was all alone on the highway at
the time. When I got to the nearest phone, I called the local paper and asked if there was an Army Air Force
base nearby. They said no. So, I went to the office of the paper, the Deuke
Telegraph, and I gave my story to the night editor. His name is Mr. Fred Lawler. I'm 33 years old. I served four
years in the army, during which time I served part of the time with anti-aircraft forces. I taught airplane
recognition for some time and I will swear that what I saw was no airplane or airplane flare. I am not looking for
publicity. I do not take the liberty of saying that I saw a flying saucer. I wouldn't know what to call this
phenomenon. I only know that it was not natural and I feel that you would like to know about it. Arguably Deuke's most
famous UFO encounter comes from a pilot by the name of Charles R.
Morris. He reported his sighting to Major Robert Friend of Project Blue Book
at the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. This sighting occurred just before
6 p.m. on March 4, 1960. And as Charles Morris writes, "My wife and I at our
home were watching a T6 aircraft performing at approximately 2,000 ft.
This turned out to be a pupil of Morris's when, as Morris says, we saw
three brightly colored solid objects in line appearing in the sky traveling
northnortheast. We saw them for approximately 4 minutes, and as they disappeared, they seemed to be climbing
very slightly. The objects did not give off smoke or any vapor trail, drop anything, change brightness, shape, or
color, did not explode, speed up, or stand still at any time. The objects
were sharply outlined, though Charles added that these objects were in fact saucer-shaped, silver in color, and he
guessed about 200 ft long and 60 ft wide. He estimated that they were at about 20,000 ft altitude, moving at
around 200 mph. And he did manage to capture them on 8 mm color film, about 10 to 20 ft of
film, which he sent to the Air Force. He said only a small portion of this film actually captured the objects, but the
Air Force said they found nothing on the film and returned it back to him. They did do research. They found no evidence
of any other aircraft in the area and ultimately called the sighting quote
unidentified. And as it turns out, there were other witnesses. Another was HV
Ludovo Vissy, his wife and son who saw the objects and Mr. Ludovvic Vissy
described them as quote three bright metallic objects traveling very slowly
almost floating. They watched the objects for 10 minutes at which point one seemed to flash at them and give off
a puff of smoke. And in fact, more than 20 calls came into the local newspaper
reporting these objects. So a lot of people were very much impressed by this. At least two of the witnesses, Ferdinand
Nestler and Alan A. Jones, said that they used binoculars and believed the objects were airplanes, but further
checks with the military and local airports showed no planes in the area. And Charles Morris, he's a trained pilot
and a flight instructor, said he'd never seen anything like these objects in all of his years of flying. This very
interesting and close-up sighting occurred around 6:30 p.m. on October 12, 1967 when two children at the home of
Richard Lamore were in the outside yard at a picnic table when they said they
saw a quote silvercoled egg-shaped object. They said it moved overhead at
very low altitude. After speaking with the adults, they estimated that this object was an estimated 10 ft long, 5t
across, and 50 feet high. And in fact, it appeared to be coming in for a landing. That's how low it was. And the
children could see what looked like landing gear hanging down beneath it. When the children jumped up to watch it,
this object immediately moved upwards and moved to the north. They tried to chase it, but were unable to keep up
with it. And unknown to these witnesses, turns out their neighbors, the John R.
Wachi family, also observed this object. Miss Wachi was watching her five
children, aged 2 through 10, through the window in the yard when suddenly she
saw, quote, "The children's eyes get as big as half dollars." She ran outside to
see what they were looking at, but this object had gone. And the children described an object that quote had a
small dome on the top and a thing coming out the back. Pretty amazing sighting.
Case after case in Deuke. Here's another one. August 22nd through 23rd,
1972. This comes from the Deuke Telegraph Herald reporter John McCormick. He writes that Brian Downey,
age 19, and his girlfriend, soon to be wife Kathy Atkins, age 18, you can see
them here, were heading home from a date in the early morning hours of August 22nd,
1972. They had just crested a hill near Flora Park when they noticed a bright
orange object in the western sky. Brian said it was flat on the bottom with a
dome on top. They watched it for about 10 seconds when it passed out of view. Kathy, who was driving, quickly backed
up the car at the top of the hill to get a second look, but the object was gone. And they said they would not have
reported to the newspaper had they not seen another story in the paper about someone else who described seeing a
similar orange UFO at 2:30 a.m. the same morning that they saw the object. And
the UFO was back the next night. This time it was 8:30 p.m. August 23rd. Miss
Leslie Avery, her brother Clarence Wernamont, Lester Ball, and his wife
Lucille were at their home on 6351 Asbury Road in Asbury. This is
pretty much a part of Deuke, uh, immediately to the west, and they saw something in the sky they could not
explain. It was Lucille who saw it first, and she shouted out, "Oh my god,
what's that?" They all looked up in astonishment and Miss Avery says that
this object was quote bright with red, blue, and green lights. They could hear
it making a humming noise. It hovered for several minutes, pulsated its lights, then moved slowly north in a
circle before moving off to the south. All the witnesses were convinced it was a UFO. And as Miss Avery says, "I can't
believe it. From now on, I'm going to watch the sky out there." This sighting got a lot of publicity. April 12, 1977,
about 1000 p.m. Seven teenagers in two separate groups, they were aged 14 to
17, all saw something they couldn't explain. The first group of four was
walking down an street. You can see it here. The second group of three was just off the street hunting nightcrawlers.
And suddenly, both groups simultaneously noticed something odd traveling southwest over the Mississippi River.
near US Highway 20. Both groups ran to the end of An Street to get a better
view. None could see the object itself, just a cluster of lights. Jerry Lanzer
and Kenny Burch described seeing three white lights with one red light which
blinked in and out. Jeff Ertel said the same thing, except he said that there
were two red lights. Jim Schumacher said that he saw two white lights and a bunch
of little red lights in the middle like a circle. And his brother Greg said that
he saw three lights, red, white, and green. Jeff Pittz remembered only one
white light, so none of the witnesses could quite agree on what they saw. Um,
they did not think it was a plane. The position of the lights was all wrong. The object was totally silent. It was
moving strangely. Uh Jerry Lancer said it was going no faster than 25 miles per hour
when he saw it, but Jeff Ertel said it was going fast, like a blur, then it
stopped. Then it went down in steps or a slope, real gentlelike. Kenny Burch also
remembers it stopping completely in midair. So, some slightly contradicting testimony, but definitely all the boys
are in agreement that what they saw was very unusual. Now, Venus has often been
blamed for being a UFO. And certainly in some cases, this is true, but I'm not so
sure that that's the cause of this sighting on February 22nd, 1982, when a
bunch of calls began pouring into the Debuke police station, radio station, and newspapers reporting a quote,
"Large, round, bright object reportedly about 1,000 ft above the ground in the
eastern sky." The calls began around 400 a.m. and most
people insisted upon anonymity, not all. Nancy Tapen of Terrace Heights Mobile
Home Park, you can see it here, said that her four-year-old son was woken up by the light and became terrified
because this light was streaming in through his window. Other callers said that this object actually moved and
changed in brightness, and calls were coming not only from Deuke, but from the surrounding areas. So, a lot of people
thought this was very unusual. Frank Miller, the director of the Height Camp Planetarium at Loris
College nearby said that what people saw was probably Venus. And as he says, I
don't know for sure that these people saw Venus, but that's the first thing that comes to mind. I don't know. It's
pretty unusual that, you know, that many people will start calling the newspapers, the sheriff's office, radio
stations to report an object in the sky that's quite low. Unless, you know, this is truly something unusual. Another very
interesting case, apparently a missing time abduction occurred on October 12th,
1996. It was 10:30 a.m. as eight young teenagers were walking through a Debuke
cemetery, likely Lynwood. And as the main witness says, there was this eerie feeling I had like someone or something
was watching us. My buddy was right next to me and I turned around and stopped
looking at the horizon and there was this very bright light moving very fast
horizontally. And I said to my buddy, "Hey, look, it's a UFO." He started
laughing and said it was just a plane or a helicopter. And I said, "No." The light was solid and had no conventional
rending lights. And the next thing they knew, this light was right over their heads. The witness's friend grabbed him
by the shoulders and yelled that they had to get out of there. Turned out the others had already run away. And as the
witness says, I looked up and the light was suddenly became very warm, welcoming
almost like you were being wrapped up in a warm blanket. That's when everything went silent and I couldn't move. That
was the last I remember of being in that spot. Fast forward 2 and 1/2 hours later. I remember hearing my name being
yelled by seven people from afar. I opened my eyes. My head was down. So I
was looking at the ground and my hands were in my pockets. I was smiling and laughing as these guys came charging
towards me when they found me in the junior high school football field 200
yards away on the 50ard line. My cousin was the first one to grab me by my
shoulders and sh He shook me asking me where I'd been for the last 2 and 1/2 hours. We were way past curfew. It was
12:30 a.m. I said I was right here the whole time. So later at home, he did
find a strange mark on his pelvis. He realized he had missing time. He now
knows what that means and is considering hypnosis. Here's another Debuke sighting. very close-up sighting of a
solid discshaped craft which occurred on January 3rd, 2002. As the witness says, the UFO had
light blue flashing lights, was saucer-shaped, and had a dome-like top on it, and it acted like it wanted us to
stop. What we saw was clearly a UFO. It had flashing lights that were very
bright. The lights would flash on for a second and go off for about 1 and a half to two seconds and then back on again.
It had windows, four or five on the side that we could see. The lights seemed to
be coming out of the windows. It came towards us on Highway 61 last Thursday
night. Then it seemed to change directions and go the way we were going for a few seconds. It was about 50 ft
above us. Finally, it started flying away from us until it disappeared. So we thought. Then I saw the light blue
lights again in my rear view mirror, which lasted for about six miles. The
lights weren't getting further away from us as we drove on. And by the time we got into the city, it was gone. I used
to think people that believed in aliens and UFOs were insane. Now people think
I'm insane when they hear my story. And I had four other people with me, too. Oh
well, we know what we saw and no one's going to tell us any different. The
final sighting in Deuke took place on August 18, 2002. This is an interesting one because
it involves a UFO that apparently tracked a plane flying just south of Deuke. A husband and wife were both
pilots. One of them is named Marlene and they were descending from 12,000 to
5,000 ft. when at about 9,000 ft of altitude, this UFO appeared. As the wife
Marlene says, "During the descent, at 500 ft per minute at around 140 knots, I
looked back behind the right wing and saw a white light between the cloud banks and far in the distance. It
appeared to me as a landing light on a plane. It was five or more miles away and almost parallel to us. Within a few
seconds, it flew closer at a great rate of speed. As it was the closest to us at
1,500 to 2,000 ft, I could see the bright white light was all it was. There
was no wing tip or tail lights. There was no wings or body. As the light descended rapidly next to us was still a
white light from the back. This all happened in a matter of 5 to six seconds. I felt it was on a collision
course with us as we were descending into the same cloud it had disappeared into. So the couple was not informed of
any other planes in the area, which they would have been if there had been a plane there, and it couldn't have been a
landing light. As the witness says, no planes turned their landing lights on at
9,000 ft. So Marlene and her husband are convinced it was not a meteor, not any
conventional craft, but instead a genuine UFO. As Marlene says, the speed
and the path of its descent is not possible by any aircraft I am aware of.
It had to travel 5 or 6 miles in a matter of 6 seconds. That's 1 mile a
second. I do not think that this was another plane. There you go, Coley. I
told you I was sure that I could find cases in Deuke. And of course I did. Did
not expect to find that case involving what? A fairy kidnapping. I don't know
how else to put that. I wonder about that one. I mean, that is a very old
case. Very hard to research or confirm. So, I don't know. Not sure what to think
of it. Is it a story? Is it true events? Hard to say for sure, but certainly
interesting. and makes me wonder if it's related to, you know, UFO experiences in
terms of people going on board. It's a very odd case, but as we see, all types
of cases are represented in most of these locations. And let's move to another
one. Daytona Beach, Florida. I expected to find more cases than I did. Still, I
found quite a few. Some really good cases as well. some well doumented
cases, multi multiple witness, couple of really odd ones as well. Got to thank
you Ag Peall for suggesting this. Uh I always learned something. It's like a
not only a geography lesson, but I learned stuff about each of these
locations, know their history. I like to dig deep and see what I can figure out
as to why these certain locations are attracting UFO activity. But like I
said, UFOs are being seen everywhere. They are ubiquitous. I doubt that there's any
location on this planet that doesn't have a history of UFO encounters. That's exactly what I'm finding. So, yeah,
Daytona Beach, Florida. Here we go. They found seven encounters in Daytona Beach
and some really interesting ones in excluding humanoids. The first occurred on August 29,
1950. This comes from J. E. Salter Jr. of Power Street. And he told the Daytona
Beach News that at 5:30 p.m. on August 29, 1950, he and his brother-in-law, Ben
Bernard, observed a disc about the size of a dish pan spinning under a low
hanging cloud. They watched it move into a dark cloud in the western sky and then
come out of the cloud and move to the south. They said it was a very low altitude and it appeared to be throwing
off a phosphorus type glow. Two years later, another impressive case. The
witness in this case is post office clerk JB Gormley, who says that around 1000 p.m. on January 3rd,
1952. He saw an object that was half moonshaped moving towards the southeast
much faster than a jet plane and yet making no noise. He said it looked to be
metallic, maybe about 30 feet across and quite low, 400 to 500 ft high. He
reported it to the Daytona Beach Morning Journal, who did check with the Civil Aviation Authority, who told them that
they have no information about this object. So, it appears to be
unidentified. And there are more. Check out this one. This is really unusual.
This one comes from the Florida UFO Study Group. The witness is Kathleen Rand. And one day in the spring of
1957, she had just left the Halifax Hospital in Daytona Beach and was
driving along the highway to Dand when she noticed something quote fuzzy and it
was pacing her car. She described this as a thing, a round cloud. She said it
had a dark center and was moving at an estimated 1,000 ft of altitude and it
was following her car. In fact, she says it followed her car for a full 20 minutes before suddenly making a right
turn and moving rapidly away. So clearly not a cloud. This next case got a lot of
attention and was investigated by NIKAP, the National Investigative Committee on Aerial Phenomena and it comes from a
good witness, a pilot and a photographer by the name of Clarence Brown. He was 27
years old at the time of this sighting. It was the evening of November 11, 1959.
He and his friend Doyle Hewitt were in a 170 Cessna flying at 2,000 ft near
Daytona Beach when a UFO showed up on an apparent collision course. And as
Clarence says, I looked out towards the ocean and all at once I saw this light
coming. At first, I thought it was a jet. It was flying as fast as a jet, but when it turned, it didn't make any
noise. And if it had been a jet or another kind of airplane, I would have heard it. It turned about 4,000 ft from
me. If it had been an airplane, I would have seen the silhouette in the moonlight. It was as bright when it
turned as it came headon. It was a white light. Not a bright light, not a dim
light, just a bright blur. I saw it turn past me, and as it continued south, it
disappeared. It was just bright blue, and it didn't act like it was throwing a beam or anything like that. Now, his
friend Doyle Hewitt saw it too and turned to Clarence and said, "What was that?" Clarence said, "Must have been an
airplane, but no, he doesn't think so." As he says, "I thought it was an airplane at first with nothing but its
landing lights on, but if it had been a plane, I would have heard it or seen its silhouette in the sky. I believe there's
a logical explanation for it, but I don't know what it is. I've never seen
anything like this before. I used to think anybody who saw unidentified flying objects were crazy.
Unfortunately, there's very little information about this incredible humanoid case which was witnessed by a
Clyde W. Hicks on September 7, 1964. He wrote about his experience in a
letter to NIKAV. He said it was a foggy night. He was driving towards Daytona
Beach when he saw a quote spaceship. He said it came drifting out of a fog bank.
He said it was egg-shaped and more than 200 f feet long. It had two rows of windows and through the windows he could
see at least a dozen quote large people moving about. When he first saw the
object, it was very bright or as he says it looked to be a blaze all over. But
when the luminosity went out, he saw the object appeared to be silvery in the moonlight. He said that he does have a
background in aviation and he is convinced that this object was not a plane or a blimp. This next case comes
from UFO researcher Christopher Montgomery of the UFO Group Eupfork or
the UFO Resource Center. He's also the author of the book UFOs, a scientific
inquiry. It was around 8:30 p.m. on February 20, 2008. was a calm night and
a father and son were at Daytona Beach when they noticed strange lights performing unusual maneuvers over the
ocean. There were glowing green objects, they said, and per the witnesses, the objects were quote, moving up and down
and back and forth. They heard no sound coming from the objects, which they estimated were quite low in the sky,
about 200 ft. They watched them for about 20 minutes, but were not able to
identify them. The most recent case I could find occurred on April 3rd, 2023, and it was investigated by Rusty
Hester. You can see her here. She's a MUON field investigator and assistant
state director for MUON, Florida, and a member of the MUON experiencer resource
team. This case involves three witnesses whose house is about a 5-minute drive to
the beach. They were outside their house at 8:37 p.m. April 3rd, 2023 when they
saw two unusual objects flying silently through the sky just off the coast.
Quickly grabbed his camera and was able to take some pictures. As the witness says, the objects were glowing orange,
shaped like a boomerang, going very fast from south to north off the coast of Daytona Beach.
The witnesses said the objects were flew very close to each other and they were so disturbed by the sighting that they
canled their plans that night to go fishing in this area. But you can see the pictures here. Uh it's interesting
because this is actually a video. This is a still of the video. The video showed that these objects were actually
flashing lights, which was something they did not notice while viewing them. Rusty Hester, the investigator, did
check the flight paths in the area and couldn't find any aircraft in that area. Certainly none that matched what the
witnesses saw and she closed this case as unknown. How interesting is that? I
hope you found it interesting. Agall Daytona Beach has definitely delivered.
That last case was pretty impressive with the photographs of these V-shaped objects. I always love it when people
are able to capture photographs of what they've seen because it's often been said that a picture is worth a thousand
words. Well, when it comes to UFOs, it's worth far more than that. Not only
provides confirmation of what a person has seen, but also you it's almost
impossible to describe in words some of these sightings that people are having. And a picture just makes it so much
easier to see what other people are seeing. So yeah, another location on
this planet that has had encounters. Now, let's move to another
location. Statesville, North Carolina. This is a fairly large city, midsize, I
would say. 30,000 or so people. Expected to find a lot more than I did, but I
found some really good ones. This one was suggested by Old Marine Mountain and
Metals. So, thank you very much for the suggestion of this location. North
Carolina have got a lot of activity. Uh, and Statesville apparently is no
exception. With a population of 30,000 in Statesville, North Carolina, I expected to find more cases than I did,
but I found two good ones. Here's one which occurred on September of 1955. And
this comes from APRO, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization. The witness is Budita L. Mitchell. She's a
trained observer from the ground observer corps station on the outskirts of Statesville, North Carolina. And in
fact, she had spent the morning there, then came to her home at 709 Colatin
Road. This is in Raleigh, some distance to the east, but still quite close to Statesville. And as Beauty says, I was
in the yard with my binoculars facing southwest. A glint of something shiny
caught my eye, and I focused the binoculars on three white or silver craft flying in V formation, but they
were not planes. They were circular in shape. When I first saw them, their
size, to the naked eye, was about that of the top of a pencil eraser held at
arms length. I estimated that they were flying at a fairly low rate of speed at
an altitude of about 15,000 ft moving east to west. I watched fascinated for a
minute or two, and suddenly one craft darted ahead of the others in a tremendous burst of speed, then slowed
down and waited for the others to catch up. This started a sort of game evidently and for another two or three
minutes until they were out of sight, I watched them playing around almost like lambs or puppies in the sky. I reported
this to my superior in the ground observer corps and told some other members about the sighting, but
evidently only my friends believed me. So, this was in the direction of
Statesville and could very likely have been seen from there. But here's another really dramatic case involving a UFO
landing and humanoids in Statesville. This occurred on June 29, 1986 around
dusk. The witness is the witnesses are a father and son and they lived on a 100
acres of land on a deadend street, a pretty rural part of Statesville.
The son was 12 years old and they went outside and saw this gigantic craft
sitting in their cornfield. And as the witness says, I have thought of this
event my whole life. My father and I were standing at the edge of our yard when my dad said, "What the hell is
that?" I looked and saw what was about as tall as a 30story building just
sitting 100 yards from us in a cut cornfield. was about as wide as a
football field or so. It had windows running all down the left side like a tall building. I could also see coming
out the right side of a a cone shaped like a metallic booster looking object
like on our space shuttles. It had a little bit of steam coming out of it like it was a vent. I could also see at
the top what I swear looked like a head with bulls horns or something, an emblem of some kind. It scared my dad so bad
that when I ran towards it to get closer for a better look, he screamed at me to stop and wait for him to go first and
see what the hell had landed in our field. He finally caught me and led the way when all of the sudden it vanished
and was gone. We walked back then, but to this day, I wish I had gone on out there because I think still to this day
it was still there and just cloaked itself. I swear on my life, and my father would too, that this happened one
late evening in the late 1980s. And I've never forgotten it or been able to
explain it. But I feel now for sure after reading about people reporting the same UFO in detail, mine was not just
lit up. I could see people in the windows. There you go. Old mountain
marine and medals. Told you I could find something in Statesville. And I did. How about that last case? I can only imagine
what it must be like to see a massive UFO sitting in your yard or your
farmfield and not only seeing this gigantic craft, but looking through the
port holes and seeing humanoid forms. Wow, amazing. These are events that
stick with people for the rest of their lives, and you can certainly see why.
All right, now we move to our last location in this collection. Thank you
for sticking around. Now we explore Annadale, New York. This one was
suggested by Becca. This is a quite small neighborhood on Staten Island,
covering about 200 plus acres, so I didn't find a lot, but I found at least
two really interesting cases. one involving landing traces. So, I think
you'll find it interesting, Becca. Certainly hope so. Let's go. Annadale is
the last location I am exploring in this little episode here. I found just a few
cases, two actually. Uh, this is a very small neighborhood, 222 acres. And one
case I found is quite interesting. This occurred on February 10, 1975. This case
comes from NIKAP researcher Dennis Anderson and was also presented in Ted
Phillips book about UFO landing trace cases. It was around 700 p.m. again
February 10, 1975 when two boys age 15 were in the forests of Anaddale and had
just entered a clearing where there was a frozen pond. They were checking the thickness of the ice in hopes of skating
on this pond when suddenly they saw a huge orange glowing ball about 20 ft in
diameter hovering about 400 ft away just above some trees near the frozen pond.
And as they watched over the next 10 minutes, this glowing sphere compressed into more of a football shape, shrunk
down then to the size of a basketball, and suddenly disappeared. They heard no
noise, nor did they feel any heat. Frightened, they fled the area. But it
turns out there was in a way another witness. Another person was in the area.
He didn't see the object, but says that his German Shepherd dog reacted very
nervously, whining and whimpering at something in the woods in this exact area. And this was a trained attack dog.
So this behavior was very unusual. And in fact, the dog not only whined and whimpered, it ran back home in fear. So
the boys left the area, but returned the next morning to explore it and found that the trees where this object had
hovered, ranging in height from four to 5 ft, one report says 20 ft, had been
sheared off and were coated with what appeared to be a carbonike substance.
Researcher Dennis Anderson went to the scene with a reporter a few days later and confirmed the presence of the broken
and burned trees. As he says, "What I found was that the trees in the area
were knocked down in kind of a radial pattern and that the earth was charred."
So samples were taken and analyzed and they confirmed that the wood of the trees was in fact burned and the residue
was carbon. Weirdly, the analysis showed that the fire appeared to be oilbased.
This was odd considering the eyewitness's testimony of seeing this object. And Dennis Anderson, who
interviewed the witnesses, says that there's definitely was not a hoax and that their witnesses quote, "Their
honesty and credibility are excellent." As he says, "I would say this is our
best local UFO sighting." One final case, July 17, 2004. I'll just quote the
witness directly as he says, "What I saw was a sphere-shaped craft hovering over
my house at nearly 2500 ft. It did not move at all, and there were two times
when it was not visible, then reappeared in the same original location. Although
it was a nice day out, the craft appeared to be equipped with luminous white light. This light looked somewhat
like neon white or a fluorescent white. My sister was outside with me and I was
pointing over the house but she was not able to see it because she was seated under the umbrella for shade from the
sun. I said, "Look at that in the sky. If you see what I'm looking at, you will
believe in UFOs." But she did not bother to get up. He did try to record it with
his camcorder, but by the time he got it working, this object had moved off. Well, Becca, that's all I could find in
Annale specifically. quite a few locations in the surrounding areas, but I didn't cover those. And again, I'm
sure there are more there. I'm going to be generous and say that one in 20
people report their encounters to say the police, the Air Force, or a UFO
reporting center, but most don't. I've interviewed so many people and the vast
majority said that they've never talked to the police or MUON or anything like
this. So again, most of these cases are going undocumented and finding this many
in all these locations just goes to show you how common UFO encounters are. And
you can see the entire range of cases. Sightings, landings, face to face
encounters with humanoids, on board experiences, couple of crash retrievals in this episode. How interesting is
that? Certainly, it indicates that our government knows far far more than
they're publicly saying. So, yeah, that's it for today. Nine locations. If
you want to provide a location for me to look up, please feel free to do so. But
I would caution you that you'll have to be patient because I've still got hundreds of people in line waiting for
me to explore the location that they provided. I'm working my way down the
list. Some of these are quite large locations which honestly will take me a
week just to go through all the documentation. So, this is a very
difficult research project, but can't say that it's work because I'm having
fun doing it. And these this series
shows once again that UFOs are not only seen everywhere, but that I think ETSs
are doing a vigorous publicity campaign sort of grassroots movement to announce
their presence likely because our own governments are covering this subject up and don't want
people to know the truth and ETSs are not having it. They're doing all they
can to disclose. And in fact, I think the ETSs have done their part to disclose. We now have enough cases to
say for sure that this is a real thing. And I think anyone who does objective,
unbiased research can only come to the conclusion that UFOs are real. My point
is the ETS have done their part. The rest is up to us. So that's it. Thank
you very much for watching. I truly appreciate it. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Maybe learned a little bit. And
until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth.
Most important of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
