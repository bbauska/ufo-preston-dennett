UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE FIVE
Oct 18, 2024

Summary:
Oct 18, 2024
UFOs are ubiquitous! They are seen everywhere on our planet. Every town, every city, everywhere! In Part Five of this ongoing you the viewers have provided nine new locations to investigate and find UFO cases. And once again, research shows that UFOs have left no place behind. Eugene, Oregon----Homewood, Illinois----Niagara Falls, New York & Ontario Canada----Glenwood, MN----Helena, MT----Tucson, Arizona----Monterey, CA---Rotherham, UK: all of them have been visited by extraterrestrials. That includes sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences, with many cases supported by evidence including photos, radar-returns, landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more. We are not alone!

EUGENE, OREGON shows a long UFO history. In 1947, a married couple had a dramatic encounter with a low-level UFO. In July of 1955, the audience of a drive-in movie theater in Eugene witnessed a dazzling UFO display. Cases in 1959, 1960, 1971 and 1976, 1982, 1986, 1986—most involving multiple witnesses, including police. In 2015, a Eugene woman saw gray aliens in her bedroom. In 2016 a witness captured startling photos of a UFO.
HOMEWOOD, ILLINOIS is a suburb of Chicago with a few impressive accounts. On April 28, 1952, two witnesses observed a silver-white dome-shaped object flying circles around an airplane. They called the US Army Regional office who routed the case to Blue Book. But the Air Force wasn’t interested! On November 8, 1973, three sightings hit the Chicago area, including Homewood, and then moved over a shopping center!

NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK & ONTARIO, CANADA have been visited many times. A very early and impressive sighting occurred in 1833. All throughout the 1950s numerous sightings occurred , many involving military witnesses. In 1955, two families picnicking near the falls saw a USO emerge from Lake Erie. They all saw humanoids inside the craft. In 1958, a woman saw a UFO landed by the highway, leaving landing traces. In 1960, a young man had a UFO talk to him, then follow him home and take him onboard. In 1963, airport tower personnel saw a UFO which Project Blue Book said was just a balloon! More cases throughout the 1970s to the 2000s!

GLENWOOD, MINNESOTA was visited on September 25, 1954 when dozens of people over a wide area reported UFOs. In 2003, Cindy Lou Schmidt not only saw a UFO from the porch of her Glenwood home, she managed to capture a photograph of it. MUFON field investigators declared the case unknown.

HELENA, MONTANA had sighting way back in 1947 when a massive fleet of 12 objects flew over the city. In 1973, cement truck driver John Struble was at Flesher Pass when a UFO sent down a beam of light disabling his truck and scaring the daylights out of him. In 1976, numerous people across Helena called the police to say that UFOs were zooming over the city.

TUCSON, ARIZONA is the location of hundreds of encounters. Here we look at nearly a dozen cases involving humanoids and onboard encounters. In 1952, a woman hiking outside of Tucson saw a UFO, then a gray walk up to her and she then found herself inside a craft. In 1960, Charlie Green was pulled out of his home by four grays. Unknown to him, someone outside his home watched him being taken. In 1977, a woman saw a UFO land next to the Veterans Hospital. A silver-suited humanoid came out and pulled her onboard, holding a long conversation with her. In 1981, a woman saw a UFO outside her home, was taken onboard and saw three different types of ETs. In 2001, a teenage boy made a wish to see an alien, and moments later saw a flying humanoid. In 2007, a woman sent a telepathic hello to a UFO. That night, she found herself being visited by humanoids.

MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA has several impressive encounters. In April 10, 1950, numerous policemen saw had a daylight encounter with a shiny silver disc. Even a prisoner saw it! In 1950, a train engineer had a dramatic encounter as a UFO paced his train. In 1967, a UFO hovered 100 feet over a farmhouse. In 1973, a low-level UFO was viewed by police. That same year, Fort Hunter-Liggett Army base had a very dramatic encounter and also possibly a UFO crash with bodies. In 1974, several residents of an apartment building all called the police to report a fast-moving egg-shaped object. In 2017, a “cloaked” cylindrical craft moved over the city.

ROTHERHAM, UK was the location of a spooky humanoid goat-man seen back in 1937. The years of 1977, 1981, 1987, 1988 and 1997 produced many spectacular cases. More cases occur, even as late as 2001 when witnesses reported a craft moving with a strange pendulum motion.
The cases speak for themselves. All over the world UFOs are being seen. UFO activity is far more common and widespread than previously thought. It appears that the ETs want us to know they are here! The truth is obvious: UFOs are seen all over the planet, including your own hometown.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs in the
Paranormal today's episode is called UFOs in your hometown episode 5 I
continuing this ongoing Series in my search for UFO Encounters in every
location on this planet I put out a challenge asking all of you guys to give
me the name of your hometown and I will find a UFO encounter there
and I've worked my way down a list of over 500 locations so thank you guys you
really delivered this is going to take a while to get through this list so please be patient if I haven't covered your
hometown yet but I'm in the 40s now and I'm still batting 100% I'm proving my
assertion that UFOs are in fact seen everywhere on this planet and are a lot more common than people
realize these are of course not just sightings but Close Encounters of the first second and third kind sightings
cases where UFOs affect the environment in some way Landings cases involving
humanoids on board encounters really the entire range of UFO activity and of
course supported by really compelling evidence huge variety of evidence actually including radar returns
photographs medical evidence Landing traces electromagnetic disturbances
animal reactions and more so I will be covering nine locations today and these
locations were provided by you guys and they include Eugene Oregon Homewood
Illinois Niagara Falls both in New York state and in the province of Ontario
Canada as well as Glenwood Minnesota Helena Montana Tucson Arizona Monteray
California and finally BR in the UK so
quite a wide variety of locations and yeah it's amazing how many
cases there are so let's just get started and the first case first area
I'd like to talk about today is Eugene Oregon huge thanks to Garrick o for
suggesting this location it's very beautiful place I've been there I have
some friends up there and no surprise I did find quite a lot of encounters there
the first significant case in Eugene that I could find occurred on July 5th 1947 at 12:30 p.m. a gentleman by the
name of John nice Wanger and his wife were driving home when a glowing object
which he described as like a child's drawing of the sun appeared overhead so
he stopped the car and he and his wife watched this object as it moved slowly across the sky and was gone a pretty
brief sighting here's another July of 1955 a whole group of people were at a
drive-in movie theater and were watching Ma and P Kettle in Hawaii when suddenly
dozens of undulating moving yellow orange lights appeared to the East and began moving around they were at very
low level and about as bright as stars but moved around for a full half hour before disappearing and as one witness
said I have never seen anything like it before or since and for those of you who might be
interested this is definitely a thing UFOs appearing at driveing theaters in
fact I did a whole episode on cases just like this and put out a book called UFOs
at the drive-in so check it out here's another case four years later March 26
1959 Gordon doel and his wife were visiting friends on River Road in Eugene
when they saw something they couldn't identify as Mrs dowel says at first I
saw only one object I thought it was a plane at first because of an orange red light that kept flashing soon I saw
another similar object with a flashing light suddenly one object sped off at a
tremendous speed in a southwesterly direction the other then zoomed like a jet southeasterly I have never seen
anything like this in my life so she was ultimately left wondering if this was perhaps a UFO or maybe a secret
government weapon of some kind next case one year later on the afternoon of June
16 1960 at least 20 people including a family who were driving along Hayden
Bridge Road saw a shiny metallic object going quote around and around in the sky
it first appeared very low in the sky but then took off according to the witnesses it was quite large as one
witness said it was a monstrosity so many cases here's another
September 1971 dozens of drivers stopped on the highway as a green and white UFO
described as a 100 yards long appeared overhead as one of the witnesses Ted Cox
says it was an extraterrestrial vehicle that's what I think it was it changed a
lot of things about my life it's really hard to explain what happens when you see something like that I wasn't as a
afraid of the future maybe it's this knowledge this understanding that there are other things out there I'm not sure
what it was but I saw I know I saw July 31st
1976 this is a really interesting case this is actually a 5 and 1 half
minute audio tape of a very interesting sighting over Eugene the witness is
called the National UFO Reporting Center only minutes after this encounter
occurred uh Eugene Oregon yes and I'd like to report something I've Just Seen
okay I saw this about at least four or five minutes ago okay now it was um I looked at it
through binoculars it was at least how far way do you think it was from where we were well it was up near the cloud
cover it was underneath the cloud cover we have here I don't know how high the cloud cover is right now it was
traveling fairly low and when it first finded it was a
horizontal uh kind of a how would you describe it kind of a bar kind of a bar
and it um underneath it was traveling horizontally to the Horizon underneath
was a yellow a bright yellow and overhead was almost a dim orange it was varying between the two colors uhhuh and
it got brighter and brighter as it came it appeared to come closer and then the flame flickered out and then in place of
the flame there was an object that was completely spherical in shape what it appeared to me it was black in color
kind of a cinder and it um was traveling it appeared to me traveling faster than a
plane would travel and uh but well maybe slower than
a than a Jet Plane might travel depending on the jet I guess it was traveling fairly fast and it disappeared
over the Southeastern Horizon going toward crestwell okay did that object appear solid yes definitely okay did you
hear any sound oh oh yes there was a little one that dropped all right there was the large
um spherical shape spherical shape and then it appeared that I it was pretty
far close to the Horizon it was very hazy due to the cloud cover and it appeared that a smaller one separated
from it from below it and became a bright color bright white or a yellowish
kind of a maybe an off white and shot very fast toward the Horizon just just extremely fast and about a couple second
later it appeared back underneath it and hovered for a while underneath it and then it was gone I don't it didn't
appear to shoot off in another Direction maybe it went back up to the other cical shape I'm not too sure I think that's
what it might have happened now when that small object moved away uh was it to the east or Western Horizon it was
moving south okay then you didn't see that come back I didn't see it come back yes I did
did you see the small one come back yes and it moved under the larger one yes but you did not did you see the small
and gold board the large one no I didn't I can't say that for sure okay that was just my and this all took
place as the object is moving Southeast yes the large object was in continual motion okay I didn't hear any sound at
all uh-huh uh can you compare the size of that object with anything that you know
a very well depending on the how far it was I also take consideration there was a a cloud cover over it was hovering in
and out of the of the clouds it appeared to be mostly out of it um what do you
think well of a large very large weather balloon or something like that I'm not sure well I don't know the size that I
saw okay it looked about the size of a pee a little large larger and quite far
away because you could tell that it was round but you couldn't you know tell
like if there was you know anything about it that might resemble a weather balloon or something like if there was something underneath it or something it
was round uh-huh it was every once while would go behind a light um patch of
clouds you know and just for maybe half a second and then come back out that's how I thought maybe it was up in the
cloud cover or below it it appeared to be from what my guess would be um maybe
the size of a a very very large balloon I really can't say it appeared to be
very large but it also appeared to be very far away okay uh can you give me the degrees uh above the Horizon that
this thing was located I'm afraid I can't okay but it just you saw actually saw the object move out of
sight yes it disappeared over the horiz okay how how were you attracted to this to begin with um shouts and cries from
uh my girlfriend's mother and her friend okay yeah um our friend was just leaving
and they mom walked out to um say goodbye to her and they were W watching it go across the sky and said wow it
looks like a UFO so we went out to look and we saw it and I ran back and got my b binoc killer to look okay and you
figur you watch this just about 5 minutes yeah yeah about 5
minutes and how many witnesses tonight um let's see there were four who just
saw with a naked eye and then the two of us that l through it with binoculars okay and through binoculars you could
see the spherical shape yeah well we sure appreciate this report and if we get any additional information on this
we'll get back to you and let you know about it okay thank you thank you very much rela always nice to hear directly from
the witnesses themselves so many cases here's another October 4
1976 an object was seen hovering at Treetop level uh in Eugene one of the
witnesses actually used a telescope to view it he said it remained for a full 45 minutes and was bright enough to
bathe the Treetops in a pale green light before suddenly shooting upwards at very
high speed and out of sight year after year UFOs are appearing over Eugene
here's another case March 20 1982 about 20 separate people called the
police between 9:30 and 11:30 p.m. reporting 1 to4 red white and yellow
lights that were hovering and darting around in strange Maneuvers and sometimes apparently dropping things
according to one witness it was only 3 months later on June 10
1982 that Wanda Johnson and her husband were driving late at night from Eugene
to Crow when they saw quote the biggest object we've ever seen it was all colors
like red and blue and kind of yellow had a tail like a shooting star might have
so they watched this object Zoom down from the sky and disappeared behind some hills in the distance and they weren't
the only ones it was also seen by Dave loer and a friend who watched it from on
top of Skinner but they said it was quote just hanging there in the sky like
they were tied together there was no sound or anything and they just floated off toward the South another witness was
Al Cole who said it was quote the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my
life quite a few people saw this some did think it was a meteor but most of the witnesses vehemently disagreed with
this explanation one was Chris Snider who said that's a good one do meteors
fly in formation do do they turn their lights on and off he said he watched
three objects for over an hour viewing them through binoculars as they moved around much of the sky next case four
years later one evening in July 1986 George dorsy his wife and their
grandchildren were in their home just south of Eugene when they saw a UFO hovering over nearby Spencer but as
George says my wife saw it first it was pinkish orange round
quiet maybe 60 to 80 ft in diameter and saucer shaped he said they watched it
for just a few moments when suddenly it moved so fast they couldn't believe it
as he says it took off it shot it didn't take any longer than a second to go from
the but in front of us over the forest behind us it had to be going at at least
35,000 m per hour FYI turns out George dorsy was a Navy combat aircraft spotter
during World War II so he knows what aircraft looked like and he definitely couldn't identify this one next case 3
years later December 31st 1989 a group of about 20 people were at
a party at 15th Avenue in Moss Street when five lights showed up and began to
put on a display in the sky for everyone there one of the party goers was Cheryl
blower and she said the objects quote move M around together formed patterns and figures and sort of danced for about
20 minutes or a half hour nobody was drinking at the time now it turns out
that her son Shawn took photos which showed these bright spots in the black sky and as it turned out there were at
least three other groups of Witnesses in separate locations also watching this
display Betsy Stephenson and her friends watched them with binoculars from her home on Skyline Boulevard also ingred
welt and her daughter saw them from Hayward Field at the University of Oregon another group of witnesses Bill
and Martha mcchesney saw them from Alton Park nobody could identify them all
believe they were quite unusual year after year here's a more recent one on the evening of August 16
2015 a lady was in her bed in her home in Eugene when she says two grays showed
up by walking right through the door she said one looked partly human but had
very large eyes and a large head she had no fear of these guys considered them her friends and she cooperated as they
conducted a physical exam she actually asked them if they could reverse menopause but they did not respond
here's another case 5 months later on the evening of January 17 2016 a witness was on his deck when he
saw a group of star-like Lights hovering at near ground level some distance away
in fact he took numerous photographs until the phone finally lost power as
the witness says I was shocked to see this and got my sister to look at them as I had never seen anything like this
so it looked at the witness that at one point these objects actually landed but they disappeared when an airplane
approached the area this case was researched by muon field investig vators Keith Rell and Anthony
balachi one more case in Eugene occurred at 815 p.m. on September
26 when a witness saw a triangular-shaped object rotating on its
Center axis the window said it had orange lights and was shimmering like heat
waves it had a smooth sides and a smooth metallic Underside which was glowing
with a light blue light thank you Garrick for suggesting Eugene Oregon I
have to say it really delivered quite a wide variety of cases including humanoids amazing now let's move to the
next location which is Homewood Illinois couple of you out there requested this
location including Mr Corsair and Kevin Washington didn't find a whole lot of
cases I have to say but I did find two so I'm still batting 100 % and yeah this
is a real brief segment in terms of locations but still proves my point UFOs
are seen everywhere and I will be returning to the Chicago area in future
episodes one early Homewood case occurred on April 28 1952 when two
witnesses saw what they described as a silvery white Dome shaped object which
was actually circling AAR large airplane for about 3 minutes they called the US
Army regional office to report it and the case was rooted to project Bluebook
who declined to even conduct an investigation probably because these
Witnesses were civilans and of course a coverup was definitely clamped into
place by that time but here's another pretty impressive case November 8th
1973 a series of three UF sightings over Chicago cited by police actually moved
over to the neighboring Homewood and then over the dixy Square shopping center located
at201 Dixie Highway in Harvey so a pretty widely viewed sighting there you
go yeah only two cases but there are UFO encounters happening in Homewood
Illinois so thank you Mr Corsair thank you Kevin and now let's move to the next
location which I did find a huge number of UFO encounters and this location is Niagara
Falls this includes both New York State and the province of Ontario in Canada
and this was requested by a couple of you out there including garbage person and Tracy so thank you guys this is an
amazing number of encounters for this location a huge VAR variety of cases and
really fascinating stuff in fact please don't consider this comprehensive
there's some I did leave out including the very famous 1965 New York blackout
because I did cover that in a previous episode about UFO sightings in New York
the top 20 cases so you can definitely find more information about the Niagara
Falls sightings for the New York blackout in that episode but but still
plenty of cases to cover here in this episode one of the first convincing sightings over Niagara Falls and
actually New York State itself occurred on November 13 1833 when an object described as quote
large square and luminous was seen hovering over Niagara Falls for more
than an hour this was at a time a huge meteor shower this does not appear to be
a meteor more than a thousand people on both the American and the Canadian sides of Niagara Falls witnessed this
spectacle though no one was able to offer any convincing explanation for what it was moving forward in time June
1st 1951 Blue Book's first unexplained case in the state was actually over Niagara
Falls it's case number 928 it occurred at 420 a.m. the
Witnesses were Master Sergeant h e Sweeney two enlisted men men as
well one glowing yellow orange saucer-shaped object with Ark shaped
Wings was observed by these Witnesses they said it flew straight up and was in
view for about 30 to 40 seconds Blue Book officers could not explain it
here's another case April 16 1952 a giant sort of ring or
donut-shaped object was seen by numerous people from a wide number of locations
over the Niagara Falls area one of the witnesses Howard Scott said it was black
at first and about 600 ft wide he estimates but as he watched it changed
to blue and white as it moved over the horizon at quote tremendous speed
another witness Robert Henderson said that this object looked like quote a large bicycle tire on its side he said
it quote seemed to be about a mile up in the sky definitely unusual definitely
unidentified just a few months later August 7 1952 and a half hour past
midnight a dazzling mass of colored lights including green white orange and
red appeared over the Niagara Falls Municipal Airport now this was witnessed
by residents military personnel at the Shaunie radar station a Lake Erie Coast
Guard base and the 36th fighter Interceptor squadron at Niagara Falls
field now major Richard bar the COO of a radar station said only that a report
had been sent to headquarters but citizens said that they saw this object hover over the Welland Canal connecting
Lake Erie with Lake Ontario a lot of cases in the Niagara Falls area here's
another one evening in Late July of 1955 two families were picnicking on the
shore of Lake Erie near Niagara Falls when a silver object they said actually
emerged from the lake and then began to approach them using a pendulum like
movement the witnesses ran to their cars only to discover that the car engines would not start the craft approached
them very closely they estimate to within 30 ft close enough that the witnesses could see four humanoids with
white heads and what looked like black robes the next thing they knew the object flew back over the lake Rose
vertically and was gone here's another case from Project Blue Book July 25 1957
12:25 a.m. a USAF pilot Lieutenant Robert S Hipkins and Sergeant Raymond C
hentry observed a brilliant white circular object with green lights making
Fast pivoting turns moving radically and then disappearing in a steep climb and
this object was was actually tracked on radar for a full 3 minutes and get this
project blue books conclusion quote probable balloon don't know how balloons can
disappear in a steep climb and move radically but okay here's another case
1:30 a.m. snowy morning in January of 1958 a woman was driving on the New York
State throughway near Niagara Falls when she noticed a large dark saucer-shaped
object with an illuminated hoik protrusion on top she knew this was
immediately unusual and as she drove closer this pole retracted into the
craft so she drove up right next to this object at which point her engine slowed
and stopped and her headlights went out typical electromagnetic disturbance now
bravely she started to get out to investigate but this is when she noticed shadowy forms moving around the glowing
pole section of this craft the forms quickly disappeared the craft rose up
spun and then reaching an elevation of only 10 ft raced away she got out of her
car to investigate the landing spot and did find some traces an area of about 1T
in diameter where the snow was melted down and was actually dry down to the
grass two years later on the evening of October 19 1960 a teenager from Welland Ontario
Canada says he felt an overwhelming compulsion to drive to a desolate area
near Niagara Falls and arriving there he found the whole area around him
illuminated coming from a light overhead and looking up he saw a 100 ft wide
saucer shaped craft he said it was about 100 feet above him so he shouts out who
are you what do you want and according to him a voice came back and saido not
be afraid we will not harm you we will return tomorrow night to confirm the
sighting and visit you this point the craft darted away so he drove home and
was preparing for bed when he felt a presence in his room a voice called out do not be afraid prepare yourself next
thing he knows he's in a round metallic room he saw three men who he described
as having tan skin short white hair hair blue eyes and wearing blue jumpsuits
they told him that there were important things to be done in the future of Earth they showed him what looked to him like
a viewing screen and they showed him images of what he found out was Rio de
Janeiro and it showed the city bursting into flames and then being swallowed by a huge tidal wave they told him that
this was just one example of many and that Civilization on Earth would soon
come to an end they told him that he was needed by them that they had helped him with health issues throughout his life
they told him that they used to live on earth more than 300 million years ago they gave him a tour of the craft
including the control room at one point they put him inside this tube like device or section which swirled with
colored lights he says a PL Pleasant energy filled him with his sense of
well-being and wisdom next thing he knew he woke up in his room and he knew this
was not a dream cuz the whole room was filled with this strange ozone like odor
all right moving along June 18 1963 at 1 p.m. Tower operators at Niagara Falls
airport and Bill Nelson a newswriter for the Niagara Falls Gazette all saw this
UFO which they described as having extremely bright lights red blue green
and yellow they said this object was performing fantastic Maneuvers at very
high speed and did so for a period of 2 hours later Lieutenant Colonel Robert
friend of Blue Book released an explanation saying that it was either a
balloon or a star or a planet anything but unexplained that's Blue Book for you
next case according to the Niagara Gazette shortly after sunset on September 22nd 196 5 dozens of residents
from Buffalo Leon Clarence North tono Wanda and of course Niagara Falls and
other cities reported seeing two brightly lit objects which changed colors moved at low altitude all across
Upstate New York the first reports did come from Leon with Witnesses reporting
bright objects over the river but shortly later Rosel Simon Leonard Butler
and other residents of Alden spotted the UFOs flying over Bloss Lee Drive next
witness was state trooper John reel who spotted the object which he described as Globe shaped reflective and metallic he
watched this object swerve first Northwest and then Southwest it was around this time a reporter for the
Niagara Gazette and his two children observed the UFOs cruise over the town
of Niagara Falls shortly later more witnesses VD price and his Foreman
Raymond bright they were at the American Standard division watched the object
they said for nearly a half hour as it passed over North Tona Wanda as Raymond brigh says this was not
a satellite this hung around in the sky for about a half an hour it would move
off in One Direction and then stop then it would change direction and move again
now the Niagara Falls Air Force Base denied any knowledge of the UFOs in that
area on that night the Federal Aviation agency at Niagara Falls International Airport was contacted but they said that
the night crew had not received any UFO reports that evening however one of the
controllers did admit that he had spotted a UFO the night before Niagara
Falls is really delivering April 6th 1968 2:15 a.m. three patrolman Thomas
shamway William Wells and Richard Atkin all saw a mysterious glowing object
pulsating with red blue and white lights hovering near the sir Adam Beck plant of
the Ontario Hydro El electric power commission other Witnesses outside the area also saw this object now another
case 5:15 September 1st 1972 a 13-year-old boy says he observed
a silent gray cigar-shaped object Zoom across the sky right above Niagara and
he said it was being chased by Air Force jets so many cases here's another on the
evening of April 3rd 1978 numerous people called the Niagara Regional Police to report UFOs among them were
two 12y old girls Tisa blal and Lorraine
velers who saw what they described as a large black gray cylindrical object with
two square red lights circling over their home at an elevation of no more
than 200 ft just 2 weeks later or so three April 25
1978 patrolman Ronald Sardina received a call about a UFO and as he says quote I
looked up in the sky and there it was the object was there for about 3 hours
also seeing it was Doris Warner and her son Jeffrey they said it was blinking on and off and appeared to be directly over
Niagara Falls so many cases here's another one year later as reported to
mufon in 1979 in an ninous family who lives adjacent to Niagara Falls Air Force Base
this includes a father brother sister and cousin were driving near their home when they cited a quote glowing orbl
likee orange light streak across the sky the Witnesses were convinced that the object was unusual because one minute
afterwards two military jets were scrambled from Niagara Air Force Base
and took off in parent pursuit of this object the father who was driving also
attempted to pursue the object and the Jets in his car but naturally was
unsuccessful they moved too quickly but the witness does write that even decades
later this event still comes up in family discussions about UFOs so it
clearly impressed them here's another case 1980 UFOs were appearing so
frequently over Niagara Falls that year that people began conducting skywatches
and were very successful in fact one gentleman Bill Nelson was able to take
photographs of these objects Harry Pickins an aeronautical engineer witnessed them many times with his
family he granted many interviews was very vocal about it and as he says I
have a secrecy clearance I've got 45 years experience and I've never seen
anything like it throughout 2007 a gentleman says that he and his daughter
regularly watched UFOs from a golf course in Niagara and that these objects would flash red blue green and Amber
lights as they moved around over Lake Ontario one final case in this area
October 18 2009 numerous residents over Niagara Falls Ontario observed UFOs for
a period of no less than 3 hours 900 p.m. to midnight definitely unusual per the
witnesses as one witness said I have never seen anything like it thank you
garbage person thank you Tracy it was really interesting to me to see so many
encounters in the Niagara Falls area proving once again UFOs are seen
everywhere and all kinds of encounters it's just fascinating to me
that there are still Skeptics around because if they did the research they would find far more cases than I I mean
the general public has no real idea I think just how common UFO encounters are
let's move to another location to now I'm going to explore Glennwood Minnesota
and this is at the special request of Court Richards didn't find a whole lot of cases but I found a couple and that's
enough to prove my point that UFOs are seen everywhere the first Glennwood
Minnesota case I could find September 25 1954 as people across Minnesota were
observing UFOs over a wide area including Graceville Fargo Minneapolis
sou Falls and of course Glennwood one of the witnesses Miss harand Iverson says I
saw it too all of a sudden the area in back of our house became light and there was a blue white ball about the size of
a 1B coffee can with a long streak after it it was going
straight South and came toward the ground in a gliding manner when as it
was about 10 ft above the ground it seemed to explode and disappear I thought it
landed so very unusual another witness Cindy L Schmidt
at 5:30 p.m. says that she observed a glowing object from the porch of her Glenwood home as she says it's stopped
and remained sideways for a few seconds now she had her camera ready and she
actually snapped a photograph as this object hovered over a hill an estimated 900 ft away she thinks this object was
about 30 ft long at one point she says it did send down a beam of light to the trees
below which let her know that this object was in fact quite close to her
and muon field investigator William J mcnf was convinced that this was a
genuine UFO as he writes my conclusion is that the object is unusual and
unidentified thank you again Court always interesting to explore these locations and find a case there it's
like finding little hidden nuggets so I'm I mean I'm just fascinated by this
subject and to know that there's not a single location that hasn't been visited is a really profound thing I really
expected to find more cases there but a couple proves my point let's move to the
next location Helena Montana this is By Request of Mr Corsair you snuck in more
than one location you know I'd love to explore all the locations you guys are
giving me but please just pick one and if you're going to add to my list please
be patient because my list is now over 500 locations but but I definitely found
some in Helena Montana the first of three cases I found in Helena
Montana occurred in 1947 to a group of girls at a slumber party at Peggy
Mitchell's home located at 610 North Logan all these Witnesses were on the
back lawn of Peggy Mitchell's home when a fleet of 12 orange glowing disc-shaped
objects zoomed overhead among the Witnesses were Janice hmel Ruth
Robertson Jerry gruner Joanne Huber and Nia Hardy all said that the objects
traveled in a V formation and were seen at 2 a.m. in the morning the next
interesting case many years later October 29 1975 John strubel a cement truck driver
was driving at the bottom of flesher pass located about 24 miles outside of Helena when an object appeared about 300
ft ahead of him on the highway said it was very low maybe 50 ft above the
ground so had four green flashing lights and as soon as he saw it it struck him
with a beam of Light which caused his truck engine to go dead and roll to a
standstill so the object was so bright it lit up the whole Canyon around it and after about 5 minutes it Rose upwards
making a loud roaring noise and started off to the east at incredible speed next
case one year later on the evening of September 6th 1976 numerous calls came into the Helena
local law enforcement agencies reporting UFOs in fact one men one man said he saw
an object dive into the Hills South of Helena another said he saw an object
hovering over the abandoned Broadwater Hotel just west of Helena on US Highway
12 thank you Mr Corsair for being so patient I hope you enjoyed finding
locations in your hometown which have had UFO encounters it's amazing to me I
mean this is really an eye openening research exercise for me because while I
already knew UFO encounters were pretty common I didn't realize just how common
they are remember most people don't even report their own sightings now let's move to the next
location which was provided by Cliff Olinger and that is Tucson
Arizona and I almost gave up on Tucson not because I couldn't find any cases
because I found two many in fact I could have done a 5H Hour episode on Tucson
alone not kidding so finally I just decided to cover the most interesting
cases mostly involving ing humanoids I have covered a number of
cases in Tucson in previous episodes check out my episode on the top 20 cases
in Arizona there was a couple of Tucson cases there that were absolutely
mindblowing but yeah I mean I found so many that I just about gave up finally I
decided you know what let's just cover the most interesting encounters that are most extensive involving humanoids cuz I
think those are the most interesting so here you go thanks again Cliff the first
humanoid case from Tucson comes from Wendell Stevens and occurred on the afternoon of June 177
1952 as an anonymous witness was walking along a desert trail near Tucson she was
actually out rock hunting when she saw what looked like a ball of fire descend behind a nearby Ridge so she's walking
towards that direction when suddenly she sees a small small gray man approaching her and he immediately spoke to her
telepathically saying do not be afraid at this point she experienced a lapse of
Consciousness and she woke up shortly later on a table inside a small room
surrounded by a group of gray humanoids four of them they all looked the same
large dark eyes large heads typical Grays it sounds like she says they
pulled P down an instrument from the ceiling like a light and used it to examine her body she does believe they
implanted devices in her ear and abdominal area and at one point they
showed her a screen which showed a Starfield and they also showed her a book which she said
was filled with strange symbols a pretty interesting case and here's another
which comes from Jim aov of Arizona muan and he says that one one evening in
May 1960 a gentleman by the name of Charlie green was in his home in Tucson when two
short thin beings with dark eyes and large heads showed up pulled him out of
his room through the window and up into a craft and that's really all Charlie
could remember but very interestingly there was a second witness outside who
actually saw Charlie floating between two beings and up into this craft which
he said was about 30 ft in diameter so this appears to be a very
rare case of someone witnessing someone else being pulled on board here's
another case from Wendell Stevens which occurred on February 4 1976 it's quite
brief all we know is that a Tucson witness woke up to find herself inside a
small room a silver colored room on a table she says the table was in the
center of the room room she said the room was illuminated by this weird hazy white light one wall was curved the
other looked flat and she said it looked like it was covered with consoles and instruments of some kind she saw what
looked like three-dimensional viewing screens on one wall and she says the beings were what we would think of as
typical Grays very short very large heads and huge black eyes fortunately
that's all we know about that case but there's always another this one is really interesting comes
from researcher Fred Dennis and occurred at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Tucson was 1:30 a.m. on April 4
1977 the witness was on the hospital grounds watching jack rabbits in the Moonlight when she heard a strange noise
and looking up saw a glowing oval-shaped craft she said it very quickly descended
and landed only about 40 ft away said it was about 50 ft wide 20 ft High she was
absolutely transfixed when a tall broad shouldered man wearing a skintight silver jumpsuit
approached he said his name was an Le and that he wanted to talk to her she
couldn't see his face that well but he she said he did have large dark kind of flashing eyes next thing she knows she's
inside the craft with no idea how that happened she saw other beings in there wearing brown jumpsuits they were much
shorter she said the craft with silver inside very well lit she saw what looked like a control panel and a screen on Le
offered her a Milky drink which she declined but he began to ask her many personal questions seemed to know all
about her life he asked her about reincarnation and how she would respond
to the prospect of facing her own death and in fact he told her that they would be coming back for her when she asked
when why he said quote it is not for you to know the next thing she knew she was
standing on the street near her Tucson apartment now off Hospital grounds and
in confirmation of her experience her shoes which had been new and unmarked
were now covered with dust and Burrs so many cases in Tucson here's another one
from researcher Jim Cox this one occurred at 2 am on February 16 1991
the witness is anonymous she woke up went outside her Tucson home to see a
metallic cylindrical shaped object with pulsating pink and blue lights hovering
overhead she noticed a large door in the object and then suddenly found herself apparently inside it inside she saw
different types of weird equipment which appeared to be glowing with blue light she she said she saw three different
types of humanoids inside one was very much a human looking figure he appeared to be in charge she said but
she also saw several small Grays with large heads and large dark eyes and what
looked to her like a humanoid reptilian very tall with green scaled skin and
large golden eyes that's all we know about that case
but here's another uh this occurred in November of
1996 to Elizabeth wall as she says one
of my roommates and I experienced an encounter for a month I would see these
Dancing Lights just outside I would be compelled to go or look outside also I
would feel like I was being watched I'll be watching TV and feel a presence but when I turned around I didn't see
anything so this feeling became so pronounced that Elizabeth began to sleep with the bedroom lights on and one night
she went to bed around 3:00 a.m. suddenly woke to find her bedroom filled
with a white blue light she tried to move and couldn't and then as Elizabeth
says I saw this tall hooded figure walk across the window into my room I
couldn't move and I was frightened but strangely she found herself becoming inexplicably calm moments later she fell
unconscious and her next memory was waking up in the morning and wondering what the heck had happened so she told
her roommate and discovered that he actually had the same experience on the same night as Elizabeth says he woke up
frightened and on the floor the room was filled with the whitish blue light and a tall hooded figure was hovering above
him he was scared out of his mind and wondered what the heck is going on that
was the only encounter reported by the witnesses though Elizabeth does admit as a small child she had seen similar
unexplained lights next case after midnight night June 20th 2001 a high
school student and his mother sat on the porch of their Tucson home watching the Stars the student says he was actually
thinking about what it would be like to see a UFO and aliens when suddenly his
mother pointed to something floating just above the trees student looked and saw a humanoid
figure with dark skin it was he realized the alien he had just made a wish to see
as the student says the alien seemed like it knew we were looking at it and started floating in small circles in the
air I felt like the alien had made eye contact with me from this distance as
soon as I blinked the creature disappeared out of the sky now they never saw any UFO but the student does
report that following the sighting his life changed quote in a lot of different
ways and he insists that this was quote a real event here is a amazing case
March 2007 a woman her husband and son were watching a spring training baseball game
in Tucson immediately adjacent to the game Davis monin Air Force Base was
having an air show and looking up the woman was surprised to see a metallic disc hovering as if watching the air
show and she sent out a telepathic message to this UFO saying I see you she
turned to her husband and son and pointed out the object and all three of them watched it for several minutes when
suddenly it disappeared strangely nobody else seemed to notice it so they watched
the rest of the game returned home and that evening the woman says she was woken up by quote a lime green light in
my face said this light was rectangular seemed to contain strange glowing
symbols she looked at her husband who was sleeping soundly next to her and as
she says I then looked slightly to the left at the foot of my bed and saw that
there were three small people standing there so that frightened her she looked away wrapped her arms around her husband
and fell asleep so she did not see these beings leave the next morning she and her son went to the car they found a
strange hand pin print with three fingers and a thumb on the car and at
that moment they turned to the west and saw a quote very very bright white light
as the witness says I put my arm around my son and leted him back into the house
and the son then told her that something had woken him up last night she didn't
ask what her son had seen but she did call her daughter who lived out of state to share the story and her daughter said
Mom you aren't going to believe this but there was a green light in my room for just a fraction of a second so several
years later the woman reported this experience to new Fork writing I do not drink or take drugs and I'm not crazy
the story you've is my account of the events that occurred to the best of my
recollection one final case from Tucson involving humanoids on July 4th
2004 a man suffering from renal cancer said he was unable to sleep and at 3:30
a.m. he decided to take his golf court around the local golf course he was climbing a small hill in the golf cart
when he noticed a yellow blue red light a strange feeling came over him and
moving closer he saw that this light was actually coming from a landed craft and
as the witnesses says as I hit the top of the hill everything stopped like time
stopped I told myself this is a dream now was at this point he saw quote
things which were walking around and examining the wild pigs that roam the golf course at night and the next thing
he remembers is quote I woke up on the ground and my golf cart was parked where
I had seen the craft I don't remember anything else sounds like missing time
to me all right there you go Cliff No Doubt Tucson has been visited many many
times I think part of the reason I found so many cases is because there were some very prominent researchers who were
based in that area including of course Jim and coral Lorenzen Wendell Stevens
and Dr James McDonald and again just the tip of the
iceberg now let's move to the next location which is montere California
this is by special request of a couple of you out there including Jenny as well
as Jovan Lopez and yes Monterey California delivered some amazing
accounts one of the first significant Monterey California sightings occurred
at 7 a.m. on April 10 1950 when at least seven Witnesses reported seeing a quote
bright chromik Flying Saucer now some of the Witnesses were actually policemen
and one of them Ted cross was driving a prisoner to jail when he saw it and as
he says was definitely some kind of aircraft but not local in fact nothing
like anything seen in this world before it was a spinning circular object
he said it was about 4,000 ft High maybe 30 ft wide and his prisoner a delinquent
girl also spoke with the press and said I guess it's just one of those days now
to his credit Deputy Ted cross radioed in the sighting in time for two other
officers to also see it also seeing the object was a Greyhound bus driver and a
gas station attendant Army Intelligence Officers arrived from nearby Fort or to
question the police officers and they revealed something kind of interesting they told him that the Army required
them to carry cameras on their person in case a UFO showed up four days after
this event the UFOs returned was 6:35 p.m. April 14 1950 when a UFO described
as quote a circular object definitely not an aircraft was moving in a zigzag
course actually following a train between Watsonville and Castroville one of the witnesses an
electrical engineer by the name of ab B Baldwin said that this craft was at about 3,000 ft elevation and would
sometimes dart out towards the ocean at 700 maybe a th000 milph before turning
back to the train he says it looked to be about 30 to 40 ft in diameter next
case 17 years later November 4 1967 just after midnight a farmer says that a 100t
wide craft hovered above his farm located just southeast of
montere he wased it as it suddenly shot out Flames as it made a sudden sharp
turn and moved out of sight case after case here's another the night of October
16 1973 numerous calls came into the police reporting
UFOs one witness was Peter Hara and his two friends who saw a object they
described as round glowing with blue green light and about the size of a large Cadillac they said it was moving
silently just over Canary row so low it barely cleared the buildings and then
actually Dove down even lower behind a restaurant and moved out of sight they
ran to see if they could still see it but it was gone that same night however Sergeant Ken froberg of Marin City said
he saw an object described his quote blue green he said it raced through the
sky also seeing apparently the same object was Deputy John brunsick here is
an amazing case very well investigated coming from Dev rugy of mufan this
occurred in August of 1973 right over Fort Hunter liot Army
base in Monteray the witness is known only as Thomas H he's a recording
engineer one evening he was with his wife on the base on the evening in question when they saw no less than five
kind of diamond shaped objects and one was quite close about 250 ft away all
were perfectly silent identical in appearance each was sort of a dull metallic gray and had a row of soft
white yellow oval Windows around the perimeter and they were spinning slowly
counterclockwise a very interesting case because it's there was a another
incident at the same area the same time could be the same one which was reported
by a physicist by the name of Arthur Newman who says that while conducting
laser tests at the base a craft showed up now according to him one of these
craft was disabled by the laser and crashed you can take this case for what
it's worth but he says that small childlike humanoids with bald heads were
captured along with the Dead and he says that the UFO movie
wavelength was actually based on this incident one evening in 1974 three
residents of an apartment building located at 316 vanban Street all called
the police to report their sightings of no less than eight groups of 4 to8
objects all moving in a V formation overhead Christoper p on of apartment 7
and Gerald and de Lee Culver of Apartment 9 called the police after seeing these egg-shaped objects which
they said were glowing blue green flying from south to North right over the
coastline and going from Horizon to Horizon in 3 to 5 seconds so very fast
here's another case which comes from muon October 15 2017 the witness described a very fast
moving UFO and as he says it looked to be cylinder shaped pulsating light blue and white in
color almost transparent the case was investigated by Nancy Felipe muon field
investigator and she declared it unknown and the witness was most impressed by how the object seemed to blend in with
the Clear Blue Sky almost camouflaged there you go that's just a little
insight and to probably the much larger number of cases taking place in montere
again just a representative sample by no means all the activity that's going on there but thank you Jenny thank you
jovon super interesting to me the most interesting case in montere was the one
over the Fort Hunter leot Air Force Base army base so
interesting and now we move to the last location in this compilation and that is RAM UK and I
forgot to write down who requested this location but you know who you are so
sorry but thank you for providing it it's really interesting I love going
outside of the US terms of investigating because it does prove the point that UFOs are being seen worldwide definitely
some very unusual and interesting cases here reaching far back into history up to the current day so thank you whoever
are for providing Ram UK the first Ram case occurred very early this was the
winter of 1937 the witness known only as by his initials r o says he was walking his dog
when he noticed a strange figure running at very high speed down a steep slope
faster than a person could run now his dog did not react at first but then the
figure ran straight through a fence blocking its way and moved so close to the witness that he could have reached
out and touched it the witness said this figure was just over 5T tall covered
with hair and he says the hands and feet looked more like a goat than anything
else had a weird pointed head and after passing by the witness it ran up a steep
slope at which point the dog did react it turned and looked at the figure and
immediately turned around to go back home the witness says he felt a compulsion to follow this strange being
but instead returned home and when he did his mom replied you look as if
you've seen the devil to which he replied I have so perhaps this is some
weird Spirit or something and not UFO is at all either way certainly unexplained
and interesting now here are some really interesting cases in RAM on September 7
1977 dozens of people reported their site of a quote Flying Saucer hovering
above their homes located in Dear Valley one witness Lillian Hudson said and I
quote quite a few people came out to look including a number of children who were all excited and flashing torches at
it my son rushed in to tell me about it and I thought he was pulling my leg at first but when I went out I was amazed
to see this peculiar looking object with lights flashing on and off but no noise
I am confident it wasn't a helicopter or plane another witness was amateur
astronomer Nigel Palmer who said that over the past 3 months he had seen mysterious objects get this more than 90
times for years later April 1981 calls flooded into numerous police stations
when people across a wide variety of locations of course including Ram
reported seeing blue green orange and white flaming lights coming downward a
Sheffield man said he actually heard one of them as it crashed to the ground now
the official explanation from Eastland Midlands Airport was that this was probably falling space debris hard to
say for sure but it certainly caught the attention of a lot of people that same
year but in January a school boy said he saw a green
object with streaks of red and blue and silver haze around it hovering in place
for 20 minutes he called out his mother too who also saw it same year only
November 13 1981 a professional driver David Green
was driving down wly road towards mboro when he saw what he described as two star-like objects but as he says they
were way too bright to be stars and they were stationary and therefore were not Aeroplane lights so the lights
disappeared after 5 minutes another witness in a nearby area said he saw
what it's apparently the same thing but he described this as a single object sort of dumbbell shaped with a bright
light on each end another witness Jeffrey gray said
they were just like two car headlights but much brighter and farther apart there were several other Witnesses too
so something was in the sky that night 6 years later September 1987 a welder by
the name of Mark Jones and his wife noticed this strange object which was flashing red and green and white lights
as Mark says I couldn't make out any shape but as we watched a white object came out from between the lights and
flew off at speed it was really shifting whatever it was we were watching it was
not an ordinary aircraft because it stayed in one place for at least 25
minutes so she the wife decided to rush inside to call the police and the second
the police answered the object vanished which really freaked out Mrs Jones as
Mark Jones says it really put the wind up my wife if someone had told me what I'm telling you I would probably have
said they were crackers but I'm no Looney and we both know what we saw
here's another very interesting case November 1987 a 16-year-old man who was staying
at the rush house for foster kids he and his friend had gone outside to
beg a pint of milk from the Milkman when they saw something they could hardly believe as the main witness says in the
corner of my eye I saw something hovering silently about 20 ft above the
ground higher than the traffic lights outside the railway Club on Doncaster
Road it was above us so we could see the underside of it was about the size of a
small articulated Lorry so so he said it was triangular shaped had a green light
on each Corner was hovering just above the traffic lights before slowly moving off and as the witness says my life
changed from this day because I know we are not alone in this universe now one
year later in January of 1988 a huge series of sightings occurred
over rotham that prompted dozens of RAF planes and helicopters to fly over the
area in response people were seeing all kinds of objects which they described
variously as bell-shaped or ball-shaped cross-shaped and more a lot of sightings
in fact in February 2nd of that year a large number of people including police
officers described what they saw as a v-shaped object covered with colored
lights again right over Ro room one week later it was apparently seen again near
barnesley here's a case that got all kinds of of attention just a month or two
later the witness was Jim Wilson and he saw this very small unidentified object
literally bouncing down the street this was in April of 1988 and as he says was
about a foot wide and was shaped like a football was the oddest thing I've ever seen and I must admit it was certainly
frightening at first so he walked towards it very curious and was amazed
to watch this thing just fizzle and disappear hard to say what that was just
a few more sightings on the evening of December 1st 1997 Bruce be was outside his roam home
when he saw a quote fiery green orange thing this was in the sky moving from
left to right at a downward angle and had flames on it not a whole lot of info on how far away or how long this
sighting land what lasted could it be a meteor hard to say for sure but he
reported it as a UFO now here's another kind of iffy case 2 a April 30th 2000 a
witness was at his home on morn Road in wickersley he was unable to sleep
watching TV when he heard a droning sound coming from outside and getting louder and louder and going outside saw
an object covered with lights passed no more than 100 to 100 feet over his house
or perhaps lower because he described it at one point as being just about the height of telephone poles he couldn't
see the shaped of of the object but based on the lights he estimated it was about 30 to 40 ft wide bigger than a
house it did sound to him like a plane but he says it was so low far too low to
be a plane he still thinks it might have been a plane but one was never identified so technically it remains an
unknown this next case is far more unusual could not be a plane this
occurred one year later August 10 2001 in the Eastwood area of rotheram the
witness Paul Garner age 42 and his son Ryan age 21 are the witnesses they were
out walking their dog when they saw two unusual lights with a weird glowing
Central column between them but the most unusual thing was the way this object
moved as the witness Paul says what struck us as very odd was the central
pillar which swung like a clock pendulum but not as rapid so they watched it for
about 2 minutes it was completely silent and suddenly the lights just went out
weirdly they could still see this object against the dark sky as it slowly moved out of sight and important here Paul is
an amateur astronomer had a keen interest in UFOs and remained convinced
that he saw something very unusual as he says I am making no claims that this was
an alien craft but it certainly was of an unusual nature there you go
definitely UFOs being seen in Ram UFOs are being seen everywhere I
think this episode alone should be enough to convince Skeptics anywhere uh
no matter how thick skinned or vement they are that UFOs don't exist that question is now been answered they do
exist you can argue about what they might be where they're coming from why
they're here but the fact is there are too many reports to ignore to explain
away as hoaxes hallucinations misperceptions mental illness no way
these things are 100% real and I'm absolutely convinced we're being visited
by extraterrestrials having had my own experiences having done research for so
many decades now to me there's no question at all that we are not alone in
this universe and that our planet is being visited so thank you once again I really
appreciate you guys watching and yeah if you have a location you'd like me to
check out I'm happy to put it on my list but you're going to have to be patient because I am only around the 40s of a
list of over 500 locations and I'm committed to this
this is a very difficult research project this takes a lot more work than some of my other episodes but I'm
committed to it I really want to prove to everyone out there not only Are UFOs
real not only are we being visited by ETS but they are covering this entire
planet I think they do have a mission to announce their presence and let all of
us know that we are not alone in this universe so yeah thank you again again
truly appreciated love you all and until next time keep asking those hard questions cuz it's up to you also keep
searching for the truth because it is out there and most important of all keep
having fun I really think that's why we're here and until next
time I will see you later be well bye
