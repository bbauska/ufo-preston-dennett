VISITORS TO EARTH: TEN INCREDIBLE HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Aug 30, 2024

Summary:
Aug 30, 2024
Despite what skeptics may claim, or any denials from our own govts, the thousands of firsthand cases of close encounters with humanoids speak for themselves: we are being visited by extraterrestrials. These visitors to Earth have been coming for a very long time. This video presents ten incredible humanoid encounters from many locations including France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, Argentina, and the United States. Evidence such as landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and radar returns prove that these visitors to Earth are very real indeed.

THE ALIEN IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT. At 6:35 am on April 3, 1948, driver Giuseppe Lanciano waited for the arrival of a train at San Martino, Italy. Suddenly his attention was drawn to a disc-shaped object, glowing orange, which zoomed silently overhead. He was joined by another witness and both watched as a beam came out of the bottom, carrying a short robotic-looking humanoid.

WENDY AND THE ALIENS. Early one morning in June of 1949, Wanda M’s father came running into their home in Dunino, Poland shouting that a strange craft had landed in their yard. He, their neighbors, and Wanda ran outside to see two humanoids in jumpsuits standing next to a large silver-brown, cone-shaped object. The beings spoke a strange language, gestured, and then returned to their craft. It took off, leaving behind landing traces.

ALMOST ABDUCTED. On the night of February 5, 1967, Timothy J. (age 15) was drawn outside his home in Hilliard, Ohio by a weird sound, and the barking of his dog. He was shocked to see a 75-foot-long craft fly by and land in a field. He watched as several figures came out and placed small spheres on the ground. Then Timothy stepped on a twig and the men heard him, came running and tried to pull him onto the craft.

A UFO IN THE BACKYARD. At 8:15 pm on July 20, 1967, Elizabeth Douglas stepped outside her home in Titusville, Florida and saw a 60-foot wide, bell-shaped craft floating silently overhead. Looking through one of the windows, she saw the silhouette of a large-headed, skinny figure looking down at her. She called out her daughter who also saw it. Inside, her son Steven wondered why his TV suddenly malfunctioned.

I KNOW WHAT I SAW. One morning in the summer of 1972, “Patricia,” (age 13,) was sitting in the backseat of the family car as they drove south of Molong, Australia when she saw a saucer-shaped craft sitting alongside the highway. Three 7-foot-tall silver-suited humanoids stood next to it, collecting samples. One looked directly at her as their car drove by.

THE ALIEN AND THE SNOWMOBILER. On the evening of February 26, 1973, Helene R, her brothers and friends were finishing up a day of snowmobiling in the McWatters area of Quebec, Canada, when a brilliant object zoomed overhead. While the others raced off, Helene was left alone. The strange craft returned and apparently landed. Helene then had a very scary encounter with a short humanoid.

THE GIANT HUMANOID. On the night of July 1, 1979, four teenage boys went hunting in the mountains near their homes in Sangonera La Verde, Spain. Suddenly a UFO blocked their way. They watched it for an hour when suddenly a 7-8 foot-tall humanoid wearing shiny tight-fitting clothes began to approach. The boys zoomed away in fear. They returned to town as they and others watched the UFO dart away.

“I AM CERTAIN THAT I SAW AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT.” On the night of January 4, 1994, the Noel family of Evreux, France reported their encounter with a black, triangular object. A few hours later, Didier Maury of Bacqueville had a scary encounter with a glowing cone-shaped object and an apparent humanoid. Hours after that, the Lopez family watched a UFO land next to their home and humanoids come out of it. These are only a few of an amazing series of events that occurred on that night and afterward.

THE ET IN THE PALM PLANTATION. One evening in April 2008, a man saw a UFO drop from the sky and into the Palm tree plantation near his home in Bankinang, Indonesia. Hopping on his motorbike to investigate, he was shocked to come upon a 6-foot-tall humanoid with a bald head, pointed ears, a skinny body and long arms dressed only in underwear and standing a short distance away. It quickly vanished.

THE MAGNETIC MAN. On the night of May 21, 2008, Walter Lopez and Omar Ferlatti were in a field near San Carlos, Salta, Argentina when they saw a tiny two-foot-tall humanoid figure wearing strange clothes standing nearby. They tried to get closer but were repelled by some kind of magnetic field. It turned out another person also saw the humanoid, and numerous people in the area were reporting UFOs.

Ten humanoid encounters, each adding to the catalog of thousands of similar cases, each providing more evidence that our planet is being visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrial humanoids.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. Today's episode
is called, "Visitors to Earth: 10 Incredible Humanoid Encounters". These are 
all true firsthand eyewitness accounts coming from all over the planet actually
I've got cases from France Italy Spain and Poland as well as Australia and
Indonesia Canada Argentina and a couple from the United States these cases did
all the way back to 1948 up to 2008 so quite a long period of time there and a
wide variety of ETS everything from tiny little humanoids to short humanoids
Grays human looking ETS robotic beings a real wide variety of humanoids and of
course all kinds of evidence to support it seven out of 10 of these cases are in fact multiple witness cases that always
strengthens The credibility of a case but some of these cases also involve
physiological evidence or Landing traces animal reactions electromagnetic
disturbances and one case even has radar returns to support it so some pretty
good cases here uh some really interesting ones as well I'm pretty sure
you haven't heard of most of these but let's just get started in the first C case I'd like to talk about today I
call the alien in the beam of light this occurred on April 3rd 1948 in San
Martino Italy I like this case because it's a multiple in this case it occurred
very early long before UFOs were widely publicized and it's just got some really
interesting aspects to it in terms of the ET
humanoid especially this case comes from Italian researcher Solas ban and was
published in his book UFOs in Italy it occurred at 6:35 a.m. on April 3rd
1948 as taxi bus driver JPI lanciano was waiting for the 7:00 train whose arrival
had been delayed he was waiting at toll booth number 14 in Farah D signno this
is in the city of San Martino Italy suddenly a strange glowing orange
circular-shaped object appeared overhead he said it was shaped kind of like an upside down bowl or quote an open
umbrella without a handle it quickly moved overhead at about 60 km per hour
and then hovered about 10 m above a hill only 500 M away so pretty close and it
hovered there for several minutes glowing with light it was long enough for him to estimate
the diameter of the object which he believed was about 10 to 15 m in
diameter he said it also had a little quote cup sort of shaped protrusion on
top which looked transparent as it was glowing with a silvery light so it
looked to jepi like this object was about to land on the hill and seeing how
unusual it was he immediately called it to the attention of the station master a
Mr bavota who was talking on the phone nearby and they both watched this object
for some time when suddenly a beam of very bright white light came out of the
bottom center of the object and they were close enough to it that they could actually feel heat coming from this beam
of light then in this beam of light was a humanoid form but definitely not a
normal human they estimated it was about 1.5 M tall for 4 and 1/2 5 ft its
posture was strangely rigid its arms were outstretched it looked to them like it
was wearing a metallic reflective suit of some kind with thick gloves and
instead of a face all they could see were two circles two big round circles where the eyes were it kind of reminded
the witnesses of a puppet they said it floated very slowly very evenly to the
ground and at this point jei became quite curious he had no fear so he
decided he was going to run up to it which he did and as soon as he started running towards this this being this
robotic type creature started to float back up into the craft it entered inside
of it the beam retracted the craft oscillated back and forth for a few
moments and then zoomed silently and upwards at an incredibly high speed so
it's certainly a pretty brief case but quite compelling a brief case certainly
but definitely compelling with the multiple Witnesses and again because it occurred
quite early in the history of you know the Modern Age of UFOs and I also found it interesting the
way these Witnesses described the humanoid that they saw there's just some
interesting elements to that case of a visitation in a pretty small town and
now we move to another case which is even more interesting I think I call this one Wendy and the aliens this
occurred in June of 1949 in dunino Poland we don't hear a lot about cases
from Poland so I think that alone makes this interesting but this is another multiple witness account it has Landing
traces as well what I find most interesting about this is that they had never heard of UFOs and didn't even
consider the possibility that they were seeing possibly extraterrestrials until
many years later this very interesting case comes from polish researcher Daman
tra and It's featured in his book secrets of lower Silesia this is written
in Polish but it was a warm morning around 500 a.m. in June of
1949 as the main witness Wanda M she's 7 years old heard her uncle mall and her
neighbor Bartholome run into the house terrified and shouting that quote something had landed
in Bartholomew's field so Wanda's father woke up and all three men still dressed
in their pajamas ran out of the house and into the field to take a closer look
meanwhile Wanda's mother also woke up along of course with Wanda and Wanda
followed the three men into the field her mother was too afraid she stood outside of the house afraid to get any
closer so Wanda joined her father and the other two men and immediately they all saw a
bright yellow light coming from the bottom of a very large object which had landed in their field in fact they all
walked up to no more than 10 ft away from this object which they said was sort of silver brown in color was
cone-shaped and it was emitting a slight whoosing noise it had what appeared to
be two rows of rectangular windows going up the side of the cone and these
windows were em emitting a silver tinged yellow light the thinnest part of the
cone was at the top and the thickest was at the base a band encircled the base of the object which was about 6 feet high
and they could see an indentation visible at the base from which small steps led to the ground this object was
landing on three sort of Landing legs which came from the lower section and
out to the ground at an angle it was about this object maybe four to five
feet wide at the base and about twice the height of a normal person so not
huge but certainly not that small either beneath the cone they could see a blue
yellow light shining out at an angle and it was strange because while it was shining out it wasn't actually touching
the ground but most amazing however were these two figures standing there they were wearing
coveralls and when the witnesses approached the figures appeared to sort of unfasten the coveralls in the neck
area and lift a hood which revealed a sort of transparent face plate there
also appeared to be a darker covering underneath the outer suit and it looked
like it had a stripe down the center Front from chin to Naval these figures
were about six feet tall and they looked human in appearance very wellb built
with large feet they had five fingers on each hand so pretty much human looking
now these figures began to speak in a foreign unrecognizable language to the witnesses
so it was neither polish it wasn't Russian or German because they spoke those languages but they did not
recognize this language it did seem to the witnesses that these figures were asking a question or trying to show them
something so the men asked these guys if they wanted something to eat or drink
but there was no response the figures did continue to make gestures for a period of about 10 minutes which is a
pretty long time at some point they did sort of Point towards the nearby towns
of kis and leika but apparently unable to make themselves
understood they put their hands on their chest bowed slightly and then turned
turned towards the object now at this point the area where the in indentation
was at the base of this object this opened up to reveal a door and this is when the witnesses saw a third figure
inside the object the two figures bowed again signaled the witnesses to step
back and then climb the steps into this cone shaped object they noticed that the door was
small enough that the figures actually had to hunch down to enter inside of it so they went inside the steps retracted
and the opening closed and then the object began to make a noise similar to
quote a heavy downpour at this point a brilliant light came out of the base of the object which
rose vertically just a short distance and then flew away in a gentle curve
towards the town of leika So after talking about this incident they returned to the house
where they did find Wanda's mother waiting and nervously weeping because
she thought that this incident heralded another invasion of their country in
fact all the witnesses at this point assumed that the figures that they had seen were normal humans from some
foreign country on a reconnaissance mission of some kind and it would be years later when Wanda the
seven-year-old heard about UFOs that she changed her mind about this and decided
it was more likely that these visitors may have been extraterrestrial in
origin there was one other thing that's quite interesting after this craft departed they found an area of yellowed
and crushed vegetation about 2 to 3 m in diameter where this craft had stood and
it remained there for 2 to 3 years in fact when grain was planted in the field
it failed to grow where the craft had stud I like the cases with Landing traces there's often Skeptics saying
there's no physical evidence supporting this subject and the truth is there is
quite a lot of it it's certainly not easy to fake and it's one of the more
compelling types of evidence out there but when you have multiple Witnesses who are that close to a landed UFO in
humanoids it's undeniable that something really profound is happening here and there's
always another case to take its place and if even one of these were true that would be amazing but the fact is there's
thousands upon thousands upon thousands and here's another one which I call almost abducted this took place on
February 5 1967 in hilard Ohio which is
a pretty small town especially back then this is a single witness case though it
does have some pretty interesting evidence to it it was also investigated
by experienced researchers from the national investigative committee of aerial phenomenon this case comes from
researcher step Macky who was associated with naikap and he conducted a telephone
interview with the w witness and also published the case in The nightcap
publication UFO investigator he called it one of the most incredible cases that they had
received during this time it was the evening of February 5
1967 when the witness 15-year-old Timothy J was outside his home in hilard
Ohio and he heard a strange noise at the same time his dog started barking
looking up he saw an egg shaped craft about 75 ft long 45 ft High coming in at
low altitude over the shoulder of a nearby Road and as he watched this craft
landed in a field not too far away coming to a rest on three Landing legs
so after this craft landed he moved closer to it and watched and saw this
elevator like shaft appear and several human looking figures come out of it
each of them were carrying small spheres which they began to place on the ground
around the ship near the sides of this craft the witness did notice something else Timothy said that each of these
beings walked with quote a slight limp he did not describe how they were
dressed but after doing this these figures appeared to just stand around the craft as if waiting for something
and it was shortly later a man appeared walking across the field up to these figures and it looked to Timothy like
they were holding a telepathic conversation in fact Timothy said that they had a quote hypnotic look about
them so was at this point that Timothy accidentally stepped on a twig which
made a loud snapping noise and this immediately caught the attention of the figures standing around the craft and
all of them turned to look at him now this naturally frightened Timothy quite
badly and he tried to run away but one of the figures who Timothy sensed was the leader actually ran after him and
caught him by the back of the neck stopping Timothy in his tracks immediately a second figure joined him
and the two of them dragged the frightened Timothy up to their craft and they almost reached the door and
appeared to about pull him inside when says
Timothy the humanoids looked at each other with what he perceived to be a panic-stricken look they immediately
dropped him they quickly gathered up the Spheres that they had placed around the craft and retreated with them back into
the UFO which promptly took off Timothy noticed at this point that the back of
his neck had a little burn mark where he had been grabbed and he reported this
incident to authorities and he says that he was actually visited by an unnamed
Air Force officer who investigated the incident and confirmed the burn mark on his neck Timothy then wrote a letter to
naikap and he was put in touch with the investigator Steven Mackey what an
unusual case that is you don't hear a lot of cases quite like that I also find
it interesting that the witness says he was interviewed by Air Force officials
unfortunately the investigators were not able to confirm that and there is no real follow-up on this case but
certainly a compelling case of a UFO landing and humanoids and now we move to another
really interesting case that got a lot of attention actually because the witness is quite
credible I call this one a UFO in the backyard it is actually a multiple
witness case which occurred on July 1967 in Titusville Florida one of the
most interesting things about this case is the location which is not far actually from Kennedy Space Center so
that could be a factor here this case was also investigated by naikap the national investigative committee for
aerial phenomena more specifically by Clark mcleland the primary witness is
Elizabeth L Douglas who at the time of the incident was 49 years years old was
around 8:15 p.m. on July 20 1967 and she had stepped out of her home
in Titusville Florida to get something out of her car which was parked out in front of her house recently a
neighborhood boy had mowed her lawn and had scattered part of the fence all over the lawn and unfortunately Elizabeth
tripped over it and fell down and as she reached out to grab a nearby branch and
pull herself up to a standing position she looked to the north and was amazed
to see a large bell-shaped craft approaching from the North she said it was only about 200 ft away and quite
large 60 to 70 ft high in the sky totally silent she estimated it was
about 50 to 60 ft long it had five squarish port holes visible around the
edge of this craft and it moved slowly towards her and looked she said quote
bigger than the house AC Ross the street and in fact it moved over the street opposite her house and this is when she
noticed something that quite frightened her she could see a humanoid form inside
Through the Windows actually more than one as she says there were other forms
moving about but I did not Mo notice this as much as the form close to the
window I could not tell if this form was trying to look out of the window or if
he was doing something else but I did notice that he looked very lean and the arms were very long the humanoid form
appeared to be leaning forward with one or both hands pressing against the transparent glass-like window she said
that this being appeared to be looking out of the window to scan the terrain she wasn't sure but this thoroughly
frightened her because this being did not appear to be human as Elizabeth says in her own words the creature had
rubbery arms that's seemed to be longer than those normally observed on mature men or women the Torso was slim and
showed no midsection or chest structure the head of the entity was egg-shaped
and no facial features such as eyes nose mouth or ears were visually
evident so looking at the other Port holes briefly she saw that they glowed
unevenly with some being much brighter than others some were bright enough to illuminate at the outside of the craft
which she said appeared to be sort of a dull finished metal one window was almost completely dark but through the
illuminated Windows she could see quote shadowy movements indicating that other
life forms were engaged in motion somewhere inside the strange craft so
she called out for her daughter and as Elizabeth's daughter ingred age2 came
outside Elizabeth also called out to her other son Steven he 15 years old but he
was watching TV inside and didn't respond as ingred joined her mother and
looked up she also saw the UFO and very startled shouted out what is that at
this point Her Mother Elizabeth was too frightened to even respond and by this point she had already been watching this
UFO and this entity for a full two minutes and for the next five minutes
both she and ingred watched this craft at this point Elizabeth now ran inside
to call the Titusville police department and she informed them that this craft was still outside told them its current
location its speed and the direction it was moving they told her that they would
send an officer to investigate meanwhile her son Steven was still watching TV but
he noticed something pretty unusual and perhaps important these weird horizontal
lines started passing through the screen of the picture tube at this point the UFO moved off and was gone so Elizabeth
and ingred were put in touch with nightcap researcher Clark mcleland who along with other researchers questioned
both of the witnesses extensively and they came away absolutely convinced that they had seen a genuine UFO and its
occupant or occupants as Clark mclen says and I quote it is the opinion of this
investigative unit that due to the sincerity of each witness this incident
should be considered factual as far as personal observation and understanding
of the unidentified object are concerned by those involved there's been no concrete evidence found to prove this
case to be a perpetrated hoax so researcher Gordon lore called it quote
one of the most interesting and compelling cases which had been received during this very active 1967 wave and
and Gordon added that this case quote added to our growing collection of
reliable Witnesses who are having encounters with humanoid like flying saucer
occupants and again it's quite interesting that the location of this sighting is only about 25 miles away
from the Kennedy Space Center the investigators were clearly impressed
with this case the Witnesses are quite credible has electromagnetic evidence as
well with the T TV becoming full of static to me perhaps the most interesting thing is its proximity to
Kennedy Space Center which certainly could be a factor because there are a number of cases on record where ETS do
seem to show an interest in our technology and rocket launches and
things like this so who knows it's speculation but it could very well be
and now we move to our next case which I call I know what I saw this occurred in
the summer of 1972 in Mong Australia it is technically a single witness case and
it wasn't professionally investigated but it's a daylight case of a landing and humanoids seen very close up and
it's a really interesting eyewitness testimony as well the witness in this
case is anonymous but I'll call her Patricia and she reported her experience to both muon the mutual UFO Network and
newfork the National UFO Reporting Center it took her many years to do so
she kept quiet about it for quite some time she says the date of the incident is approximate but it was one morning
around 7:30 a.m. in either August or September of
1972 at the time Patricia was a 13-year-old student and she was being driven by her mother to school along
with two other passengers who were going to work they were driving from Mo molong to the city of Orange this is again in
Australia and they were about 5 kilomet East of mulong when Patricia who was
sitting in the back seat noticed a very bright glow in the distance on top of a
small hill not far from the road now she assumed that this was the reflection of
the morning sun on a new Tin Roof she lost sight of it briefly as the road
curved but as they approached closer she saw it again and she saw that it was not
a new Tin Roof it was something quite different and very strange as Patricia says in her own
words I noticed a very large object about the size of a large shipping container in length and about twice as
wide and one and a half containers tall on either side humanoid beings were
standing holding something in the middle one humanoid was walking towards the
fence line the road was about 20 ft beyond the fence as I looked at the
humanoid he appeared to look back at me while he was walking to the fence line so these were definitely not normal
humans according to Patricia these beings looked quite tall at least 6 feet
she thinks they were probably closer to 7 feet tall one was holding a sort of tablet or book like object it appeared
to be watching the traffic and it looked to her like it was almost taking notes or something the object itself was
glowing with a very bright fluorescent likee aura this object was oval or saucer shaped
had a very smooth surface a dome on top and it sat on Landing legs only three of
which were visible to the witness but she suspects there were four was parked right between two dead trees she said a
ramp extended from the center of this object to the ground and yeah these
figures were not normal as Patricia said the humanoids were wearing what looked
like a metallic dull silvery colored suit similar to a wet suit from head to
toe tight fitting the headwear looked like a full face mask but with no protrusions like it was fitting over the
head and face in one piece the suits themselves glowed like the craft or
reflecting the sun intensely the face plates or visors appeared to be dark or
black but Patricia was very much intrigued and puzzled by what she was seeing especially this figure who was
closest to her and was walking at a slow pace towards the fence line and the road
the other Figures were just standing around the craft she had the impression they were there to keep guard now
Patricia was so stunned by this she wanted to call out to her mother and the other passengers but as she says for
some reason I didn't it was like a feeling that I shouldn't say anything because it felt wrong it looked like
they were collecting things and looking at the cars going past I am sure the one walking down to the
road saw me as he turned his helmet and followed our car with his blackl looking
visor now there was other traffic on the road but nobody else seemed to be reacting to this strange site but as
Patricia says I still remember it like it was yesterday I know what I saw and
to this day I can show you exactly where they were I see it now as if it was only
yesterday unfortunately that case wasn't professionally investigated but
certainly is compelling and I think when someone sees something that close up the
chances of misidentification are pretty much zero as she says I know what I saw and this
is certainly a quote a lot of witnesses say it must be quite an experience to
see something that close up and know that this is really unusual
all right now let's move to our next case a really interesting case this one I call the alien and the snowmobiler
this is a multiple witness case it occurred on February 26th 1973 in mcwaters this is in Quebec
Canada and it's a really compelling case again multiple Witnesses and Landing
trace evidence this very unusual case comes from Canadian researcher Ferguson
and was published in his popular book written in French Le human noad or the
humanoids the main witness is known only as helain R she's 14 years old and she
was out enjoying a day of snowmobiling with her two brothers and seven teenage
friends in the mcwaters area of Quebec Canada they had been out all day and it
was now around 8:00 p.m. this is again February 26th 1973
and everyone was riding around on their own individual snowmobiles when all of them suddenly saw a giant quote light
Rise Up from behind them and pass directly over the group it was so bright it illuminated the whole landscape
around them and then it moved on once it was gone the boys didn't think too much
about it and decided to race each other and 14-year-old helain was left behind
and this is when suddenly this strange glowing object reappeared flew back over
her and behind her Hela estimates it was quite large about 60 ft in diameter
suddenly the illumination from this object went out and Hela wondered if perhaps it was a plane that had crashed
somewhere behind her so she decided to turn around and go investigate she went back about 500 ft
got off her snowmobile and started walking towards this large dark bulky
object which she could just make Out Among the trees and she had approached to about within 50 ft of it when without
warning a hand reached out from behind her grabbed her and tried to drag her
backwards at this point helain assumed it was her younger brother playing a joke so she broke free from whoever had
grabbed her and pushed them down into the snow and turning around to face them
boy she got a shock because she saw what she first assumed was a small child
smaller than her 13-year-old brother it was sitting in the snow and she could see no this was not a child she quickly
ran back to her snowmobile just a short distance away and grabbed a flashlight and shown it on the figure to get a
better look this figure at this point had risen up and was now walking slowly towards her and sure enough it wasn't
another child it was a humanoid figure just under 4T tall wearing dark tight
fit clothing with a strange quote plated surface it also wore a helmet that
covered his head down to the chin this helmet had a visor which reflected the light but she could see this being's
face and was surprised to see that it had enormous eyes that seemed to shine
brightly in the light like a cats does this figure did seem to have some
difficulty walking in the snow she noticed but this scared her badly she
dropped her flashlight ran to her snowmobile hopped on it and fled the area she immediately found her family
and friends and together they went home because as it turned out helain had a weird symptom her left arm appeared to
be paralyzed she couldn't move it she was taken to a doctor who gave her a sedative and as far as I can tell this
was a temporary thing but the next day several people went back to the place
where Helen had seen this humanoid and in fact they found a large patch of snow
which was melted down to the ground it was dut shaped and about 50 ft wide
which matches what helain saw in terms of this object and next to it were two
sets of very small bipedal tracks they were short but quite broad with a large
protruding big toe when you have that many witnesses when you have Landing
trace evidence and appar parent Footprints it's really hard to explain this away it's something mundane it's a
really compelling case and there are so many like it it's really interesting to
me that this ET actually reached out and touched the witness that's pretty unusual though that happened in the
previous case in hilard Ohio so this does happen and here's another really
interesting case which I call the giant humanoid another multip witness case
which occurred on July 1st 1979 in sanguna La Verde this is in
Spain actually and it's quite a compelling case with four Witnesses
actually more who saw the UFO itself but a very close-up encounter with a very
strange humanoid this next case was published by AER gimenez in his book and
also by Francisco J Sarabia in the magazine stendek and by Albert Rosales
who published the case in his book there are four Witnesses Antonio gu CIO age 16
his cousin Jose CIO age 14 and their two friends gz jimz AR and Jesus both aged
17 it was about a half an hour after midnight and they decided to go out on their motorbikes along the dirt roads of
Sanga La Verde this is in meria Spain and they were looking for turtle dove
nests this is out in the mountains it's quite rural there and coming around a curve in this dirt path or Road this is
when they noticed a very bright light which appeared to be hovering over a well-known Landmark the cabo de la
caracola it's called so they wondered briefly if this might be Hunters with
flashlights but the problem was this light was far too bright for flashlights so as they kept their eyes
on it as this light appeared to move around in circles sometimes changing colors from white to yellow and at one
point apparently red they came around another curve and they approached close enough that the headlights of their
motorbikes were shining on the hill where this light was and when this happened the strange light seemed to
respond with bright flashes that illuminated the entire environment around them in a bright yellow light so
they arrived at an old abandoned house and they decided to stop and sit under a pine tree smoke a few cigarettes and
wait for this strange light to go away but it didn't instead it stayed still
and after almost an hour of watching this the events escalated when they heard the sound of branches being
stepped on footsteps coming towards them and looking towards this noise which was
growing louder and closer they suddenly saw a very tall being they estimate 7
and 1/2 ft tall and was walking down the middle of the dirt road and coming
directly towards them very quickly it was about 15 to 20 ft away but it
stopped abruptly when the boys jumped up and looked at it and yeah this being was
strange in several ways it was moving in short slow steps and it did not move its
arms when it walked it was wearing a shiny tight fitting white jacket with what looked like pockets on the chest
with wavy stripes on the apparent Pockets it had stripe going down the center of its suit it also wore a
squarish helmet with a dark face plate at this point the boys noticed an
unnatural and absolute silence over the area no insect noises no crickets
nothing they were very frightened by the appearance of this figure so two of the
boys immediately jumped on their motorcycles and began to leave two of the other boys they stayed a moment long
but when the first two boys left and this tall figure continued to approach them they also jumped on their
motorbikes and all four fled the area as fast as they could and in fact one of
them did get a flat and broken spokes on his wheels but didn't stop not until
they reached the town they got back into town and rushed into a little restaurant
Bar on El palmeral Street and they shared their story with the people there
and in fact they convinced some of the people in that restaurant to go outside
and look and going outside all four boys and some other Witnesses did see a white
light rising from this hill it reached a certain height then made a sudden 90°
turn to the South this point some of the people decided to take a car up to the mountain
to investigate and arriving there they found that the dogs of a Shepherd who worked in this area were very excited
barking crazily and as soon as the car arrived these dogs hid under the cars
and refused to come out this really puzzled the owner of the dogs he says
his dogs were normally quite Brave afraid of nothing and it was some days after the encounter that reporters went
up to the area having heard about this incident and they found what appeared to be the footprints of the humanoid which
were in fact photographed also three triangular indentations were found in the soil and
they were indented quite deeply into this soil which indicated that there was an object of great weight had come down
on the ground there there you go multiple Witnesses animal reactions
Landing traces with photographs of the landing traces that's pretty unusual so
an a really important case I think I don't think the general public has any
idea how common these kinds of events are or there are so many of them they've
been occurring for such a long time in my opinion Skeptics simply don't have a leg to stand on at this point because if
you examine the evidence it's undeniable that we are being visited and here is
another case which I call I am certain that I saw an extraterrestrial craft
which is of course a direct quote from one of the witnesses this is actually a
series of events which is quite complicated occurring throughout January most specifically on January 4
1994 in various locations in France including ER bville and M so it was over
a fairly wide location but some incredible evidence a lot of Witnesses
in this case and so interesting this case is so interesting because yes it
involves a series of encounters that occurred throughout France on one night which made may not be directly connected
but the first encounter comes from the Noel family which is comprised of L the
father Rosaline the mother and their 18-year-old daughter swazi who they were
driving to her Dojo it was around 6:30 p.m. on January 4
1994 and they were driving along the d74 highway in a France they were only about
400 m less than A4 mile from the de b55 interchange or
intersection and this is when swazi looked out through the window to the right and noticed a very large dark kind
of triangular-shaped craft up ahead she set at three red lights at each Apex she
immediately alerted her parents and all three saw it as it approached more closely then crossed the road in front
of them it did disappear from view for a brief moment then they saw it again 200
m or 650 ft to the left of their car and as they turned onto the
d55 it began to parallel the road for a short distance kind of pacing their car
but moving slightly faster than their car and ahead of them they estimate that it was about 30 m wide close to 100 ft
though after speaking with investigators they sort of upgraded this or re-evaluated its size is nearly twice
this as L says in his own words I immediately thought that if it was a
plane it would crash but it wasn't a plane was flying much too low much too
fast and above all silently besides we are used to seeing planes and we know
how to tell the difference swazi says I have always thought that we could not be
alone in the universe witnessing this phenomena confirmed this idea it was a
wonderful moment so this sighting really impacted them and in fact following the
sighting swazi began to dream constantly of UFOs she had one repetitive dream
where she would see the UFOs and take photographs of it but she had all kinds of dreams about this she said in another
one of her dreams this UFO would land in her front yard and several small-sized alien-looking figures would come out and
invite her on board in the dream she always becomes afraid of them saying that they look quote mean and strange
and she tries to attack them and then she would find herself in this strange red
desert after one of these dreams she woke up and she was shocked to see that her flashlight in her bedroom had
apparently turned on by itself so somewhat unusual but meanwhile only
about 5 hours after the Noel family's encounter at 10 minutes before midnight
there was another encounter the main witness is dier Mori he's a chef and he
was watching TV in his home in bville and this is when he noticed a strong
yellow orange illumination about 300 M less than 1,000 ft from his home in the
second he looked at it he saw this brilliant light transform into what he perceived to be a conical shape with the
point facing upwards and it was glowing brightly with different colors including red blue and
green he said it looked very pretty and immediately it started spinning at high speed speed then it disappeared or
appeared to shrink down to a small glow and it now moved to the Northwest in the
direction of the nearby Chateau Bonar but very quickly this sort of
glowing cone-shaped object reappeared and now it was noticeably approaching him this point D became quite fearful
and panicky he quickly shut off the television to plunge the room into darkness so as not to draw attention to
himself and then he ran to his bedroom and crawled into bed not bothering to
wake up his wife at the same time his little dog who had been outside came
running inside and actually crawled under the bed in fear and soon this very
strange event became even stranger cuz as did says I didn't want to wake my
wife I was as if Paralyzed by the event at the foot of my Gable on the street
side I heard a crunching on the ground so this sounded to him like footsteps
and then things went from very strange to truly bizarre because as did says it
was at that moment that I felt strange Sensations deep down in my back as well
as in my lower limbs I had a flash in my eyes with an astonishing feeling to be
in some way osculated now this means a this is what
happens when a doctor is examining the sounds of your heart so he had some weird feeling that he was being
physically examined and then as he says then suddenly nothing more except a real
scare with the feeling of having experienced something completely quite
extraordinary so needless to say he was absolutely astonished and he believed he
had just had a brush with the UFO as he says it's true I was very scared and I
hope I don't have to live such an experience again it's hard to imagine
the impression that it leaves I believed in it but nothing more yet that night I
am certain that I saw an extraterrestrial craft so having heard these footsteps he
suspected that there were probably ETS outside his house but the events weren't
over yet soon more events followed because later on January
17 both he and his wife heard a loud noise in the field behind their house
but both were too scared to look outside and 3 days later on January 20th he saw
another strange unidentified light in the sky investigators of course did
research all of these incidents and they found another witness who is at nearby Bonar just a few kilometers away who on
January 4th the night of D's original sighting and that of the Noel family
said he saw a quote strange luminous craft which in no case could have been
an airplane now DDA did not report his sighting at first it would have remained unknown if not for what happened to
another family on again the same night some distance away in the small town of
ponville on Bera again in France this includes the Lopez family the father's
name is Michelle also included his wife Michelle and their three daughters Seine age 17
deline age 13 and Priscilla age s also in the house was David age 20 who was
severin's boyfriend all of them lived along a little street called R
de and you can see their house here this is the exact location and they were getting ready for bed when Michelle was
awakened by a bright light shining on the road between two fields near their
house this was only about 300 ft away and as the father Michelle says the
strange light invaded the room we were literally blinded but the light did not hurt our eyes so as Michelle his wife
and daughter Priscilla rushed to the window the light dimmed in brilliance at
which point they could see that it was actually a craft of some kind with multiple red flashing lights two yellow
lights they could see numerous beams of white light shin shining Upward at an
angle you said the craft was saucer shaped very much like a bowl it had a
transparent Dome on top it appeared to be about 5 m in diameter and 2.5 M high
and inside this transparent Dome they could see three humanoid shapes the one
in the middle appeared to have a larger head than the others the one on the right was shorter and appeared to be
heavier set than the other two but all three appeared to be wearing shiny whitish gray metallic looking
outfits so shocked they all went outside Michelle actually alerted two of his
neighbors to this incident everyone came outside to look at it and the members of the Lopez family in a unit stepped
cautiously forward to get a closer look they approached to about 80 M of this
object about 250 ft and as the wife says it was a strange engine very bright
circular in shape which emitted a strange whistle so as they watched a
door on the left side of the object opened this made a slight noise one of
the figures came down and according to the witnesses he looked like a normal human he was carrying a squarish
flashlight which he Shone towards the witnesses moving it from side to side as
if to examine them he then immediately walked back into the object the door
closed Ed making another weird noise the transparent Dome became even darker and
this object took off with a slight hissing sound and moved off behind a row of houses and was lost from view the
whole encounter lasted the estimate about 7 Minutes the next morning the
lopezes were visited by a family friend who lived just a few kilometers away and she immediately told them that she had
seen this weird light Illuminating her room the night before this was at the same same time of the Lopez's encounter
the Lopez's then explained what happened to them and it was then that they decided to call the newspapers and this
led to the case being officially investigated both by police and UFO
researchers now going to the place where the craft had been they found three circles and about 20 cm wide where the
soil had been depressed into the ground so this could be a genuine ET encounter
it's possible this is also reverse engineered craft with humans hard to say
for sure but certainly an interesting series of events all on one night and it
turned out the activity was going on throughout January cuz later on on January 9th another witness in the area
said he saw a luminous sphere in the sky January was a busy month in for France
in this area uh this is again 1994 and a really famous case occurred
just a few weeks later Air France flight 3532 being piloted by Captain Jean
Charles dubac was flying over the kulier region of s elar France when the entire
crew noticed this brownish red sort of disc-shaped object it was in view for
only a few moments before disappearing it looked to them like it was changing
shape but this could be a matter of perspective but what's really interesting is this
was confirmed on radar by the Sankar lail radar station where it was tracked
for 50 seconds which corresponded both in time and flight path to the
observation made by the crew of flight 3532 so there you go four five incidents
over a very short period of time and a pretty sharply defined area hard to say
for sure whether they're all connected but it certainly looks like it and when you have this much activity
going on you have to wonder why what's going on in that area at that time to
draw in so much UFO activity it's really interesting and now we move to another
case which I found really bizarre and quite compelling don't know that I've ever heard of an ET description quite
like this it's certainly similar to other cases and has a lot of elements that we do see in cases but it's very
unusual I call this one the ET in the Palm Plantation it occurred one evening
in April 2008 in bang Indonesia I like this case because we
don't hear a lot of cases coming from this area it's also interesting that this was a plantation of palm trees
perhaps that's why the e was there presuming this is an ET cuz we do see a
lot of cases of UFOs and etes landing at farms and picking various plants and
this sort of thing so perhaps that was the draw hard to say for sure but you can make up your own mind about it this
next case was posted by Sue propo on the UFO nesia Indonesia UFO blog I believe
he is the witness uh as the witness says in his own words I'll just let him describe it
because it's a very interesting account as the witness says I saw a glowing
object falling on the palm Plantation Hill about 300 M from my house in bang
kinang R this is again in Indonesia and as he says a few moments later I started
the motorbike and immediately drove to where the object fell but about 50 m
before arriving I was shocked half dead because suddenly there was a creature
blocking the way my motorbike breaked suddenly I set the motorbike lights High
while revving the gas to make it brighter the creature was clearly visible it was more than 2 m tall it
looked thin with a long neck longer than a normal human a bald head tapering
upwards with round eyes and pointed ears uh the witness elaborated further saying
that this being's arms dangled down below its waist he says its hands had very long fingers and it appeared to be
naked except for a pair of underwear he didn't get a good look at the legs because the headlights of his
motorbike illuminated this figure only from the waist up but he was very
curious and eager to investigate what he was looking at so he shifted the clutch on his motorcycle raced forward to get a
closer look but as he approached this strange creature quickly jumped to the side and behind a palm tree when the
witness reached the spot where the creature had been it was gone and as he says I was really surprised what kind of
creature is that now he does report having a number of UFO sightings in the
past but this was apparently his only face-to-face encounter with an actual
humanoid that is a single witness case yes and it wasn't professionally
investigated but certainly the witness seemed absolutely sincere clearly
puzzled clearly frightened by what he saw and it's just an all round
interesting case and now we move to the last case in this little compilation
which I call the magnetic man and you'll see why I gave it that title this
occurred on May 21st 2008 in a small town of San Carlos
Argentina this is a multiple witness case in fact there's quite a number of
witnesses who saw UFO activity at the time though only two well actually three
people had a very close-up encounter with an extremely unusual humanoid this
unique and unusual case was written up by Scott Coralis also Albert Rosal and
other researchers in fact it received considerable news coverage following its
occurrence the main Witnesses are Walter Lopez a mechanic and Omar ferati who you
can see here they were out in the farm fields near San Carlos this is located
near salta Argentina it was the evening of May 21st 2008 when suddenly they
noticed a short glowing humanoid only about 40 cm tall this is just over 1
foot 1 foot 3 in very small but it was mostly human looking now in a televised
interview Omar gave a detailed description of this figure as Omar says
its hair was combed FL flat in the middle and the back was raised almost meeting in the middle of the head his
hair was copper colored and he had dark bulging eyes no eyelashes no eyebrows
and he a pointed nose that ended straight down the bottom his upper lip was thin not very thick thin but big and
his lower bottom lip was thin too but it was a big mouth his face was a little
round but the little thing stood out his clothes were were like a sweatshirt with a kind of t-shirt like those dark brown
Lumberjack shirts and it faded until it became a light brown in the middle
everything was like that the top and the bottom were pants they were halfway up
his leg a little longer perhaps and he had something rigid at the waist the waist was rigid also the same color and
in the same way crooked I mean his feet were crooked I couldn't see his feet but
his hands were long his finger long and he didn't have nails so yeah he was
wearing a belt of some kind weird clothes weird hair an unusual face
everything about him was unusual and so short so Omar and Walter immediately
tried to approach this figure but when they did something really amazing happened some weird sort of magnetic
force field or something prevented them from approaching they assumed it was some sort of magnetic force field after
a short time of trying to approach this creature it quickly ran off Omar and
Walter reported their sighting to the police and news spread fast this led to
them being interviewed by a news team and it was soon learned that a lady who tended her flock of sheep nearby in the
valet sh shaki also saw this apparently the same strange little being she gave
the same exact description and then came further confirmation because newsmen interviewed
a resident in the area who said and I quote it's true everyone here says they
see lights in the sky there are people here who are afraid and don't want to go out at night another said the kids are
not going out at night for fear of strange beings and UFOs so yeah a lot of sightings were
going on at this time and in fact researcher Luise bagos confirmed this
that the area had a quote Avalanche of sightings which he says are quote
accompanied by all kinds of events such as sightings of amphibians objects
falling from the sky sightings of ships and mysterious explosions so this created quite a fur
in this small town Deputy Commissioner Luis karez told the news that the
descriptions provided by the Witnesses are very consistent but that the humanoid has quote not been seen again
if he were to return it would be good to confirm that this was the case as you
can see that case put the whole town in an uproar and had a huge effect on
everybody involved it's a very unusual case there aren't a lot of cases
involving humanoids that are less than 3 feet tall but it does turn up there was
a study I think quoted by researcher George faucet who said that 60% of
humanoid reports involve beings that are 4 feet tall or less so that does seem to
comprise the majority of cases though as we've seen in this compilation here some
can be quite tall upwards of 8 feet so here again we see a very wide variation
of humanoids but pretty much all humanoids bedal two arms two legs eyes
nose mouth and so forth which has huge implic ations and raises all kinds of
questions so there you go that's our episode for today really interesting
cases coming from all over the world over quite a long period of time most involving multiple Witnesses a wide
variety of evidence to support it I think this subject is so important
everybody deserves to know the truth about it it's why I do this research that and it's endlessly fascinating so
many cases so thank you very much you guys for watching I truly appreciate it it's
because of you I do these shows so thank you thank you thank you and until next
week keep searching for the truth because it's up to you to find it to ask
those hard questions and most of all keep having fun because that's also very
important I will see you next Friday bye for now
