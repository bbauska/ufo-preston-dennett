THREE BEDROOM VISITATIONS BY GRAY ALIENS
Nov 12, 2021

Summary:
Nov 12, 2021
Where is the most likely place to see an extraterrestrial? As strange as it may sound, one of the 
most commonly reported encounters is known as a "bedroom visitation." In case after case, people 
report waking up at night to find gray aliens in their bedroom. For many witnesses, a bedroom 
visitation is the experience that wakes them up to the realization that they are having lifelong 
encounters with extraterrestrials.

This video presents three different cases of people who experienced a bedroom visitation by gray 
aliens. Each is unique, not only in content, but in how the witnesses react.

CASE ONE "Connie" is visited in her third story apartment bedroom in Washington State by silver-
suited grays, causing a huge transformation, physically, mentally and spiritually.

CASE TWO: "Madison" had seen UFOs before, but had no idea that she was in actual contact until 
she was visited by grays in the bedroom of her apartment in White Plains, New York. Only then 
did she examine her past and realize that she had been having contact her entire life.

CASE THREE "Evelyn" had never thought much about UFOs until she woke up in her bedroom to see 
several grays who told her that they were on a mission. Evelyn felt no fear, and would later 
have more encounters during which she received urgent messages for all humankind.

Bedroom visitations are far more common than most people realize. It doesn't matter if you live 
in the country or in the heart of a crowded city, the ETs can find you. These three cases have 
volumes to reveal about the ET agenda, what it's like to have a bedroom visitation, and the 
incredible after-effects of contact.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today's episode is called three bedroom visitations by gray aliens grays are probably 
the most common type of e.t that people see certainly that's true in my own files 
and one of the most common types of encounters is what I would call a bedroom visitation people wake 
up usually at night to find grays inside their bedroom this happens quite a bit and that's why 
i wanted to do this video i've got three cases i'd like to share with you today and each of them 
i think have some unique and interesting insights into what it's like to have a bedroom visitation 
what the ET agenda is and how people react to it so let's just get started 
case one connie connie comes from mount rainier in washington at the time of this encounter she lived 
in a three-story apartment building and not the greatest part of the city and connie had 
no reason to think she was having encounters she really had not thought about ufos at all 
her only real clue that something unusual was going on in her life was she was having a series 
of repetitive dreams in which she was being chased and felt like something was trying to capture her 
but she did not in any way relate this to ufos or extraterrestrials until one night in august of 1998 when she was having one of these weird chasing dreams 
and then she woke up into what is probably the single most unusual experience of her entire life 
what woke her up was a loud buzzing noise feel filling her apartment at the same time there 
was a very very bright light coming in from the window it filled up her whole bedroom and she 
thought at first that it was a police helicopter and that perhaps there was a drug bust or some 
sort of crime going on outside because again she did not live in the best part of the city 
so she was quite concerned and wanted to get up and investigate it but found she was paralyzed and 
this is when she started to realize several things at once the bright light was still there but it wasn't really a helicopter sound it was a loud buzzing noise she was unable to move 
and as she's trying to orient herself she sees that there is a silver suited gray type e.t 
standing right next to her bed and this really of course frightened her and unable to move really 
anything except her eyes she saw that there was in fact another one standing at the foot of her bed 
and her first thought was oh no they're here she has no idea why she thought that who 
they were but she was absolutely convinced that something or someone is in the room 
and that's when she saw these things and i'll just quote connie in her own words as she says 
i was fully awake my eyes were wide open my body was paralyzed I kind of looked 
around because I couldn't move I turned my eyes to the left closest to the window 
and there was a small being dressed in a foil silvery suit it was a real skin tight uniform 
like a leotard silvery in color like aluminum foil it has scaly look about it like snake skin 
it looked like it was also wearing some kinds of gloves and a belt I tried to look up but I 
couldn't see any further than the belt portion so this shocked her and uh most of her attention 
was riveted to this being but at the same time she could see another one standing at the foot of her bed and this filled her with fear and she tried to break free of the paralysis as she says 
and I quote I knew I couldn't take it anymore I screamed with all my might get out of here 
my heart beats like it was going to blow out of my head it was so loud it was beating in my ears 
i felt as if my whole body was sweating all its water out of it I could not move with all 
my might I want to kick and scream and fight i'm not a religious person although I know 
how to recite my catholic prayers as soon as I called for help from the almighty I woke up 
connie looked at the clock it was 3 30 a.m the strange light and the weird humming noise were 
now gone and there was no ET's in her bedroom and she thought for a second it might even be a dream 
but then she noticed something very strange her legs were propped up in as she says 
kind of like a pap smear position and she looked under the covers and got a real shock she had 
no underwear on so she quickly jumped out of bed and realized she was actually lying 
crosswise on the mattress instead of vertically as she had gone to bed and secondly and even 
more strange her bed sheets and blanket were perfectly made and tucked in and the bed did 
not even look like it had been slept in as she says it was the weirdest thing it was so strange 
i was tucked in I had the comforter over me my pillow wasn't moved it looked like I had just 
opened my bed and it was nicely made nothing looked like it was disturbed like I hadn't even 
slept there considering the amount of fighting and kicking I thought I was doing at this point 
she noticed a cool sensation running down her legs and it was this fluid and that of course concerned 
her it made it very clear that this was no dream so she had to get ready for work and took a shower 
got ready for work and went off to her office and this is when more weird things started to happen
she noticed that her mouth was numb and it had a weird chemical taste in it 
her stomach was upset up in knots and she was suffering from diarrhea and nausea 
she collected herself as best as she could and started her work at the office turned on her 
computer and shortly after that the computer mysteriously went down she called over the i.t 
person to help put her computer back online and while he was doing that she went to go make some 
copies on the copier machine and no sooner had she turned it on when it completely malfunctioned 
she thought that was strange so she decided that she would try to get some of the faxes done that 
she had to fax she went over to the fax machine and that also malfunctioned and this is when she 
realized that something very strange was going on every machine that she touched was breaking down 
that's certainly something I have heard before I think something about having a ufo encounter 
raises a person's vibration raises their bio electric field and it causes all kinds of problems 
with electromagnetic machinery watches televisions radios light bulbs computers all of these things 
can break down and do so a lot with contactees and that was certainly happening with her
so she didn't feel well and this persisted for a couple of weeks in fact she said as she described it she got the shakes for about two weeks and finally recovered 
but this was quite upsetting to her initially and she thought was this you know a demon was 
this a ghost what had happened to her and this sort of kick-started her spiritual 
journey she was already moving away from religion and was looking for more answers to the purpose of 
life why we are here are we alone in the universe what's the meaning of life this sort of thing 
so she started looking into her experience and she decided no it was not demons that she saw 
and in fact doing the research on the internet it sounded very much like she had had a ufo encounter 
and that caused her to start re-evaluating everything and she's looked into her past to see 
if there was any clues that she had had encounters before and she found many of them quite a few 
there were of course the chasing dreams but beyond that she'd often wake up in her bed lying 
the wrong direction sideways in her bed or even sometimes she'd wake up with her feet on her pillow at the head of the bed and her head at the foot of the bed 
she complained to her parents about it and they said well you just must be a restless sleeper 
but she knew she couldn't be that restless it just didn't make sense
she also had other little clues she had a lot of sinus problems sometimes she would wake up 
and there would be these weird red marks in a triangle on her neck right below her 
lymph nodes it was always the same same place same little red dots in a perfect triangle 
if it was bug bites she thought it wouldn't be so regular like that another thing 
was uh one time she at some point in her life felt like there was this weird thing stuck in 
her throat near her sinuses she went to the doctor about it and the doctor couldn't find anything 
but at some point she experienced a severe coughing fit and out came this peculiar looking 
little object the time she didn't think anything about implants but now looking back 
she wonders because this object looked peculiar now she says 
it was really tiny probably half a pea size it was white it was round and it was organic looking 
i tried to squish it but I couldn't break it I couldn't destroy it I thought that was kind of strange but it was scary looking so I ended up throwing it out 
there were other clues there was several times as a child she would wake up and hear a very 
loud buzzing noise overhead no one else in the house ever seemed to hear it just her 
as she grew up she she had a child and her child suffered from a series of pretty severe 
nosebleeds they could not figure that out so there were all these little clues 
another thing that was very unusual is that her family would joke with her that she was an alien 
as it turned out connie was very short under five feet tall and she also had a very very high 
forehead that gave her a somewhat unusual appearance and her family joked all the time well 
maybe you are half alien at the time she didn't think it was funny and now after this experience 
she really wondered about it that could there be something to this was she even a hybrid so there 
were all these weird little clues that perhaps something very unusual was going on with her 
and it was just a few months after this encounter that she had her first real big ufo sighting 
she was out on a date with a gentleman at a restaurant and they were seated in an outdoor section and talking when both of them saw a cluster of lights in the sky 
it wasn't terribly far away but it wasn't super close either but it was unusual enough 
that it caught both of their attention and they were looking at it and as connie says 
all of a sudden the weirdest thing happened it just took off it made a really fast zigzag 
maneuver and just disappeared we were looking up there I looked at him and we looked at each other 
and connie's date was surprised and he said well I did not see that and connie 
looked at him amazed and said well yes you did because we both saw it it was strange because 
although they were at a restaurant and there were many other people there no one else seemed to see it it was as if the sighting was just for them 
so what I find interesting about this case is that connie had many clues throughout her life that she 
was having contact but never really picked up on it until she had one of these bedroom visitations 
and that opened it up and she realized that there were all these clues to the possibility that she 
was in fact a contactee which she does think she is considering you know the implant the strange 
marks on her neck the sinus problems her daughter having nosebleeds the weird buzzing noises 
and of course the bedroom visitation itself and the way she effects electronics ultimately the 
biggest effect was that connie became spiritually transformed and really became a spiritual seeker 
and opened up to a lot of different subjects such as ufos and life after death and spirituality 
although her encounter was traumatic she does not feel like the ETs were trying to hurt her 
or scare her or anything like that she does have a lot of questions about her experiences 
but she feels ultimately that it was a good experience and she wouldn't mind having another 
so that's case one now we move to case two madison madison lived in new york 
with her family and it was in 1984 that she had her first encounter she was driving with her 
parents and her brother she was 10 years old they were driving from peekskill to oceaning 
new york and that's when they saw a ufo hovering over the highway a large boomerang shaped object 
at treetop level and a lot of people were seeing it in fact it stopped traffic on the highway 
as she says everybody was parked and looking at it I got scared because everybody was looking at 
it I thought it was the end of the world I was pretty scared she and her family didn't realize 
it at the time but new york upstate new york was going through a massive wave of sightings 
which we now know is the hudson valley ufo wave there's been several books written about this 
incredible wave of sightings it's one of the most widely viewed series of ufo events in u.s history 
and she was a part of it and her encounters did not stop there was just four years later when she 
and her entire family had another really dramatic very close-up encountered her outside her home 
this was on the evening of march 17 1988 when there was this enormous egg-shaped object hovering 
right at treetop level in the backyard madison's mom saw it first and called everyone outside 
and as madison says I don't know what it was it wasn't a goodyear blimp it was amazing it was 
really close there was a tree in the backyard and you could hear it brushing against the tree that's 
how low it was and I could hear it it was making a humming noise it was turning all colors blue green 
it was weird so that was it just these two sightings madison had no reason to think that 
she was having actual contact and she grew up became an adult uh went to school became 
a dental assistant found an apartment in white plains new york a pretty densely populated area 
and this is when she had her bedroom visitation this was on the evening of may 15 1995 she had 
just had her son who was three months old and he was sleeping in the same room with her because she 
he was so young madison was a single parent at this time although she had had a relationship 
it didn't work out so she was raising her son by herself in this apartment in white plains new york 
and she usually stays up late in fact he had invited someone over that evening 
but for some weird reason she found herself going to bed at around 10 p.m 
something she never does so that was the first clue that something strange was happening 
and then at some point she woke up to find that there were several beings 
in her room and she looked at them and they were what we would now call grays and she was 
absolutely stricken with terror this was not a good experience for her in any way as she says 
this is kind of embarrassing for me to tell you but I know it wasn't a dream 
i woke up and there were about six or eight beings and they were going around my bed I remember they 
were pushing me down and I woke up I don't know what they were doing but I know they woke me up 
she was not only scared she was very angry because it seemed like they were interested in looking 
at her infant son who was only three months old and she was very protective of him and as she's 
looking at these beings she's she was repulsed by their appearance uh it really frightened her 
badly as she says I remember cursing at them get the f off me leave me alone where's my baby 
and they were surrounding me it was dark I remember looking up and they were pressing 
against my chest and my forehead it was a weird feeling I don't know if they were 
physically touching me it was like a weird force I don't know it was very very weird 
i can remember kicking my feet and they just stood there it was scary they just stood there looking 
at me like I was some kind of animal or something like we do with animals like experimenting on them 
so she fought and fought with them and the next thing she knows they were gone 
she jumped up and checked on her son he was fine the only thing that was different was 
that there was this weird sort of crackling electricity in the air the atmosphere itself 
felt somewhat charged and different but her son appeared to be fine she herself was fine 
and she's trying to orient herself when there's a knock on the door and it's her friend it's 
now 11 p.m he's showing up and she opens the door and immediately tells him what happened 
and he was kind of skeptical and said well maybe it was just a dream and she insisted that 
no it was not a dream I was awake and it was this event which caused her like it does with other 
witnesses certainly like it did with connie to examine her past and this is when she found clues 
like connie that she had been having experiences her whole life so this is a pattern we see over 
and over and there were of course the two close up ufo sightings and when a ufo is within a couple of 
hundred feet of a person that is definitely a huge red flag but there were other clues 
as a young kid she saw the television program the muppets which was supposed to be a fun program but 
for some reason the sight of these muppets with their wide staring eyes completely terrified her 
and sparked a series of what she called her muppet nightmares she hated the muppets 
they scared her to death so that was one clue and she did have an experience at age 14 which she is 
now absolutely convinced was a visitation because she woke up and there was someone 
or something in her room and she wasn't unable to move and unable to see who it was but she 
was absolutely convinced that there was someone there as she says and I quote somebody was there 
i remember I felt like I was drugged but I knew that there was somebody in front of me in my room 
and she fell asleep and she woke up a short time later being dropped into her bed from a couple of inches above and that woke her up 
as she says I remember my body dropping when I woke up my body was dropped to the bed 
and again she lost consciousness woke up the next morning and this is when she had a really 
strange discovery as she says that morning when I woke up I felt really weird 
not only that there was dirt on my bed on my couch in the living room on the floor 
and it was going towards the window that was the weirdest experience I ever had 
she now is pretty much convinced that this was a visitation and I have to say it fits the pattern 
i've heard from many other people it was shortly after that she had another weird experience 
where she fainted for no reason or had what might have been a seizure ended up going to 
the doctor about it but he couldn't find anything wrong with her and that night 
madison and her mother both woke up to hear someone moving around in the living room but for some reason they didn't or couldn't get up to investigate as madison says 
maybe it could have been one of the beings I hate thinking about it but it could be you never know
so now she's looking back on her past and sees all these little clues that perhaps she was having 
encounters her whole life but didn't really realize it until she had this full-on waking 
experience this bedroom visitation and she did tell her family about it and a few close friends 
some were skeptical and she's decided that she's not going to tell anyone else because it was quite embarrassing telling people that she she thought she had been 
uh visited by extraterrestrials so she just kept it quiet and didn't really tell anybody 
but one after effect of this was a pretty long lasting anxiety she says she has the constant 
feeling that she is being watched and observed that there's someone looking at her I can't tell 
you how many times contactees have told me this that they have this feeling that they are being 
watched and that is certainly true with madison as she says I feel ridiculous but sometimes I feel 
like they are watching me or something i'm always dreaming of them sometimes they're just there 
like they're in my room I sometimes sleep with the light on because i'm thinking of that experience 
so yeah that's something also i've heard from many people who have encounters uh they have trouble 
sleeping without a night light or a light on in the hallway or some type of background music 
or being alone can frighten them so yeah she had all these lasting after effects and she says I 
just hope that they don't come around again it was scary i'll put it this way I cannot 
be by myself in a house sometimes and I live in a building I can't be alone because i'm afraid
i can't leave the door open in my room at night I have to close it and turn my light on or at least leave the tv on when I think about it I get scared
she has thought about going under hypnotic regression she did some research and realized 
that this is one way to recover memories but she's afraid it might open up a can of worms 
that it might be scary and she's decided that she is not going to do it and she's just decided 
that she's not going to explore this at all and try to live a normal life as best as she can so 
that has been how she reacted to this experience and it was some years later her son was 
around 11 12 years old and they were watching television when a ufo program came on featuring 
gray aliens and her son jumped up and changed the channel this had happened before 
and she just ignored it but when he kept doing it what happened again she confronted him about 
it and she asked him what's wrong and he said I hate those things and she said why and he said 
i don't know why I just hate them i'm just scared of them and she persisted tell me why 
and he turned away from her and said I don't want to talk about it mom it's scary I don't like it 
so I think this is significant because what we have seen is this thing does track families if 
a person is having encounters it's quite likely their parents or grandparents have 
and also that their children have and that seems to be true in madison's case 
and one final endnote which I think is really significant in this case this also turns up 
madison following this encounter began having a series of dreams about wide-scale disasters 
as she says my dreams are mostly about water and major floods what could this mean 
i don't know she feels like it might be connected to all this and they could be 
prophetic dreams about upcoming disasters and I have to wonder about that because that turns up 
quite a bit so that's madison's case and it has all these really interesting details it shows 
that ET's do seem to be interested in reproduction the fact that they visited her three-month-old son 
and often they do warn people about disasters that does seem to be true in madison's case 
and it can cause a very strong fear reaction which is absolutely true in madison's case 
she does not feel like this was a benevolent experience she doesn't want it to happen again and she has no interest in exploring it further so this is how some people will react but now 
let's move to the third case and one of the most interesting this is case three evelyn 
evelyn has had no memories of any encounters she lives in ontario canada and her first real 
encounter occurred one evening in august of 1998. she was alone in the house she has two daughters 
at that time who lived with her and just for fun she thought she'd sleep in her daughter's bedroom 
and she woke up in the middle of the night because she sensed that someone was in the room as evelyn 
says and I quote you just get that feeling that someone's there so I got up out of sleep and I 
noticed that I couldn't move I couldn't even open my eyes I was like paralyzed finally after really 
fighting I got one eye open and then the other and when I did that I saw six grays around my bed 
she recognized them instantly as grace she had seen them on tv enough to recognize them 
and for whatever reason she felt no fear whatsoever she did not feel like they were 
there to hurt her or anything in fact she got a really friendly feeling from them 
and the gray that was standing to her left spoke to her telepathically and said don't be afraid 
we're not here to harm you we are on a mission and evelyn replied okay and felt no fear and said she 
was felt with what she says is a quote feeling which was very powerful and she was amazed at 
what happened next that she says when I said that the paralysis started to go down I was starting to 
feel my body and I could move a little bit and the other guys the other five of them were just 
standing there all around the bed the one standing to my left side held a wand maybe about a foot 
long and two inches in diameter it was bright the whole thing was shining it was like full of energy 
and he took the wand and he went from the top of my head down to the tips of my toes 
then the guy on my right side said extend your arm so I extended my arm 
and she felt like they were scanning or measuring her body for something and at this point she 
realized she had full freedom of movement and as evelyn says and I quote I sat up in bed just sat 
there and looked at them and I was shaking my head thinking is this real somebody pinch me I 
don't know why but I wasn't afraid I was in awe of them they were four feet high the head is bigger 
than the body their eyes were dark and big they had a one-piece suit on a very light gray color 
they themselves were like a baby powder color their features were round they had very small 
noses very thin pencil mouths I didn't notice any ears i've always known about the grays 
i know that a lot of people have had abductions and they weren't very pleasant and there's a lot written out there that they're going to harm you but I didn't feel like they were 
going to harm me mine seemed to be really nice it was really nurturing to tell you the truth 
uh at this point her memory ends she doesn't know what happened next the next thing she knows 
it's morning as she says when I woke up I thought it was all a dream but it was so vivid 
and when I looked on the inside of my arm the elbow part there were two small horizontal 
marks I know they weren't there when I went to bed that night so now she's convinced that this was 
in fact a real experience and it wasn't long before she had further evidence of this she did 
tell her daughters when they came home and both her daughters looked at her like she was crazy 
they were supportive but didn't really believe it they were skeptical and then one of them had an 
encounter along with evelyn and of course became a believer as evelyn says and I quote my daughter 
and friend were sitting by a campfire one night just sitting and talking and laughing and singing 
it was pitch dark the only light was from the fire pit all of a sudden this beautiful light surrounded us my daughter freaked out I told her to just 
sit still I don't know who they were they didn't stay long within a minute the light 
went up and disappeared when I looked up I could see an orange reddish ball fly away
so evelyn feels like these are benevolent encounters and in fact she had another experience 
where she was visited and they healed her she believes of back pain and not only that 
she came away from the experience feeling like she also had the ability to heal and has done 
so successfully she relieved other people's back pain so she had this really interesting 
experience with healing which does turn up in many many cases and it's certainly true 
with evelyn and she had another really interesting experience with healing as she says and I quote 
one of my cats got into a fight with a raccoon and came home with his one eye hanging out 
i asked my alien friends to heal him two days later he came home healed 
so that was weird she didn't actually see her cat getting taken or anything like that 
but for him to come home without any sign of injury was bordering on miraculous 
and she feels pretty sure that her e.t friends healed her cat it's only one of several cases I 
have of animals that have been healed so it definitely fits right in the pattern 
and following all this evan became very deeply spiritual had a lot of psychic events 
and in fact started channeling and was channeling all kinds of messages often about 
widespread disasters striking our planet about the importance of love 
warnings against war and violence this sort of thing all about the importance 
of getting along with each other and the possible future destruction of our planet 
and it wasn't long before she had a full-on experience where this was underlined and 
they basically told her flat out that this is a very real danger as she says 
two came to me and told me they wanted to show me something 
they took my hand and before I knew what was happening I was in outer space looking down on our planet I was in awe then they started to bring me back flying towards the earth as I got 
closer I could see the wars people dying from starvation us destroying this beautiful planet 
they told me that this made them sad they put us on this planet I feel that they are the teachers
so evelyn has come away from this experience I think believing uh that these guys are absolutely 
benevolent and for her the experience was not in the least bit frightening it was in fact 
very healing and she feels that they are trying to teach us so that's what's interesting about these 
three cases each is slightly different I presented each of these cases in my latest book wondrous 
25 true ufo encounters and I wanted to do this video because not only are gray encounters 
really common but this type of encounter the bedroom visitation is very common I hear it all 
the time and each of these three cases reveals various insights into the grays who they are 
why they're here and what it's like to have an encounter for example example in connie's case and 
in madison's case they lived with a lifetime of strange experiences were probably having contact 
since early childhood but didn't recognize it until they had one of these bedroom visitations 
and connie came away for from her experience spiritually transformed this is absolutely true 
with evelyn as well connie has had all kinds of problems with electromagnetic instruments I hear 
that all the time madison has come away with ptsd and a real fear and anxiety that's another thing 
i hear quite often she chose not to explore these experiences and instead is just trying to shelve 
them in the back of her mind and live a normal life which is you know totally understandable 
whereas the other two really faced it head on and I think got the better benefits of having an encounter which include you know being spiritually transformed and possibly even 
healed and getting warnings but that's true of madison too she's having all these dreams of 
floods widespread floods across our planet so there's a lot of commonalities to these 
experiences that I think help corroborate these experiences and add a level of credibility to them 
uh each of them talk about strange marks on their body um implants these sort of things so there's 
all these details that show that these experiences are probably real and again like madison or rather 
connie and evelyn both talk about how their children may be having encounters as well 
so that's why I wanted to do this video to let people know about this type of encounter what 
it's like to see grays in your bedroom why they're there and the after effects 
of these experiences so that's it for this episode I hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you once 
again for watching I really appreciate it until next time keep asking questions 
keep searching for answers and most importantly and i'm serious about this 
keep having fun it's important that's why we're here until next time.
