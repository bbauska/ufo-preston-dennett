THE UFO INVASION OF CALIFORNIA'S MILITARY BASES
Aug 19, 2022

Summary:
Aug 18, 2022
UFO researchers have known for a very long time that UFOs are attracted to military bases. In fact, pioneering investigators Jim and Coral Lorenzen knew this, and when new military installations were built, they predicted sightings would occur there. And they were right!

The state of California has the largest population of any state, and according to NUFORC (the National UFO Reporting Center,) it also produces more UFO reports than any other states. California also has a very large number of highly advanced and sensitive military bases. So, it should come as no surprise that many of these installations have been visited by UFOs. In fact, sightings stretch all the way back to at least 1947, The Modern Age of UFOs, and are continuing today. 

This video presents about a dozen high profile cases of UFOs surveilling California military bases. These are not random sightings of lights in the sky at night. Many of these cases involve solid, metallic objects, and some are seen over a period of days. Many bases have been repeatedly visited for years on end. A few of the cases involve confirmed radar returns, and several of them were declared unidentified by intelligence officers from the Air Force's Project Blue Book.

--July 3, 1947, Santa Rosa Naval Auxiliary Station goes on high alert when a 20-foot metallic saucer hovers a mere 1000 feet above the base runway.

--July 29, 1947, Hamilton Field experiences the first of a series of dramatic encounters over the base occurring over a period of five years.

--March 3, 1951, UFO activity at McClellan Air Force Base is so brazen that Blue Book officers investigate and are forced to label the case Unknown.

--May 1952, a month-long series of low-level daylight sightings of metallic objects over George AFB causes alarm at high levels of government.

--July 24, 1952, several military personnel at Travis Air Force base report a UFO. Blue Book officers arrive, and again are unable to identify the objects.

--January 28, 1953, control tower operators at El Toro Marine Base (and at nearby bases) try to intercept a fiery red disc hovering over the base.

--November 3, 1953, a witness identified only as "J" observes and photographs a UFO hovering at low levels above Norton Air Force Base.

--February 2, 1955, concerns are raised when numerous officers at Miramar Naval Air Station see a UFO, and Blue Book has no idea what it is!

--1956, a cat-and-mouse confrontation between UFOs and USAF jet fighters occurs over Castle AFB. The pilots are ordered to remain silent.

--September 15, 1964, an Atlas Missile is launched from Vandenberg AFB, causing a UFO incident that will make waves for decades to come.

--December 16, 1966, a crowd of military officers at San Diego Naval Air Station observe multiple objects perform gymnastics over the base.

--February 8, 1990, residents outside of Twenty-Nine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Base observe and photograph an incredible encounter.

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Edwards Air Force Base has a history of UFO encounters that rival perhaps any other military base in the United States. Clearly something profound is happening here. The reports coming from highly reputable trained observers within our own military can be ignored no longer. The time for lies and cover-ups is over. The truth must be revealed. These cases show that UFOs and extraterrestrials are watching our technological progress very closely. They are letting our military know that we are being watched.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today's episode is called the ufo invasion of california's military bases this is kind of a 
sequel a follow-up to my other youtube episode the ufo invasion of edwards air force base 
and as the name implies this is all about cases in which ufos have hovered over and investigated 
various military bases in california pioneering ufo researchers jim and coral 
lorenzen were among the first to be able to predict ufo sightings 
and they noticed that whenever there was a new installation a military base being constructed 
sure enough there would be ufo sightings over that area and we certainly see that with california 
california leads the nation in terms of the number of ufo reports and we have an awful 
lot of military bases here so it should come as no surprise that there have been many cases 
in which ufos have hovered over military bases here in california so i have about a 
dozen cases i'd like to share with you today some are really quite dramatic others are pretty brief 
but i think they really show an interesting aspect to ufo behavior shows they're really keeping a 
close watch on our military activities and that's why i wanted to present this episode to you today 
so let's get started the first military installation to attract the interest of ufos 
is probably the santa rosa naval auxiliary station in northern california 
and at 5 pm on july 3rd 1947 this is nearly the same time as the roswell ufo crash 
trained observers at the base observed a 20-foot metallic saucer hovering only 1 000 feet above the 
main runway so that's quite low and as one of the observers said and i quote it was covered 
by silver material that looked like aeroplane aluminum there were no marks of any sort on the 
surface it was perfectly smooth it had no wings no apparent projections of any sort this was just the 
beginning of the ufo wave that would sweep across the united states it was really a super wave 
and it wasn't long before there were more cases of ufos hovering over military bases in fact that 
same month only a few weeks after that another california military base was targeted by ufos 
it was at 2 50 p.m on july 29 1947 that hamilton field experienced its first of many surveillances 
by ufos one of the witnesses was lieutenant ward stewart and assistant operations officer 
captain william reiherd they were both on the base when they observed a 25 foot shiny whitish disc 
overtake a p80 jet fighter which was coming in for a preliminary approach at about 6 000 feet 
and seconds later both officers observed an identical disc maneuver in a protective left 
to right pattern over the first disc after which both continued southwards 
so project blue book intelligence officers were called in to investigate and lieutenant stewart 
testified that the objects he saw were unlike any conventional aircraft in his considerable 
experience as a b-29 pilot and blue book officers were unable to explain the sighting 
and labeled the case unidentified this is one of the first blue book cases case number 69. 
but this sighting marked the first of a series of sightings that would occur regularly over hamilton 
field and the next sighting occurred about three years later on june 25 1950 on that occasion 
at 1 35 a.m corporal garland prior was at the base when he observed a strange 
object pass overhead at 5000 feet elevation at a speed he estimates of about 1500 miles per hour 
so he alerted staff sergeant ellis lorimer who had three years experience in control tower 
observation and he also observed the object as it made two additional passes overhead meanwhile 
another person on the base staff sergeant virgil capuro observed the same mysterious object and 
he used binoculars to look at it and still could not identify it none of the airmen were able to 
identify this object which eventually disappeared over the pacific ocean trailing a blue flame they 
said like an ass settling tort so two years later the ufos were back on august 3rd 1952 
officers at the base observed two huge silver disks maneuvering directly over the base 
the radar tower was immediately contacted and radar operators verified on their scopes that 
the objects were circling the base several f-86 jets were quickly scrambled to intercept the craft 
and at that point six additional disks suddenly appeared and assumed what looked like a defensive 
diamond formation around the original craft and then seconds later all the 
objects quickly accelerated out of sight so a pretty amazing series of sightings 
and around the same time that this was going on at hamilton field there was another series of 
sightings that was probably even more dramatic at george air force base george air force base 
is located in the southern california desert just north of los angeles and in may of 1952 
the based experience what researcher michael david hall calls quote a particularly intense 
series of sightings and in fact this wave of sightings over george air force base remains 
one of the most extensive of all the california bases accepting perhaps edwards air force base 
so it all began at 10 50 a.m on may 1st when four officers in the base range control tower 
observed five white disks swooped down from the direction of apple valley and cavort over the 
base and one of the control officers released an official statement saying and i quote 
the objects five in number appeared to be round and disc shaped the diameter of these 
objects seemed to be greater than the length of an f-15 fighter plane they were of a flat white 
color and gave off no glare or reflection they moved in formation with the last two 
darting around in a circular motion i estimated that the speed of the objects was about twice 
that of ordinary aircraft and the altitude of the objects to have been about four 000 feet 
another witness to this event was actually the wing director 
of george air force base he was playing golf about four miles north of the bit of the base 
when he saw one of the mystery objects and he later told investigators the shape of 
the object was round i could not see if it was shaped as a ball or a disc it was white in color 
made no noise had no visible exhaust and the speed appeared to be in excess of 1 000 miles per hour 
so once again project blue book officers were called in to investigate including j 
allen highneck and as heinek says and i quote the discs were very maneuverable 
appearing to almost collide and break away blue book officers were very impressed they did not 
know what to make of these objects they clearly weren't planes and they declared this sighting 
unidentified this is blue book case number 1176
so while base personnel assumed that the settings were over 
actually they were just beginning this was going to be a very busy month it was only 
eight days later at 10 30 a.m on may 9th that an officer at the base cited a round silver object 
maneuvering overhead at the same time pilots in two f-86 aircraft also observed the same object 
which quickly darted away it was only two hours later that the ufos were back and in this occasion 
numerous personnel on the base observed these two objects make a low slow pass over the base 
and the objects were described as having quote a silver metal metal color with a dark spot in 
the center and at certain angles to the sun gave off a bright glare so the day wasn't over yet just 
a few hours later at 5 20 pm additional witnesses observed a quote dull colored object in the shape 
of an arrowhead pass high overhead so i don't know what's going on during this month but it was busy 
for two days there was no apparent activity then at 12 20 pm on may 11 a large whitish 
object shaped like a white paper plate was seen tumbling over the base at jet speed and at one 
point this object appeared to reduce its speed and then it quickly darted away at high speed 
two days later at 2 25 pm this was may 13 the base was again put on high alert when a single round 
shiny metal disc hovered stationary overhead remaining in view for more than 30 minutes 
so that's quite a long time for an object to be hovering over this very sensitive military base 
and it was the very next day on may 14 when this disc was back again this time it showed up at 
205 pm and was observed by many officers who agreed that it appeared to be the same object 
then one week later on may 20th the disc returned for what appears to be its final 
survey of george air force base it appeared right on schedule at 2 25 pm 
and remained hovering stationary over the base for about five minutes before moving away 
so not surprisingly this dramatic series of multiple sightings caused a major air 
force investigation and the head of project blue book captain edward rupelt arrived on may 20th 
at george air force base for what turned out to be the day of the last sighting rupelt had high 
hopes of seeing one of the saucers for himself and convinced the base commander to scramble a 
t-6 jet to look for the ufos unfortunately rupault didn't see anything except for a balloon and for 
whatever reason the sightings at george air force base had come to a sudden end and once 
again blue book officers were unable to find an explanation for this series of sightings and were 
forced to declare this case unidentified this became blue book case number 1194
so george air force base was apparently of particular interest to the et's and 
it should come as no surprise that there was yet another sighting there this was several 
years later on the night of june 17 and 18 in 1969 when two base security policemen observed 
what they described as a bright orange colored object hovering overhead think it was quite large 
they estimate that this object was at least 375 feet in diameter and after just a few moments this 
ufo flitted away and this account was actually leaked to the press by an inside source and 
otherwise would probably have remained a secret which is one reason one of several reasons why i 
think most of the encounters that we know about represent just the tip of the iceberg meanwhile 
the ufo reconnaissance of california's many other military installations continued 
and the next one occurred over mcclellan air force base this was on march 13 1951 
when both military and civilian witnesses reported strange ufo activity over the base 
and once again project blue book officers came in to investigate the case and labeled it 
unidentified this became blue book case number 907 so the 1950s were really really active 
the next military base to be visited was travis air force base they had a sighting on july 24 
1952 when personnel at travis air force base reported a strange object hovering over the base 
project blue book officers were called in to investigate and after interviewing the 
witnesses they were unable to find an explanation and labeled it unidentified 
this became blue book case number one five eight eight so this just goes on and on 
on january 28 1953 personnel at the control tower at el toro marine base observed an unknown 
object hovering in the sky at the same time officials at the nearby point magoo base and 
long beach airport control towers also observed the object marine jet pilot major harvey patton 
was sent to intercept this mysterious visitor and he described the ufo as quote 
a large fiery red disc shaped object and after four minutes of chasing after this thing major 
patent was unable to close the distance between himself and the object and the chase was ended 
so it just goes on and on the next case occurred at norton air force base 
and if you look at my episode california ufo crash retrievals you will see reports of ufos being held 
at norton air force base but in fact there are sightings of objects hovering over the base one 
occurred on november 3rd 1953 this is just one year after the george air force base sightings 
and that november 3rd a witness identified only as jay observed and allegedly photographed an object 
as it hovered directly over norton air force base at 4 00 a.m in the morning and it was just 
one year after that that california's miramar naval air station located in southern california 
had a really incredible sighting it was on february 2nd 1955 when the base went 
on high alert after numerous officers observed an unidentified object hovering over the base it 
eventually darted away project blue book officers were called in to investigate and after conducting 
an investigation they could not identify this object and once again declared it unidentified 
this became blue book case number three four one six year after year military bases over california 
for that matter all across the u.s and the world are experiencing very close up ufo sightings in 
1956 a cat and mouse game involving ufos and usaf jet fighters occurred over castle air force base 
when citizens from the nearby town of modesto called up the base to report ufo activity 
two f-86 jet fighters were put on alert duty and instructed to fly over the town 
to intercept the unknowns however shortly after takeoff two control tower personnel at the base 
themselves observe what they described as a quote luminous elliptical object hovering over the base 
so the interceptors were ordered to return to the base and as the fighters returned to the base they 
actually closed in on the ufos and approached to within only a few hundred yards of these objects 
these ufos easily evaded the jets by sneaking in and out of the low cloud cover both pilots 
said that they had radar returns on their craft of a solid object
one of the pilots was low on fuel at this point and started to descend for a landing and at that 
exact moment one of these ufos maneuvered itself close behind the other jet fighter 
fearing a confrontation the first pilot returned to protect his wingmate and 
the ufo then promptly shot off into the distance and disappear 
investigators ordered the pilots to never discuss the incident when local citizens outside the base 
asked for an official explanation the air force said that what the sightings were were actually 
geese that's a ridiculous debunking explanation and really makes no sense 
at all other than the fact that there is in fact a ufo cover-up so meanwhile the encounters continued 
on september 15 1964 a crew of 120 military personnel at vandenberg air force base prepared 
for the launch of an atlas f missile this launch took place as scheduled however at 
60 miles of altitude the missile mysteriously lost control and plunged into the pacific ocean 
dr robert jacobs who was then a lieutenant was actually put in charge of filming this incident 
and the next day he was called into the offices his superior major mansman to view the film 
and as robert jacobs says suddenly we saw a ufo swim into the picture it was very distinct and 
clear a round object it flew right up to our missile and emitted a flash of light then the 
ufo flew around the missile twice and set off two more vivid flashes from different angles and then 
it vanished a few seconds later our missile was malfunctioning and tumbling out of control major 
mansman asked jacobs what he thought the object was and jacobs replied a ufo and as instructed 
dr jacobs kept the incident secret for 20 years he only revealed his account after becoming concerned 
about the ufo cover-up and as a result of going public he actually received numerous harassments 
and threats researchers later contacted major mansman who confirmed this incident 
so i did present this case on my youtube episode ufos and rockets and i have quite a bit of more 
information about it if you'd like to go check it out but i thought it was important to include 
that case here because it fits right in and the sightings continued the next military base 
to be visited is san diego naval auxiliary air station on december 16 1966 
at 9 30 pm while exiting the main gate of the base helicopter pilot ensign john 
schmidt and more than a dozen other officers observe several ufos hover over the base and 
start to perform incredible aerial gymnastics and as ensign schmidt says there were three of them 
they were bright round yellow objects up about 50 000 feet and flying in a triangular formation 
we don't know what they were but none of us have ever seen anything like them we agreed that they 
couldn't be meteors they would hover then go forward then to one side they were traveling 
at speeds from about the maximum speed of a bomber to about five times that so more and more military 
officers gathered to watch this and at that point yet another ufo repaired and as ancient ensign 
schmidt says and again i quote a fourth one came over the horizon from the east at terrific speed 
it came up to the group of three stayed near the formation for a minute 
then headed east it dropped to a lower altitude and the magnitude of its light increased it 
dropped two spheres of light which disappeared then it headed west and we lost sight of it 
the other three objects suddenly disappeared we had these objects in sight for about nine minutes 
which may not sound like a long time but when you're seeing a ufo 
it is so the final case i'd like to talk about is a more recent encounter which occurred on 
february 8 1990. the witnesses in this case are residents they are the syborowski family 
and several others observed and actually photographed several ufos hovering over the 29 
palms marine corps air ground combat base which is not far from their own and as anna siborowski says 
i couldn't believe my eyes as we stood watching the three craft approach we could see their 
shapes directly against the morning's blue sky the rising sun glinted brilliantly across their smooth 
metal skins so the swarovski family and others watched for the next two hours as 
numerous craft of different sizes hovered and swooped over the base 
it was around the same time that an enormous sandstorm engulfed the base forcing all field 
exercises to be shut down and at 8 40 a.m the craft suddenly departed so there you go 
that is the cases that i found in which ufos have hovered over military bases here in california 
and i know this is just the tip of the iceberg the vast majority of cases we 
don't hear about they are covered up there is a ufo cover up i did present these cases in 
my book ufos over california a true history of extraterrestrial encounters in the golden state 
but as i said this is really just a sampling a cross section i am guessing there are probably 
dozens if not hundreds of cases of this kind but i think there's enough here to provide a really 
accurate picture of what's going on it's clear that ufos are hovering over our military bases 
as to why we can only speculate but i suspect that they are keeping tabs on our military technology 
our progress with technology and this sort of thing so yeah they're pretty interesting cases 
i hope you've enjoyed this episode and perhaps learned something but until next time i want to 
thank you for watching i truly appreciate it and as i always say keep having fun.
