OANBOARD AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT: TEN SPECTACULAR CASES
Jan 17, 2025

Summary:
Jan 17, 2025
For more than 100 years, people across the world have been taken onboard extraterrestrial craft. Many of the cases have commonalities that corroborate each other down to minute details. But they also have unique high strangeness aspects that have much to teach us. This video presents ten spectacular onboard UFO cases involving face-to-face interactions with a variety of ETs. Cases like these are the cutting edge of UFO research and have the potential to answer the many questions surrounding alien contact.

“I STARTED TO CRY.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MR GB. One summer day of 1921, an 8-year-old boy was playing along the Canal Nord in Peronne, France when two tall, thin figures in metallic jumpsuits appeared, grabbed him, and took him into a strange craft. Inside he was placed on a flexible couch in a small room. Mr. GB cried and the ETs let him go, miles from where he had been taken.

“THE SOUL LIVES FOREVER” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF EMILIA. One day in July 1942, Emilia was walking to her home in Niinisalo, Finland when a lady appeared and spoke to her telepathically. The lady brought Emilia to a flying saucer and invited her inside, showed Emilia how to fly the craft and spoke to her of spiritual subjects. After being released, she fell ill and had to be hospitalized.

“IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE IT, I CAN’T SAY I BLAME YOU.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF RICARDO MACHADO. Riding his motorbike near Pajas Blancas, Argentina one morning in April 1957, Ricardo Machado saw a disc-shaped craft ahead of him. He ditched his motorbike and hid. A man emerged from the craft, approached Ricardo, and took him onboard. Unknown to Ricardo, many people in the area were seeing UFOs.

“THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOVE US.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MR. GREENAMYER. One summer day in 1958, three boys were playing outside their homes in Novato, California when a strange silver craft appeared overhead. Two of the boys fell asleep and one of the boys was shocked to see weird figures around them. The witness had vague memories of attacking them. Later under hypnosis, he recalled being taken onboard.

THEY CAME FROM THE STARS. THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MRS. D.S. While driving to her home in Sedalia, Missouri at 11pm on August 16, 1965, a young lady was shocked to see a strange figure and a weird light in a field. She drove off in fear and arrived home to find herself missing over an hour of time. Later under hypnosis, she recalled being taken onboard a craft where she was examined by ETs.

“I SAW THREE BEINGS.”  THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MRS. G. Hanging up her clothes in her backyard in Ermington, UK one day in October 1965, a woman saw a glowing blue light hover overhead. Suddenly three figures in jumpsuits appeared, grabbed her, and used a beam of light to lift her into the craft. She found herself in a small room, but quickly passed out. She woke up in her backyard as the craft zipped away.

TAKEN TO ANOTHER PLANET. THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DIRCEU GOES. One night in June 1967, Dirceu Goes saw a glowing sphere in the sky near his home in Sarandi, Brazil. A beam of light came from the craft, carrying two short humanoids who grabbed Dirceu and pulled him onboard. He found himself in a tiny low-ceilinged room and remained there for 6 hours as the beings took him to what appeared to another world, then took him back to Earth.

THEY LOOKED LIKE INSECTS. THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF WENDEL AND NANCY. While driving one night in June 1969 near Salt Lake City, Utah, a couple was chased by a UFO. They pulled off at a rest-stop and saw a weird humanoid approaching. Later under hypnosis, both recalled being taken onboard, put in a weird chair, and examined by short ETs with blue eyes.

“THE FEELING I HAD WAS ONE OF UNDERSTANDING.” THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF LUKE. While driving near Hillsboro, Kansas one night in November 1971, “Luke” was amazed to see a silver flying saucer hover over a nearby field. He stopped his car and approached. Two short, bald, human-looking ETs wearing robes invited him onboard and gave him a tour of the craft. Afterward Luke began having psychic experiences.

AN INSECTOID PRAYING MANTIS. THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF JUNE. Driving to her home in West Palm Beach, Florida on the night of August 15, 1997, a woman was puzzled by a strange darkness descending over her car. She arrived home 30 minutes late. After having other weird encounters, she used hypnosis and recalled that she had been taken onboard a craft and examined by praying mantis type ETs.

Ten cases, each adding to the growing database of similar accounts. One case like this could be easily dismissed, or ten or even a hundred. But there are thousands of cases like these, and some researchers believe it might number in the millions. As hard as they are to believe, there are too many cases to explain away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. Humanity is in contact with aliens!

Jan 17, 2025
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal
today I'm going to be talking about the ultimate type of UFO encounter and that is the onboard UFO experience and in
fact the title of today's episode is called on board an extraterrestrial
craft 10 spectacular firsthand cases and yeah the 10 cases I've chosen for you
definitely I think fit that description these cases reach all the way back to
1921 well before the Modern Age of UFOs all the way to 1997 so pretty recent and
they come from all over the world I've chosen five cases from outside of the United States that includes England
Finland France Argentina and Brazil and five from within the United States
including California Florida Kansas Missouri and Utah these are cases that
involve a wide variety of ETS physiological evidence there's a couple
multiple witness cases which are quite rare for onboard encounters but yeah I
like these cases in particular not only because they super fascinating and very extensive but I think they have the most
potential to answer the main Central questions surrounding extraterrestrial
visitations which is who are these guys where do they come from and why are they
here what is their agenda on our planet so yeah that makes these cases I
think super important they in my opinion are The Cutting Edge of UFO research and
deserve a lot more attention than they're getting so these are cases that have
quite a bit of evidence as well and I think you'll find them super interesting
I certainly hope so but this should be pretty long episode let's just get
started and the first case I'd like to talk about today I call I started to cry
the onboard UFO encounter of Mr GB this one occurred in the summer of
1921 in Peron France this is way way before the Modern Age of UFOs in
1947 long before UFOs were at all in the news so that alone makes this case
important one of the reasons I wanted to include it it's also interesting because
the witness in this case is just a little kid 8 years old contact often starts at a very young
age so that's another reason this case is important but let's just get to it
and you can make up your own minds about it this very early case comes from a letter sent by a firsthand witness who's
known only as Mr GB was sent to the French newspaper the Paris match so this
case has not been officially investigated but it is nevertheless of interest if only because it is one of
the first known reports of somebody claiming to be taken on board a UFO Mr
GB was 8 years old at the time of his experience which occurred one hot foggy
early afternoon likely in the Autumn of 1951 and I will just quote the witness
directly because he describes it in quite some detail as he says I was one day wandering along
the slopes of the channel of Nord I was 8 years old and I love to get lost in
the moonlike Landscapes made by excavations and from the first world war
suddenly two beings wearing a flexible kind of diving suit literally leaped
among the acacia trees without any further Ado they dragged me towards what
I believed was an oddly shaped war tank they hoisted me in the machine with I
without I being able to resist I should say without me being able to want to
resist I can hardly give details on what was the apparatus and its cabin I was
undoubtedly too much upset I remember only two details that there were square
or at least rectangular Port holes the cabin had a kind of flexible couch on
which I had sat I seem to recall that their diving suits were of metallic appearance
I do not have any memory of any particular anatomical details except that the two beings were very tall and
very slim suddenly I started to cry and I do not know if that moved them but
after a few minutes an opening appeared in the ceiling of the cabin and in a few moments I found myself on the ground I
had however to walk for a large part of the afternoon until I found myself near the road which I had left 5 minutes
earlier when I I arrived home that night my parents called me a quote dirty
little liar and nobody ever wanted to believe in my story so Mr GB ended up
keeping his story a secret for more than 30 years until there was a massive wave of UFO sightings and landings which
occurred in France in late 1954 the researcher Joel Minard writes
of this case that quote in view of the numerous similar experiences witnessed
in France and elsewhere during the succeeding quarter Century incredible as
it may sound at first this case deserves serious consideration and I agree
because this clearly wasn't a tank if it had a couch inside and rectangular Port holes uh and these do not appear to be
human beings they were too slender very tall it's quite an interesting case now
the poor kid it's too bad his parents didn't believe him but he's sticking to his guns yeah that case wasn't
professionally investigated but given that it occurred so long ago well before
UFOs were even a thing I think it's an important case in that regard it's also
interesting because it shares a lot of details we see in modernday cases now let's move to another case
which I also found really compelling because it is a multiple witness case it's another very early case I call this
one the soul lives first forever the onboard UFO encounter of Amelia this is
a pseudonym the witness is anonymous but this is a really interesting case because there are some very prominent
spiritual elements to it the spiritual aspect of UFO encounters often gets
overlooked this one occurred in July of 1942 in ninis Salo Cana Finland and I
think you'll find it a super interesting definitely a case with unique elements to it this very strange case comes from
researcher tapani kuningas he's the author of several UFO books and was also
brought forward by ilka Sarah this is again one of only a handful of onboard
UFO encounters predating the Modern Age of UFOs of
1947 the main witness is Amelia again that's a pseudonym as she has requested
anonymity this experience occurred one day in July of 1942 as Amelia was walking to her home
in nanalo again in Finland after checking on the family
cows suddenly a tall middle-aged woman with short dark hair wearing dark blue
clothes appeared in front of her and began to walk along with Amelia the
woman did seem friendly and kind according to the witness but suddenly Amelia was concerned to see two tall
slender men human looking they were dragging a young boy between them who
was showing fear and did not want to go with them and Amelia recognized the boy
from a neighboring Farm she knew who he was these men did appear to be human
again they had short light brown hair and were wearing blue shirts and green
pants but things took a strange turn moments later when Amelia and this woman
Came Upon an open field and Amia could now see a quote strange ship it was
sitting on three Landing legs on the ground she said it was silver metallic about 10 ft High 21 ft wide apparently a
classic Flying Saucer and she watched as these two men dragged the protesting boy
up into this craft now at this point the woman accompanying
Amelia began to communicate to her telepathically and invited her on board
the craft C Amelia agreed she and the woman went into the craft Amelia
described being in this round room with a 6-t high control panel a table in the
center of the room there were Windows looking outside which was strange as no
windows had been visible from the outside of the craft the floor appeared to be metallic but was covered with a
rubber like carpet she said there were five men sitting around this table the
woman proceeded to ask Amelia to press a button on the console Amelia obliged and
as she did the ship immediately Rose upwards and this is when the woman began
to communicate some very interesting things to Amelia she told her that it
was possible to travel back and forth in time she told her that the soul lives
forever and that they were now quote flying towards the time when Jesus was
born the lady told Amelia that it was quote very important to know
Jesus Amelia had the impression that the woman was in charge of the craft
unfortunately there are no more details as to what actually happened the next
thing ailia knew she was outside of the craft about 1,500 ft from where the ship
had been she felt quite ill immediately vomited and rushed home she was ill for
about a month and was actually hospitalized with no appetite her eyes were red and swollen as far as the other
witness the little boy he was returned but was apparently mentally adversely
affected by his encounter because it was four years later that he ended up in a psychiatric hospital a fascinating case
for sure it's really interesting because the ETS describing this case were absolutely human-looking that has really
profound implications which points towards us having a much closer relationship to
ETS uh so perhaps uh the message that so many
contactees get from ETS that you know we do share a common Heritage is absolutely true because how could you explain this
I mean this does raise questions about human Origins and whether or not we evolved on this planet I also found it
an interesting case because there was the mention of Jesus and urging for the
witness to learn more about Jesus so this is interesting to me because there
are some people out there who feel like this is a demonic phenomenon I'm not one
of them I've certainly looked into that theory I don't find it at all persuasive
I do think such things are real but my research shows that this is an
absolutely separate and different phenomena I do believe we're dealing with extraterrestrials in the classic
sense it's my personal assessment you may have a different Theory which is of
course perfectly fine it's why I want to get this information out there in an objective unbiased way without pushing a
narrative so that everyone can make up their own minds about what's going on here so let's move to another case
because there are a lot of them these 10 cases are honestly just the tip of the iceberg and this next case is super
compelling I call this one if you don't believe it I can't blame you that of
course being a direct quote from the witness this is the onboard UFO encounter of recardo masado this
occurred on in April of 1957 in pahas blanas
Argentina and yeah a single witness case but certainly compelling because this
did not involve hypnosis neither did the two above some of the cases in this
collection do uh but these fully conscious encounters I think do have an extra level of
credibility because you can't say this was a hypnotically retrieved
memory uh and frankly the ones that are recalled through hypnosis match up per
perfectly with those that are fully conscious so that is an important detail
but yeah I think you'll find this case particularly interesting again this case received
tremendous publicity after it occurred being published in newspapers such as
the Diario de Cordoba the Cordoba Daily News and magazines such as the Flying
Saucer review and books such as the humanoids by Charles Bowen initially the
witness was Anonymous but we now know his name to be Ricardo masado following his encounter he did
Grant an interview to a journalist Antonio Perez alaman and told this
journalist quote what I am now telling you in confidence has been revealed to nobody so far and
if you don't believe it I can't say I blame you for I doubt whether anybody would believe it if I were to State the
facts openly when it happened the mere mention of flying saucers would have
meant that I would have been considered hopelessly insane now according to Ricardo it was around 7:30 a.m. one
morning in late April 1957 he was driving his motorcycle just
a few miles from the pajas Blancas International Airport heading towards
Rio saos again this is in Argentina he had just reached the pajas Blancas area
when for no apparent reason his motorcycle engine failed so Ricardo got off of his
motorcycle to check the engine and this is when he immediately noticed an enormous disc-shaped craft hovering 50
ft above the road in front of him so this caused great fear he went straight
to panic ran off the road abandon his motorcycle and hid in a ditch and he
watched as this craft lowered down to about 7 ft above the road and became
stationary he could now hear a loud hissing sound coming from it sort of
like air escaping from a tire he said and he could see that this craft was metallic with a sort of greenish bluish
iridescence to its texture Ricardo estimated that this craft was about 60 ft wide and 15 ft
High moments later a weird almost transparent looking stairway or a lift
emerged from the bottom section of this craft and came down to about 1 foot
above the road and Ricardo watched this human looking figure
emerge he was an estimated 5'8 in in height and was wearing strange clothes
of sort of plastic looking divers suit is how Ricardo described it so this figure
proceeded to look around him at the environment and then began to walk directly towards Ricardo Ricardo became
frantic with fear at this point and actually tried to dig a hole in the ground in the ditch to hide himself from
detection but the ET apparently knew he was there walked right up to him and
gracefully extended his hand to assist Ricardo out of the ditch
seeing no other choice apparently Ricardo took the man's hand and allowed him to pull him from the ditch the being
then gestured towards the craft in an apparent attempt to get Ricardo to follow him without fear but Ricardo was
still afraid he resisted at which point the man did something very interesting
just reached out and gently stroked Ricardo's forehead to calm him down and
again pointed towards the machine it apparently worked cuz Ricardo was now calm and followed the man up to the
craft up this little staircase lift and inside of it and this lift kind of
closed up into the craft and Ricardo now found himself in a large cabin he said
along the walls he saw about a half dozen 6ft wide panels each covered with
intricate equipment and television like screens other human looking beings very
much like the first one were seated in front of each panel each was dressed exactly the same way above the panels
Ricardo was amazed to see large Square Windows which puzzled him as no windows
had been visible from the outside just like the previous case now he did see
light coming in through the windows but he says that a dull phosphorescent type of light pervaded the cabin and there
was no light source visible so that puzzled him as well nobody in the craft
except for the gentleman who escorted him inside paid any attention whatsoever to Ricardo and the next thing he knew he
was being escorted out of the craft down this little staircase lift as he did so
Ricardo reached out and wrapped his knuckles against the side of the craft which rang with a sort of metallic sound
confirming that yeah it was made of metal Ricardo did ask how this craft was
able to stay afloat and the being replied with a gesture passing the palm of his hand flat over the other Ricardo
did not know what that meant but apparently this is perhaps something to do with anti-gravity pure speculation
there at any rate together they approached Ricardo's motorcycle which
the ET proceeded to inspect with curiosity Ricardo offered to start it up
but the ET again apparently communicating with gestures made Ricardo to understand that the motor mcle would
not work while the craft was there the man placed his hand on Ricardo's
shoulder apparently a goodbye gesture and then walked back into the craft the
staircase lift closed and after a short moment the craft rose quickly upward to
an elevation of about 2500 ft and zipped off very quickly and that was the
experience but here is some interesting confirmation because later that morning
at 8:45 reports of a UFO presumably the same craft came from nearby Cordoba also
Pampa Del POA and 45 minutes later at p
calamuchita and San Francisco shanar and finally at 10:00 a.m. from
aruo so quite a few people were seeing Craft on that morning and there's an interesting end
note to this case that is perhaps related because just a few months later on August 20
1957 a plane from the Argentine Air Force was forced to make an emergency
landing at quino this is in Cordova not far from the above encounter three Air
Force guards were sent to protect the plane then two had to leave to get
supplies so there was just one man left guarding this plane and he was staying inside a tent this is when heard a
persistent buzzing noise and went outside and to a shock saw a disc-shaped
craft hovering an estimated 280 ft overhead looking down on the ground he
could see the vegetation around him seemed to be agitated by the presence of the craft the guard immediately tried to
withdraw his revolver to shoot at the craft but couldn't he found it strangely stuck in its holster and this is when he
heard a soft voice coming from The Craft apparently audible which told him not to
be afraid that they had come to make the world aware of interplanetary ships that
they were setting up a station of some kind in salta not too far to establish
contact with the people of Earth in an attempt to help us as they said because
of the wrong use of atomic energy was threatening to destroy Humanity they
said that soon the rest of humanity would be aware of of ETS at this point the vegetation again
seemed to become more Disturbed the craft rose vertically another 150 ft
then moved off to the north for an onboard experience that one was
remarkably brief but we do see that it doesn't appear that this gentleman was physically examined which is certainly
the most common experience that people have when they're taken on board so
apparently he was just pulled on board to be given a tour I think there's an element here of ETS just wanting us to
know they are here but I like that case because there were seven other sightings
about in that area at that time which absolutely lends a huge amount of
corroboration to Ricardo mado's experience not to mention the other encounter by the military officer just a
few months later in the same area which I also found super compelling because once again we get this warning against
nuclear weaponry proliferation the use of nuclear material really in any
capacity it's a very prominent theme that runs through firsthand contact
cases so another important case now let's move to the next one which is not
that well known but certainly deserves to be I call this next one there was something above us that is a direct
quote from the w this is the onboard UFO encounter of Mr
greenamyer we don't know his first name unfortunately uh this case has kind of
moved Into Obscurity so I think it's important to revive it a little bit because it has some really interesting
elements to it this occurred in the summer of 1958 in Novato California and
technically this is a multiple witness case there were three four Witnesses
only one person was taken on board uh some very compelling physiological
effects afterward that point towards the veracity of this case and it's got some
other interesting details that we see a lot and some that we don't see this case
was investigated by appro the aerial phenomena research organization and primarily researcher James Harter PhD a
very well-respected researcher and also involves Leslie M lron as a hypnotist who worked with the
main witness this case involves three perhaps four Witnesses all young boys the
central witness is a 12-year-old boy Mr R greenamyer the others were 13 and 10
and 11 they were brothers this case took place in Novato not far from the
witnesses homes off Highway 37 very near the Petaluma river right on the
outskirts really of Hamilton Air Force Base it was 10000 p.m. in the afternoon
one summer day in 1958 as the three boys were playing up in the hills in front of their homes
this is a pretty rural area at that time when together they saw a quote silver
cigar-shaped object as Mr greenamyer says it appeared to be just below Treetop level on the
Ridge across the valley was above the ground and stationary it was a silvery
color it was saucer shaped it really appeared to be reflecting Sunshine we
became very excited about the thing and went to tell our mothers but they just laughed it off I went down to tell my
parents there was a flying saucer on the hill but they didn't believe us so yeah cigar shaped or saucer shaped
the witness did say that this could be a matter of perspective he's really not sure but it was definitely a solid
object and their parents did not believe them so with no help from their parents these kids were left to their own
devices to figure out what was going on and they did as the witness says so we
got our BB guns and went to the spot where it should be visible we were armed
me and my friends were out to go capture a flying saucer so we got up there and
we were looking around and we didn't see anything so we were standing around fooling around up there it was at this
point a weird feeling overcame Mr Green Amire as he says I felt like there was
something over my head I felt like there was something directly above us I sort
of wanted to look up but I didn't dare because I was scared there would be something up there you know how you get
Goose pimply your hair stands on end it was then that we heard the beeping noise
like a busy signal on a phone so right before this beeping noise Mr Green was afraid to look up and
actually asked his friend if there was anything up there and he said that there was nothing up up
there but it looked to the main witness like his friend was actually closing his eyes all the boys felt that the sun
seemed to be unusually bright and Mr Green was still too afraid to look up so
apparently there was a bright object right above them but this is unclear at
any rate they stood there for just a moment longer and then started walking towards where it sounded like this
beeping sound was coming from there there was nothing there only the cows of their neighbor Mr Benson so they were
continuing to walk around searching and investigating when something very strange happened as Mr Greener says for
some reason I felt tired or sleepy or something and lay down in the
grass so his two friends continued walking up a hill and suddenly came running back towards the primary witness
saying there's a flying saucer over there now although all three of them had just
seen one earlier and were actually looking for it for some reason Mr Green Amire didn't believe them called them
psychos but that's when he noticed that his friends were suddenly laying down on
the ground as he says I thought they were just playing with me so I didn't pay any
attention I looked up again and now this is where my story is getting kind of funny I seem to remember there were
other people standing around them who are dressed up in weird costumes like Spacemen I figured it was just somebody
trying to play a joke somebody else was trying to scare me so he started to get
a little scared he felt unsafe he wasn't sure if his friends were seeing what he
was seeing and he also wasn't sure if these strange figures standing around his friends could see him so he lay
still hoping to remain undetected and as Mr Green Amer says I
didn't want to look up to take a good square look at them I was assuming that
they were somebody from over a hill dressed and trying to pull a Halloween trick it was hard to figure out I was in
sort of a confused hazy mental attitude I don't remember for sure whether
somebody approached me and then went back or approached all the way up to me first I do remember that there was a
pair of feet standing there sort of Gray boots or something like dark
gray so at this point the witness's memory of events becomes a little bit
jumbled he does remember shouting at whoever was there not receiving any answer he remembers looking up at them
and seeing something that really scared him and he also remembers something else
as he says I seem to remember having either shot at one of these people with a BB gun and it having no effect I seem
to remember that I hit somebody with the gun and the others thrashing around somehow I lost my BB gun I turned around
and I ran and I fell down I remember thinking there's something all over
watching me fall so yeah events get a little confusing he does recall hearing a
second series of beeping noises he believed at one point he did lose Consciousness because as the witness
says when I woke up again I I had my eyes closed when I woke up after the
second series of beeping I was no longer laying there I was standing in a little
hollow space in the trees around the edge and none of us had our BB guns we
had BB guns when we went up there and I asked them his friends if they had seen
where it quote the beeping had come from they were still interested in finding where the beeping was coming from and
they said they had their eyes closed and didn't know where it came from so we left then after that we found our BB
guns they found theirs in the same place where I saw them laying down but mine
was not there I found mine down the hill it was in rather sad shape and had a
grass underneath the lever the plastic stop was broken so clearly something had
happened that they don't fully recall and this was when he did recall swinging his gun like a bat at one of the beings
and or shooting at them now with their guns in hand they started to walk home and the entire incident was
not discussed as Mr Greener says we didn't say a word going down the hill
and happily up the street and we figured that was kind of odd you know there should be something said but nothing
happened we got home and our parents asked where have you been all day our
mothers wanted to know where we had been all afternoon and to their shock it was now about near Sunset hours had passed
where it seemed like it had been only minutes they did rush back up to the spot for a second L and sure enough
there was that craft still in the sky as Mr Greener says was back at the original
position where we saw it in the first place we just gave it up as crazy
then so following this incident the kids did get in a fight they never talked to
each other again this subject became kind of taboo the sister did mention it
once but that's it however following this incident the witness did dream
about it and he did recall seeing a being standing over him with quote large
slanted eyes he saw what looked like two tubes going up to its head and he also
had some pretty prominent physiological effects directly related to this incident he says he developed sores on
his body and he also had two strange bruises on his chin and suffered some
hair loss so the witness did not discuss this incident for years but about 5
years later he was on an airplane flight from LA to Dallas when the pilot made an
amazing announcement as Mr greenamyer says the pilot said look out the left
side of the plane way up in the air there's something up there it looks like a flying saucer we can't I identify it
it can't be a weather balloon because it's going against against the jet stream that's up there so the pilot
actually announced a UFO outside the plane I know of other cases like this
but per the witness everybody on the plane scrambled to the windows to look
and he saw a quote a bright aluminum object up there that looked like a disc
everybody on the plane was looking out the window so it was this incident that reignited his interest in UFOs and in
his own personal experience he ended up obtaining a UFO book by coral and Jim
Lorenzen contacted them and was interviewed and
hypnotized so under hypnosis he recalled this incident he
recalled being taken up into the craft and physically examined the beings were described as
quote Spacemen he said they were 5T tall with big heads Big Eyes stubby little
fingers he recalled that the one of these ETS inserted two tube like devices
into his chin apparently where these bruises were later found and he believes
they were taking a blood sample there's likely more information on this case but
has never been released interesting however is another case which occurred in the same area and
around the same time her the National UFO Reporting Center around July 15
1958 at 5:30 p.m. a man and his father were driving along Highway 101 right by
Novato when they noticed a small fire in a field not far away so they turned and
looked and saw the cause of the fire as the witness says we saw this shiny
greenish object about 30 to 40 ft in diam Dieter next to the edge of the San
Francisco Bay then the object took off almost in a 45° angle towards us moving
at such a great speed that after a few moments it just got smaller and smaller until it disappeared the saucer was
totally quiet it had no lights that we could see and it left the grass field
totally burning so the witness's father urged him not to talk about it and he didn't
not for 40 years later had he finally reported it to newfork in hopes that someone else in the area had seen
something similar to confirm his own sighting so these two events could very
well be related and there's another interesting case in Novato which deserves mentioning a couple of them
actually one occurred on the evening of October 23rd 1975 when four Witnesses saw a ring of
Lights which they said was 50 ft wide this is interesting because later that at night one of the witnesses was in her
kitchen and looking outside she saw a quote man in a metallic suit that had no
eyes a slit for a mouth and a pointy looking head she screamed and this F
figure ran up a hill she said faster than a person could go and was gone
later that night her sons saw a glowing object among the trees in that area and
going there the next morning they found three four foot wide circles on the ground in the shape of a triangle with
the grass spun in the same direction in each of these circles so more Landing
traces and finally there was another case which occurred on April 15
1989 when two witnesses saw what they described as a vertical dumbbell-shaped
object quote like two spheres connected together this object had a glowing halo
around it they actually used binocular and said that they could see four smaller golden discs around them another
weird thing they noticed was a quote strange absence of kids and dogs at the
time so perhaps the Oz effect is taking place I think you'll agree that's a
pretty interesting case and although the his memory of the onboard segment is
somewhat sketchy and pretty brief it's clearly an important case and that there
were multiple Witnesses and for that matter other sightings occurring in that
area it could be significant that this is pretty close to Hamilton
AFB hard to say for sure what's going on here but certainly a very interesting
case now let's move to the next one I call this next one they came from the
stars the onboard Encounter of Miss DS this one occurred August 16 1965 in
sadelia Missouri this is an important case this is one that involves missing
time so the memories were recovered using the technique of hypnotic
regression but the missing time aspect has certainly been verified and it's an important case because it's a fairly
extensive encounter with a lot of information that I found quite
interesting and some unique and some actually quite familiar this little
known case was investigated by respected researcher Jerome Clark along with the assistance of a hypnotist by the name of
Ron Owen the witness is anonymous known only by her initials DS so I'll use the
pseudonym Debbie at the time of her encounter Debbie lived on the northwest
edge of sadelia this is in Missouri it was around 10:45 5 p.m. on August 16
1965 that she decided to drive to the local drugstore this is about 5 to 10
minutes from her home so she could pick up some diapers and cigarettes she was on her return trip
probably around 11:00 p.m. just a few blocks from her house when she saw
something really unusual which caused her to slow down to take a better look at it she saw what appeared to be a
unusual looking figure in the ditch to her right he appeared to be picking
things up off the ground and as she drove by him or towards him he turned
and waved at her then he stumbled as though he was trying to come out of the ditch and moved towards her she did also
notice a strange Smoky light in the field next to the road but all of this looked strange to her and kind of
concerned her so she drove off and this is when she saw what she thought were
too large large birds one of which flew directly at her car she was confused
afraid disoriented she stepped on the gas and rushed the short distance home
but when she arrived home her husband was very angry because it was now 12:25
a.m. and he wanted to know where she had been Debbie was unable to account for
about 1 hour and 20 minutes of time and all she could tell her husband was that
she remembered seeing some kind of giant bird some flashing lights a figure she
wondered if there had been a car accident or something but none of it made any sense and the whole incident
puzzled her for many years at the time she had no knowledge of UFOs or ETS it
wasn't until years later after speaking with researcher Jerome Clark that she
realized this was UFO related she agreed to undergo hypnotic regression to the
time of the incident and under hypnosis an entire different scenario emerged
what she thought were two birds were in fact two 5 foot tall figures dressed in
onepiece suits which covered them pretty much from head to toe except for their
eyes as she drove up to them they were standing in a ditch on the right side of the road one appeared to be holding a
container or a sack of some kind on its back while the other was collecting samples of grass rocks and soil and
putting them into the bag she said their movements were strangely stiff almost robotic especially their
arms which almost seemed to flop up and down somewhat in the manner of a bird
flapping its wings hence the screen memory of birds at any rate under
hypnosis she recalled that one of these figures tried to climb out of the ditch which she she remembers this fully
consciously but this figure slipped got up and then successfully climbed out of
the ditch and began began to walk towards her car gesturing for her to
stop Debbie says that at this point her car engine failed and a feeling of
Terror and helplessness overwhelmed her the figure walked right up to her car
and she could see that it was dressed in this fullbody jumpsuit kind of like a
mummy is how she put it it shown a light on her face this caused her to become
immobilized she said she also felt some pain in her legs and in her head looking
at the field she could now see a large glowing object the shape of a football
it moved and landed on the road it had been very bright but now she could see
that it was metallic she said it had a bright red light and a number of white lights along
the bottom so the figure next to her car walked around the car while the other in
the ditch moved towards the craft on the road she saw a door open in the lower
section of the craft and two or three additional figures came out she said
they looked largely human except the head was more pointed the eyes kind of wrapped around the sides of their head
had a very thin mouth just a line with no lips they were 5 and 1/2 ft tall in
some ways this does sound like Grays but at any rate they came up to the car opened the door and led her out of the
car towards the object object one spoke to her telepathically saying she would
not be hurt but that she must come with them he would be the only one who
communicated with her through the whole experience so they actually carried her
because she was unable to walk she They carried her up what she thought were some stairs into the craft and once
inside her first impression was a difficulty breathing cuz the air felt
heavy she said she's not entirely sure of the sequence of events but she did
recall that the craft appeared to lift up off the road this caused the interior
lights of the craft to change from white to Red the craft then landed in the field and one of the ETS told her that
they had to move off the road to avoid detection that they had in fact moved her car as well she was then taken to a
room with rounded walls and a metal table she was instructed to lie down on the table she said that there were three
humanoid figures in the room the one who was speaking to her who she perceived to be the leader and sort of a doctor or
scientist there were two others who were about a foot shorter Their Eyes Were rounder than the leader their skin was
very wrinkly whereas the leaders was smooth she had the impression that these other smaller Figures were quite a bit
older she did notice that the leader had an Insignia on his chest which portrayed
three rings the second figure one of the shorter ones had a symbol that looked to
her like a red lightning bolt and Debbie had the impression that this figure was a female and that she was the pilot of
the craft these two smaller figures made her fearful and uncomfortable she did
not like them they looked quite different she did recall the female one carrying a tray of some kind into the
room and this is when she was examined the leader began to remove Debbie's clothes with the assistance of the other
two they examined her hair they took a skin scraping the leader examed her feet
and Debbie had the impression that he was excited to see her red toenail polish apparently thinking that it was
their natural color and he told her that their people don't have toes and
actually showed her a model of their feet to demonstrate the lack of toes the
leader then took a round black object out of the wall which they placed on or
over her head this object this instrument glowed with a blue light she
felt a brief flash of pain kind of like pens is how she put it almost felt like
they were penetrating the top of her head and entering into her brain she felt as if her body was being quote
blown up with air or something they then showed her a screen on the wall which
showed this weird pattern of of about seven vertical lines with weird dots and
dashes between them all of different colors and they told her that they were taking pictures of her body and that
this was a representation of that so she's looking at these strange symbols and she told the leader that she didn't
look like that this caused the leader to smile that was her impression but
without speaking all she had to do was think she asked the leader why they were doing this and he told told her it was
to determine the differences between people she asked them do you live
nearby and he told her no that his home was in the sky far away now apparently
unaware of UFOs and not believing in Aliens she told the ET that this was
impossible that people don't live in the sky and he told her that in fact they do
and this is when he showed her a star map on the computer-like screen pointed
to one of the stars and said that this was their home world he explained that they had come to Earth to collect
samples he told her that they cooperated with other ETS on specific projects but
one of the problems was that human aircraft would chase them and cause
trouble for them so after being physically examined and having this short conversation Debbie was escorted
out of the ship back to her car which was now back on the road where it had been when the experience began the
figures returned into the craft which rose upward just a short distance and then seemed to vanish Debbie drove off
in fear and all she she could recall consciously was a vague impression of
this figure in a ditch two birds flapping their wings one coming towards their car and this blinking light in a
field I think that's an important case for a number of reasons not only because of the the information that the witness
learned but how easily a onboard encounter can sort of slip past the
memory of a witness who was left only with the idea that she had encountered
bird coming at her car a vague memory of a man waving at her this sort of thing
lights off the side of the road makes me wonder how many people have had an onboard encounter and sort of just
dismiss it as an unusual event and perhaps didn't even notice that they had
missing time and again I do think hypnosis done correctly is a valid tool
to recall memories on board uh a UFO uh because as I said the
hypnotically recalled memories do in fact match up with those that are consciously
recalled so another amazing case and let's move to the next one which I call
I saw three beings the onboard UFO encounter of Mrs G like many witnesses
she elected to be anonymous camp Lamer the ridicule and disbelief surrounding
this subject persists to this day and this one occurred years ago in October
of 1965 in Herington England and while
there isn't a whole lot to this case I found found it to be really interesting
I was initially hesitant to include this case because the details on it are quite sparse but it does come from a highly
respected uk-based researcher and Scientist by the name of Jay Bernard
deair and this case is important because it illustrates that many people who have an onboard encounter often don't
remember much of what happened on board and are essentially left with amnesia of the event the witness did help ever
remember seeing humanoids also the witness speaks about the event in her
own words says the researcher Bernard deair we take this report seriously her
story is very graphic and fits many others she is so frightened of not being
taken seriously that we may name her only as Mrs G so this case took place in
Herington this is in Devon UK this is the epitome of a quaint little
English Village and it's happened one day in October of
1965 Mrs G was out in her backyard hanging closeup when she noticed a
bright glowing blue object coming directly towards her from the north section of the sky and as she says in
her own words the light hovered Over the Garden I was petrified I dropped the
washing there I was completely enveloped in bubbles of light I saw three beings who
look like men they did not speak they were each about 5T tall wearing bluish
metallic like clothing they grasped me by the arms and we were lifted up a beam
of light into a kind of room there were more men there I was given the impression that I would come to no harm
a little later I found myself back on my lawn I felt a sharp blow on the back of
my neck I was stunned but not hurt when I looked around the thing set off at
great speed and disappeared so yeah she did remember part of what happened on board Bernard
deair the investigator points out that the witness had just given birth to her son one month earlier which may be
significant as we do know that ETS do show an interest in human reproduction
ultimately he did find her story very believable able as he says to many that
would sound incredible but there have been many reports of experiences similar in almost every detail from many
countries in recent years alone such reports mean little but more and more
totally unrelated accounts come up with the same details these people are
representative of all walks of life from dustmen to policemen to Architects to
scientists it is just not possible that all these people none of whom have ever met and
whose accounts have rarely been published could agree on so much and at
the same time be making it all up I totally agree apparently there is more
detail to this case but that's all I could find would really love to talk to
that witness directly because it's pretty rare that a person has a one-off
and by that I mean a singular encounter again most often contact is something
that occurs throughout a person's life particularly if they have an onboard
experience they more likely than not have had experiences as a young child
and throughout their life so we know that again there's more to this case but
the vast majority of these cases go undocumented unrecorded uninvestigated
people have I think the misconception that this is a rare event but the more I
do this research the more common I think these events are and I'll just briefly again mention that in 1991 the rer
organization did a poll which found that one in 50 people show the markers of
being a UFO contacte so yeah far more common than certainly the general public
believes here's another case which speaks to that point this one is really
unusual I call this one taken to another planet this is the onboard UFO encounter
of deir goz this one occurred in June of 1967 in Sandi Brazil and again a fully
conscious onboard experience with some a really unusual type of ET human looking
but not quite and the events that this gentleman experienc exped on board this
craft are also really unusual it was around 9900 p.m. one evening in June
1967 that a handyman by the name of dersu goz you can see him here was
walking to his home on the outskirts of the town of Sandi this is located in Rio
Grand doou Brazil this is when his life changed forever he was at the
intersection of a road leading to Pala Das misos he was only about 600 ft from
his home very close when he saw this glowing sphere about 600 ft away and
about 100 ft off the ground but very quickly it descended to a height of
about 30 ft right in front of him sent down this beam of light to the ground
right next to him and to his amazement two small beings descended down this
beam of light in a very interesting way they kind of spiraled down this beam of
of light a short distance from it and these beings were not human as we would
think of it they were 3T tall they had round human looking faces blue eyes
stray red hair a normal nose and mouth he noticed they had teeth they wore gray
suits that wrapped all the way down to their feet went right up to a high collar with belts the same color around
their waists they immediately approached him pasted some kind of quote ribbon
under his arms he was stunned and helpless unable to resist as he found himself being drawn up this beam of
light through a round opening into the bottom of the craft he could immediately
see that this was very small in fact the room he estimates was maybe 4' 9 in tall
forcing him who he was 5 feet 2 in to bend over he immediately you know it was
no bigger than the truck cab is how he put it uh he said the light inside this
room constantly pulsated to a blinding brightness to a dim darkness which made
it difficult for him to focus he was immediately met by a third occupant
inside this craft who led him promptly to a short single pedestal stool about 1
foot high then pulled off this ribbon-like device that had brought him in it was at this moment that a light
came down from the the ceiling of the cabin down through the still open Hall in the floor and the two crew members
who had met him were still on the ground they rose up this beam of light again in this weird spiraling motion keeping
their eyes on the beam as they had when they descended now inside the craft they
began to speak verbally to each other and sometimes to him in a language he was unable to understand but he did say
they had very pleasant voices he says he was in The Craft for a good 3 hours he
could see there was nothing in there really except this small window and a panel uh this small window next to him
was dark but after about 3 hours looking out he saw that it was Daylight outside
and looking outside he saw something amazing a strange apparently alien
looking City with tall buildings and dark forests he saw this just briefly when
this window went dark again three more hours passed was during this time that the ETS did show him this
illuminated panel on the wall uh and as at the end of the 3 hours
uh they show this panel lit up and it showed strange vehicles and humanoids
who appeared to be looking at him so much of the et's conversation did seem to center around this panel and when
they got back to where he had been taken craft lowered to about 9 9 ft above the
ground the witness was wrapped up in this weird ribbon-like device again and let down to the ground to about one foot
the ribbon unraveled from his body and went up into the craft the door closed
and the craft flew away at an angle disappearing in mere seconds the witness was so unnerved so weakened by his
experience that he lay on the ground for about 10 minutes before he was able to get up he felt a very strong urge to
urine and was shocked when only air came out at first he then was able to urinate
normally but this strange condition lasted for a few days for one week following his
encounter he did suffer from fever weakness and severe diarrhea he remained
bedridden he lost considerable weight he said headaches and weakness persisted for a full month he stayed at home to
recuperate did not seek medical attention how amazing is that there are
a surprisingly large number of cases where people claim to have been taken to another planet beyond Earth that this
something like this is almost impossible to prove and again this is a single
witness case he did have some pretty pronounced medical effects which
certainly Point towards the credibility of his case to me it's the huge number
of cases with remarkable commonalities that provide the best proof that
something very profound is going on here I'm absolutely convinced people are being taken on boardcraft and as you may
know I had my own experience with this and having talked to so many hundreds of
people who have I am Way Beyond convinced that this is going on there
are just too many cases of people who report this cuz here is another I call
this next case they looked like insects the on board UFO encounter of Bill and
Nora this is a super compelling case because it was very thoroughly investigated it is a multiple witness
case it's got all kinds of really interesting details to it this one
occurred in June of 1969 in Salt Lake City Utah and again not a very
well-known case but certainly deserves to be this case comes from researcher Jerome Clark who did publish it in the
Flying Saucer review and he calls it quote a story that until fairly recently
even ethologists would have dismissed as unbelievable but as he says there is no
doubt in my mind that the witnesses gave me a straightforward honest account of what happened to them at least as they
understood it the name of the article in the Flying Saucer review is a weird encounter in Utah this case involves
three Witnesses we first knew them as Bill and nor but we now know their names to be Wendell Meyer and Nancy Jensen a
young couple that Jerome Clark describes as quote hippies turns out he actually knew them as acquaintances from
college uh also this case involves their two-year-old son Aaron the witnesses had
left their homes in Morehead Minnesota and were traveling to California on vacation it was around 1 a.m. one
evening in junee of 1969 the were traveling westbound Southwest of Salt Lake City when
something very unusual happened as Wendell says all of a sudden it was like
I woke up in fact his last memory consciously had been seeing the lights
of Salt Lake City but waking up he saw the car was traveling at 90 mph and he
was unable to prevent himself from hitting a white post and then in succession three other white posts this
accident of course stopped the car and the car was damaged it had a flat tire
broken shock absorber a broken turn signal there was a small dent on the bumper which the witnesses felt was
quite strange because they really felt like there should have been more damage given how fast they were going so
Wendell proceeded to change the tire and he said that while he did so he had a very strange feeling that they were
being watched Nancy Took the Wheel they drove a short distance when Nancy began
to get an uncomfortable feeling that they were being followed and looking in the rear view mirror she saw yellow and
white lights she thought it was a car at first didn't think much of it until she
noticed that they were on the wrong side of the highway so she told Wendell and both of them watched this object these
lights until suddenly they moved off to the left and were gone now this was strange because there was no turnoff
that they had noticed there so they began to move into an a mountainous area
and this is when Wendell looked up and saw what appeared to be the same lights the same object and he turned to Nancy
and said it's in the air now now Nancy later told researcher Drome Clark quote
that's when we started getting paranoid so strangely this object began to Pace
their car at an even distance behind them it then suddenly flew to within a
few hundred feet close enough that they could hear a quote faint humming sound
it said this object was almost fish-shaped with a flat bottom what looked like a fin on the back it had a
red light on top a dome in front and it was so bright that it nearly blinded
them at this point they both felt quote funny vibrations moving through their
bodies uh their 2-year-old son Aaron began to cry Nancy later said that it
was as if her whole body became numb then weirdly the back window opened 1 in
by itself and then closed again by itself their little baby Aaron stopped
crying now panicked they floored the accelerator but the car which had been going 70 dropped down to
60 and Wendell told Nancy oh Christ it's going to get us but the UFO suddenly
backed off so shortly later they turned off into a rest area and the object also
stopped and hovered in near silence just on the other side of the highway they
did notice a white camper at the rest stop with its lights on so Nancy suggested that Wendell go and inform
them of the UFO but Wendell felt uneasy about it and it was shortly later that
they both saw a quote ghostly face peering at them from the camper window
they later said it was quote bony peculiar not quite human in fact Wendell
would later recall it as having sort of an egg-shaped head a pointed chin wraparound eyes very much a description
of a gray ET but events escalated when suddenly Wendell gasped and pointed towards this
strange glowing figure that was approaching them from the opposite side of the highway where the UFO was
hovering he said it was somewhat reminiscent of a big snowman with a big round body he drew it as you can see it
did have arms and legs but but it was moving slowly towards them weirdly Nancy
couldn't see it so Wendell told her to turn on the headlights which she did at
which point the figure seemed to disappear when she turned off the headlights wendle got a huge shock
because he could see this figure again and it was now much closer to him now
while Nancy says she didn't see it as she told researchers quote I was trying
so hard to keep my sanity maybe I didn't want to see it so there's some confusion
going on at this point they were very frightened they pulled back on the highway immediately positioned
themselves between two cars because this object continued to follow them Nancy
started to feel an extreme quote mental strain she could barely keep awake so
they had to pull over so Wendell could drive but Wendell had the same problem so they kept continually having to
switch drivers a few times and the UFO continued to show up and
Pace their car weirdly they could not get the car to go faster than 55 miles
hour finally they did reach a small town they pulled into a gas station and the
UFO which had been close to their car flew up and seemed to mimic a star
Wendell did point it out to the gas station attendant who said something very interesting he said quote some
drunk fired at a flying saucer yesterday day and he kind of chuckled uh so they got back on the
highway and this UFO dropped down again and continued to Pace their car it would
back off when other cars would approach uh but move closer when they were alone on the road finally as
daylight came the highway became busier with cars the UFO backed off and up and
when daylight actually arrived it moved off into the clouds over a mountain and was gone so both Nancy and Wendell were
exhausted actually had to pull off on the side of the road to sleep for 2 hours the high strangeness wasn't over
yet at 8:30 a.m. they got back on the highway past what appeared to be the
same camper they had seen at the restop so curious Nancy looked over at it and
screamed as she says Wendell those people don't have any heads she later
elaborated and said that she saw the dim outline of heads and a weird chesher cat
like grins it looked to them to her rather that these figures were wearing
black leather Suits now Wendell didn't see this he was driving he was skeptical
and said you're just shaking up I'll slow down and we'll let the camper pass us then we'll know for sure so he slowed
down they went around a corner but the camper never appeared around the corner it just seemed to have disappeared which
again was weird because there were no exits there in the highway they proceeded to enter another small town
and were very spooked to see that not one person was visible in the whole town
plenty of parked cars but not one living person as Wendell said it was like
stepping into the Twilight Zone so they left one month later there was another
sighting the car broke down about 15 miles north of Morehead Minnesota where they lived and wend did see another UFO
with red green and blue lights that he says quote didn't fit the form of an airplane he said the object moved across
the highway circled around them moved closer and closer stopped and
vanished so back at home weird things started to happen wend says a hooded
faceless figure appeared out of nowhere lunged at him and disappeared the same
thing happened to Nancy while she was scrubbing the kitchen floor got a trembling feeling turned around saw this
weird faceless hooded figure which jumped at her Wendel started to get paranoid that he was being followed he
saw the same hooded figure twice more he thought once on his lunch break at work
and once sitting in the backseat of his car in February of 1970 he was in a
hospital room resting from a quote minor ailment when this figure appeared again
only this time he could see that had long thin fingers he felt like it was trying to communicate with them but he
did not want any anything to do with it so Jerome Clark's article in the Flying Saucer review was written in 1970 just a
few months after all of this occurred but it was 5 years later that he arranged for the couple to go under
hypnosis he used a hypnotist who was skeptical of UFOs despite this going under hypnosis
both Wendell and Nancy did recall being taken on board a craft Jerome Clark told
the story in D Scott rogo's book alien abductions in a chapter called the ultimate
abduction there were six hypnosis sessions two for Nancy and Wendell had
four under hypnosis Nancy recalled that after they had parked the rest stop she
was actually floated up out of the car through the windshield into the UFO
inside this craft she says she saw 20 short humanoids with white skin
oversized heads and large green insect like eyes and she says they look like
insects like grasshoppers she said they wore white uniforms they seemed to
communicate among each other with a quote buzzing or mumbling she said the room was white circular she did see Str
a strange curved panel with weird instruments on it she actually believes
that perhaps the ETS may have lifted her out of her physical body into the craft
and afterwards placed her back in her body perhaps this is because she was puzzled to move through the car window
at any rate that was her impression but Wendell who knew nothing of what Nancy
had recalled under hypnosis first recalled seeing a figure through the
Dome of the craft he also recalled being floated up from the car at the rest stop
into a quote round room he said had a clear Dome on top he actually see the sky through this Dome
like Nancy he saw a panel with strange gauges and dials like Nancy he said the
room was filled with this weird foggy white light and like Nancy he said he
saw a group of quote little people he described them as having big heads no hair small round mouths little noses and
like Nancy very big green eyes and wearing white uniforms Z says they look
strange they look like insects he like Nancy described was also placed
in a chair where he couldn't move neither Nancy or Wendell ever saw each
other so they were apparently in separate rooms but Wendell said the ETS communicated telepathically with him and
could read his mind and each time they did so it made him feel tired it seemed
to Cluster around a large device in the room which was somehow related to his
examination he would study it and the beings did not want him to look at them and what they were
doing they began to do something to his body and at this point he fell unconscious and when he woke up he was
not only back in the car the car was now moving down the highway his impression
that was that this whole experience lasted about 20 to 30 minutes now per Jerome Clark the hypnotist was severely
shaken by this and ultimately pulled out did not want to do any more sessions and
and the witnesses felt the same way the hypnotist did insert a post hypnotic
suggestion that both Wendell and Nancy would forget the sessions so they had no memory of the onboard segment and at
first they actually refused to listen to the tapes but some years later after meeting with researcher Leo sprinkle he
reassured them and had them listen to the tapes so they were able to recall
what had happened to them that case is in many ways a fairly standard onboard
UFO encounter where people were taken on board and examined by your typical gray
type ETS I did find the detail that they had striking green eyes quite
interesting because that is something I've heard from a number of witnesses and while hypnosis was used in this case
the many many details that match up between the two witnesses who did not communicate with each other because
again the hypn IST uh basically gave them the suggestion not to remember
their encounters so they didn't know what the other person had recall and yet these details match up to an incredible
degree that pretty much makes the explanation of collusion or
hoaxing almost impossible uh in fact the investigators
involved in this case were absolutely convinced so well respected
investigators too I think and again if it were just one case or even 10 or a
100 you could probably dismiss them more easily but it's thousands upon thousands
here's another one I like this case because it was very much benevolent again a very strong spiritual aspect to
it I know researchers who have actually edited censored out spiritual aspects of
people's Encounters in an attempt to reduce this to a sort of nuts and bolts
phenomenal and make it more believable I think that's a mistake we really need to look
at all the evidence if we want to solve the mystery of UFOs if you can even call
it that at this point but more importantly we need all the pieces of the puzzle to really figure out what's
going on here I call this next case the feeling I had was one of understanding
the onboard UFO encounter of Luke again unfortunately this is a
pseudonym the witness wanted to remain anonymous and you can't blame him given the
hostility that many people who do report this Ang go public receive from those
that they share their experience with this one occurred in November of 1971 in Hillsboro Kansas tiny little
town but a certainly really compelling case because it is a fully conscious
onboard experience also which occurred during daylight which is somewhat rare
but absolutely not unique as we've seen in this compilation alone the only real
source of information for this case comes from a newspaper article by John Row in the Witchita Kansas Beacon
newspaper but the encounter was apparently investigated by researcher Richard palasio who John row calls quote the
Johnny Apple seat of UFO sightings could not locate the investigator but the sole
witness is anonymous and is known only as Luke he's described as a college student majoring in English a poet and
as Richard palasio says just your average guy the exact time of the
encounter is unknown other than it occurred in November of
1971 Luke was driving near Hillsboro Kansas this is a small town with a
population of about 25 200 people when he saw a bright silver saucer-shaped
craft zoomed down out of the sky and hover about 12 ft above the ground over
a field alongside the road Luke immediately pulled his car over to look
at it and he was curious so he walked right up to this craft and as soon as he
did a hatch opened a ramp came out leading to the ground two beings walked
out he said that they were 4 and 1/2 ft tall very much human-like faces but
large bald heads both wore white robes the immediately began to communicate
with Luke telepathically giving a feeling giving him a feeling of calmness
and security he found himself able to talk with them mentally telepathically and
ask them if they could stay and let him go inside the craft and they agreed the
ETS guided Luke up the ramp and into the craft he said it had a shiny acrylic
like floor a very brightly lit ceiling he saw what looked like comp computer Banks lined up against one wall there
was a control panel with five rows of four buttons each and next to the panel
was a window and two high-backed chairs that Were Somehow supported by invisible
swivels which faced these panels this visit was quite short apparently limited
to this very brief tour of the craft which Luke said was entirely benevolent
when asked if he had any fear at all during this experience he said not at all I was shocked but never worried the
overall feeling I had was one of warmth and understanding and in fact following
this experience Luke began having psychic experiences such as seeing auras
around people and having outof body experiences which allowed him he says to
have contact with other interdimensional beings that he says are quote difficult
to explain and as it turns out this is not the first time Hillsboro has been
visited because it was four years earlier on March 21st 1967 a very close encounter involving
strange electromagnetic effects caught the attention of researchers coral and
Jim Lorenzen on that night One Mile West of Hillsboro just off US Highway
56 Mary Beth newfeld and several of her girlfriends were driving when they saw a
brilliant lightning in the sky this puzzled them because it was a very cloudy night no stars were visible
through the cloud cover but on a lark they drove towards this light and as if
in response this light flashed back at them and then moved directly towards them as it got close they could see it
was a flat pancake shaped craft with a dome on top like quote an upside down
Cup in seconds this object was directly over their car which quote started rock
in real bad everyone in the car became understandably alarmed especially when
the car engine stalled after several seconds the object left as quickly as it arrived the car
started up again and the frightened Witnesses drove straight into Hillsboro
to report their encounter pretty interesting it doesn't at all surprise
me that this witness started reporting out of body experiences and telepathic
contact with the ETS following his encounter because that is actually a very prominent pattern that I think when
we don't hear about it might not be reported but is in fact present because
again some of these details often do get censored out of people's accounts which is such a shame because it's super
interesting and I think a very important detail this points towards one of the ET
agendas of waking us up to our own abilities I think this is one of the reasons people are contacted they're
trying to wake us up to all these what we would call supernatural abilities
that we have not just telepathy and Clairvoyance but astral projection remote viewing mediumship healing so
much more so it's an important detail that we should not Overlook in my humble
opinion now let's move to the last and final case in this collection which I
call an insectoid praying m antis the onboard UFO encounter of June again
we're dealing with a person who wants to remain anonymous so kudos to everyone
who has had the courage to use their real name uh that is happening more and more as skepticism and disbelief and
ridicule is falling by the wayside still have a lot of work to do as this case
shows which is a fairly recent case this occurred in August 15 1997
in West Palm Beach Florida it's an important case because as we'll see this
person was taken on board a craft in a pretty crowded location and as
researchers will tell you this kind of experience can really occur pretty much
anywhere the final case in this little compilation was investigated by Florida muang group Miami Skys scan it occurred
around 8:00 p.m. on August 15 1997 to a woman known only as June she
had just left a friend's house in the Lake Park area of West Palm Beach Florida when suddenly she noticed a
strange heavy Darkness around her vehicle it got so dark that the street
lights themselves seemed defused and dimmer than normal she continued to drive but this weird effect increased
finally she was approaching the traffic light at Park Avenue by the railroad
crossing you can see it here she was puzzled to see three cars were stopped on each side of the intersection as if
the light was red on all sides that was weird she also noticed this weird
strange dark tunnel effect on Park Avenue itself in fact by this time the
weird Darkness had turned the street lights she says into quote pin Pricks of
light so after what seemed like a long time the light turned green June had no
choice but to drive into this weird tunnel of darkness and by now the darkness was so pervasive that she was
not only having trouble seeing the street itself but the instruments on her car dashboard so she slowed way down
crept down the street finally she arrived home badly frightened by this weird inexplicable experience only to
find that this drive which normally took 15 minutes had taken 45 minutes so
that's a full half hour of missing time which couldn't be explained by the fact that she was driving a little slowly but
later having other encounters she agreed to go under hypnosis to recall what happened during the missing half hour
and under hypnosis she recalled an onboard experience she was taken back to
the moment when she approached the intersection of Park Avenue by the railroad crossing and suddenly she says
this bright light was all around her June found herself disoriented unable to
move and the next thing she knows she's in a strange room with quote Shadows all
around her she said this room had curved walls that glowed with a green light this included both the floor and the
ceiling but it did look metallic almost like Platinum she said she could smell
an unpleasant odor in the air she had difficulty breathing but looking across
the room she saw strange little people looking at her so she focused on one of
them and saw that he looked like an insectoid PR mantis about 4T tall very
skinny body two holes for a nose a beak like protrusion on his face where the
mouth is large dark eyes and what looked like antenna coming out of his head he
wore a skin tight gray jumpsuit with a belt he had four fingers on each hand
and in one of his hands he held a thin rod bright and shiny about a foot long
with a light at the end the being proceeded to touch June all over her body he placed the rod either on or in
her body she yelled at him to stop she said she has no memory of any pain or
being hurt so that's good but the next thing she knew she was driving through
this weird tunnel again she remembered opening the car door to see if she could see the street but she couldn't see it
she let her foot off the car's clutch the car didn't sway at all she actually felt like the car was floating CU she
could not feel the road underneath her car she did recall seeing the dimness of the street lights and finally recalled
making it home pretty interesting it makes me wonder what's so important that this person was basically pulled from a
city street when other cars were around don't know it's hard to say what
exactly the purpose for all of this is it appeared to be a pretty Brief Encounter she was being physically
examined again I I know in fact that this case is not a oneoff she does
report other encounters uh so there is more to this case certainly but a really interesting
one because she did describe praying mantis type ETS which while are
consistently reported are not super common by far people report some
variation of Grays next would be I think human looking tall whites little blue
beings but praying mantis are definitely in there and strange humanoids as we've seen of all types I mean that case from
Argentina how strange is that short little three-foot beings that looked
human except had straight red hair and bright uh blue eyes really unusual each
of these cases has something to teach us and again if it were just one or two easy to dismiss but there's thousands
upon thousands there's no doubt that there is something going on here it's a
logical progression if you think about it so many sightings millions of documented
sightings somebody is piloting these things UFOs do have contents they're
just not empty shell as we can tell because not only from the reports of
these craft landing and humanoids getting out but particularly these onboard encounters and frankly the
reports of UFO crash retrievals so my point is it's a logical
progression what's going on here uh the sightings and The Landings and the
face-to-face human encounters all lend Creedence to the fact that people are
also being taken on board I do wish this subject was more accepted that we could
put more funds towards this that it would be studied by a lot more people
with a lot more tools to study it but until that time I'm going to continue doing this research SE Arch I think
ultimately that the day of disclosure will come I don't know if our governments will ever willingly disclose
or fully be truthful and transparent I highly doubt it in fact but on the other
hand I feel like disclosure is inevitable for one simple reason UFOs
are real ETS are real and you simply cannot hide the truth forever I mean you
can hide it you can distort it you can ignore it but you can never destroy it
truth is truth and sooner or later it's going to come out and also I think sooner or later we're going to have open
official contact we kind of practically already have I mean we know governments
across the world have had official contact but they're just keeping quiet about it and how many people have to
have contact before we say this is really happening and that disclosure is already a done deal
I'm going to continue doing this research until this subject goes fully mainstream and I can focus maybe on
something else we'll see at any rate I hope you found this episode interesting
hope you learned something I really want to thank you guys for watching it's because of you I do this research and
put out these episodes so thank you thank you thank you and until next time
keep searching for the truth it's up to you our government's not going to share it uh keep asking those hard questions
all of us I think have a personal responsibility to remove ourselves from
delusion and ignorance and walk down this pathway towards wisdom Enlightenment and love and last of all
keep having fun because if you're not having fun probably a good idea to do things differently I feel like that's
why we're here so yeah thank you again I will see you next episode and be out
