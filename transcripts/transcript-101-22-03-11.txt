Summary:
Mar 11, 2022
If you had the opportunity to go live with the aliens, would you accept the invitation? Before you answer, consider what happened to a young man named Paul.

In 1978, a group of a half-dozen young men went to a remote cabin in the deserts of Palm Springs, California to enjoy a weekend getaway from the city. During their stay, one of the men, Paul, (age 21) decided to take a late night walk alone through the wilderness. Hours passed and back at the cabin, Paul's friends became worried. Had Paul become lost? Had he hurt himself. They were just getting ready to organize a search party and go look for him when Paul returned to the cabin with an incredible story.

Paul said that during his walk, he saw an unidentified glowing object drop from the sky and land on the desert floor near the base of a cliff. Paul went to investigate and to his amazement, he saw that the object was a flying saucer, a UFO. And walking around the object were several strange figures. 

Paul gathered up his courage and approached the object. Upon arriving at the site, Paul saw that the figures were not human. They were aliens, extraterrestrials. They were about five feet tall, bald, with large dark eyes, grayish skin, and each of them wore a white jumpsuit. They welcomed Paul and explained that they were studying this location. They invited him onboard their craft, which Paul said was all white inside, very clean and sparsely furnished. Then they asked him a question which sent Paul's mind reeling. "Would you like to come with us?" The only thing was, if he said yes, the decision would be permanent. He could not return.

This was the story that Paul told his friends. Some of Paul's friends were skeptical of the story, but others believed him. And then, soon something happened which would leave them no choice.

Paul's story is among the strangest of UFO contact stories, but it is not wholly unique. This video presents the true UFO encounter of Paul, and of two other separate cases involving different men -- all who were apparently invited to live among the ETs. It's something that happens more often than you might think.

Paul's complete story is told in my book, "Onboard UFO Encounters." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode gone to live with the aliens this is the true story of a young man by the 
name of paul I do know his last name but I'm not going to reveal it out of respect for his family 
and once you hear paul's story I think you'll understand why 
this story actually comes from a friend of mine by the name of tony I met tony at the 
renaissance fair when I worked there one year and tony found out that I was a ufo researcher 
and he was very excited because he had quite a story to tell 
the story takes place in 1978 in a remote cabin in the palm springs area of southern california 
this is a desert area and the area where this cabin was was quite remote paul tony and his 
friends would occasionally go out to this remote cabin in palm springs to spend the weekend one of 
them had a family member who owned this cabin and it was a great place just to go and get away from 
all the hustle and bustle of the city and just relax and have fun and that's what they were 
doing on this one weekend in 1978. paul tony and his friends went up to this cabin and were just 
hanging out and one evening paul said that he was going to take a little walk this was late 
in the evening and off paul went and a couple of hours went by and paul still had not returned and 
everyone started to get a little worried because it wasn't like paul to just disappear like this 
and they wondered if something had happened if he had gotten bit by a rattlesnake or tripped or 
what was wrong and they were just getting ready to go search for him when paul came back into the 
cabin and he looked quite excited he had a really incredible story to tell and everyone rushed up 
to him like where were you we were just getting ready to organize a search party what happened 
and paul said well I saw something land over in the hills over there so I went walking over to 
check it out and it was a ufo and everyone freaked out they're like wow you're kidding you're full of 
crap you know a few of them were like what are you talking about I don't believe in ufos but paul was 
absolutely serious he said that while he was out walking there he saw something drop out of the sky 
a glowing object and it landed some distance away at the base of these cliffs and he saw 
people come out and walking around it so he walked up to it to see what was going on and as he says
it was this kind of saucer shape there were people these aliens they looked kind of like us 
and paul proceeded to give a description of these figures which tony now recognizes as the 
typical grays or perhaps gray human hybrids and according to paul these figures were short about 
five feet tall with greyish skin they had large dark eyes bald heads they wore white uniforms 
they looked largely human and as paul says they were walking around the outside of their ship so I 
went down to see what was up and tony said really did you actually talk to them and paul said yes 
i went in their ship and looked around inside of it and according to paul these figures were very 
friendly he was invited on board this was not an abduction by any means they were very friendly 
on board the ship he said it was very sparsely furnished was very clean the ets told him that 
they were studying the wildlife in this area and they actually invited paul to go live with them 
the only caveat was that he could not return and paul said no he was not ready to just leave earth 
like that and the et said well we're going to be back here in this exact area one year from now 
and if you want to come with us come back one year from now and make contact and you can come with us 
so this was the story that paul told his friends and this was quite shocking to them some were 
skeptical paul seemed to be absolutely sincere and tony certainly believed him because he knew 
that paul was not the kind of guy to joke about something like this and he could tell that paul 
was really excited you could see that paul was absolutely sincere about what he was saying and so 
tony pulled him aside and said what are you going to do and paul said I don't know I'm 
going to think about it tony told him oh you should have come back and got me that would have 
been cool we could have at least gotten them to give us a ride around a little bit and come back 
so tony was very much impressed by paul's story and was eager to see what his decision would be 
and he didn't have to wait long as the year rolled around it became clear that paul was 
seriously considering going out there as tony says and I quote over the year coming up to that time 
he started getting rid of all of his stuff he gave all his stuff away 
everybody started getting a little worried and his family thought that maybe he was going through a 
mental breakdown or something because he was just getting rid of all of his possessions 
he said I don't need this anymore I don't need them and tony spoke with paul several 
times and on each occasion he asked paul are you thinking of going with these guys 
and paul said I'm going out there I don't know I'm going to go back there but I don't know if I'm 
going to go with them I don't know and tony said well make sure everybody knows where you're going 
and there really wasn't much else to say at this point tony didn't really believe paul 
would actually leave the whole story sounded so crazy but paul was apparently absolutely serious 
about this and sure enough when the day arrived it happened paul drove off alone into the desert 
to presumably meet with these aliens and as tony says and I quote 
he went out to the desert to that place the day that they were supposed to be there 
we didn't hear anything after a couple of days his parents were worried they called us and asked us 
we said that we knew pretty much where he was going so we all go out there and we found his car 
out there out in the middle of nowhere just parked out in the desert there some of the people thought 
that maybe he might have committed suicide his car was there his car keys but he was never seen again 
we never saw him or heard a thing from him from that day he was gone he disappeared 
he was only 22 years old so after finding paul's abandoned car with the keys still in the ignition 
paul's parents filed a missing persons report with the police 
the police showed up at the scene they conducted an investigation 
they questioned paul's parents that questioned paul's friends they found no evidence of 
foul play they found no evidence of where paul had disappeared to when it came time for tony to be 
interviewed by the police tony told them exactly the story that paul had told him that 
he had come upon this landed ufo with these almost human-looking et's if the ets had invited him to 
go live among them as tony says this is all I can tell you this is what he told us happened out here 
so the police had no choice but to believe the witnesses there was you know six people 
telling the same story so it was clear that uh this is what had actually happened 
whether paul actually went to live with the ets nobody could say for sure but this is 
what tony believes happened he thinks that paul is probably somewhere out there living among the et's 
i covered this very unusual story in my book on board ufo encounters 
and yeah I know how unusual this sounds but I'd sure like to believe that paul is out there living 
among the et's that's certainly what it looks like and it's crazy and as unique as this story sounds 
it's actually not unique uh it's not unprecedented there are in fact a few other stories out in the 
ufo literature very much like this in fact there's a remarkably similar story 
which occurred to a musician by the name of jim sullivan in 1969 james sullivan who was a 
moderately successful musician released an album and one of the songs on this album was called 
ufo and it's all about going out into the desert to make contact with aliens and it was 
just six years later in 1975 when jim sullivan disappeared under very unusual circumstances 
under circumstances that are incredibly similar to what happened to paul as it turns out jim sullivan 
left very few clues as to where he went or what he was doing at the time he went missing 
all we know is that jim had checked into the la mesa motel in santa rosa this is in new mexico uh 
according to the evidence the investigation he never actually slept in this hotel 
he was last seen about 26 miles away at a ranch and this was where they found his car 
his car was abandoned full of olive jim sullivan's earthly belongings including his money 
his guitar and a box of unsold records and jim sullivan was never heard from again this case is 
quite well known in the ufo community and there are many people who believe that jim sullivan 
was taken on board a ufo to live among the et's again very hard to say it's an unsolved mystery 
but very similar to what happened to paul and again not unique and as it turns out there's 
another story that's very very similar coming from another gentleman by the name of granger taylor 
granger taylor comes from british columbia in canada and granger was very well known for being 
interested in ufos perhaps even to the point of obsession he believed he was in contact with ufos 
he was so interested in ufos that he actually built a model a life-size model of ufos 
uh of a ufo on his parents property and then on november 29 1980 granger taylor who was then 
32 years old walked out of his parents home leaving everything behind and was never 
seen again however before he left he wrote a strange enigmatic note for his parents 
to find and in this note he explained that he had quote gone away to walk aboard an alien spaceship 
the aliens with whom he had been communicating via dreams said that they had offered him quote 
a voyage to explore the vast universe this is what granger taylor said in his note and he told his 
parents not to worry that this voyage would only last for 42 months after which he would return 
and he left all his possessions behind saying that he no longer had any use for them this 
was the story that granger told in his note unfortunately granger was never seen again 
and many people speculate that he in fact went to live among the et's like he wrote on his note now 
there are some reports that his vehicle was found along with his clothing and what might be human 
remains though this is quite controversial has not been fully verified some of his friends in a 
family are not sure about this because they do not believe that granger would have taken his own life 
so yeah this is a controversial case all of these are quite controversial with still many many 
questions surrounding them but what I think is so interesting is how remarkably similar all three of 
these cases are and I know there are other cases like this I know leonard stringfield had a case 
where an entire family went missing told one of their family members one of their relatives that 
they were going to live among the et's so there are a number of cases out in the ufo literature 
like this so who knows maybe people are being invited on board to live among the 
et's certainly stranger things have happened so I guess you'll just have to make up your own mind 
but these stories do happen and that's why I think it's important that people know 
about it that's why I wanted to do this little episode for you today I hope you've enjoyed it 
i really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until next 
time keep searching for answers keep asking questions and most importantly keep having fun
