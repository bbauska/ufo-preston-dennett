THE ROBINSON FAMILY UFO SIEGE
Mar 18, 2022

Summary:
Mar 18, 2022
In 1975, the Robinson Family (pseudonym) left their home in the San Fernando Valley in southern California to spend the weekend in a cabin located in Cedar Pines, in the remote wilderness of the San Bernardino National Forest. Little did they know, this weekend vacation would mark the beginning of a series of UFO encounters that would involve their entire family. 

That evening, the mother, Diane Robinson, looked out the window of the cabin and saw a large round object covered with white lights, hovering and darting around before quickly zipping off. Meanwhile, in the lower cabin, her two young daughters (Jenny and Kelly) and their cousin, also observed the object. All the witnesses were deeply impressed that they had seen a genuine UFO. But it was just a simple sighting, and they thought that would be the end of it. But it was just the beginning.

Years later, in 1982, Kelly Robinson (now a teenager), traveled south to the small town of Julian to spend a few weeks at a church camp located in the remote Volcan Mountains. Laying outside one evening watching the stars, Kelly and her friends were amazed to see a star-like object flitting across the sky. It moved super-fast and at acute angles, making it obvious that it could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon, shooting star, satellite or any other conventional object. It was a UFO. After watching this object dance across the sky, Kelly and her friends became frightened and retreated inside. None of them talked about the sighting.

Over the next few years, Kelly returned to the same church camp in Julian, and on at least two other occasions, witnessed more UFOs. One time they watched an object for over an hour. It became an interesting and fun activity to look for UFOs, but it also made Kelly slightly nervous.

Events soon began to escalate. Back at the Robinson family home (located in Reseda, California,) Kelly's older sister, Jenny, was driving outside with her friends when they saw a strange unidentified flying object flitting around in the night sky. Again it was a star-like object, quite high in altitude, but obviously not a plane. And when Jenny saw it again, she began to wonder, why were they seeing so many UFOs?

Soon they would have their answer. In October 1987, Kelly (now age 19,) woke up in her bedroom to find herself surrounded by several gray aliens. "Do not be afraid," they said. "Come with us."

Kelly was consumed with fear, and protested, explaining that she had a family, a job and bills to pay. The next thing she knew, Kelly found herself inside a small, rounded room with gray walls, laid out on a table. Small figures with large dark eyes, bald heads and grayish skin surrounded her, and told her that they needed to cut her arm. They then told her they needed to do an operation on her brain, and that Kelly would not remember any of this.

"No," Kelly protested. "I will remember!" And she did. When she woke up the next morning, she immediately looked at her arm and saw a thin, red scar where she had been cut by the grays.

That was her first encounter, but two weeks later, the grays came back again. This began a series of encounters. During one such event, Kelly was able to converse with the ETs, and they provided her with several predictions about her personal life.

More strange events began to occur, including a series of weird poltergeist activity. 

Meanwhile, Kelly's mother, Diane, woke up to find a strange needle-like mark on her arm. And following one of Kelly's encounters, Diane had a very strange "dream," that she had been taken onboard a UFO and shown weird-looking babies. A human-looking figure entreated Diane to hold and nurture the babies, saying, "they have everything, but they need love."

This video presents the true story of the Robinson family's series of UFO encounters. What began with a simple sighting eventually escalated into a full-blown series of close encounters and onboard UFO experiences. This case reveals one of the main gray agendas to produce hybrid babies. It's a multiple witness case, and shows the patterns that often appear in many other cases of extraterrestrial contact.

This amazing case was first presented in my book, "One in Forty: The UFO Epidemic," along with many other cases of UFO contact. Now available!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode the robinson family ufo siege this is not their real name they prefer to remain 
anonymous and the robinson family consists of the mother the father and two daughters and 
what I like about this case is that it illustrates how a ufo case can develop from beginning to end 
it also illustrates one of the main et agendas the grays and it also shows how a case can start out 
very frightening but evolve into something that's more benevolent so that's why I wanted to present 
this case to you today and this case starts in 1975 when the robinson family decided to go to 
the san bernardino national forest for a weekend away from the city they rented a couple of cabins 
and were enjoying themselves and then late that evening a ufo showed up it was the mother diane 
robinson who noticed it first she looked out the window and saw this glowing object 
and it had lights on it and it was darting around in these weird angles and it was immediately 
obvious to her that this was a ufo as she says it was erratic movement 
you could see it moving in the sky it would hover and then it would just go shoom shoom 
shoom I mean things stars don't go all over the place and helicopters don't go all over the place 
they don't go quickly from one side to another and then shoot up and then come down at an angle and 
do that so fast like faster than sound movement diane describes this object as quote bright 
it had a lot of bright lights on it it was round like was like that and it was in the distance 
kind of disappeared into nowhere into the night blackness it just left zap and it was gone as 
fast as we saw it it was gone diana of course was not the only witness her daughters saw it as well 
and I will let the youngest daughter kelly describe it at the time she was just a pre 
teenager and uh as kelly says that one was with my sister my cousin and I we thought 
we saw ufo it was jumping up and down a bright light kind of jumping you know back and forth 
we just thought it was a ufo because it was moving in different patterns 
not like a plane so this was a quick simple sighting and off it went it was very brief 
and they thought that would be it the extent of their experiences 
but it wasn't it was about seven years later that they had another sighting this second 
sighting actually was just kelly and her friends kelly the youngest daughter this occurred in 1982 
kelly had gone to the town of julian this is located in southern california in san diego 
county and she had gone to a church camp out in the vulcan mountains it's quite isolated there 
and she was one evening laying out on these benches with her friends looking up at the 
night sky when these ufos showed up these were star-like objects darting at right angles 
and it was immediately obvious to kelly and her friends that this was not a plane satellites 
helicopter or anything like that as she says this was up in the mountains by san diego a bunch of 
us saw it it's an outdoor church where you can go outside and they have benches and everything and 
we were just lying down and talking and looking up at the sky and all of a sudden we saw it 
and we all got scared it was like jumping back and forth like aircraft but going super fast 
going back and forth the only reason we didn't think it was a plane 
because we saw it zigzagging and moving back and forth so fast we just basically chickened out and 
went back to where we had to sleep we went back and we were all scared we didn't talk about it 
so that's not unusual for witnesses not to talk about a sighting but this is definitely a clue 
that there might be deeper levels of contact and again kelly thought that would be the extent of it 
but she would return to this same church camp in julian over the next few years and she saw 
the ufos again it sort of became a pastime for her and her friends to do go out late at night 
and see if there were any ufos and sure enough they showed up these darting star-like objects 
and she actually watched them for over an hour on at least one occasion and again they thought 
that was the extent of it but it wasn't this is when events started to really escalate and it was 
just a few years later in 1987 when the oldest daughter who I called jenny also started seeing 
ufos only this time it was directly over their home their home is located in resida california 
actually in the same town where I am right now about one maybe two miles from here 
this is located in the san fernando valley outside of los angeles it's a very densely populated 
suburb and jenny was out driving one evening with her friends when she saw this star-like object 
again pretty high up there but it was immediately obvious that this couldn't be a plane or anything 
conventional just by the way it was moving and as jenny says I'll let her describe she says yeah 
something I thought was a ufo maybe up in the sky something that didn't move like an airplane 
it was just a light in the sky that moved in all different directions 
and it was moving definitely too fast to be an airplane it wasn't a plane it moved back and forth 
in different directions so fast that it couldn't have been an airplane and it was one year later 
when the youngest daughter kelly who had seen ufos probably more than anyone else in the family 
became apparently the target of the greys kelly this was in october of 1986 kelly woke 
up in her bedroom to see grays surrounding her bed she said there were several of them 
she described them as being short bald with large dark eyes kind of grayish leathery skin and she 
was fully awake and they told her do not be afraid come with us kelly protested she says I have a 
job I have a family I've got bills to pay no but next thing she knows she found herself in a small 
rounded room with gray walls and these beings told her we need to cut your arm she said no but they 
went ahead and cut her arm anyway and then told her we need to do an operation on your brain this 
really freaked her out naturally and she said no no and uh they started arguing about whether 
or not she would remember this they told her you cannot remember this and she said yes I can and 
they said no we're going to take your memory away you will not remember this and she said yes I will 
and I'll just let kelly describe a little bit of what she experienced as she says I just remember 
fighting with them like trying to take me away something like that and she describes the room 
as quote like gray it was like gray walls and a kind of rounded ceiling and a bunch of people 
trying to do something to my brain and I was fighting them all the way they were pulling on me 
and I'm all let me go let me go that morning I had a scratch on my arm I was really upset about it 
the next day she showed me her arm where the scratch was it was already healing over 
this was quite a scary experience for her as she says it was quote horrifying and scary 
and she hoped that that was the end of it but of course it wasn't it was just two weeks later on 
october 15 1987 that the et's returned kelly was alone in her room when these lights showed up and 
she described them as being little orb like lights and she felt like they were 
trying to enter her into her brain and they started communicating telepathically with her 
and they said you need to come with us and again she protested and told them why she couldn't go 
that she has a job she has friends she has family I have bills to pay 
she felt like they were scanning her mind and recording her memories 
and really the whole discussion was about whether or not she would remember they said you won't 
remember and she of course said she would they told her we are going to take your memory away 
and she said no you're not no you're not I'm going to tell and they told her no you're not she said 
yes I am and she started swatting at these lights grabbing them and sort of swatting them away 
and she felt like they were draining out the thoughts of her head and she's threatened to 
tell her parents and they said your parents wouldn't understand you better not tell them 
and she's threatened to tell her dad and they said no you will not remember this when you wake up you 
will not be able to speak and kelly suddenly woke up she was still in a sitting position swatting at 
these lights which were no longer there and she blurted out with a great effort of will dad are 
you all right she wasn't quite sure why she said that what that wasn't what she intended to say 
but she was able to speak and she was able to remember I should say here that her father is in 
naval intelligence doing top-secret work he will not talk about what his job is I don't 
know if there's a connection there or not but for what it's worth uh I thought I would mention that 
and that was kelly's second encounter with these grays and although she didn't see them 
face to face it was obvious to her it was the same beings and this completely freaked her out uh she 
was fully awake she was very much afraid of them coming back so at this point she started sleeping 
with the door open and the lights on she had a lot of anxiety to the point that she didn't want 
to sleep in her own room and she ended up sleeping often across the street at her boyfriend's house 
and a few times they looked out the window and saw strange glowing lights in kelly's bedroom 
that happened at least twice I interviewed about her about it and I called her up two weeks later 
to do a follow-up interview about it and she had no memory of seeing these lights in her room 
from across the street and not only that she did not remember me interviewing her I'm like listen 
i have you on tape so that really freaked her out that she could forget something like that but this 
is something we do see there's a very strong amnesia aspect with some of these encounters 
and it wasn't long before kelly had a third encounter with these glowing lights and this time 
it was a little bit more benevolent they still argued about whether or not she would remember 
but she had a real honest to god conversation with them this was on december 2nd 1987 
she woke up hearing her phone ding and looking at her bedside she was shocked to see that the phone 
was inside a paper bag she did not put it in a paper bag she could not explain that and I 
should say that at this time the robinson family started having a lot of poltergeist like activity 
with doors opening closing knocking noises objects disappearing in fact one time diane tried to get 
into kelly's room kelly was not in her room at the time and she couldn't open the door and she 
had to get her husband and they forced the door open it turned out this really heavy dresser that 
kelly had had slid across the floor and blocked the door so they have no idea how that could 
happen if there was nobody in the room so lots of poltergeist to activity including apparitions 
this was witnessed by all members of the family so kelly wakes up she hears the phone dinging 
looks and sees it's inside of a paper bag and this is when these lights appear again 
and she feels them trying to invade her brain and they start speaking to her telepathically and uh 
they started giving her information and talking to her they asked her about 
people about society asking her strange questions that any normal person would know the answer to 
and then they started giving her information about herself predictions that were very personal they 
gave her predictions about her job it said that she would get a raise they told her about her 
relationship with her boyfriend that it was going very well they told her about her relations with 
her friends at her church so just started giving her all this information which she found quite 
interesting and that really intrigued her uh but again they argued quite a bit about whether or not 
she would remember and they would say stuff like you're not going to remember this and she said 
yes I am and she would punch at these lights they told her you're going to forget everything 
and she said no I'm not and they said we're not going to let you remember this we're going to take 
your memory of this away and she said no you're not and then as quickly as the experience began 
next thing she knows she wakes up and they're gone this was really quite alarming for her and 
it was you know her third experience with this so she was really quite concerned about it 
and uh she says it was very very scary but on the other hand the fact that they were 
asking her all these questions about people and giving her this information made her feel like 
they weren't trying to harm her and she doesn't think they're evil in any way 
and as she says I think they're religious they're not really out to hurt us they're out to learn 
but they're afraid for us to remember because they're afraid we would tell people about them 
i don't talk to people about it because people think you're weird I just hope 
you don't think I'm totally nuts you know so that turned out to be her last experience and
she says I get scared because I really wish it was just my imagination you know what I mean 
i don't really want to believe in this stuff 
and while that turned out to be her last experience events were not over yet in fact they 
were about to come to a really dramatic climax it was this during this whole series of visitations 
that kelly's mother diane woke up one evening and found this weird needle-like 
scar or bruise on her arm it was quite pro quite prominent and it really concerned her she and her 
husband talked about it they couldn't figure out what this could possibly be it was way too 
big for her to have just accidentally scratched herself or something like that so she wasn't sure 
what to think of it that's when her daughter said that she was having all these experiences 
and she wondered if it was related to that and then it was shortly after just a few days after 
her daughter's last encounter with these weird lights that diane had what she calls a dream she 
makes it clear that this was not a normal dream she actually doesn't think it was a dream at 
all because it was just so bizarre and she was awake in the dream and what she experienced is 
really interesting and fits exactly in with what we hear a lot in other cases diane described 
finding herself in a small rounded room very clean very hospital like she says 
and very sterile she said it had rounded walls that were sort of a pastel blue in color there 
was a human looking woman who was wearing what appeared to be like a doctor's coat a white coat 
and in the center of this room was a very strange device sort of shaped like a christmas tree 
it was quite tall and it had all these cylinders uh around it attached to the center of it and 
when diane stepped forward to look inside these cylinders she got a real shock because it turned 
out they were incubators and inside each one of these cylinders was what appeared to be a baby 
and this was quite a involved experience and diane started to talk with these this 
human-looking figure and this human-looking figure told her to pick a baby and diane said no 
i don't want a baby I have grown kids what am I going to do with a baby and the lady said uh well 
we want you to hold a baby and I said no these I don't know what to do with the baby 
and these babies need help the ladies said well we're giving them help diane said well 
okay if you're taking care of them then I don't need to take one 
and the lady said we're taking good care of them they have everything but love that's why 
I'd like you to take one and love it and uh diane said well I would like to but I can't and 
she believes that the e.t or this figure I should say told her to take one home 
and she says no I can't I have no place for a baby I love babies but uh and I would love to 
love them all but I cannot take them home I can't help you I can't give them love 
and the lady was very understanding and said uh you feel sad because you can't do this 
and diane said no I feel sad because you say they need love and in my whole life I think 
the greatest thing on earth is not money or anything but love and you make me very sad 
because I can't give them love it's physically impossible for me to take them and the lady said 
well these babies have problems they're different but these babies still need love and diane said I 
know but there's no way there's absolutely no way I can do this and she described this sort of uh 
device this incubator machine as being cylindrical and I'll just let her describe it in her own words 
she says that strange room and this lady she was strange too because I didn't know her 
i didn't know who the heck she was there was this round cylinder type thing that turned around and 
around there were all these babies in little compartments like in enclosures it was almost 
the shape of a christmas tree narrow at the top and it came down in all these little compartments 
and she would press a button and it would move around so you would see all these babies and 
then she'd press another button and it would move around again and she said these babies there was 
something wrong with every one of them and the lady told her it wasn't supposed to be this way 
and diane described the room and I quote the room was strange it was like nothing I've ever seen 
before not walls like we know the walls were kind of rounded it was not a regular room it was blue 
like a pastel and then that container or the cylinder or whatever the heck 
it was that these babies were in all these controlled compartments uh you could see them 
and they looked fine they looked healthy they were squirming around and everything
but there was some of them definitely looked deformed and unusual 
and she wasn't quite ready to say they looked alien or not but she also said that they didn't 
look entirely human either but she said this room was not very big not a big room at all a 
strange room and well lighted it had no corners not like regular walls and the lady told her 
that it was was not planned this way that they had all these things wrong with them they were 
well taken well taken care of and well fed and she said they have everything but love 
so this is a common theme we see in a lot of these cases this is really all diane remembers 
she woke up the next morning quite upset she told me about this and she had no idea that 
other people were reporting very similar events this is what ufo investigators call a baby 
presentation and it's not at all unusual for people contactees to be handed these babies 
and told to nurture them and love them and that appears to be what's happening in this case 
uh it was just a year or two later that bud hopkins came out with his book intruders 
which really sort of established that this is something that does happen to a lot of contactees 
and following this quote dream the robinson family stopped having ufo encounters that was it 
their encounters had started with sightings moved directly to bedroom visitations face-to-face 
encounters and onboard experiences and culminated in this baby presentation and that was it I did 
present this case in my early book 1 in 40 the ufo epidemic and I like this case for several 
reasons again because it shows how a series of encounters has a pattern starting with sightings 
and moving on all the way to full-on encounters and on-board experiences and a baby presentation 
and this illustrates I think one of the main et agendas with the grays to produce hybrid babies 
and it also shows how a case can start out quite scary 
but is ultimately benevolent and both kelly and diane who are really the main witnesses 
in this case do not feel that these beings were evil they were just curious and very 
interested in human society so yeah it's a very interesting case it really uh was quite 
difficult for kelly and kelly in particular to experience and she was glad when it ended 
diane was also very much moved by the experience that she had with this quote dream 
so yeah it's a very interesting encounter and that's why I wanted to present it to you today 
i hope you've enjoyed this episode I really appreciate you watching and until 
next time keep asking questions keep searching for answers and most importantly keep having fun.
