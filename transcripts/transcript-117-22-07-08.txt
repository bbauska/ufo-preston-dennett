INTERVIEW WITH A FULLY CONSCIOUS UFO CONTACTEE PART II: THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
Jul 8, 2022

Summary:
Jul 8, 2022
In May of 2022, after decades of remaining silent, Dolly Safran went public with her experiences as a lifelong fully conscious UFO contactee. As a very young child, Dolly had several encounters involving missing time. Then, in 1973, at age 14, she was taken onboard a craft from her home in the Florida Everglades, and was able to remember the entire event without the aid of hypnosis. Since then, she has had more than a thousand fully conscious onboard UFO encounters. She has been taken onboard large motherships, seen a wide variety of extraterrestrials, traveled throughout the solar system and even to other planets. Her story is one of the most extensive cases of UFO contact on record.

For many years, Dolly had tried to obtain photographs and films of the UFOs, but like most contactees, she discovered it was no easy task. In fact, it's very rare that contactees are able to obtain good photographic evidence. But when Dolly decided to go public with her experiences, she asked the ETs if they would allow themselves to be filmed. To her delight, the ETs agreed!

In Part One of this series, Dolly described her UFO encounters up to age fourteen. Now, in Part Two, Dolly shares the many photographs and videos she has been able to obtain of the UFO craft. This footage includes both daytime and nighttime footage, various UFO craft, with multiple witnesses in various locations. Dolly's extraordinary video captures include metallic craft posing for the camera, a mothership dropping smaller ET-drones, a craft that performs flips a 180-degree flip, a craft that hovers only a few hundred feet above a house, and more.

For those who want evidence of UFO reality, here it is! More than twenty photographs and films are presented. Dolly provides a detailed commentary for each photographic event, and explains why obtaining good photographic evidence is not as easy as one might think.

The photographic evidence presented here is only a portion of the many photos and films she has been able to obtain. You can view more of Dolly's amazing captures on her YouTube Channel, "DOLLYSAFRAN." The link to her channel is provided at the bottom of this description on YouTube.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos and 
the paranormal got a very special episode for you today I call this 
interview with a fully conscious contactee part two the photographic evidence 
this is of course an interview with dolly saffron pictured here say hi dolly hello 
um as you may know for those of you who've read the book or see the scene part one uh dolly saffron is the subject of my latest book symmetry a true ufo adventure 
and dolly is a fully conscious contactee has been since age 14 it was 1973
yes 71 73 um and uh yeah her experiences are very very extensive more expensive than anyone 
I've interviewed uh she first remembers as we put uh talked about in part one uh being 
taken on board a craft or at least members being taken I should say at age 10 months when she 
floated out of her crib from that point on she had pretty regular experiences uh of seeing ufos 
having missing time I had a face-to-face encounter at age six where she was taken on 
board and that's where she met a tall white uh who she calls mama actually a tall gray 
tall dre all right so uh this is all in part one which you can find on my youtube channel 
but her experiences were very extensive but she remembers being taken to the et's planet going on 
board their craft all kinds of really amazing experiences taking a tour of our solar system 
uh visiting the moon again all of this is in part one and I'm going to be doing further interviews 
with dolly so we can talk about some of the other amazing experiences she's had being taken on board 
having healing events visiting all kinds of et's all kinds of really cool stuff but 
what I'd like to focus on here today is the photographic evidence I've interviewed a lot 
of contactees and I can tell you it's very rare for people to have really good physical evidence 
certainly people can point to scars and marks in their body and things like that medical evidence 
very occasionally you'll get landing trace evidence photographic evidence does turn up but it's really rare and that's kind of what I first wanted to talk to you about before we 
get into the actual evidence itself dolly okay uh is you know why I'm not I think there are 
sorry no worries um yeah I want to talk about why um the photographic evidence 
is so rare and we talked a little bit about this before you know we started recording 
uh and uh there's I think as near as I can tell two main reasons one is that the et's are somewhat 
shy about being photographed and are not always willing to go on camera and another is technical 
difficulties in actually obtaining a good film or footage 
so wonder if you could speak to that as to you know why it's so few people have gotten photos and 
both you know in terms of the et's being shy about it and technical difficulties and after that 
how it came about that you started getting some really good evidence okay um well we'll back it up a little bit in uh right up until about the year 1980 uh everything 
was a 35 millimeter uh film hard film and but there weren't that many people looking up so et 
wasn't filmed as often as they could have been there weren't people out you know calling them 
running after them and taking pictures of them uh that did not start occurring until the digital age 
and digital cameras by their nature are electronic and et craft put out an electronic signature a 
pulse an emp an electromagnetic pulse that downs anything electrical any equipment digital all of 
it it if they get close enough they'll turn your camera off they'll turn your car off they'll turn your house out all kinds of stuff they can lower the grid on you um they realize 
that this was happening they have their theory about it I'm not going to go into it right now 
uh but they also tend to be a little bit shy and a lot of things that they do when they're incoming 
like movie theaters you know like the drive-ins and stuff they're down on top of that screen and I 
don't know if you've maybe got one or two photos from that you know in all your research none 
a couple couple people have tried but yeah they're too close they're they're in line 
of sight their signal is line of sight of you they're electromagnetic pulse and it just knocks everything out it'll shut off the movie it'll down all the cars everything as soon as they 
lift away though they can turn their engines back on and chase them when they're coming in coming 
to your backyard you know in other words if you're gonna be contacted by them you're not going to get 
anything you're going to get them at about the 2-3 mile limit you'll get lights in the sky but 
anything closer than a mile it's going to shut you down especially if it's focusing on you the line of sight of that electromagnetic pulse it's going to eradicate your phone from doing anything 
so that's one of the reasons and yes they are shy they have an agenda of who they want to 
contact first because everything that's going on and they've made it very clear who they're contacting first and um I think it would be ce5 people it would be children 
everyday regular people at drive-ins people at uh games out in the public you know they're coming 
to the people not the governments of the world they're coming directly to the people and that's their agenda yeah I've got I mean there was a case on catalina island where there was 12 people there 
and four of them were professional photographers but every single one of their cameras failed yeah and I've got case after case of that there was another guy who I was talking about before 
he had a brand new camera pointed at the object it powers down to zero right um points it away and it 
goes back to power it up back powers down so this is in some sometimes intentional but sometimes 
it's just the fact that you're pointing it at it right right line of sight it's they're positioning the craft and the way it pulses which the direction the pulse emits 
uh if they're paying attention to you it'll be directly at you and yes it'll knock you out um I want to bring something up the turkish ufo was filmed by vhs camera which is electronic 
only in that it uses vhs tapes in a camera that's powered with a battery but this power 
this camera had one heck of a zoom uh the craft was it literally out at uh two miles three miles 
but it had the ability to exceed that and get a really a good up close picture of it and I thought that was brilliant and I wonder why people don't have vhs cameras now and are 
going back to that to film them I mean it would be very convenient if you were going to get a really good zoom on them to use vhs camera and that type of technology so you could zoom up to them 
otherwise you've got to have a phone with a really good zoom on it and not everybody knows how to get that to put on their phone or how to use the equipment and they scramble somewhat they 
get a little floppy when it comes to the exact moment when it's happening so but it's a good idea 
yeah I love that footage I think it's definitely in the top 10 if not some of the best out there 
there's some really good old footage too absolutely but yeah it's quite rare and 
another thing I've noticed is not a single person that I know of has ever been able to take a camera 
on board or craft and photograph the interior that's because they won't work uh that's why 
the crafts are run psychically any electronic equipment onboard that craft would never work 
the batteries that they use when they come down below you know into the atmosphere are specifically designed to handle that kind of environment they're highly protected from it 
uh but even they can fail it has happened um it's a big situation and no I've tried multiple times 
i even had a little brownie camera that you wind it up nope let me take a picture on board because 
the actual magnetism of it messed the film up so that it was blurry couldn't get a shot 
yeah so some of the best photographs out there that people have taken um it's quite clear that 
they've said as much that they were called outside you know you can photograph us now they're the et's posed for them and they get some really good photographs right so initially you were trying 
to get photographs but not having a whole lot of success and then boom started um you decided to go 
public right yes yeah and talata who is the craft that uh you mostly go on board and is himself an 
alive and aware entity um said you know you wanted evidence right yes um I asked him for it 
i realized when I was going to the um to the the ufo megacon that um he was going to follow me he 
planned to follow me and uh he had two other craft with him and um I was mentally talking to him all 
the way there you know you're gonna have to let me get pictures of you and he did me one better he came down within a one-mile limit of me I was able to zoom my camera had enough zoom to get to him 
to get some good shots of him and he also showed himself in las vegas they triangulated on him and 
it was on the news and I was so excited when I heard that you heard it I heard it yvonne heard 
it we watched the newscast and I was very disappointed afterwards when they wiped it clean it's no longer available for anybody to watch that um but he knew that I I'm we were 
coming up to a deadline of their situation and I really really really put it to them I need this 
and he gave it to me he gave me a couple different situations where I i got him so I'm happy about it 
yeah yeah me too because trust me when I tell you that I'm often asked like oh you know they're 
seeing ufos all the time how come they didn't get a photograph well there's this is why because 
you know they often don't want to for their reasons and it's not as easy as you might think 
correct um yeah I mean there's some really good cases where people in the past have got them from polaroids and stuff simply yeah cameras but uh all right so let's start getting into the photographic 
evidence because you actually have a whole lot I mean not just a couple you have quite a few 
and what I want to do is play about a dozen well I want to show a dozen still photographs most of 
most of which are taken from actual you know videos okay and you know about a dozen videos 
so let me just share the screen and pull up the file I want to pull up here 
and I'm going to start with one that you have not seen before which is not your photograph 
okay so this is a photograph that someone brought to me at work and uh from his friend who's having 
a backyard party here in the san fernando valley in southern california and had a little bouncy 
house as you can see here and food set up and they did not see this what looks like a metallic saucer 
i am just putting this here for you know fun uh and I just wonder what you know you thought of 
it because sometimes people take photographs and there's they don't see anything then they develop the photograph and they're like what the heck this this is real he's a low rider he is doing 
reconnaissance the reason she didn't see this on film is he was moving so fast she never caught him 
but the camera did the camera clicked on it just as it was center frame uh which is 
miraculous because a lot of times they're blurry but that is an actual craft and he's a low rider 
and he is scoping the place out to make sure that they can come down and make contact somewhere 
and they do that that's a habit yeah look at that perfect saucer [ __ ] looks metallic 
yes and you can tell he's on batteries because if you look at the bottom the the low part of it is protruding down that circular area that's where their batteries are 
and you know they're on batteries when that drops down and you can see it when they're up in the stratosphere and up in space that uh pack slides up and it becomes completely flat so they can fly 
but he's on batteries right there very cool yeah sorry to spring that on you but I just thought 
i saw it okay oh that's a good photograph I wonder what the other thing is I like it 
all right so now I'm just going to speed through a number of these photographs because we actually have the video which is much better but here is one where you can see two lights but 
you're saying this is actually one complete craft right uh no this one is uh tilada's on the right 
and he's got a drone sitting right next to him and then the other one is another drone over there 
they never fly with a backup he tolada always has one drone he just dropped that drone and it's kind 
of hanging around with him for a few minutes I don't know why but he did and it might have been you know so you could get a picture of it right next to him but yeah that's a drone and a drum 
enchilada an e.t drone yes yes I want to be specific they are they are um only piloted 
their their particular type of drone if you want to call them that I use that word because that's what everybody understands about an unmanned craft but they are not unmanned they are piloted by 
ai which they still consider on man because no biological entity is on board it's a.i
many biological not complete and you say they never fly alone never ever ever if you see one ufo 
there's going to be somebody else with them at least one minimal and maybe two or three yes yeah I started to realize that very early on in my research and I would ask people is 
there anything else I'm like oh yeah I saw another one way up there and went much lower so I didn't notice that they don't always see it but I've come to realize like come 
on I think there probably is another one there that you're looking at yeah they're not always running with their lights on they usually run lights out to keep you from seeing them 
but uh in this picture this is at um uh lachlan and they had lights on so that I could capture 
them this is tallada's side view his front lights are on that's on the right and you can see 
the outline of his ship and he's slightly turned up he's in skiff position but if if you were able 
to make that brighter you would see there's a whole craft in there that's just the top lights 
you can see it right here there's definitely a metallic body between these two lights yep and 
it travels down he is on batteries actually there they're not real far down which means that he's 
half inter-dimensional probably at that point so yeah all right here's another photograph which is 
pretty cool it's in color yeah it's it's the one of tolada with the drone behind him 
and uh so this is a whole craft right here that's yeah headlight on the right right and this is 
the drone right awesome this is just another close-up of it yeah gives you a really good view 
his headlights are so bright he can look like a sun at night and that's the brightness of it on 
the front end I mean they can blind you with the lights they're that bright yeah I had that happen 
with ce5 with a you know a steven greer groove see seti group he was he wasn't there but it flashed 
a red light at us which I'm like oh wow oh it was going interdimensional if you see the red 
light specifically a red light they are definitely about to open a light door and go through it yeah 
it was very much like looking at a prism hanging a window exactly they're shooting 
all kinds of color at it and that red light and that is them generating a light gate to go out 
so here's another close-up I think of the the drone yep all right yep he's actually heating 
up he's getting ready to go pretty fast you can see the plasma it you know heating up around him 
all right very cool okay this is obviously taken from a video as you can see here but this I love 
this one because this is a solid metallic yeah he let me he's sort of he's like a cuttlefish he can 
present many different ways uh use light on him to present a certain way and he was coming down 
in georgia here and I was alone that night outside and um he came down so that I could 
get a good look at him and he's not far above my head he's he's about 500 feet or so and he's about 
uh I don't know 35 45 yards in front of me away from me so yeah looks pretty close well 
we'll see the video later that's going to be the last one because it's my favorite okay 
so here's another one where he's just flashing his headlights right this is this is one he's 
uh I was in panama city for this and he's actually uh in the process of flipping 
uh he's doing what they call a three six three 360 rollover and he was trying to get my attention I 
was out there I had a neighbor outside with me she had her kid and he's like trying to get me to get out of their presence and he's just doing all kinds of good stuff he was out there with us for 
almost two hours he was flying he'd fly around us for a few minutes and then he'd shoot out and 
circle us and he came back and he was very very busy that night he wanted my attention 
well huge thanks to tilada for providing these because she did not have to 
all right and here is another still from waffle right this is a actual mother craft 
she looks like tolada only she's way bigger and she is dropping a drone all right in the process 
and there's four drones there I don't know you can see that how the light breaks up as it's going down there's one two three four drones in that drop if you can see it here's one here's one 
and then two in the middle right and then one on the top yep very cool all right this is just 
another close-up again from that same video right which we will play later I'm going through these 
pretty quickly because the videos are really much more exciting but but this allows me to enlarge 
right I want to be able to do that that particular type of drone I call them retrievers because they 
come and pick me up talata doesn't always come down to get me they come in those I'm they're just big enough that I can be on board with them and they can get me back to tolada pretty rapidly 
it's called snatch and grab and that's because where I lived there I was right by the u.s space force tyndall air force base and they had to come in stealthy and get me out quick so all right
same one yeah um this one I i snuck on we didn't preview this one but I saw it in your photos okay 
oh that's actually three pictures of the same thing that's a lot of you caught three 
pictures see the the difference between the things that's just yeah it's three of talata all right 
that's another very interesting here's another where he's turning over kind of yeah 
he's about to give me chevy lights or cadillac lights chevys and cadillac sometimes have the same lights and he knows I like them so he'll show them to me when they come down on the roads uh when 
they're following people they have the ability to look like a car behind you by their lights and he's showing off I've got cases of that where people are driving along like what's that funny 
well that happened in close encounters with richard dreyfuss he's like go on yeah hey yeah 
i do do that and I think this is important because if you see how this is at a diagonal 
and in the videos you'll see the et drone actually turning over which drones can't do right right there's no military no military drone can flip over like that at all 
no in a controlled slow rotation right all right here's another one I think I just stuck in there 
again this is um this I don't know it looks strange oh you know what that is 
that's a light gate shutting oh all right it's left of a light gate shutting down 
they went through and I was snapping pictures and I I've never I've never actually myself witnessed 
the light gate shut and I was like click click click and I got it and just before it went poof 
all right very cool and it's just one or two more there's another 
that's yeah that's panama city yeah and he's just showing off all right 
and now we're getting to the videos let's see I have the sound on this one there it is
I'm probably saying hey dude are you here to see me and here he goes he's starting to he's starting to roll over
all drones that we have have fans or blades you know uh they have serious fans on them they're 
really big ones and uh they can't do it they lose altitude too rapidly they lose control they can't 
maintain this is a anti-grav rollover and then and now he's showing me a what you'd call a 
you know an orb he can look like an orb when he wants to either a red one or a white one 
no okay I'm going to play that again without sound so what I think is cool is this is where you can see him actually turning up on his side 
right flipping over yeah most most crafts fly in that position in that side position 
they travel the electromagnetic currents of the planet the field guidelines in what they call skiffing and they're surfing the energy wave electromagnetically so if you're say inside that 
you don't feel like you're turning over dude no I did not yeah no and what is the red light 
that keeps flashing uh that's him getting ready he's showing that he's doing it in other words 
they're like us you know they they communicate by light sometimes with one another and if a drone's gonna start flipping over and there are others around him he will show them 
that he's in a he's in a rollover and he'll flash certain lights and it's white and red 
all right very cool okay I'm going to play another one that's I think on the same night I'm going to turn down the sound because the language gets a little colorful 
yeah my neighbor was uh so here let me play that and make sure the sound is not good now he he'd 
been around us for over an hour and a half at this point and he he wants my attention right now he is done he's like I know your doctor make her go inside and uh so he did a really really beautiful 
rollover this time and he gave me the cadillac and the chevy lights yeah look at that yeah the reason 
uh there was a little girl out there right and she yes daughter a little 12 year old daughter and 
we were trying to keep her calm you know I was trying to maintain equilibrium with her because she was right on the edge her mother asked me not to let her be scared 
her mom knew I was going out at night she she she knew things were coming to get me shot I 
live right next door to her and uh every time she saw me go outside she'd follow me 
what's going on I'm like oh god here we go oh yeah that's good footage I want to play this one more 
time yeah wait for his lights show his lights he's doing he's gonna flash them see aren't they pretty 
yes doing chevy lights yeah so how far how far away would you estimate he is at this point he is 
he's less than he's about 500 between 500 and 700 feet above our heads yep and so he's less than 
he's he's only about an eighth of a mile from me at that point if I was to go to south of my point 
i would be under him in a couple of minutes because he's about an eighth of a mile under me I would have been there this is tolada right uh this is this one is uh nope this is an ai uh
I'm never without him he's oh if I'm being uh contacted till artists up up above him waiting for 
me to get there he brings me to him did a complete rollover there yeah wow how big is one of these 
oh they're about 20 feet in diameter and they have a a shape to them that's kind of sporty 
and uh they have just the basic needs there's no beds there's no potty there's no nothing 
it's just a transporter all right I'm gonna play the next one here let me make sure the sound is up 
oh no wait this is the really loud one okay um I'm not gonna play this on this 
one because it's just too noisy yeah we had an incident one night and it brought tolada down 
um somebody behind us in the building behind us was holding somebody prisoner I think 
and the police showed up in number with fire trucks rolling and ambulances and everything and they had a bull horn and they were screaming at him to get out to come out now with his hands 
out and there's there's a lot of honking and so that's what the red light is this police say yes 
yeah the sun yeah the the flashing lights of the cops and tolada is like what's going on I'm like 
somebody's in trouble and he's like and he watched the whole thing he came down for it he figured they were looking at him not them not him you know so he had an opportunity you know 
so he'll appear in just a second but right now you're actually filming outside of your window yes I'm I'm one story up I'm on the second floor of our apartment it's a townhouse and I'm looking 
at my bedroom window and uh filming it because this is a somewhat cloudy night in just a second 
here you're going to see some lights down here in the second yep or the bottom half yep and
you can explain what we're looking at as soon as they show up which is going to be right I was panicking I was panning toward it and then and then I caught a lot of my mind and there 
he is I look back up and there he was okay so what's going on there's a dark line here this is 
a whole cloud layer and here's the her you know the actual horizon down here right yes way down 
and you can see a reflection here in the window yep and there's tolada right there so these two 
lights is one is one craft yeah and he's at the three-mile limit right there and he's skiffing 
all right now this is not super great footage but it certainly is interesting because it's coming down to check things out yeah so I kind of wanted to play this yeah because it's 
um some of the footage is better than others I'm saving the best for last or what I think is the best um but you have a lot of this stuff I mean this is just a small sampling yes so it does not 
appear that he's really moving here at all no he's holding he's dead up skiffing he's in one position 
and uh he can't come in too low that's why he set the almost the three mile limit is if he came down any it would knock out the whole neighborhood everybody would have lost power and that would 
have been bad so he didn't do that at this point he's communicating with you telepathically yes yep 
all right you know he came in because uh they were getting ready to contact me and then all this 
started happening and they were surveilling it they were making sure that I was going to be okay 
they watch everything that goes on around me always so yeah well that's true definitely 
with other contactors I know all right I'm going to move on to the next footage and let me just turn up the foot or the sound here okay this is a good one yep um this is um on the back porch 
on outside it's late at night I'm sitting in a chair because I know I'm about to be contacted everybody had gone to bed and this is this is a retriever coming down from me an ai and he's 
coming in pretty slow he's watching everything right now uh we live about 10 miles from 
the base you know u.s space force tyndall and uh so they have to be very careful this is a 
heavily populated area they don't want anybody shooting at them uh missiles are tend to fragment 
uh when they hit when they hit the field around the craft and those fragments can come down and kill people and so they don't want to draw fire over populated areas it's very bad and um 
that's what he's doing is so easy slow so here here's the house down below yeah that's not my 
house it's the one a back of us you know on the other side of that fence and um it's their back 
of their house it's grass between us okay it's not a parking lot or a road there it's all grass 
okay you can see another light up here so that's a second craft no that one is actually oh yeah okay 
yeah jupiter's all the way down low and yeah there was another one hanging around with them correct all right and so this blinking is really just him coming in and out of the clouds 
yes uh-huh there's there's uh crystallized clouds you know high steers up there and he was coming 
through that layer they were dropping down they were gonna have fog and uh he's citing me now 
he's trying to find me he knows I'm there he knows about where I'm at and he's about to flash a light 
down on that house so if I see it I'll jerk you know he'll hear it in my head and he'll know he's almost on top of me and I'll give him I'll tell him you know more 
you know 20 feet 30 feet I'm to your right whatever from your position and and then 
he'll know where I'm at all right so we'll see this whole house light up in just a second then
i will play it back so everyone can see it there it goes here let's just go back and pay 
very close attention to the house here and so he's sending out a bean uh yes it's a searchlight yeah
yeah so this is tilada then it's not it's a lot is above him oh okay 
he's the retriever they all have the ability to shine a really big light all of them they can they 
they're they're all equipped all right
so this is you know they're actually planning to come pick you up at this point yes when he gets 
within so many feet of me he will zoom up on me and they will take me up as quickly as they can 
i will walk out into the yard because I know he's there I'm getting ready to actually I'm sitting in a chair and I'm just waiting for him to give me the signal get up go and he'll grab me 
they'll grab me in a light beam they can't do that they can they can levitate you up in this beam 
you know no this is when when your housemate opened the door and yeah my my son-in-law he got 
up for some reason and was wandering around he saw me sitting out there like what she did and then he hit me with the door in the chair it's like and then they took off nope not playing it scared 
them off all right I just turned on the sound so we can see this one more time so this is the 
drone the pickup craft yes and talata is the danger like we said I think I saw him right there 
yeah he's up there he's watching he maybe there right there yeah he's around you see him blinking 
back and forth he the reason that he watches this so closely is if anything scrambles against him 
uh he will drag them away from the scene in other words he will give me cover in other words he'll 
you know give them something to do other than pay attention to me and what that craft is doing he'll 
you know what do they call that diversion they you'll create a diversion 
so at this point they're still pretty far away or how far away would you say uh he's within 
he's a good coming well right now he's up there okay you turn it back to the beginning right 
yeah I think so okay yeah yeah he's he's under a mile up and he's probably a half a mile away 
you know all right and he's just coming down real slow and he's inching toward me you know 
moving forward and he's watching everything on the ground below him as he's psyched me out and you know he knows basically where I am he can hear me in his 
head they can I have implants okay and talata's guiding him as well because tolada has that you 
you know what you would call gps on me tell us exactly where I am and so you know what's good 
about this footage is you have the foreground the house you can see this isn't a balloon 
it's not a satellite duh it's not ball lightning it's it's not an airplane it's not a helicopter 
no you can't hear anything all you hear is our air conditioning unit that's it okay no sound none 
if it was a if it was a a drone a police drone or something like that you would hear it whirling you 
know oh that's not it there's the house lighting up again yes replay that real quick so we can get 
another look at that so when he's sitting down a beam of light boom that's interesting
all right another very interesting piece of footage
it's very cool and uh some of the stuff coming up is even better and this is important that 
people see that this is a physical experience people are trying to say oh you know no no events 
are psychological no no no people are being taken physically on board they are physically there yes
and here is the event he's not close enough to affect your camera in any way so this is not yet 
no all right and they have ways of overcoming this not in line of sight of me in other words 
they knew I was filming this okay and I was going to get as much of this as I could until it dimed 
out and once once that beam hit me hit me it would have killed the camera instantly would have 
knocked all the power out in the house everything all right now we're going to here's another oh I 
love this footage um so I think this was yeah this was laughlin yes june 2021 june 6th after midnight 
actually so it's like june 7th in the morning now look at that there you can see the craft yep that 
is tolada I want everybody to pay attention I wish you'd I wish you could make that bigger but the shot of him sideways you can make him big enough I want everybody to think real hard where 
have they seen the shape of that craft before and uh yeah well I know what it reminds me of
so yeah I turned on the sound so if you want to make more comments uh here's the l he's flashing 
his light and we saw the other we saw the other craft over here but this is tolada yes that is 
sitting there yep and he's what's a couple hundred feet across um he's 230 some odd feet give or take 
yeah and he can actually become 250 he can expand he is able to do that he can make himself bigger 
you can make rooms bigger all kinds of stuff so it looks like one two two other craft besides 
yeah the lighting is not good but there were actually five of them up there I counted five 
all right and this was at the I was arriving the next day we yes at this conference I was 
speaking there I know you were on uh what show were you on that night coast to coast 
oh that's right yeah that's why you could get there the same day because you had to do close to coast yeah yeah I like that footage that is um really good footage and now we have another 
piece of really good footage that I'd like to play let me get the sound this is also the same night 
let me just start this over that's also talata and he's got his headlights on pretty bright 
now he did buzz bomb us okay this is just before he did that and when he did my camera died it was over okay um but he wanted yvonne to be surprised so yeah yeah so
this is the footage you know that actually appeared on the news in arizona the next day 
yep and uh we both watched it I'm like wow yeah yvonne had to drive the next day to las vegas 
to on her way home because she lives in uh uh just like northeast of phoenix she was going that way 
and she called me on the phone screaming you're not gonna believe this turn the news on why she says you're on the news 
he's on the news he got him they got him and I'll tell you wow so it's a big deal
i I i I didn't know anybody there yet I was just there so if I had known if I'd met anybody at the 
conference or anything I would have invited him over to sit with me but I didn't know anybody 
and he's a little bit shy when it comes to stuff like that so you know and and he is of their mind that you never know who's going to be at the conference 
who would show up who could make a phone call so put him at risk so we're not going to do that 
yeah this was the first day of the conference I think yes yep as I remember you were facing 
north so this is practically over the conference itself yes exactly it was he did it well 
there was a you know after anybody was out there looking up they would have seen him absolutely
and it's funny too because uh there were nights that they planned to do ce5s during that conference and they all went out and did it and I was just like oh my god and I don't 
know if they got in any any film or anything until I didn't tell me you know I was too busy
learning about things this was the very first conference I ever went to I knew I was still the babe in the woods when it came to what goes on in this community and 
i was all a gog I was gobsmacked you know just like wow
all right yeah this is again really good footage um what's really interesting about this is there 
are a number of ufo conferences where people have been able to photograph or film their 
photos over the conference itself right um so they should show up and this is another clear 
case of them posing I would say you know posing for the camera like we do yes we do yes 
and as you can see there's no conventional airplane lights there would be a red light or
yellow strobe yes and uh this is again staying relatively still in the sky you say 
they don't stay generally speaking stock still stationary they dip a little bit you know they 
it's like a boat on the water trying to stay in one spot they just you know they're around but you can't see that translated to you very far away you just see them as being still 
but they're actually moving around and when the light flares up here that's actually a product of 
your camera trying to focus right yes it's trying to grab the photo all right well it's good footage 
yeah so there you go people people are asking where how come they don't photograph them well they do and here is a good example of it 
and uh I just really want people to know this because dolly does have an extraordinary story 
uh everything you've told me I've said this before I've heard from other people pretty much all of it 
bit by bit piece by piece yes but for you to bring it all at once is amazing it's important to me to 
clarify the fact that I'm not the only one okay uh just because I've come out and I'm stating 
what I'm stating still doesn't make me the only one with information everybody has information about this they're hoping that everybody joins in contact with them they really do and I'm excited 
about it actually and that's their message come join the come join them come talk to them you know 
it's easy you can learn how to do it all right we just have like a few more but some of them are like really good okay here's this this is the same footage but you hired 
yes I lightened it up a little bit so you can make more out of him and uh
yeah you can definitely get more definition here yeah talata is that that his 
ship type his craft type is the more common type of craft um they have the 
sports models like lazar drew you know the one that he saw and and they have the ones 
that come and get me are more like the sports models it is a sports model um they have other 
types of craft just depending on what the job is that they've got going and they have much larger craft other than to water I mean torah is pretty big but there are way bigger than him um 
these craft last quite a while until something goes wrong and uh when you're making so many 
it's it's like they've got a good uh mechanism going you know and they don't alter from it 
too much they've been around too long it's you know what what works don't it's if it's 
it ain't broke don't fix it kind of attitude and they spend more of their energy and time on the 
things that do matter to them their craft are important but they're not trying to be uh better 
looking than everybody else that it never crosses their mind it's not part of their thinking process
so um I will tell you that the turkish ufo is exactly like toronto exactly and well you can see 
the shape right there yeah look at the turkish footage there you go yes it's yeah that's it 
okay so all right okay now let's move to the next one which I think if I'm correct is the 
daylight footage yes I love this one ah um I was home in columbus um uh it's 2017 and um 
getting ready to have surgery on my arm I developed an 11 inch blood clot in my arm where I had a fistula from before my kidney got transplanted and I was sitting there 
and it was after my surgery and I was in my big chair and I was talking to my donor on the phone and my phone was in the kitchen on charge and I'm looking out the window in my living room it's a 
big window like this all the way across and uh there are five of them and they're circling the 
house I'm like melissa hang on I want her to see it I didn't want to tell her what it was right away so I ran in the kitchen got the phone when it came back I caught one that was the one 
and I was peeved beyond belief but you can hear me say I was very emotional I said that's a ufo 
and I was trying to show it to her well this is great footage it's daylight footage this is 
object is not moving like any conventional object right you can see it's not almost stopping and 
dropping or he's adjusting you know yeah and when it goes behind the tree that proves that this is 
not something close to the camera right right so I mean it's very hard to refute stuff like this yeah
and this is you know daylight footage is exceedingly rare correct so yeah I really like this one as well
I'm glad you managed to capture it there I love that yeah workloads behind the tree that's yeah a 
good job how ever you're photographing something do try to get something in the foreground because yes you learn that technique yes you learn not to get uh flares from the sun or the moon you 
learn what your camera is capable of producing uh artifacts that are not there things like that you 
just take a little soft course about it on youtube youtube has lots of courses about photographing 
things and um it'll help you a lot in your capture of what you're looking at so yeah very cool
all right it was a good day this I when I showed this to her she went dead silent on the phone 
she went oh my god that's a real ufo because I'd been talking to her about it forever okay she knew 
it was a part of my life I mean she's practically part of my family okay and uh when my mother my 
mom was getting ready to go into assisted living and she wanted to be in panama city near my daughter and so melissa and I moved her down there we loaded her up on that truck moved all the stuff 
in and loaded it into the the place where she was living and on the way back a terrible storm 
started brewing and there was a horrible accident and tolada told me slow down stop do not go forward yet and I did and she was like what are you doing honestly tell us to stop don't 
go forward and she's like why I said there's an accident and she's like okay right sure and about 
five minutes later when we started going again oh yeah it was bad it was a 20 car pileup and we would have been in it uh she was like getting ill over that and I saw a mexican restaurant so 
we pulled over and had dinner and afterwards um the weather was so bad I couldn't tell east west 
north or south I didn't know that parking lot and I turned down the highway the wrong way and after about five minutes I realized oh god I'm going the wrong way and tolada literally came down in under 
you know you say the the limit you know the viewing limit of a storm coming down it was less than 10 miles it was more like five and he bloody came down over the car and she said 
what is that she was looking at it and I said that would be our our way out of here and I followed me 
turned me around and I got back up on the right road and he stayed with me almost halfway back to where we were going and she just sat stone silent in the car and she was like oh my god oh my god oh 
my god oh my god it's real I'm like yeah he wanted her yeah he wanted very much for her to enjoy 
that knowledge he wanted her to have personal contact also because I mean it's just a weird 
situation how she gave me a kidney in the first place and he he feels very close to her also so 
i want to interview you more about some of those kinds of experiences because I have to tell you I put a whole chapter about these sort of events in my book about ufo healing cases uh where they 
rescue people you know prevent them from that in car accidents and all healing and all kinds of 
stuff so we could definitely talk more about that later but now I want to get to but I it's honestly 
my favorite footage okay uh which is the last one I think that we're gonna play today and this is 
a pretty pretty short one oh no there's one more sorry it's okay I think that's talata more of him
all right let me start from the beginning because there's good good sound here
it's very fast yeah
that was a weird night for me by the way I'd been on a plane all day I had two planes to get on 
and travel all the way from you know panama city florida all the way out to las vegas that was 
the closest I could get to walk lane and then yvonne picked me up at the airport and we drove all the way through the desert to get the loch line so I had been up at five in the morning 
and it was after eleven o'clock when I finally said let's go outside and you know I hear him 
and I was in face down tired from all that and he was be reading me the whole time just go to 
bed just go to bed you're fine you'll be fine it's like no I want the footage I'm determined 
to get this footage yeah I was not thrilled with laughlin there's just no water there one there was the river but it was a dry dead area yeah yeah what got good footage
yes it did all right so this is that same ufo conference the ufo car okay 
right yeah yes uh-huh all right so now I think if I'm correct is the 
maybe not the really good footage well it's coming soon this is oh no this is the drones right 
so this is actually really interesting uh you can see a tiny little dot here but 
just wait there it is oh this is during the fourth of july no no no no this isn't the 
fourth of july okay no no this is when he drops the drones oh okay all right the e.t drones okay
yeah I'm probably trying to coat some but yeah you tell when you're observing them and they're like it's looking at me you know 
they can hear you thinking and I had to tell them you know go ahead go ahead go ahead
I'll teach you a new word I'm trying to teach everybody one new word every so often means go ahead
in the grace language yes it means go ahead all right so that's two words I know one is absol 
yes that means I'm ready um yeah which means there we go go ahead go ahead 
now it's like come on drop one go ahead you know all right luther there watch this this is cool
there we go because this is kind of footage I haven't seen elsewhere yeah I'm pretty sure 
nobody's got footage like this anywhere this was a treat for me yeah yep there he goes he's 
dropping them it's like okay we're gonna let them see how we do this you know people don't realize 
how they do it they have to drop it into an electromagnetic field that can go down below their 
two concurrent fields if they were try to drop a drone out of their bubble it would make it hit 
the inside of it and bounce around so they have to create a force to drop the drone side of the craft 
all right so he's pretty low elevation here at this point yeah he's he's um at uh just under the 
mall limit he's dropping in under a mile yep all right here I turn down the volume because I want to play this again because I have a few things I want to comment on yeah okay so right now 
you can't really see much because they're way the heck up there but there's a tiny little white dot right there yep it's quite hard to see but give it a second to know you can still see it 
yeah just so y'all know that I have a samsung uh 10 or is it 11. I have a samsung I have an android 
phone and uh so I have the three the three you know lens camera and uh it takes decent footage
all right so this is just one craft one light that we're seeing up right yes but at some point you see the two lights that's the whole craft
the the drones come out the the literally at the front side of the craft right up underneath the 
front side all right they have a huge array there that they move out of the way and they shoot down 
a light uh it's light that's why it's the color that it is it's pure light it's dropping down 
through a light uh force that's can penetrate through that that electromagnetic current 
that they've got going on in there and uh it literally it's interdimensional okay so now 
semi interdimensional we see the two lights so this is still one yeah that's the whole craft yeah 
okay go and see one now but it's this we'll see the two in a second and this is this is 
stilata right uh or no no it's not tolada it's one that looks like him he's a little bit bigger 
i would call that a mother ship that's a big ship big big big how big are we talking uh 
300 400 feet yeah probably four or five hundred feet so from here to here yeah and the drones 
that are being dropped out the e.t drones I'm just want to clarify that they're about 30 feet 
long all right you know the tic tacs that everybody sees that's down well all right 
but different power modes for them makes them project different light fields around them a 
plot you know the one where the two fields are shooting out that's a plasma field it's heating up it's getting ready to take off and go where it's going to go plasma is funny it starts at 
the two points the two main energy points and then it totally engulfs the entire craft and they look 
like a tic tac when they're fully running so very cool yeah and this actually made the evening news 
well I'm not sure if this was the actual footage that made it but well he flew over las vegas he told me he did so very cool all right lots of people saw him then 
let me turn the sound back up because we're approaching the end here
and uh I just want to play a couple more pieces
all right here we go oh yeah here's the one I really like okay yeah 
he's doing his cuddle fish he's coming down his stealth he's making himself look smaller than he really is and uh he came way down 
and I he would have I would have gone with him except that I was home alone and if they had come back and I wasn't there it would have been bad so I stayed and but I got him on film 
that was very very cold if you play the sound you can hear dogs start barking they're all freaking 
out you know the property next door because they saw him they're like ah what is that you know 
no the sun's down it's mostly traffic noise uh-huh yeah it's on a main road it's on uh highway and uh
she's gotta I guess about two and a half acres out there maybe two weeks this is this is a window right with a pillowcase over it yeah it's a porch window so the house is right here you can't really 
see the house itself but you can see the window right and this is tolada this is yes all right 
and how high up would you say he is and how close okay he's under a thousand feet he's about between 
500 and 800 feet easily and he's about an eighth of a mile away from me and in that 
direction let's see he was uh he was like due west of me and this was in florida no it's in 
georgia yes all right so it's right and are those little lights are we just seeing reflections 
uh remember I said he's like a cuttlefish he can make any light pattern on him he wants he can do an array of little blinky you know lights all the way and can shimmer 
and he's being pretty there so that's why we have such a wide variation of people's describing 
colored lights and lit up like a christmas tree or even different different shapes because they can 
assume an appearance yes they can absolutely but what I like about this footage is it's so darn low 
yeah he was coming in yeah enough away from me was going to knock my camera out and but he was 
low enough that I got a good shot of him you know and it was so quiet that night I mean it was a 
weird night nobody was really out they were down in town which is a long ways away from there and 
i got a good I got good pictures of him yeah and you can't tell me this is just a light in the sky 
because it's not you can see the gray metallic surface there the saucer will saucer is ish shape 
right the way you zoom up on it clearly see yep this is a busy boy all right I'm gonna play it 
one more time because I just like this footage and it's the last one we got for today I remember when I sent it to you lost your mind you're like oh my god oh my god you're jumping up and down 
yeah when people ask where's the photographic evidence there is a lot of it 
and what I like about yours is you're willing to stand behind your footage you can explain it so much that's out there on the internet there's it's completely anonymous 
and a lot of it's clearly cgi and disinformation and completely bogus yes there is a lot of 
that I'm beginning to believe that a lot of experiencers you know contactees are mortified 
of what the government could do to them or their families okay and so they don't talk I'm kind of 
at a point in my life where I don't have that hanging over me and I'm really not afraid of 
anything anyway you know right well no it's good footage and zlata was very kind to provide it
like I said it's not often people get good footage
well I want everybody to take a camera course and get good cameras and go out there okay right now you're not going to get more than drones I'm going gonna be honest about that 
um it would be a freaking weird uh circumstance to see an actual e.t uh craft coming in coming 
because our magnesium is so messed up it's too dangerous for them the drones they're expendable so they don't mind okay uh leaving them behind they're keeping an 
eye on us because of what we're all going through but you will see the drones and you can the ai on 
board can hear you they're psychic as well and uh you can talk one down get a good shot of it 
go for it I mean it go for it seriously you know all right well I think we got a 
good look at that so let me just uh stop the share so we can get both back on screen here
all right that was awesome it took a little longer than I thought that's awesome that gives a good 
hour of actual good ufo footage okay so there you go people want photographs those are photographs 
so I really appreciate you having the courage to step forward and share all these dolly you're very 
welcome it's my pleasure and my honor I know there are skeptics out there and I'm going to say this 
again which I've said before is it's up to each individual person to follow their own pathway 
towards the truth right self-discovery of yourself and the truth heal yourself 
and stick your mind out there and start learning all you can learn I mean it's what it's about here and yeah because photographs are not going to prove to you that ufos are real the only proof 
for each individual is personal experience that's where knowledge comes from so these this is just 
you know a little signpost a little you know welcoming just to say that you know this is the 
kind of experience that you can have you can go out there and see this for yourself correct and
a lot of people have taken really extraordinary photographs I think most we don't see most of them 
this is true I mean there are tons of footage on the internet that I used to know about 
and it's totally gone now and it breaks my heart you know uh there's there are there are stories 
that were reported to the different agencies and they're disappearing as well and that breaks my 
heart so yeah so this is just one form of evidence I will say that um you know I interviewed dolly a 
hundred times going over and over the same events uh she has confirming witnesses she's medical 
evidence photographic evidence other evidence so it's really just something I want people to know 
that there is a lot to her story and this is the part I've been wanting to share for a while so 
once again thanks dolly you're very welcome and I think I'm going to end it here I want 
to thank you all for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time like I like to always say 
have fun yes keep having fun keep having fun all right bye for now guys until next time bye
hey dude you watching us
my neighbor is out here with me and her daughter how do
now been out here for about half an hour close to 40 minutes
well we're either going to hear about it on the news or we're not
i wonder how many other people are filming this
by the way he is circling us
here move everybody
that is a ufo
son of a [ __ ]
if I'm running outside I'm not going to catch it damn it god damn
come here look at my camera I see it he's gonna do a flyby I asked for it we're getting it they told me to start looking
zoom in on him oh yeah how pretty he's moving all around yep I'm okay I'm doing pretty good
I'm just tired I know
and I will
okay we got a name coming he's got a low rider
oh I lost him yeah there's a little rider coming we're gonna get buzz
oh he's dropping drones I'm gonna give him
yes see if we can get him yep there he is he's dropping drones it's one of the guys
oh come on you can let me see thank you
I'm so tired
