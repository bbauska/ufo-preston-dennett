ALIEN GRAVE ROBBERS
Jun 9, 2020

Summary:
Jun 9, 2020
It's one of the strangest types of UFO behavior, and kind of creepy. UFOs are hovering over 
graveyards and cemeteries, usually at very low levels. In some cases, they land and humanoids 
are seen. In other cases, graves are being disturbed. Clearly something very profound is 
happening here. 

In this video I present about a dozen cases coming from major researchers across the world. 
UFOs are definitely attracted to graveyards. The question is: why?
For those who would like to learn more about the information in this video, I wrote an 
in-depth study of these types of cases in my book, "Not from Here: Volume 1," now available 
on Amazon.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett those  of you who are familiar with my research no I've  
never shied away from controversial areas and  this video is about a pretty controversial area  
of UFO research I would say it's about UFOs  that hover over graveyards not only hover but  
very low level sometimes land in a few cases  that are humanoid seen these cases are coming  
from researchers all over the world so there's  definitely some connection there not sure what  
it is but thought I'd take a little look at  some of these cases a really interesting case  
took place on May 7th 1967 at the Mount Pleasant  Cemetery in Edmonton in Alberta Canada the main  
witness is 14 year old Ricky ban iord he and  his friend Glen saw this UFO hovering over the  
graveyard they described it very much like a  typical flying saucer with two like two bowls  
stuck together and it was sending down beams of  light into the graveyard for some time the next  
day they examined the graveyard and sure enough  there were strange burn marks among the graves  
which was verified actually by the cemetery  foreman joseph Lafourche a lot of cases like  
this one case comes from Jim and Cora Lorenzen  also in 1967 they heard from a lady who owned a  
funeral parlor she said her son came running in  one day and said there was a UFO hovering over  
the building she didn't believe him but several  days later a gentleman had come to visit a loved  
one's gravesite came running in and said there was  a UFO hovering over the graveyard by the time she  
got outside it was gone but apparently this place  was targeted twice so there's definitely some kind  
of interest there excellent case involving UFO  hovering over a graveyard comes from J Allen  
Hynek he's obviously a pioneering researcher in  this field he discusses a case which occurred  
on March 8th 1967 in Leo Minster Massachusetts  to a young couple who decided to go driving and  
look at the scenery and was we're driving by  the local cemetery when they noticed an object  
a lighted object hovering very low above it there  was a weird strange fog covering the cemetery and  
only that area so it was very strange they drove  up to it and pulled the car over alongside the  
road right at the cemetery he got out of the  car he left the car running and he pointed at  
the object at which point he felt in an electric  shock his arm was pinned back to the top of the  
car and he was paralyzed the car engine failed the  headlights dimmed and the radio became filled with  
static after a few seconds the object lifted up  darted away and the man was no longer paralyzed  
the car engine came back on and they drove away  so clearly this UFO was doing something in the  
graveyard that it didn't want them to see that's  what it looks like researcher Raymond Fowler also  
a pioneering and well-respected researcher says  that he's run into several cases involving UFOs  
over graveyards one occurred in October 1964 two  young men robert Kushi and william chase were  
driving by a graveyard when they saw a metallic  silver disc hovering very low they watched for  
about 30 seconds before they became frightened and  drove off to tell the police many researchers are  
reporting these types of cases a great one comes  from Jacques Valley it occurred in October 9th  
1954 at a cemetery in porns a Lhasa teve France  for children were rollerskating near the local  
cemetery when they saw a disc either hovering  or very low or landed in the cemetery next to  
it was is very small short figure had dark eyes  was wearing a dark jumpsuit it spoke to them in  
some foreign language shined a blinding light at  them then retreated into its craft which took off  
straight up and when it went away it's one of the  few cases involving actual entities an alarming  
case comes from Nova Scotia Canada from MUFON  director Eugene Friesen he interviewed a young  
paperboy who decided to take a shortcut through  the local cemetery and apparently came upon a  
landed UFO it was fairly large metallic it lifted  up as he approached and went right over his head  
he felt a blast of heat he ran home by the time  he got home he had blisters all over his face and  
his chest so the UFO apparently burned him another  case occurred on November 4th 1957 to two police  
officers and a fireman who were on patrol and had  been sent to the scene of a possible crime when  
they started to pass by the local Elmwood Cemetery  where they saw a very large glowing egg-shaped  
object hovering in place as they approached their  headlights began to dim and their spotlight also  
began to dim and flicker this object quickly shot  up upward about 200 feet and then darted off very  
quickly an article about the incident was actually  published in the local newspaper so I don't know  
how many cases are like this but there's a lot  one case comes from actually the famous celebrity  
a musician by the name of Rob Zombie who told a  journalist that back in 1973 he saw a UFO hovering  
over the graveyard that was not too far from the  school a case reported to MUFON comes from a lady  
who was buying driving by the Chile coath cemetery  in Chile Cote Illinois when her radio started to  
become staticky she pulled over because she saw  these two large glowing orange objects at very low  
level over the cemetery she saw other people had  also pulled over and were watching these objects  
which stayed for only a few moments and started to  move away when helicopters approached and actually  
chased them away scott Corelli's is a prominent  UFO researcher and one of the few people who have  
actually looked into these types of cases he's  uncovered a number of them actually one occurred  
in Brazil on April 5th 1996 when a mother and son  came upon a landed UFO and it quickly took off and  
went right over their car solo they thought it  was going to actually hit their car the mother  
was so emotionally traumatized that she had to  be sent to the hospital another case from Scott  
Corrales occurred in South Paulo Brazil at a large  graveyard this was in 1989 when a gravedigger saw  
a metallic object aluminum looking shaped like a  hat hovering at very low level over the cemetery  
another case from Scott Corrales occurred to  two couples who were in Spain and saw this red  
glowing object landed in the graveyard near their  home they watched it for a few minutes when it  
suddenly took off straight up and was gone a case  from England again it's all over the world on July  
15th 1996 a young man was walking home we saw a  yellow object at very low level tree top level  
he said hovering over the cemetery and it was  sending down beams of light that frightened him  
badly so he ran home got his dad they called the  police and they met there at the cemetery the UFO  
is gone but they did find some pieces of wood big  big railway sleepers that had strange 4-inch hole  
burned through them and they were still smoldering  some people have caught photographs of these  
things over graveyards a famous incident will not  famous but this case was reported to MUFON and it  
occurred on June 6 2006 a group of Ghost Hunters  were doing a stakeout at alt cemetery in Alta  
Colorado when a UFO showed up it looked like a UFO  is a glowing kind of saucer shaped object one of  
them had a camera which he quickly snapped a photo  of and submitted it to move on another photograph  
was taken in February 2000 by Cindy Corriveau a  prominent paranormal researcher who was visiting  
a graveyard in Wethersfield Connecticut and  thought she saw some figures small figures out in  
the distance in the graveyard and looking up saw a  glowing object and quickly snapped three pictures  
so there are people who have photographed these  things for sure probably the biggest case of this  
kind comes from veteran journalist bob teats who  reported about an incident like this in his book  
West Virginia UFOs there was these three adjoining  cemeteries net consummatory calvo cemetery and  
most importantly here Dean Memorial Cemetery  throughout the 1960s in the 1970s and beyond  
there were numerous sightings of objects over  these cemeteries large glowing objects metallic  
objects one couple drove by the cemetery saw UFO  it actually followed her car people have watched  
this from their homes it became so predictable  they started doing UFO stakeouts a very famous  
incident occurred on October 8th 1967 when three  people were doing a UFO stakeout one of them was a  
reverend and sure enough a classic flying saucer  showed up and they watched it send on a beam of  
light and target one of the graves they noticed  that that was actually a freshly dug grave the  
person had been buried that very day this was a  pattern that turned up on other instances where  
the UFO appeared to target freshly dug graves  so yeah I mean a lot of cases I know of several  
others one in June 8th 2011 a man in Illinois  heard his dog barking strangely went outside and  
saw a UFO hovering over the graveyard at the end  of the street another case in December 1966 where  
a whole family observed a UFO land in the local  cemetery so yeah a lot of cases the question I  
think is why what's going on here these are very  low-level sightings they're often landing we've  
seen humanoids in these cases sometimes the grave  sites are actually disturbed scott Corelli's who's  
looked into this as I mentioned speculates that  perhaps the ETS are retrieving their implants  
my first thought when I heard about these cases  was that they were perhaps harvesting genetic  
material someone asked me after I published you  know an article on this whether they might be  
harvesting souls another thought perhaps they're  doing autopsies or whatever the explanation these  
cases like these show that UFOs definitely show  an interest in cemeteries and graveyards Raymond  
Fowler had a case in the summer of 1964 which  he investigated with well-known UFO researcher  
Walter Webb where a UFO had landed in a cemetery  in Lawrence Massachusetts it had been seen by two  
young boys and the researchers follow her and Webb  actually did a stakeout in the cemetery didn't see  
anything but they later learned that the police  were also staking out that cemetery because on  
the same week that the children had seen the UFO  there had been a gravesite that had been robbed  
so perhaps that's what we're seeing here is you  know alien grave robbers I hate to say it but  
these cases kind of speak for themselves back in  2 thousand and two I wrote an article about it for  
fate magazine they rejected it so I sent it off  to the MUFON Journal who published it when I next  
got the issue of fate magazine their next issue  there was an article there by Scott Corelli's  
also talking about UFOs over cemeteries so we had  both stumbled upon the West Virginia Dean Memorial  
Cemetery case at the same time and started looking  into this and both found a bunch of cases since  
then there's been a lot more cases I've made  a complete study of these which I've published  
in my book not from here volume one so if you want  to yeah I mean I'm not sure why UFOs are targeting  
graveyards again I've got my theories I do know  one thing for sure with so many cases it's only  
a matter of time before it happens again so once  again thanks for listening and keep having fun
