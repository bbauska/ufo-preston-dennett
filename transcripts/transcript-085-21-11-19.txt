STAR DAUGHTER: ONE MAN'S LIFELONG EXPERIENCES WITH EXTRATERRESTRIALS
Nov 19, 2021

Summary:
Nov 19, 2021
Born in New York, Tony Ditata had his first UFO sighting at age seventeen, while walking outside his home in Brentwood. A few years later, he experienced a dramatic face-to-face encounter with a gray alien on the local golf course. Before long, he started having memories of being taken onboard a craft. Soon more encounters followed: sightings, missing-time, onboard experiences and more face-to-face encounters. When Tony realized finally accepted that he was a UFO abductee, he sought regressive hypnosis and recalled an incredible experience where he and his girlfriend were taken onboard a massive disc which had landed alongside the road in upstate New York.

Tony's encounters span the gamut of the UFO experience, with virtually every type of encounter, some of which are extremely bizarre. At one point, he was able to meet with who he believes is his hybrid-ET daughter, or as he calls her, his "Star Daughter." Along with the UFO encounters came various paranormal experiences, such as poltergeist encounters, past life memories and more.

Tony's encounters have left him profoundly changed, and have left him a whole new view of life on Earth and beyond. His story provides a fascinating glimpse into the life of a contactee.

This video presents Tony's story in his own words. You will hear his story firsthand as he describes his encounters, and how they have affected him and altered the course of his life.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i've got a fantastic episode of you today I think I call it star daughter one man's lifelong 
experiences with extraterrestrials these include not only ufo sightings but face-to-face encounters 
some with details i've never heard before and of course onboard ufo experiences it's a very 
interesting case I think you'll enjoy it very much what I like about this episode is I was able to 
interview the witness firsthand of course and i'm going to play for you the clips of 
the interview I did with him so you'll be able to hear the descriptions in the witnesses own 
words the witness is tony de tata he was born in 1946 in new york and his first major ufo 
sighting occurred when he was just 17 years old outside his home in brentwood new york this was in 
1963 and he had gone out for a walk one evening it was around 9 00 p.m 
and he was just outside his home walking through brentwood when he had a major encounter 
with a giant black disc at treetop level it had little red lights all around the circumference 
and i'll just let tony describe in his own words what he saw so I left my house that I 
was starting to walk up the street towards her house and this is still in threat with new york
i was looking towards uh the middle of what would have been the town and there was a uh a black disc 
it was a an awesome thing to see it was it was quite large
i'm going to say at least 40 feet in diameter
and I don't know if the thing itself was was turning spinning or there was a red light on 
its edge and I don't know if that red light was going around the edge or the thing itself was 
was spinning and it was like um with the front of it the leading edge of it was 
tilted towards the ground at like um roughly 45 degrees 
um and it was moving slower than a piper cup would be I would say 30 40 miles an hour maybe 
and uh it was I was at ground level naturally and it was at my tree top level and maybe a 
quarter of a mile away and it was going along and it would uh I would lose sight of it behind 
like a house and then it would come out again and I could see it again so I i ran back to my house 
i was painting the house at the time so there was a ladder on the side of the house so I put 
the ladder up and climbed up on the roof to try and get a better look at it and it 
went behind the house and then it would come out and I could see it again and then it would go 
behind the house and I can't see it and then it would come out and I could see it again 
then it was behind the house and never came back I don't know what happened to it 
i never saw it go up I never saw it go away I don't know where it went so as you can see 
that was quite a dramatic sighting tony's next encounter occurred just four years later in 1967 
and this was an actual face-to-face encounter with gray ET's tony and his friends used to 
hang out brent at brentwood state park this is in the middle of brentwood in new york and uh 
they would just hang out have fun maybe drink some beers on this particular evening there was 
about a half dozen of them they didn't have any money so they weren't drinking beer at this time 
they hung out for a few hours walked over to the nearby local golf course and finally they decided 
that they were going to go home for the evening most of tony's friends decided that they were 
going to hang out at one of the friends houses he lived right across the street from the golf course 
but tony and his other friend john decided that they were just going to go home 
and so the group departed and tony and his friend john were walking along and decided to 
rest for a few moments on a park bench overlooking the golf course this is when they had a very 
interesting encounter it began when they heard this strange jingling noise like car keys 
or perhaps a dog's leash or something along those lines they didn't see anything so that was quite 
unusual but it was just a short moment later when they did see something and it was a gray e.t just 
50 feet away from them and i'll let tony describe what happened next in his own words and 
we turned and looked at it again at the green and there was a gray standing there
again about um
i'm trying to remember the distance maybe
maybe 40 feet at the most 40 feet and
again it was facing us and I don't remember any faithful features
and it it looked it was wearing like what looked like a one-piece type um I guess today you call it 
like a running suit a sweatsuit you know that kind of thing and it was like the dull side 
of aluminum foil is what it looked like and we both stood up and turned around and looked at it 
and I turned and I looked at john's hit and he looked at me and um and rico turned back 
and looked at it and I i I don't think this was more than 30 seconds either
and it turned and that's why I know it was facing us because it turned and went off away from us 
and it went right down the middle of the golf course now this is not lit up you know there are some lights there but it's not it's not lit up like um 
you know keep trespassers away or anything like that at that point in time there wasn't uh that kind of thing going on so there was no need 
really for spotlights and stuff like that but anyway we could see this thing in the um 
i don't know I don't remember now if the moon was out or whatever but we could see the thing 
and it was moving fast enough that it should have been running but there was no movement there was no balance and I don't remember seeing its legs moving 
it was like that the yacht of the golf course was covered in ice or it was on wheels and it was 
moving pretty fast faster than a human could run and off in the distance i'm going to say probably 
quarter mile away roughly there were a group of trees and two or three uh very tall pine trees 
and this thing went behind this two or three pine trees and then it came out and another one came 
out from behind the tree we didn't see I don't remember seeing the other one and then they both 
took off down the middle of the golf course away from us and I used to see john 
up in the park almost every day he was one of the regulars up at the park 
so I would see him just about every day and I didn't see john again for three years 
and I walked into the uh brentwood uh bowling alley and there was john sitting at the uh 
at the counter and I said hey john and he goes hey tony and any little green men lately 
and we both laugh and um I never saw him again so what an interesting encounter 
especially the way the e.t moved gliding across the golf course there without even moving its legs 
it's quite unusual and what's really interesting is what happened after this encounter they went 
rushing to their friend's house to tell them and found them all asleep on the floor 
it seemed far too soon for them to all have just fallen asleep especially in that position 
tony and his friend john thought it was quite weird after we saw this on the on 
the golf course we we both granted to dave's house which was uh like a half a block away
i'm guessing less than a block away and we ran we ran to dave's house and looked down in his 
basement and there were all all the guys asleep now I believe it was a friday night I mean a group 
of guys sitting there watching tv they're all gonna fall asleep within like a half an hour that 
doesn't make sense john and I do what the hell how could they have fallen asleep so fast 
because it seems like we just left them 30 40 minutes ago there was about three years after this
my girlfriend and we ran into this girl her name was katie and uh katy was telling us 
that her brother um was looking out his bedroom window uh like two o'clock in the 
morning so there was nothing on the other side of his backyard except the golf course 
uh so katie was telling us that uh her brother looked out there and there was a disc sitting 
on the ground with 11 little men walking around underneath picking things up and it was around 
the same time that me and john saw the two greys on the golf course and they went when 
they when they left they headed in that general direction right but there seemed to have been 
um in that area uh from where we were looking out on the golf course from where we were looking 
off in the distance there seemed to be a red or reddish glow coming from roughly 
that area and I just you know I i would just like like to go back in time and 
if they're connected it was two years later and tony was dating at this point he had met 
a young woman and they decided that they were going to go to lake ronkan kama this was a 
popular hangout for young lovers to sort of get a little bit intimate and uh overlook this beautiful 
lake and tony was there with his girlfriend it was at night when they had a very dramatic ufo 
sighting and again i'll just let tony describe in his own words this incredible ufo sighting 
involving two glowing discs we used to go to this um place in a town called ronkonkova new york uh 
there was a there was a there is a lake there lake ronkonkoma and there's a town there and in part of 
the town there was a trail you could drive off the main road and go up this uh trail into the woods 
and you could literally drive for about 15-20 minutes through these woods maybe longer and and 
totally be away from everybody in the middle of long island new york you know and so we would 
go back there and and sit around and drink beer and talk and hang out and then you know the guys 
and girls would separate so me and lori would separate and you know go make out and whatever 
and uh just one night was sitting out there and and talking and I looked up in the sky 
and there's these two they looked white two discs but these two discs seem to be 
locked together and they went like from what horizon we could see and to the other inside of um
20 seconds and they were they were they were white and I don't know naturally I can't tell 
how high they were or how low they were but they weren't you could tell they weren't close 
they had to be up there and I why were they so brightly white and there's no way if you looked up 
could miss them there's no way you could miss them they were pure white bright light
but no sound no sound at all it was around this time that tony began to have some very 
interesting memories he's not sure when he first recalled being on board a ufo 
it seemed like this memory had always been there he just started thinking about it more and more and it soon got to the point where he had to face the fact that he remembered 
being on board a ufo and what's interesting about it is he traces this memory to about the age of 14 
which was well before his first ufo sighting and his sighting of these gray ET's on the golf course 
so he's not sure how this happened he doesn't remember being taken on board he doesn't 
remember being put back but he does have a clear memory of being on board a ufo now again just let 
tony describe his experience in his own words I don't recall how how it started but I i remember
being on a on a ship being on board and i'm sitting on a table and it's like a uh not really a gurney but a fixed table uh
but like human length you know like maybe a six foot long table seven foot long table something like that and i'm sitting on the edge of the table 
uh with my legs dangling over the edge I don't know what happened 
uh because i'm i'm sitting there and i'm in my underwear only and this grave walks in and
he puts his hand on my left leg on my knee and he looks into my eyes and i'm looking into his
and he's maybe 12 inches from my face maybe a little less but that's all I can remember is is 
looking into his face and
as i'm looking at him his right eye in the upper right corner of his eye it twitches you know like um like an earthquake 
and I that for some reason sticks in my mind as if to say this is the life living creature
at this point in time memories are kind of a little bit faded but he took me out of the room 
and we walked out of the doorway which was not a typical door um everything you looked at inside 
of the ship there was no sign of any any kind of nails or screws or any kind of hardware or no uh 
light fixture but the room was lit and I can't tell where the light is coming from
there is no corners anywhere everything is grounded 
uh even where the ceiling meets the wall and the wall meets the floor it's rounded
and we walked through this doorway and to the right and it was
to the left there was another doorway and uh
seems like some kind of control room maybe or maybe just like that um I i don't know what to make of it it's like a a desk thing
and i'm trying to remember I think there were two two other beings in that room
and that's really all I can remember I don't remember how I got there or
when and or how I was brought back any colors were very pale 
um pastel uh like yellow I i don't know I seem to remember uh the light being sort of yellowish
not a bright yellow the room was I don't understand this either the room was brightly lit 
but the light source I don't know where the light source is that is another thing 
that has bothered me over the years being that this thing was that close to my face 
there must have been communication but I don't remember any any communication 
i don't really recall any telepathic or verbal I remember any sounds it wasn't cold in the room 
or in in on the ship but it wasn't extremely warm either it was just comfortable I mean no no breeze
i can't remember smelling anything he was about four feet tall um 
might have been the same guy I that's what i'm curious about because he looked to be
about to say um except in this uh when I was 14 I could see his face um 
and it's not like whiplash um communion uh cover it's not like that it's closer to um 
uh what they call that russian uh video that's out there skinny bob 
yeah it the head doesn't look exactly like kidney ball so as you can see tony's onboard experience 
is fairly typical he recalls the rounded room the indirect lighting 
uh gray ET's he did say that the inside of the ufo was normal temperature normal gravity 
he says that it had muted pastel colors no real furnishings he did see a weird cabinet 
and other sort of weird stuff that he found hard to describe it's a strange isolated memory and he 
doesn't know quite how this happened when he was taken it's very odd and he never thought 
he discussed it with anybody but he did later meet as an adult a childhood friend and as they started 
talking the subject of ufos came up and his friend told tony that tony's to talk about ufos 
all the time i'll just let tony describe this encounter with his friend and what his friend said 
i run into a friend that I a friend of mine that was in school with me back then 
and he said that I always talked about it I always talked about aliens and ufos flying saucers and I 
said I did really and he said yes you always used to talk about that kind of stuff I said oh wow
that was kind of um can't I don't know I guess kind of a surprise I didn't I didn't 
know that I talked to other people so as an adult tony became very interested in 
ufos he started working at a factory later worked at a car dealership doing detailing 
and he became so interested in ufos he decided he was going to do some research he ended up 
joining the long island ufo network this was a ufo group that met monthly on long island this group 
was headed by john ford who founded the group tony was able to talk with john ford first hand 
and john listened to tony's story about his ufo sightings and encouraged tony to go under hypnosis 
and tony was intrigued by the idea that he might have memories locked in his mind that he wasn't 
consciously aware of and so he agreed he agreed to go under hypnosis and actually had 
three sessions and all three of these sessions focused on one particular puzzling incident 
it was in the mid 1970s that tony and his girlfriend soon to be his future wife 
decided to go up into the catskills and up into the adirondack mountains for just a little trip 
up into the wilderness this is something that they had done before but on this particular 
trip something weird happened they became lost somehow they got diverted off the main highway 
and onto the side streets and the next thing they know it is the next morning 
and they're parked behind a building which turned out to be a diner they have no idea how they got there at the time they didn't know what to make of it they didn't 
even realize they had missing time but now that he went under hypnosis he recalled a very interesting 
and dramatic onboard ufo encounter in which he not only saw grays but another type of entity 
and i'll just let tony describe this whole encounter in his own words
i remember we were driving down uh we got off the interstate highway 
and why I don't know I don't know why we got off and we were driving down this two-lane road and
i I don't know what sense any of this makes i'm just gonna tell you what what happened
we're driving along and there in front of us in the distance I can see like uh fog
low-lying frog like very close to the ground and it's covering the road and then as I get closer I 
can see that the road is going into a decoy and it's going like downhill not a steep um grade 
but I guess gently let's say downhill sort of grade and in front of us with water
and uh that I don't know what this means I don't I can't make sense of it 
how could this road be covered by water and I remember I had to stand on the brakes 
because I i was going pretty fast and I had to stand on the brake 
and hope not to go into the water and the next thing I knew we were in this um in this field 
a very large open field I remember somebody being to my right standing to my right but I i couldn't 
tell who it was that was standing there and then I i remembered that it was her it was my 
my girlfriend at the time and um she's standing next to me and there is a um i'm
getting chills there is a desk sitting on the ground and this thing is uh 
i I don't know how to describe the size it was tremendous I mean i've i've walked up to 747 
and this thing made the 747 look like a piper cup I mean absolutely gigantic 
and on her right and on her left there was a gray and on my right and my left there's a gray 
and they're leading us towards this disc on the ground and there's a um I don't know how to 
describe where this came from in relation to the disc it was underneath kind of like a tunnel um
i guess you could sort of compare it to a jet way that kind of thing
and it was black the walls the ceiling the floor were all black 
and looked like and to my feet felt like rubber
i don't know what that means and there's um the entire length of this thing there is uh light 
at where the uh the floor and the walls meet its curve and in that curve there's light and it's 
just like a long tube of light it's not like you know fluorescent bulb here and there's um 
a section where you see the next is involved it was one continuous light and it was like a
sort of lime green and there was another tube of light at the ceiling where the ceiling and the floor our wall men met
and i'm as we're walking I guess walking into this thing there is um
the two with her she's in front of me and I can see the back of their heads 
and their clothes they have something on and I think it might be black 
and the two with me I mean I don't remember if I ever looked at them and we get to the end of this 
walkway and there's um a column at the end at each side I believe they were square columns 
but again rounded off no no corners but kind of square looking columns chilling to floor about
12 feet tall and there's some kind of writing on the columns going 
from top to bottom not really hypocritical looking not really chinese looking or japanese 
but something along that line I would say and they're in the same color this kind of 
no no the lights along the floor and the ceiling were yellowish 
and the light coming from the columns was like a lime green and this 
this opens up into a a very large I don't even know what to call it a room I don't 
know what it is it's a very large open area and not far from where we walk in there is of being
standing there at like a podium
and he's tall he's got to be eight feet tall but I i can't I can't see what he looks like except 
that it's a being and it's a lie i'm not sure if it may have what robes on a rope type of thing uh
and it's dark um it's not lit inside this gigantic I don't know if it's as big as the um 
the disc was if that was the inside of the disc and that was its entirety 
i don't I don't think so because the disc was so big
and the underside of the disc was black also the next thing I know is 
it's around six o'clock in the morning and we're in the car me and her are in the car and we're sitting behind the building 
sitting in the car behind a building a small building and
i don't know how we got there and I don't know what we're doing there and I start the car and we drive around 
to the front and it's like a diner so it wasn't just ufo encounters tony 
like many contactees started to have a wide variety of paranormal events 
and that included ghostly or poltergeist type activity he would hear footsteps outside his door 
other family members reported weird events and i'll just let tony describe one particularly 
dramatic poltergeist like encounter so here's tony describing what happened when he had this 
encounter in the basement of his home uh yes when me and my two brothers were growing up we had um
i guess you would say poltergeist activity um there were
it was a time near my my next youngest brother his name is rich me and rich were sitting down 
in the basement watching tv and me and my brother are sitting there watching tv 
and this empty box come sailing out of the room and there was nobody downstairs for me and him 
there was no one there wow and it was like this box was um kicked or thrown uh because it was in 
the air it's not like it just slid across the ground or floor or whatever it came sailing 
out of this room and so the stairs were right there and I ran up there with the the lights 
and I mean we both knew there was nothing there and we looked around and there was nothing there 
my mother said sometimes she would hear the footsteps coming up the uh the stairs from 
the basement and figuring it with one of us she would open the door and there's nobody there
uh she said in the back room she was doing laundry and there was nobody down there with her she 
was just starting to put stuff in the washing machine and um she feels a tap on her shoulder 
so she turns and looks and there's nobody there I don't remember how old I was but 
my brother and I slept in the same room and he was eight years younger than I 
am so he was already asleep and I was sitting on the floor watching tv and I hear these footsteps 
outside the door the door was closed and then
it's like you know you go to stay in the front of the door and you take one foot and slide it and then 
you take the other foot and slide it and come to a stop that's what I heard 
outside so I jumped up I opened the door and there was nobody there 
another really weird incident happened at age 12. now that tony had discovered he was a 
contactee he began looking through his past to discover if there are any clues to this and this 
one incident at age 12 came up he was with his friend billy who's also a young pre-teenager 
and they were playing cars just rolling this little model car back and forth and this is 
when something very strange happened it's unlike any incident really i've heard before and i'll let 
tony describe in his own words what happened while he was playing with his friend billy 
one of this guy's sons his name was billy he liked building model cars and playing with cars 
and I did too and so this one night we were over their 
in house deer park new york and um we're sitting on the floor rolling the car back and forth to 
each other and i'm sitting with my back against a uh sofa and he holds the car to me and I missed it 
so it rolled under the under the couch and there was like a skirt around the cap 
the bottom of the couch there so I lifted up the car the uh skirting and um
i looked under there and I could see the car so I put my hand under the couch and started reaching for the car
and right before the car I felt a foot and my hand went up the instep 
and I could feel like an ankle and then a leg
and at that point I pulled my hand out of there so I don't know if there were toes 
or not I don't remember but i'm like I said i'm looking right at the car 
and there's nothing there but my aunt is feeling this thing
and I i jumped up but I spread out of the house I said billy came running after me said what's the matter 
i said I felt a foot under that couch and then I I have no explanation this happened um whatever 
was standing there had to be standing right through the couch as if the couch wasn't there 
i mean it it was not human no it was not human where the ankle and the leg are seem to be thin
and I i don't I don't want to say scaly but just not right 
not skin it didn't it wasn't skin and it wasn't a shoe and it wasn't clothing it was a naked 
foot so like I said i've i've had weird things all throughout my life 
so there were all these weird experiences going on uh tony doesn't remember anything happening for 
a number of years and then he moved to oklahoma and one evening he decided he was going to visit 
his brother who lived in tuttle oklahoma this is a very small town quite rural there's not a lot 
of people there certainly not when this incident occurred which was uh about 10 years ago in 2011.
this was the july 4th weekend and uh tony had traveled to his brother's house 
there was a lot of family members there some friends as well 
and they enjoyed a fourth of july barbecue it got dark they watched fireworks in the distance 
and finally around 11 pm or so tony decided he was going to drive home 
and he said goodbye to his brother and friends and everybody and started to walk to his car 
and he clicked the little clicker on his car to unlock it this turned on the headlights 
and this is when he saw something very unusual there was a gray e.t standing 
in full view of the headlights the headlights were actually shining on this ET and it 
was just a few feet away and i'll let tony describe this incredible encounter with this 
gray e.t I walked out of the house and I hit my clicker to unlock my card doors
and when I do that the headlights come on and um I wasn't looking at the car because 
i know what's going to happen with the car you know so
i was looking towards uh there's a garage off in there 
a few yards away from the house I was sort of looking for the garage area 
and I thought I saw something out of the corner of my left eye and um I turned and there was a gray 
standing there about four feet tall um I couldn't see from like the knees down because 
it was standing in in some tall grass I i stood there and looked at it and it was looking at me 
and it was like I wasn't afraid and it didn't seem to be um my feelings at the time 
well I i I guess just interest and I guess sort of the state uh oh it finally turned and went 
towards the back of the house and as it turned and moved away I don't understand how it moved
because it wasn't running it was extremely fast
and I i I just I mean even now I i I can't put into words how it moved i've never seen anything 
do what this thing did and it uh went towards the back of the house in the backyard there 
and there was six foot chain-link fence around the um back part of the house and
i thought I saw it jump
over the fence and it was like 20 feet in the air and I i I 
that that blew my mind also oh also with when when it was standing there and I was standing 
there it's weird but I don't remember any facial features or anything like that I don't know
i could never understand why I i don't remember any
facial features or anything like that it must have been facing me so that's an amazing encounter i've 
never heard anyone describing an ET jumping over a chain-link fence and flying like 20 feet into the 
air so wow I mean that's just crazy tony did get a good look at this ET and how it ran and i'll just 
let him describe again what this ET looked like and for the longest time I wondered
why did that thing stand there so long it had to be about 30 or 40 seconds um
i don't think it was any longer than that I i think it was like 30 40 seconds and I couldn't understand why it would stand there 
and not just turn and run away when the headlights came on 
i might have just you know caught a glimpse of it in that circumstance but it stood there and 
then I as I thought about it I thought you know maybe it didn't run because I know it 
he knows me much faster much faster than i've ever seen anything move animal or human I don't 
know I just don't understand what means locomotion is used I it just doesn't compute I you know I i 
don't know how how else to put it the head was um large in comparison to the size of its body 
and it was uh I i'm not I don't know what typical really is but um sort of typical gray looking head 
um larger on the top kind of elbows and coming to a point more or less towards the chin area 
very slim arm and what I can see is its legs I don't remember um the hands really 
so immediately following this event he ran back inside and told everybody and 
there was kind of interesting aftermath to this whole encounter as tony says 
and i'll just let him speak in his own words and I went back into I went back inside the house 
and my brother and his wife were sitting on the couch and in front of them was a coffee table 
and like I said there was about 12 people inside and um I walked up to the coffee table and 
stood in front of my brother and his wife and they looked at me and they said what's the matter 
and I said um I just saw gray and they said what I said I just saw a grain and my brother said where 
and it was like right outside the window that they were sitting next to 
and everybody jumped up turned on the outside lights and started looking around you know and 
by this time you know it was long gone but there was one little girl about 12 or 13 years old 
she I don't know how come she went where she went I mean people were looking all over the place 
and she went right to where the thing was standing and you could see it trailing the tall grass
and um it was about the same size as she was
when everybody ran out they were like wow it was right there holy smoke how close to 
the house it was because it was standing right right off the corner of the house
maybe 10 maybe 10 feet from the house itself yeah it never moved until it left it just stood there 
and that that bothered me for the longest time why why did it stand there oh I mean 
30 or 40 seconds is not a long time but in in that setting it's kind of a long time
sir I mean you know it could take any animal you know for an example it wouldn't stick 
around that long the headlights come on and the thing would have been gone it was a deer or 
you know some kind of animal but I mean there was no mistaking what this was it wasn't far away from 
you know it wasn't like it was um 100 yards or whatever it was it was really close
and that's another thing why I don't understand why I don't remember seeing like especially 
his eyes and also i've got to mention my brother has two dogs and one was a little dog 
a terrier kind of dog I don't remember exactly now what dog it was they've had so many but um 
they also had a big dog there was like a shepherd mix and um the the shepherd liked 
to be outside this dog was always outside and if it was raining and raining hard they would 
have to drag the dog inside the house he just didn't like come inside and this particular night 
when everybody ran outside the dogs ran in the house and went to the back of the house 
and stayed there and um my brother's wife told me that the next night there was something outside 
because the both dogs came in the house and they ran to the back of the house and 
got under her bed and was hiding under her bed and she said that 
they had all the lights on outside here and my brother wouldn't go near the front door
every time I talked about about this kind of stuff to him
he has the um attitude well you know tony get over it it happened so 
so what you know what's the big deal and
i love it I don't
understand why either that
it's changed changed me it's changed my life it's changed the way I think and feel um
to be that close to something that is not from here it's just um
i don't know how well to explain it except to say that it's on my mind i'm not going to say constantly but
a lot a lot of the time I think about these statements so as you can see tony has had some 
very interesting experiences throughout his life and one of the most interesting is meeting his 
daughter who is not human tony does have a son abdi has never had a daughter not a human daughter 
but he has a very clear memory of seeing her and like his early childhood encounter at age 14 he doesn't remember being taken on board or 
going back but he's a very clear memory of seeing his own daughter it's quite an emotional thing 
for him he doesn't talk to a lot of people about it because many people don't understand but he 
agreed to share it with me so here's tony's description of his who he calls his star daughter
my mother knew that I had encountered
i have I have a daughter
who's out there I know i've seen her once at least
i I don't remember the circumstances how it was that I got to see her or anything else 
connected with her except that she's not entirely human I found a picture on uh paula harris's 
website of uh it's supposed to be an actual photograph of a a hybrid
and it looks just like her my mother lived out in a town called bayport which was um
i can't remember now in a mile probably about 30 miles from brentwood and I i lived in brentwood 
and she lived out there and um sometimes I would call her up and we would talk I would talk about 
this stuff and she was from oklahoma that's part of why i'm here when I became disabled uh
being on a limited income it's not too easy to live in new york 
so i've been coming here to oklahoma all my life because my mother was from here and so 
my mother used to make the stuff that we called bacon gravy
here in the in the south there's something called biscuits and gravy that people eat
and uh she used to make gravy out of instead of sausage um grease and she'd make it with bacon fat 
and it was so good and I called her up one morning it was about two in the morning and I said mom
i feel like some bacon gravy and she said well where are you and I told her I was in brentwood 
and she said um you want me to come all the way out there and pick you up I said yeah
and I said mom listen uh I have a daughter
and she said what and I said I have a daughter
and she says oh tony she knew what I meant and we talked we talked about it for a little bit 
and there's uh oh got chill
there's times and I can't explain this so I don't I don't know i'm just going to tell 
you there's times when I feel her and I don't know what that means but I know it's her and
i just feel her
i don't know the thought transference or if she is actually near I don't know
another very interesting aspect of tony's experiences is that he actually remembers a 
past life as an e.t this is not unusual i've heard this from a number of contactees tony was quite 
surprised when I told him that but here's tony's description of his past life memories as an e.t 
i mean you know what like I said i'm 70 years old now and I don't know if that has anything to do with anything
i've never thought about you know um
past lives or anything like that
except for one thing uh and now 
sometimes i'm a little bit hesitant to say this but I i have a feeling that I in past life 
i may have lived on another planet in another form for the longest time um
and this I i can't explain this I don't understand it um
but for the longest time when i'm in the shower and I look down at my leg 
they don't look right like my knees are supposed to bend the other way 
and I should be walking on the balls of my feet where does that come from well so am I out of 
my am I out of my core or what so there you go it's quite an interesting series of encounters 
tony's experiences started out quite fearful but now as a elderly gentleman 
he looks back on it as a blessing he feels like he's gotten a lot of knowledge and experience 
and enlightenment from all of this he wouldn't trade it for anything he looks forward to having 
another encounter he has no real fear anymore but has definitely changed his outlook and i'll just 
leave you with one final quote from tony about how his experiences have left him transformed
i'm i'm really have been and still am confused
when it comes to things that are going on here on earth and
i tried to explain this to my son and I i really have no way to explain 
this but I have a completely different look at this planet because it is only one of many
and there's life everywhere I this is I i know this but how so when I look at things that are going on here I don't understand
how things are why things are the way they are if everybody could understand and realize 
that we are just part and a very small part of a gigantic um universe I guess for lack of a better 
word full of life there's probably things all around us that we may not even be able to see 
how do you explain that I mean I i'm no physicist or if I get astrophysicist or anything like that 
where does this come from and one thing I i wanted to add I don't know if it's important or not but I 
just wanted that that doctor that did the hypnosis he told me that I have ptsd which is now why and I 
don't understand why it's dissipated I it's not gone you know I can't I can't sleep in silence 
i don't like silence and I don't like jet black darkness I have to have some kind of light 
and I have to have some kind of sound because I don't the only way I can explain it is that 
um I don't want them sneaking up on me that's when I asked him uh if I was crazy and he said 
no that I wasn't crazy and all that kind of stuff and he said tony you have ptsd
i said what he says yeah you you are showing signs of ptsd well I i have to say I used to be that way 
i used to not talk about it um and keep it to myself now I just don't care anymore
i'm not i'm not i'm not looking uh i'm not telling stories um i'm not making up things 
uh so you believe me you believe me you don't you don't who cares I don't this is what happened 
i'm telling you what happened believe it fine you don't find it doesn't matter 
i can only tell you I can only tell you what happened so that is tony's story I hope you've 
enjoyed it I told tony's story in my book on board ufo encounters it's quite a fascinating 
series of events and shows how a person can have a lifelong series of experiences 
that start out somewhat fearful in some cases but end up being quite spiritual and transformative 
uh so that's really why I wanted to do this video because it's 
a really interesting insight into what it's like to live your whole life with this phenomenon and 
i really want to thank tony for agreeing to be interviewed for allowing his real name to be 
used he's quite an interesting gentleman he's got a great sense of humor and i'm very happy 
to see that he has come forward to talk about his encounters so that's the show for today once 
again I want to thank you for watching I really appreciate it I hope you've enjoyed this show 
and until next time keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and keep having fun
