CAN WE CONTACT UFOS WITH THE OUIJA BOARD?
May 9, 2021

Summary:
May 9, 2021
A Ouija Board is a tool normally used for contacting and communicating with spirits. However, there are now many cases on record in which people do not contact ghosts...instead they contact aliens. In fact, many people not only communicate with ETs using a Ouija Board, they have initiated encounters, actually calling down UFOs and summoning aliens.

This video presents more than twenty firsthand cases involving the Ouija Board and UFO encounters. The connection is undeniable. In some cases witnesses were able to photograph UFOs and even the ETs themselves. Even stranger, some cases involve Bigfoot. UFOs are known for having high levels of strangeness. And these unique cases show just how strange the UFO phenomenon can be. 

How do people contact aliens and UFOs with a Ouija Board? Why does this method work? Is it dangerous? This video answers all these questions and more.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal i've got an interesting I think and unique episode for you today 
i call it can we contact ufos with a ouija board and i've got about 20 cases that suggest 
the answer is yes and I would like to present these cases to you today 
the first case one of my favorite comes from ufo researcher frank salisbury who's the author 
of the excellent book the utah ufo display this case took place back in february of 1967 
in the city of roosevelt utah uh the main witnesses are tim and tammy mcdonald they're 
two little kids who were using the ouija board and got the message that a ufo would appear at 
a certain time the next day over roosevelt hospital which was right near their home 
right next door actually so they were pretty excited about it and we're getting ready for 
the ufo sighting which was due to occur when suddenly it appeared they screamed and ran outside 
and saw this very large glowing object hovering directly over roosevelt hospital they described it 
as quote kind of an orange ball orange to red kind of in a circle bigger than an ordinary light 
so this object was basically circular in shape and started moving towards them blinking 
on and off and it was quite large it had the apparent size of about one-third of a full moon 
and what's really interesting about this case is they weren't the only ones who saw it this is a pretty urban area and there were a lot of people out there on the streets and many 
of them saw actually uh two other witnesses were verl and leah haslam they saw hovering overhead 
another wet witness was ken vowers who was driving his car and said it moved right over his truck 
another witness was wesley erkenbrach he described the same thing another witness roy merchant said 
that this object actually followed him in his car for some time so this is a very interesting case 
in which a ufo was apparently called down using a ouija board 
and uh you know as strange as this case sounds it's not unique there are quite a few cases 
which have this weird ouija board connection ouija board of course is normally used to call spirits 
ghosts but in some cases it's apparently being used to call down ufos and aliens 
another case occurred in farmington massachusetts 
this was in 1994 a young girl by the name of mona kempka had been playing around with 
the ouija board when she made contact with an entity who called himself zozo that's z-o-z-o 
and uh she got several messages from him and uh it was a few months later when something 
really remarkable happened this was september 1st 1994 at around 3 15 a.m mona woke up 
because she felt a very strong pressure on her hand like someone squeezing her hand 
she woke up and was shocked to see that it was a reptilian figure quite tall covered in scales very 
muscular with frog like legs she said her whole room was glowing with this bright pinkish glow 
it scared the daylights out of her this being told her telepathically that his name was zozo 
so this is apparently the same entity she contacted through the ouija board it frightened 
her badly enough that she quickly sat up in bed and screamed at which point this reptilian figure 
dematerialized and vanished and that was it uh she had no other 
contact with zozo though a few months later she did have a similar experience where a gray 
e.t materialized in her bedroom so again we seem to have someone using a ouija board 
and making contact not with spirits but with aliens and there are more cases um here's another 
one which occurred in spain actually in the town of beigur garona a couple was using a ouija board 
hoping to make contact with aliens from umo this was a very well-known case at the time which was 
getting a lot of attention in which people were claiming to have contact with human-looking ets 
from the planet umo there are actually two books written about this case it's quite well known 
and they had joined a group which was using a ouija board to communicate with these 
alleged et's and it was shortly after this period of time while they were using this ouija board 
when they were driving along with their two kids and suddenly a ufo appeared overhead and started 
tracking them pacing them in their car this was on august 28 1980 was in the middle of 
the night around 2 15 a.m they were traveling down highway a17 in the town of bagor in spain 
and uh yeah this object was following their car uh they became quite concerned and a little bit 
nervous because it was getting lower and lower so they pulled over got out of the car to look at this thing at which point it zoomed really high up in the sky and stayed hovering in 
place they watched it for just a few moments before they decided to get back in the car and continue their road trip which they did at that point the object continued to follow them 
getting lower and lower it followed them all the way to the town of aiguablava at which point 
it sent down a beam of light and by this time it was low enough that they could see a weird symbol 
on the bottom of the craft and sure enough it was the symbol that many other people had reported 
seeing on these uh craft which were allegedly from the planet umo it's definitely a controversial and 
somewhat bizarre case but is not the only one involving this weird ouija board connection 
there's another case from spain actually which occurred in the town of la tajita la tahita 
uh in on tenor reef beach this case occurred on june 9 1975 this was at 11 30 p.m it all began 
when uh two gentlemen by the name of jose brito and paco padron were using a ouija board and 
contacted entities which told them to drive to the beach and these entities would make an appearance 
so that's what they did they drove to tenerife beach and were shocked to see ufos several very 
bright lights hovering over the water they watched them for just a few moments when these ufos came 
swooping down towards them and these two boys had missing time I was quite a frightening experience 
uh they later went under hypnosis because one of them was receiving telepathic messages that they had been taken on board so they went under hypnotic regression and 
sure enough they recalled an on-board experience uh they recalled being taken through a lighted 
corridor sort of like a glowing hallway and into a room where they were placed in chairs 
and uh then they these uh entities which were not described other than being dressed in white 
jumpsuits and having helmets on so they really couldn't see what these entities looked like 
these entities placed them in chairs and put a helmet over their head this helmet had about two 
dozen cables attached to it so this appeared to be some sort of mental experiment or procedure 
at any rate that was pretty much the extent of the experience afterwards they were led down 
the same corridor and the next thing they knew they were being placed back into their vehicle 
so here we have yet another case in which people used a ouija board and 
ended up making contact not with ghosts but with extraterrestrials or apparent extraterrestrials 
another case i'd like to cover occurred in via lacra in burgos spain this occurred in the summer 
of 1984 when a young couple by the name of jose arans and maria zarzugaza were vacationing in 
via lacra and they were using a ouija board and made contact with an entity who called himself m4 
and the message that this entity gave them was to go to town and get a camera 
and he would allow them to take a picture so that's exactly what they did they returned 
with the camera contacted the entity again and he said he would manifest the next day and that they would be allowed to take a picture of him and sure enough the next day 
they were very surprised to see a glowing entity outside their cabin it was this was on september 
9th 1984 and this glowing being was about a hundred feet away from them 
he appeared to be seven feet tall was wearing a shiny suit covering his entire body 
they quickly snapped a photograph which shows this glowing entity and this was the first of 
about 10 sightings they had involving this entity interestingly they saw this entity more than 10 
times over the next couple of weeks communicating with it through the ouija board and when they 
returned home from their vacation they saw a ufo while they were driving back to their home 
another interesting detail is following this whole series of incidents jose who suffered from severe 
back pain no longer had this problem he had somehow been mysteriously cured so it's another 
interesting and bizarre case involving both photographic evidence and physiological evidence
and some of these cases get really bizarre and in fact involve not only ets but bigfoot for example 
here's a case which comes from bigfoot researcher peter gutilla this occurred in the sequoia 
national park in california in the summer of 1975 involves three witnesses john clark 
his wife and their friend ralph johnson they had gone camping in the sequoia park 
at sequoia national park when around 4 00 a.m they were woken up they were in a campsite out in the 
wilderness and they were woken up by their dog barking furiously so they all get out of their uh 
tent and were shocked to see a nine foot tall hairy human-like figure was covered in blonde fur 
or hair and it ran very close right through their campsite scared the living daylights out of him 
one of them picked up a frying pan and threw it at this figure which retreated off into the 
wilderness they themselves quickly retreated to their car and spent the rest of the night there 
uh woke up in the morning could find no footprints no evidence of this creature that they had seen 
but they had a ouija board with them and decided that they would try to contact this creature through a ouija board and apparently they were successful they started getting messages 
allegedly from this creature this bigfoot who told them his name was i'll spell it 
because I don't know how to pronounce it q o n so quan perhaps khan and uh 
this bigfoot gave them a kind of a strange bizarre and to me not a very believable story 
uh said he was from the planet pluto and had got come to earth in a ufo crash 
uh some over 100 years ago back in 1860 so i'm not sure really what to make of that message 
but this experience really impressed these witnesses and in fact they could not stop thinking 
about it could not let it go felt that perhaps something happened which they couldn't remember 
and one of the witnesses john clark ended up going to visit well-known 
ufo researcher james harder phd james harder was a very early researcher one of the first 
among the first to use hypnosis to help people recover missing time so john clark goes under 
hypnosis and sure enough he remembers an on-board ufo experience uh from this apparent camping trip 
where he was taken on board a craft into a triangular room he says he was laid out on a 
table physically examined they stuck tubes against his body it was not painful it wasn't very scary 
for him either they used lights to examine him he did see entities but couldn't describe them 
very well other than he saw their eyes which were very much like slits is what he said 
so yeah that is a weird case and i'm not sure quite what to make of it 
but it is what it is and there are other cases like it involving bigfoot 
in fact here's a case from nick redfearn according to nick redfern in the summer of 1985 four teenage 
girls from new york had decided to have a slumber party and were using a ouija board 
unfortunately it didn't seem to work they didn't really get any messages but shortly 
after using the ouija board and putting it away all the power went out in the house mysteriously 
and then it came back on and then it went out again so that's kind of weird and it was the 
very next night when one of the witnesses who lived at the home her name is laura 
she was in her bedroom when the power went out again and in the middle of the night 
that evening she woke up in the in the middle of the night to hear a very strange sound coming 
from the woods behind her house she described it as a quote strange animalistic scream and it 
scared her pretty bad and she went back to bed and was woken up by a terrible terrible smell 
in her bedroom she described it as quote the grossest smelling thing ever like an old 
rotting cabbage and she looked around her room and was shocked to see a hairy 
man a hairy human-like figure and as laura says it was quote just like a bigfoot a big hairy 
thing that I couldn't tell if it was a monkey man or a hairy man and it started communicating 
telepathically with her and it told her basically not to get mixed up with ghosts and ouija boards 
ironically enough so there's another case involving a ouija board 
and contacting not ghosts or aliens in this case but a bigfoot and I should tell you that there 
are a number of cases in which bigfoot and ufos do appear concurrently together and often people 
do encounter a bigfoot there is also telepathic communication so these things are all starting to 
tie together I mean there's another case which I found on the files of mufon the mutual ufo network 
in which a man used a ouija board and i'll just quote directly from the port 
report as the report from mufon says this man was quote using a ouija board when he heard sounds 
outside and grabbed his flashlight according to him he saw two figures one on two legs 
huge claws snarling teeth and the other on all fours like a master's dog and even more hideous 
he felt that the ouija board may have opened a rift to another dimension and perhaps that's true 
hard to say but as these the number of these cases mount it's clear that there is a weird connection 
and that ouija boards can be used to contact not only ghosts but different types of entities 
another very interesting case comes from a lady by the name of jay-z knight jay-z knight is perhaps 
most well-known for channeling an entity by the name of ramtha she's written a number of books 
about her experiences and the messages she has received from this alleged entity who 
says he's from the pleiades and she also has had some ufo contact as a child she did see a ufo 
and had a period of missing time so there is a ufo connection here at any rate she uh had 
just begun uh channeling this entity and it was in 19 or september 1977 actually when jay-z knight 
a good friend and her boyfriend were using a ouija board when they got a very intriguing 
message and the message was and I quote we salute you wise one you will bring great joy and answers 
we hail your enlightenment you are in the palm of the hand of god and then it spelled out the word 
outside so all three of the witnesses went outside and were shocked to see this ufo 
up here swoop down towards them and start darting around as jay-z knight says just about the time I 
was thinking this was a waste of time from out of the northern sky came a huge ball of light 
it moved very fast and was only a few hundred feet in the air I was astonished 
and it quickly moved away and wasn't long after that that another ufo showed up as jay-z 
says just as I was regaining my wits another ufo whizzed by over my head only this time it divided 
and became eight smaller balls of light the eight balls of light disappeared over the treetops 
so that ended the sighting after waiting outside a little bit more and nothing happened they went 
back inside turned on the radio and were amazed to hear that they were apparently not the only 
witnesses to this sighting uh as they says it's as they uh as jay-z knight writes 
she heard the announcer on the radio saying quote our switchboard is lighting up with 
reports of unidentified flying objects so here we have another case of people calling down ufos 
using a ouija board and in this case it's a channeler who's channeling an entity by the 
name of ramtha who claims to be from the pleiades so maybe there is something to these reports 
all these cases are different and some are totally unique consider what happened to donald m 
ware who was very prominent in the mufon organization donald ware is from fort walton beach 
florida at the time of this incident he was the florida state section director for mufan and one 
evening donald ware's son had a friend whose name was was kenneth kenneth approached donald and 
asked him about the ouija board and what he knew about it and donald didn't have much information 
for kenneth other than to say that he's aware of the ouija board and that it's 
used generally for contacting spirits but he doesn't really know much more about it 
so it turned kenneth gave the whole story and it turned out that he had been using a ouija board 
and as donald ware writes and I quote two years earlier ken's friend 
borrowed his mother's ouija board and several of the boys experimented with it 
when they placed their fingers lightly on the pointer it moved and spelled out several messages 
the name of the source was spelled out and one of the messages told kenneth to talk with donald ware 
so whoever this entity was it wanted kenneth to contact uh donald ware 
who was a very prominent ufo researcher so they stopped using the ouija board because it started 
spelling out pretty frightening messages but at some point kenneth had a very powerful dream 
in which he got the message that he should use the ouija board again and he did and he 
got another very intriguing message as uh donald ware writes and I quote 
the boys borrowed the board and again the message they spelled out was that kenneth was supposed 
to talk with donald ware so once again kenneth approached donald ware and told him this message 
and donald ware spoke with kenneth and at that point this is when kenneth learned about 
donald ware's ufo connection that he was a very prominent ufo researcher for mufon and this was 
very interesting to kenneth because he had always been interested in ufos and started talking about 
ufos with donald ware and one thing led to another and kenneth actually became a ufo researcher so 
there's a weird connection there this ouija board led to kenneth becoming interested and 
researching ufos so i'm not sure what's going on in these cases I mean here's another case which I 
found online from a gentleman by the name of kurt and i'll just let kurt describe what happened to 
him in his own words as kurt says has anyone else heard about this i've read a lot of stories online 
about people using a ouija board and then having experienced ufo sightings alien encounters etc 
i do believe there is at least some minimal connection between the occult and aliens 
ironically three days prior to purchasing my own ouija I had a ufo sighting myself 
so here we go again another weird connection between ufos and the ouija board and I found 
another case from an anonymous witness who is on a website forum and asked 
put out a question asking if it was quote possible to use a ouija board to make contact 
with alien beings is this anonymous witness says and again i'll quote directly from him 
this idea may sound stupid or funny but I think it might work I got this idea from 
a dream I had the other night and it made me wonder in my dream it was at night and I was 
on the back porch of my house staring up the sky there were three saucer-shaped ufos and one of 
them was brimming beaming a bright laser-like light onto a ouija board that was on the floor 
in my dream a voice kept repeating use it use it this was the weirdest dream I ever had and it left 
me wondering the day after and when I gave it much thought I realized this could be a message I think 
that the dream meant something there's probably something that's going to happen and they want 
me to know about it I think that i'll go and get one tomorrow so I don't know what happened in that 
case but it's another weird case involving this weird sort of mixture of ufos and the ouija board 
another researcher familiar with these types of cases is karen a dolmen who says that you 
can't communicate with ets through the ouija board she began communicating with ets who 
told her that they were from the planet maldek she also says she has seen many of her ships 
in her youtube video ouija communicating with et's via the ouija board and ufo sightings 
she talks about her journey from communicating with spirits to aliens she says it's very much 
the same process however the alien energy feels different and you know there's always another case 
about this here's another very bizarre case which actually became quite well 
known this occurred in the july in july of 1990 and it made front page news actually 
when six gi's from the american intelligence unit in germany actually went awol they abandoned their 
post in germany and traveled all the way to gulf breeze florida which at that time was having a 
very intense wave of sightings this group was led pretty much by vance davis he's one of the gis 
and they got all kinds of messages from a ouija board that they were using which told them 
in effect to travel down to gulf breeze where they would make contact with ufos 
these gi's were all apprehended and punished for going awol 
and they admitted that they had traveled to gulf breeze because of these specific instructions they had retrieved from a ouija board the vance davis and the other gi's said that they
while using the ouija board they had received all kinds of messages including several accurate predictions some of these predictions included an earthquake 
in iran the iraqi invasion of kuwait and it was then that this board started giving them messages 
about ufos at one point it told them to show up at a restaurant in munich 
which they did they were told that a visitor would approach them and give them 
papers about william cooper milton william cooper a prominent ufo conspiracy uh expert 
and that happened apparently uh the board also gave them descriptions of many different alien 
races that were visiting the planet earth and told them then that they should travel to gulf breeze 
eventually vance davis did write a book about his experiences he co-wrote a book 
called unbroken promises so yeah it's a very interesting and certainly controversial 
and bizarre case once again illustrating this weird connection between the ouija 
board and calling down ufos so there is definitely something going on here uh researcher brad steiger 
who has researched the paranormal and ufos looked into this connection after 
he met with a well-known psychic by the name of mary robinson who was able to use the board 
the ouija board to contact not only ghosts but aliens and according to brad steiger 
he concluded that if this is possible that you can contact both ufos and spirits 
this strongly suggests that quote such entities may not be that different
i think it's entirely possible that uh he's correct and that what we're looking at are entities who are telepathic and are able to therefore make contact using a ouija board 
another very interesting case comes from author and researcher gary vale tenuta who actually wrote 
a book about what happened to him when he used a ouija board to contact extraterrestrials he wrote 
a book called ouija contacting e.t it's available on amazon and his experience occurred in 1967 
in the town of long beach california it's a very strange case he his wife edie and their friend tom 
began using a ouija board to communicate with deceased relatives and instead they soon found 
themselves communicating with an alleged et by the name of quote guro spectre and this entity guru 
spectre gave them messages one of the messages was and I quote we exist on a physical plane 
we are on the fifth planet from the sun in our system our planet is called grec we are living 
beings as you are living beings but we are in a different dimension we are in your future time 
uh this entity explained that one of them tom had actually been abducted and taken to their planet 
and had allowed them to use his genetic material to produce a child 
and tom himself admitted that he did have a very strange dream a bizarre dream 
with these features in it they these entities guru spectre told gary valtenuta his wife and 
tom that they are able to communicate with the ouija board using telepathy using their minds 
so they continued to use the ouija board and it wasn't long before gary valtena's wife edie began to channel the ets through the process of automatic writing 
which is directly connected to ouija board and channeling it's very much the same thing 
just instead of using a ouija board the person uses their hand and a pen and starts writing out messages that are being telepathically communicated to them and as 
the messages that came through were again very intriguing from gu guru spectre uh who told them 
that they could actually build a ufo as guru spektor said you can build one 
using your mind as gary val tenuta writes we tried to get across the idea 
that we didn't understand how to build a ship with our minds and guru insisted that what was needed
guro insisted that was what we needed to do he said someday we would understand how to do this 
in fact many people would know how to do this he said there would come a time when there would be 
great devastation upon the earth but many people would escape in huge spaceships he said they would 
take them with domestic animals and plant life of various types for growing food these people 
would then return to the earth following the devastation to begin a new civilization 
so as bizarre as all this sounds this is by no means unique there are many cases of people who 
have channeled entities using ouija boards and automatic writing perhaps most famous of course is 
jane roberts who channeled an entity called seth she ended up writing uh dozens of best-selling 
books about her experiences which began by using a ouija board another example comes from jessica 
lanzing a psychic channeler who began channeling an entity by the name of michael she also wrote 
books about her experiences uh then of course there's daryl anka a very famous channeler who 
began channeling an entity by the name of bashar I personally actually had a chance to meet with 
daryl ankle inca and have a channeling session he pointed to me and said he saw ufos over my head 
and that I was an alien in a past life I found that intriguing because I was certainly interested 
in ufos but at that time was pretty new to the subject certainly was not well known by any means 
so that was interesting to me and daryl anka is now quite well known for channeling 
bashar who is allegedly an extraterrestrial and many people have allegedly gotten messages from 
bashar so there are many cases like this another very famous contactee is george hunt williamson 
who was one of the famous contactees from the era of contactees the 1950s 
and he actually wrote a book called the saucers speak in which he gave all kinds 
of messages which allegedly came from using a ouija board in automatic writing 
and uh from ets uh probably the best verified example of this kind in which someone actually 
channeled extraterrestrials usually using a ouija board in automatic writing would be 
systo paz wells a peruvian contactee who got all kinds of messages saying that ufos would appear 
and sure enough they did he ended up having very extensive contact 
and was able to form a group called mission rama and brought many people into it who had direct 
contact and he has successfully called down ufos on many many occasions perhaps hundreds 
and has introduced many people to the idea of extraterrestrials and has shown many people 
ufos successfully called them down on many many occasions so this is by no means unique 
uh and in fact I have my own case involving this uh this uh one case I investigated personally 
involves a lady by the name of marianne she was a waitress from carpenteria in southern california 
and uh one evening she was watching the television program unsolved mysteries 
she had earlier had a couple of ufo encounters in 1980 or i'm sorry in 1978 
she and a friend had a very dramatic ufo encounter while driving uh they had a police officer right 
next to the mossad as well this object came up out of the ocean out of the coast right near 
their home was massive and large and flew overhead and it was 10 years later she had another sighting 
and with friends again involving multiple orb-like objects darting around their home and it 
was in 1992. while watching the program unsolved mysteries that she had a very bizarre experience 
on this occasion the program unsolved mysteries was about ufos in fact the program was featuring 
the then ongoing wave of sightings over hudson valley new york and marianne was watching this 
episode when she suddenly felt a very strong presence in the room and it became increasingly 
strong until she started to see images in her mind and to her shock it was a gray alien as she says 
he's hairless he's pale he's short he's thin he's got almond shaped eyes they're dark and there are 
no pupils he doesn't wear anything but it's kind of an asexual body and she had a very strong urge 
to start communicating with him using automatic writing what she did 
she is right-handed but she had this pen in her left hand and it started writing messages which 
she can't write with her left hand uh and these messages started coming out really quite quickly 
she had called her friend susie over and susie started asking her questions which this e.t 
answered first question they asked was what is your name and this gray e.t spelled out kevin 
you said his name was kevin that really surprised marianne and her friend susie and 
they started to get a series of messages from this gray alien named kevin the first message 
from this gray e.t was that they have been on our planet for a very very very long time uh far 
longer than we have been here was the impression marianne got like thousands of years uh kevin also 
said that he was he in his race is very very interested in humans and are fascinated by us 
uh he told marianne that they live in the oceans and are in very large numbers much more numerous 
than us he said that they are a very benign race they are not violent at all they don't 
have any weapons of any kind they are only here to observe us he warned her of upcoming earthquakes 
and widespread disasters on our planet and that's certainly a prominent theme among ufo contactees 
and finally he told her that it was his job to find and locate people 
who are receptive to receiving messages so that was basically the gist of it this only happened 
a few times marianne got pretty nervous about it because she started to sense spirits as well and that scared her pretty bad so she stopped doing it but it's certainly a very 
interesting case which I wrote about in my book extraterrestrial visitations I devoted a whole 
chapter to it because it was such an interesting and unique case so these are the types of cases 
i'm talking about where it's apparently people are able to contact ufos using a ouija board 
so i'm not sure exactly what's going on here but what I think is going on here is that 
there is a connection that ets like spirits like bigfoot are telepathic and are trying to 
communicate with us and they use various methods um sometimes appearing physically 
sometimes communicating telepathically and as we have seen sometimes are able to use a ouija board 
i found other cases like this some are exceedingly bizarre but I think there's enough cases here 
to sort of get the idea of what's going on here I did write about these cases in my book not 
from here volume three and I think it shows pretty conclusively that there is definitely 
a connection between ufos and the ouija board obviously some cases are more reputable I would 
say than others but there are enough where I think it's worth looking into and that's why 
i wanted to do this video to let people know that there is this weird connection between ufos and 
ouija boards and it is in fact possible to call down a ufo using a ouija board you know i'm not 
sure I would recommend it uh because I have done some ghost research and uh there's been 
a couple of cases I researched where people used a ouija board and ended up having a pretty horrific 
haunting so if you do please do be careful and use the proper precautions 
such as you know raising your vibration and doing a spiritual cleansing before and afterwards using 
white light and meditations and this sort of thing or perhaps if you are really wanting 
to do this contacting someone who has experience with it so that's the episode today can we contact 
ufos through ouija board the answer is yes but be warned you might not get what you expected so once 
again I want to thank you all for listening I hope you found this episode interesting and educational 
and uh yeah thanks again for listening and until next time keep having fun
