DO NOT BE AFRAID: EIGHT EXTRAORDINARY ONBOARD EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS
Mar 21, 2025

Summary:
Mar 21, 2025
The most extensive UFO encounter is being taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft. This is the cutting edge of UFO research. These cases  hold the potential to answer the many questions surrounding ET contact: who are these visitors to our planet, where do they come from, and why are they here? This video presents eight amazing cases involving people who have been taken onboard a UFO and met aliens face-to-face.

THE EARTH WILL ROLL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MARION FRANCIS. At 12:30 pm on Feb 10, 1969, Marion Francis and her friend Jim Wells drove from Jacksonville, FL to Daytona Beach. It should’ve taken one a half hours, but weirdly it took five. Marion suffered from a bad headache, weakness and depression. Later, she went under hypnosis and recalled being taken onboard a craft. She was examined by a gray ET. They showed her where they came from, and said that Earth would one day tilt on its axis, and that the ETs would be there to rescue those who are not afraid to go.

DAZED AND CONFUSED IN A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSE PEREIRA SACRAMENTO. On the night of May 20, 1969, Jose Pereira Sacramento heard a noise outside his home in Vila Operaria, Brazil. Going to investigate, he was shocked to see a UFO landing in his backyard. He was suddenly pulled inside it where he met short beings standing in weird cylinders, speaking an unknown language. He was frozen in place as the room filled with painfully bright light. Suddenly he found himself back in bed. His eyes were badly inflamed, and he suffered from lightheadedness for a full year.

TRANSFORMED BY THE ETS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSEPH SUSEDIK. On May 26, 1974, while camping at Mitchell Caverns in California, Joseph and his family saw a UFO. That night, he was woken up by colored lights outside the trailer and found himself immobilized. Upon awakening, he had vague memories of being taken somewhere. Later under hypnosis, he recalled an onboard UFO encounter where ETs showed him the inside of the craft, images of Saturn and various nebulae. Following this, Joseph became a prolific inventor, and he and his wife pioneered the field of prenatal learning.

PROBED BY ALIENS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JANET STEWART. While driving to a friend’s house in Bethel, Minnesota on the night of Jan 6, 1976, Janet was shocked when a UFO paced her car. Picking up her friend, she also saw the UFO. Arriving home, Janet was missing an hour of time, and had sore eyes. Under hypnosis, she recalled she had been stopped by the UFO, and taken onboard. She was physically examined and returned to her car. The encounter made, her a more easy-going, open-minded and tolerant person.

THERE ARE THINGS I STILL CANNOT TELL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF NESTOR URRUTI. On the morning of May 14, 1976, Nestor Urruti was driving through Olivarria, Argentina when a UFO pulled him onboard with his truck. He found himself sitting in front of a horseshoe-shaped panel with odd symbols. A telepathic voice told him that one day the ETs will reveal themselves to the world. He then found himself back in his truck. He was badly traumatized and had to be hospitalized.

YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE THINGS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DOROTHY Y. On Sept 15, 1976, Dorothy was awakened by bright lights outside her home in New London, MO. Going outside, she saw short strange beings. Suddenly, she was in bed and it was the next morning. Later under hypnosis, she was taken onboard and recalled being physically examined. The ETs told her that she would being to see things: a prediction which turned out to be true when she began having psychic visions of disasters.

A JOURNEY ONBOARD A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF VICTOR AND BORIS. In Jul 1986, while hiking in the woods outside of Shenkursk, Russia, Victor and Boris, came upon a strange craft and two human-looking men in jumpsuits. The men invited Victor and Boris onboard. So began an amazing journey where the two witnesses were flown across Europe. They asked many questions of the strange men. At one point, one of the ETs allowed Victor to pilot the craft. They were then returned back to the forest, amazed by their encounter

A FIGHT WITH STRANGE HUMANOIDS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROLF FULLER. On July 25, 1992, Rolf was amazed to see a UFO outside his family’s home in Tuttlingen, Germany. That night, he woke up to find himself inside a UFO, confronted by short ETs with large eyes. Rolf fought with the ETs. Suddenly, he was knocked unconscious. He woke up back in bed and to his shock, the humanoids were still there! 

Eight onboard cases, each with details which are remarkably similar and confirm each other’s accounts, and each with unique details that show how much we still have to learn. What these cases do show is that people all over the world are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft and meeting extraterrestrials face-to-face. It has been happening for a long time.

Hello everybody. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. Today I'm going to be talking about my favorite aspect of UFO research and that is onboard UFO
encounters. The title of today's episode is do not be afraid. Eight extraordinary
onboard extraterrestrial encounters. I gave it that title because a lot of
people experience quite a bit of fear during these encounters, which I totally understand. But I think if you take an
objective look at what actually happens when people are taken on board, it's quite encouraging. There's no evidence
that the ETs are intentionally trying to scare people or cause harm. In fact, I
think it's quite the opposite, as these cases, I think, will show. I've chosen
eight cases from all over the world, including Germany, Russia, Argentina,
Brazil, and four from the United States, including California, Florida,
Minnesota, and Missouri. These cases date from 1969 to 1992.
They involve a wide variety of humanoids. But I think these cases are important because onboard cases are not
only to me the most interesting, but they certainly represent the cutting edge of UFO research because they
contain the most information about who these visitors are and why they are
here. So, let's just get started. First case I'd like to talk about today I call
the earth will roll the onboard UFO encounter of Marian Francis. This case
took place on February 10, 1969 near Green Cove Springs in Florida and it's
an extraordinary case with some really interesting details. This case comes from the Florida Crown Psychical
Research Society and may have actually been published in Fate magazine. The
main witness is Marian Francis, the last name is apparently a pseudonym. It was shortly after midnight on February 10,
1969 that Marian and her friend Jim Wells, that's also a pseudonym, they
were driving from Jacksonville, Florida to Daytona Beach. Now, this is a trip
that should have taken about 1 and a half hours. However, they were shocked to arrive at their destination, Daytona
Beach, around 5:30 a.m. So, this trip had taken somehow 3 hours longer than it
should have. Neither of them had any recollection of stopping or seeing anything strange. So, they returned back
to Jacksonville, arriving at 7:00 a.m., which is the normal time it should have taken. It was around this time that
Marion began to suffer some strange symptoms. First of all, she had a very bad headache. Over the next month, she
says she felt depressed and listless to the point that she was unable to go to work and actually spent most of her time
in bed. She also noticed that the back of her hand felt abnormally itchy. It
actually grew a few weird long dark hairs in this one spot, which thankfully vanished, but returned again six weeks
later before vanishing for good. That wasn't all. She also noticed a strange
circular mark about the size of a dime on her right cheekbone. Thankfully, she recovered
from all of this, but she never forgot about the missing time and these weird symptoms. and curious about them. Eight
years later, in November of 1977, she decided to go under hypnotic regression,
which was conducted by Paul Crutz. Now, under hypnosis, Marion recalled that
they had driven just a few miles past Green Cove Springs when, without warning, a brilliant light shone down on
the car from above and behind them. At the same time, they heard a buzzing sound, which increased in volume until
it became painfully loud. Now, per Marion, both she and Jim at this point
became unconscious, and the next thing she knew, she was standing in a curved
corridor. A door slid open in front of her, and she walked into the narrow end of a wedgehaped room. It opened wide on
the farther end, and at the farther end, she saw several tables. There was also a
short man who she described as having gray skin, a bald head, large eyes,
ears, and a small slit-like mouth. So, this sounds like a typical gray. She
said he was wearing a gray tight-fitting suit, and he proceeded to lead her into this examining room. He began to speak
to her telepathically, saying that he meant her no harm, that he wanted to examine her. Marian dutifully removed
all her clothes except for her underwear and then lay down on the table. And for the next 40 minutes, this grayskinned
figure proceeded to conduct a physical examination. He used an undescribed
instrument which Marian said made her skin tingle. He also took skin scrapings
from the side of her hand. They placed quote some kind of machine on her right
cheekbone. This was apparently where she later found the dimesized mark. and she says this quote hurt a little bit.
Following the physical exam, she was floated out of the examination room up to the quote control room. She now saw
to her surprise that the ceiling was transparent. She could actually see a field of stars above her. There were
three new grayskin figures in there. Two were shorter than her and one a little taller. She perceived him to be the
captain. He was dressed in white while the others had that same gray tight-fitting suit as the one who had
examined her. So the taller one pointed to a distant star and said that it was where they came from. He told her that
it took them only an instant to travel to Earth and he explained that quote their time is different from our time.
He also said that they have quote the secret of eternal life. But then he gave
her a pretty frightening prediction about Earth's future and followed that up with a hopeful message. He said that
quote when the planets align the earth will roll in the heavens and there will
be much destruction. But he then said that quote they want to help us so that all will
not be lost. And finally he said that they will take quote anyone who is not afraid to
go with them. They then escorted her out of the room where she was reunited with
Jim. Together, they were floated back down to the ground and taken to their car and they resumed their interrupted
journey without any conscious memory of the onboard experience. How amazing is
that case? In many ways, it is your typical onboard UFO encounter with a
person being physically examined by ETSs. But the message she was given is one that I've heard quite a few times
about the earth possibly going through a polar tilt, an absolute axis shift. Uh
and also the ET saying that they are here to help and will scoop people up in
the event of this existential crisis. So certainly an important and interesting
case. Now, let's move to the next one, which I call Dazed and Confused in a
UFO. The onboard UFO encounter of Joseé Pereira
Sacramento. This one occurred on May 20, 1969 in Via Opera in Brazil. It's an
important case. It's got some really unusual details to it that I don't think I've heard before. Yeah, I think you'll
find it quite compelling. This case comes from the Brazilian publication the
SBEDV bulletin. It's a single witness case. The man's name is Senor Jose
Pereira, Sacramento. He resides at 190 Padre Yustaku Street in Via Operia. This
is in Nova Lima in the state of Minus Jerus in Brazil. It was around 1:00 a.m.
when he was awakened in his home by a sound, which he first assumed was his motor scooter. He had recently had his
chickens stolen from his backyard, so he was on high alert, and he rushed outside the front door to investigate, but he
saw that his scooter was still there. But now he heard his dog, Lassie, barking in the backyard. So he went out
into the back. He saw that the dog was quite agitated. And almost immediately he noticed a bright circle of light
shining down on the ground moving around like a search light from a aircraft. And
looking up he saw this glowing object about 1,500 to 3,000 ft overhead. He
said it quickly grew in size and it became clear to him that it was actually descending and moving towards him. All
of this was in perfect silence. At this point, he wanted to run back into the house and alert the others, but he found
that he was unable to move or call out. Now, the object, which he described as
quote enormous, landed right next to him. He said he was immediately quote
hulled through an opening and he found himself inside this craft. actually found himself in what appeared to be a
small elevator which rose upwards and into a brightly lit compartment with
circular walls and a curved ceiling. He estimates it was about 45 ft in diameter
and he was immediately greeted by six very short entities each about 3 and 1 half to four feet tall. He said that
they had large heads and Japanese-like eyes. This was all he could see as their
heads and the rest of their bodies were covered by a close-fitting, flexible, transparent plastic-l looking jumpsuit,
which he said was light cream in color. He did see a bulge on their faces
underneath their suits, which looked to be where their nose was, and a line
where their mouths were. Now each of the being inside a cylindert type device
which was quite narrow three feet in diameter about 15 in high and at the end
of each cylinder was a curved plate he said with a kind of lever on it. These were situated in two rows with a kind of
hallway between them. You can see his sketch here. Now, per Jose, the beings
spoke verbally among themselves in a strange, unintelligible language, which
he describes as repetitive, high-pitched, quote, "short sounds repeated shrilly like pigs grunting."
Now, for the next four or five minutes, he remained frozen there until one of the beings on the left side began to
manipulate a control. This caused the illumination in the room to slowly
increase in brightness to a point where it became so bright that Jose actually lost consciousness. The next thing he
knew, he was waking up in bed with no idea how he got there. He has no idea
how long he was in this craft. Now, his wife does remember him leaving the
bedroom, but she didn't see him come back. She fell asleep. Waking up in the morning, his eyes were red, badly
inflamed. He had trouble focusing. This was a condition which lasted for a full month. He also noticed that his shoulder
was pretty painful. Finally, he also felt lightaded and quote empty. He had
difficulty concentrating and this was a condition which lasted a full year. So
this whole incident left him in a state of shock for quite a long time and affected him very profoundly. Another
very interesting case. Certainly the ETSs that he describes do sound very
much like Grays. I think what's important about this case is he did have some hard to fake physiological effects
following his encounter. This is something that I think adds a level of credibility to it. There's so many
cases. If there were just 10 or 20 or even a hundred people across the planet reporting this kind of experience, I
think we would have reason to be skeptical. But it's far far more than that. It's thousands upon thousands. And
there's some good evidence that this actually numbers in the millions. So yeah, another important addition to our
understanding of onboard UFO encounters. Now, this next case is probably one of
my favorite in this collection. I have a few favorites, actually. This one is super interesting. I call this one
transformed by the extraterrestrials. The onboard UFO encounter of Joseph
Lewis Suzdek. Now, this case is so interesting. It took place on May 26,
1974 near Mitchell Caverns in California. like this case because the
whole family saw the UFO before the father was taken on board. What's also
interesting is who these people are. I've often, you know, wondered why some
people are contacted and others aren't. And the witnesses in this case absolutely fit the pattern I've seen
before. And also, it's the after effects of this encounter that I think are the
most important. This case comes from California-based pioneering UFO researcher and a member of NIKAP, Idabel
Eper. Was early on the evening of May 26, 1974, when the Suzik family, consisting
of Joseph Lewis, he's a machinist, aged 52, his wife Judiko, and their two young
daughters, Susan and Stephanie, were camping at Mitchell Caverns in California. They were in a little
trailer. To their amazement, they saw what they believed to be a UFO. They
didn't describe this, but this was not the first time Joseph had seen UFOs.
He's had several earlier sightings. But after this particular sighting, it was several hours later
that something would happen which would completely transform Joseph's life and
his families. It was the early pre-dawn hours of May 26 as Joseph and his wife
Jitsuo and their two young daughters were asleep in this camper near Mitchell Caverns. Suddenly, Joseph was awakened
by a humming noise. Looking around, he saw a pulsating light reflecting on the
inside of the camper, obviously coming from outside. At this point, he tried to call out to his wife and children, but
found that he was immobilized. He then saw four of what he described as quote pinw wheels of odd-shaped colored
lights, red, orange, yellow, and blue green. At this point, Joseph passed out,
and the next thing he knew, he was waking up the next morning, 2 hours later than he normally would have woken
up. He found that he was suffering from bloodshot eyes and achy body. He had
some vague impressions of having been taken somewhere in the middle of the night, presumably inside a UFO, but he
was unable to consciously recall much detail. But there was one very strange
and profound after effect of this encounter. Again, a machinist by trade
with no high school diploma, he suddenly found himself becoming a prolific inventor. Just months after his
encounter, he began designing new inventions and filing patents with the patent office. One of which is quote a
doorork knob nightlight or an illuminated doorork knob. Another was an illuminated cover plate for electrical
outlets. So this continued and as time went on he kept thinking about his strange experience of May 26 and finally
contacted Eper who began to investigate his case. She recommended hypnotic
regression and Joseph agreed. The hypnosis was conducted by Dr. William
McCall. He's quite experienced at this. And under hypnosis, Joseph recalled
being taken inside this craft. Inside, he was greeted by a group, he says, of
eight crewmen. He did not describe what they looked like other than to say that they wore foil type metallic uniforms.
Seven of these uniforms were maroon in color and one wore a quote pale blue
soft uniform. Joseph says that along one wall of the room he found himself inside
of he saw a row of what looked kind of like gyroscopes. He says that the quote pin
wheels of colored lights that he had seen apparently served to energize the gyroscopes creating quote an artificial
gravity field. This is apparently what the ETSs told him. Now, while he was in
there, he did have a physical examination. He says the ETS examined
his eyes with what looked like a magnifying glass type instrument. Joseph says that the ETS showed him several
other things, including quote, nebula in various colors to show concentrations of
metals and minerals. They also showed him a close-up color image of the planet
Saturn and they showed him a control panel in front of which were quote three
black reclining highbacked seats. This is really all he was able to recall under
hypnosis though he believes that more probably happened. But perhaps the most
interesting part of Joseph's encounter is that he would become world famous for
being one of the first to recognize the importance of pre-natal learning. He and
his wife. In 1985, he published his book, quote, a spark of genius, the
world's first prenatal teaching book. It turns out this was quite effective because Joseph and his wife, who is a
former school teacher, began teaching their children in utero while she was still pregnant. They would sing songs,
speak to them, count. They provided an environment of love and nurturing, and
it worked. Their eldest, Susan, knew how to say mom, drink milk when hungry, or
say wet when her diapers needed changing. all when she was only, get this, two weeks old. Susan started high
school at age seven and would later enter college at age 11. She ended up graduating with a master's degree at age
16. And the other four children were no different. Stephanie, Stacy, and Joanna
were all equally advanced. By the age of three months, all children could engage
in conversation. By nine months, they knew the alphabet. By the age of one
year, all could count to over a hundred. All of them ended up skipping grades in
school. In fact, when Joanna was only four years old, not even in school yet,
she was testing at a fifth grade level. Later, all four children tested IQ's at
over 160. That's well above genius level. Jitsuko also wrote about their methods
in her 1984 book, Fun and Happiness in Learning to Read. Their pioneering work
paved the way for prenatal learning, and it's now considered a wellaccepted and effective method to give young humans a
huge head start in learning. How interesting is that case? To me, the most interesting aspect is who these
witnesses are. the father being an inventor and the mother being a teacher.
This is a pattern I've seen in many cases where the people who are having contact are people who are doing good
work for humanity. It's so interesting how Joseph became an inventor
immediately following his encounter. Also super interesting and I think
significant is the fact that this couple pioneered the idea of pre-natal learning
which had a huge effect on society and really hap helped humanity in an amazing way. No coincidence in my opinion. I
think this is again further evidence that ETSs are here to help guide teach
warn wake people up to their abilities. It's an amazing and really important
case as is this next one. I think all these cases are important because at the
very least they provide further corroboration or evidence that
we are being visited that we are not alone in this universe. I call this next
case probed by aliens. The onboard UFO encounter of Janet Stewart. This is an
important case because there is more than one one witness. And while in many
ways it is a typical onboard UFO encounter, it has some really interesting elements to it. This case
was investigated by Brad Ayers and was published in the Muon UFO journal and in
a number of other publications and newspapers. It involves two witnesses,
Janet Stewart, aged 29, and her longtime friend Mary Root. It was an icy cold
night on January 6, 1976. As Janet was driving to pick up her friend Mary, she
was heading southbound down East Bethl Boulevard. You can see it here. She came upon the last curve in the road. And as
she maneuvered this last curve in her car, she looked up and saw three lights above the tree line, clearly attached to
one aircraft, which she first assumed must be a plane. There was a red light in the center, and on each side, a
smaller green light, which she immediately recognized as a bit strange. These weren't conventional lights.
Coming up to a stop sign, she stopped and paused there to gaze at this strange craft, which was now quite a bit closer
and larger. These little green lights were blinking rapidly, she said, which was also very strange. So, she's
wondering to herself, could this be a helicopter? She continued her way and as she came around a sharp right turn
corner, she was shocked when this object suddenly dropped down, zoomed forward,
came right over her car, and began to pace her vehicle. And as she says, I did
not hear a sound even though it wasn't more than 25 ft above me. Now, this
object stayed with her car as she made another sharp turn to the left. It stayed right above her for the next
mile. She drove quite slowly so she could keep an eye on it. She could see very clearly that this was not a
helicopter. She said it was larger than her car. She could see a chrome color on
the bottom of this craft, though it was hard to see as the lights really didn't illuminate the craft itself. She did see
what looked like a dome, though she couldn't be sure. Now, at one point, a car passed her in the opposite
direction, and she considered flagging it down, but didn't. Besides, she was now very near to her friend Mary's
house. So, she drove to Mary's house, got out, rushed to the door to tell her,
but by now the object was gone. The two piled into the car, drove back up East
Bethl Boulevard, hoping to see the object again, but it was gone. So, they continued their drive, turning around
and getting on Highway 65 south. And this is when Mary noticed a red light off to the east, pacing their car. After
driving about 2 miles southbound on Highway 65, they decided to get off on an eastbound dirt road, driving off to
where it ended so they could get a closer look at this object. And they could see it. It was hovering above the
trees at the edge of an open field. They flashed their headlights at the object,
but it did not appear to respond. So, after watching it for a few minutes, they turned around and got back on the
highway. They went to their destination. They were going to an astrology class. And then they returned
home. But when Janet got home, it was strangely an hour later than normal. She
told her husband, who was very supportive at first, but following this
sighting, both Janet and Mary began having menstrual cramps, and they had their period, which was contrary to
their normal cycle. Janet also noticed that following this sighting, she
suffered from painfully dry and burning eyes and extreme light sensitivity,
which worsened over the next few days to the point that she became very concerned. and she says, "I thought I
was going blind." She used eye drops and was going to go to the doctor, but then
her condition began to improve. Later, she did go to the doctor, but he could
not find anything wrong. Now, the next morning after the encounter, Janet remembered a dream that she was sitting
inside a small room filled with red lights. Also, when she woke up, she felt
an odd feeling of quote repugnance and quote contamination. and she took a long hot bath that
morning which was unusual for her. In fact, when this feeling persisted, she felt compelled to take another bath.
Thinking about her encounter and realizing she had missing time, she did some research and discovered Mufon and
agreed to go under hypnosis. Under hypnosis, she was taken back to the tire
of her sighting and she recalled that a tall figure dressed in white came up to
her car, which was now stopped along the road. She willingly opened the door and
exited her vehicle and took the figure's hand, which she remembered had a white glove on it. He walked her up to a craft
which was resting alongside the road. This craft was all lit up in red. It had
a translucent domed bottom section. It had an open door and she could see two
other white suited figures standing next to it. Next thing she knows, she's being
pulled inside this craft. She remembers seeing a face with large slanted eyes
staring at her. This caused her considerable fear. As researcher Brad
Ayes says, her clothing was removed. She was probed by a needle and heard Brad.
She was then taken to a small room filled with red light which was much like she recalled in her dream. The ET
then took her out of the craft and back to her vehicle. The engine was still running now. Brad Ays says of this
hypnosis session, quote, "It's all on tape. I have listened to the anguished
voice many times. The woman has changed. She has adjusted, but there was a time
when her marriage nearly fell apart. Her husband tried to make her believe that this never happened when in fact she
felt it had happened. It changed her life. It modified her worldview. She is
more tolerant. She used to be judgmental, especially in her concept of right and wrong. But she has cast off
prejudice. She opens her mind to people, to philosophies, to religions.
And thankfully her husband also came around as Brad says he has turned 180°
too. He's convinced that his wife underwent a very strange and traumatic experience. He's willing to accept
something that's unexplained. Now, interestingly, Janet Stewart's encounter occurred on the very
same day as the now famous Casey County, Kentucky case involving three women who
were apparently taken on board a craft. These include Louise Smith, Mona Stafford, and Elaine Thomas. No evidence
that there's a connection between these two cases, but it's certainly an interesting synchronicity. Also interesting is that
this area has had quite a few encounters. It was just one year later
in early October 1977 that a bus driver near Marine Lake
said that a UFO followed his bus. Now, unknown to him, there was another bus driver 20 m to the west near Lake.
Now, this is just a few miles from where Janet Stewart had her encounter. And apparently, this same UFO followed this
other bus driver as he told reporters after they guaranteed his anonymity. And
I quote, "It stayed pretty much in front of my bus and above it, maybe 2,000 ft
high. When I stopped, it stopped. I must have watched it for seven or eight
minutes. Then it disappeared in a flash. Now, he intentionally did not alert his
passengers to the object, but some saw it anyway. And as he says, nobody was
scared. We just laughed it off. It's not the only case in this area. 9 years
before Janet's encounter in 1967, there was a huge wave of sightings
over this exact area involving multiple police officers. Trollman Bob Force was driving along
Highway 7 when he says he saw a star-like object zoom by his car. As he
says, "It appeared to go alongside me. Then suddenly it was out in front. You got to see it to believe it." Many
officers began to report these objects. They gave various descriptions saying it
quote bobs like a cork or it stops and it darts or it's changing colors or it's
making Uturns and more. In fact, on Highway 12 at the Wazada Country Club
area, no less than seven police crew cruisers with the officers inside came
to a stop and gathered there with police chief Bill Kieran to watch a formation
of these strange objects. So, a pretty intense UFO wave. And it was just one
year later after that, again, just a few miles from Janet Stewart's case, another woman, Jean D, says that late one cold
night in January of 1968, she was awakened by a whirling sound in her home
in Golden Valley. Looking out her window, she saw a small 3-fft wide,
highly polished metallic disc hovering. was at very low elevation, right outside
her window, and she proceeded to hear a voice saying, quote, "We have to get into position on the east side of the
bedroom to clasp." She heard a strange sound and suddenly saw a metallic image
appear on her wall. It grew in size very quickly, and suddenly several three-ft
tall humanoids came right through the wall. She said that they had large gray green heads with large eyes. She said
that they had ears and a nose, but they never opened their mouths and communicated
telepathically. The next thing she knew, she was inside a room lying on a metal table. The beings told her
telepathically that they needed some of her quote substance. She says they placed a flashlight instrument on her
stomach and at one point they said that they wanted her son and she was not to
talk about this experience. Quite an amazing case, or should I say a series
of cases. It's not at all unusual that when someone has an encounter like this,
other people in the area are also having encounters. Apparently, there's something about this area that is of
interest to the ETSs. I suspect it's the people, honestly. But some very
interesting cases. This next one is also super fascinating. I call this one, there are
things I still cannot tell. The onboard UFO encounter of Netor Yuruti. This case
got a lot of publicity. It's pretty well known in Argentina where it took place.
This one took place on May 14, 1976 in Olivaria in
Argentina. It's an important case with some very unusual details and I think
you'll find it really interesting. This incredibly unusual case first appeared in a popular Argentine newspaper and
later in the Spanish publication Quarta Demension issue
44. Researcher Marcelo Nayer calls it quote one of the strangest known. The
witness is Netoruti. He's 47 years old at the time of his encounter, married
with four children. He lived near the intersection of Belcarce and Cirin
Valasion in Olivaria, Argentina. He worked at the Fiat Mariano Aosta car
dealership in town not far away, and it was at 6:20 that morning, May 14,
1976. He left the dealership in his MercedesBenz 55 truck, heading north
towards Boulevard to deliver a tractor. But he never made it there. He had only
just departed and was on route 226 in front of the bridge that crosses over
Avanita Pringles. You can see it here. Suddenly and without warning, about 20
street lights all around him were extinguished. And at the same time, the lights of his truck also went out.
Immediately, an intense yellow and purplish light appeared. and he could see it was coming from this glowing
object sort of shaped like an oyster. He said it and was hovering just above his
truck. I'll let Nester describe this in his own words as he says, "I was driving
over the bridge in a thick fog when I saw that. It opened like a big oyster and was very brilliant." Following that,
I find myself and the truck inside, and from then on, it was completely dark.
The tremendous brilliance had blinded me. Afterwards, I could see an enormous
panel of 3 or 4 meters size in the shape of a horseshoe, and on it were
instruments similar to clocks with needles, but without numbers. There were
also drawings on the panel resembling flowers of strange shapes, yellow and violet flowers. These were drawings of
open flowers with the petals facing inwards. On one side of the board, there was a cylinder with a ribbon that runs
up and down. On both sides, two kinds of triangles. And at the end of what seemed
to be instruments, two effiges of seahorses sitting on the same board. All
of this was green in color as if it were underwater. So, you can see the drawing
of this here. Now, Nester did not see anybody. Nevertheless, it appeared that somebody was there as he heard a
soothing voice begin to talk to him. and he started to feel these unseen beings doing something to him. As Nester says,
I had quieted down when I felt a helmet with several cables being put on my
head. I didn't see any person or living being. I can't say if it was a man or a
woman, but I heard a voice that reached me in the form of an echo, as if from afar, telling me to stay calm, that
nothing was going to happen to me. I heard many things, things I still cannot tell because I have a wife and daughter
and I don't want anything to happen to them. He now saw something else beyond
just this strange horseshoe panel. As he says, I was surrounded by a screen that
allowed me to see water, plants, seahorses. Now, the next thing Netor
knew, it was 45 minutes later and he was at his place of employment. He had no
idea how he got there. He was pretty traumatized, shaken, disoriented, largely incoherent. He was rushed back
to his home and his wife took him immediately to the Olivaria hospital. He
remained there for several days recovering. They gave him an encphilogram and then to verify his
story, they questioned him under the influence of sodium pentathol, commonly known as truth serum, but his story
remained totally consistent. He also had another weird aftere effect where he felt really disoriented and
dissociated almost as if he was somebody else. This came and went over a period
of days and finally that stopped happening. Now Nester was later
interviewed by researcher Fabio Zerpa and he admitted that following his
encounter he was still in contact with the ETSs via telepathy and the ETSs
telepathically told him that a time will come when humanity will see the ETS in
great quantity. They also told him something about them being in the oceans. He also
said that there were things, quote, that I still don't have permission to tell. Now, this case did get a lot of
attention. Skeptics and debunkers converge to try to pass off this incident as Nester becoming disoriented
by a refraction of his own headlights in the fog bank. And that the stress of this caused his mind to create the whole
story. But Nester still stuck to his story. How amazing is that? Such a shame
that the debunkers tried so hard to explain away his case as stress caused
by him seeing his own headlights reflected in the fog. I mean, that's kind of ridiculous. You have to admit
that's just insane. But I guess it's hard for some people to accept the reality of these kinds of experiences. I
blame the worldwide coverup for that. There are enough cases I think that we can move past skepticism and accept the
fact that these kinds of cases are taking place. Another really interesting aspect to that case was the ETS hinting
that there will come a day when there is open official contact. This is a message
a number of contacties have gotten and I honestly think it's inevitable because they're out there and sooner or later
we're all going to know it. You can hide the truth. You can distort it. You can
lie about it, but you can never destroy it. The truth can take care of itself and sooner or later it will become
known. Now, let's move to the next case. Also really interesting. I call this
one, you will begin to see things. The onboard UFO encounter of Dorothy Y. I
called it you will begin to see things. That's a direct quote from the ETSs and it's super interesting and illustrates
an important fact involving the aftermath of a UFO encounter that I see again and again. This one took place on
September 15, 1976 in New London, Missouri, and it's a
really interesting and unusual case. This profound case comes from Joseph
Bril and Dwight Connelly, both MUN field investigators. The witness is anonymous.
She's known only by her first name and last initial, Dorothy Y. She was 41
years old at the time of her encounter and lived in a trailer home in New London, Missouri. It was after midnight.
She had gone to bed only to wake up finding herself sitting on the couch and this bright light coming in through the
window. So nervous, concerned, she quickly retrieved her shotgun and three shells
and went out the back door and opened it to see what was going on. To her shock,
the sky above her was so fiery red that for a second she wondered if the world was coming to an end. And it was at this
point that she says she felt her willpower being somewhat overtaken. And
without her conscious valition, she went back inside, put the gun away, and
walked out the front door, head down, barefoot, till she reached about 20 ft
away from her home. And this is when she noticed two 4ft tall figures standing
nearby. She said that they had big heads, cheeks that looked somewhat swollen, and she also noticed seven or
eight similar figures standing some distance away lined up along a fence.
She said they seemed to be jibberjabbering to each other. She also heard a sound which she likened to a
helicopter above her. She could not force herself to look up at it and she found herself walking towards another
figure that seemed to be surrounded by mist. It reached out towards her and she
could see now that it had a white hand with quote something wrong about it. This was all she could really recall
consciously. The next thing she knew, it was morning and she was waking up in bed. She immediately noticed that there
was dirt on her feet. The soles of her feet felt a little bit burned. She also
felt weak and had a sore stomach. This was a condition which persisted for a full week. She also had a bad headache
and this lasted for two weeks. She did find some pleasant changes. Before her
encounter, she said she had been quite a worrier. But now she found that she no longer worried about things. And she
also found herself with an increased appetite and temporarily gained 40 lbs.
Now knowing this was all very strange, she later went under hypnosis. And under hypnosis, she recalled that this misty
figure she had seen closest to her had large eyes and was wearing dark form
fitting clothing. In its hand, which looked like it had two thumbs, it was carrying a shiny metal rod. Now, this
figure told her he meant no harm, and she found herself being led up a kind of
rope ladder, she said, into a quote round room. Inside this room, she was
put on a table and given a physical examination. After her examination, she did see
another man who she thought might be her husband, and he was being brought into
the room. Meanwhile, she was taken into a domelike room which had blue lights revolving around it. And as the
encounter came to a close, the leader told her, quote, "You will begin to see
things." She was then escorted from the craft. Now the last and final after
effect was that she began having predictions of disasters which she recorded and apparently which also came
true. I find all of these onboard UFO encounters quite fascinating and this
one is of particular interest to me because of the aftermath. the way that
this lady started having psychic abilities following her encounter,
predicting disasters which would come true. I think this is one of the ET
agendas are trying so hard to wake us up to our own psychic abilities. It's
something we see again and again in these types of cases and this case provides further corroboration of this.
In that regard, I think it's a really important case. Now, let's move to the
next one. This one is also one of my favorites in this collection of eight onboard cases. I call this one a journey
on board a UFO. The onboard UFO encounter of Victor and Boris. This one
took place in Russia in July of 1986, more specifically in the Shenkursk area
of Russia. I like this case because it's a multiple witness case. The witnesses
apparently weren't aware of UFOs and had a hard time figuring out what was
happening to them, assuming at first that this was just a military exercise
of some kind. But it's also got some really important and interesting aspects
to it that we see in other cases that are not super common. I think you'll
find it very interesting. This amazing case comes from leading Russian UFO researcher Vadim Chernobrov. He's the
head of the Russian UFO research organization known as Cosmopolis and the
author of UFO books. There is some confusion about the date of this case
with some sources saying July of 1986 and another saying spring 2014. I
believe the July 1986 date is correct. But on the day in question at around 700
a.m. two men, Victor, a fisherman, hunter, and jack of all trades, and his
friend Boris had gone into the Lumpsky swamp area. This is located about 10
kilometers or six miles outside of Shenkursk, Russia. They were there to
collect cloud berries or according to another source, edible mushrooms. and
they were returning along a dirt road in the forest and coming up to a fork. The
way ahead of them was blocked by a large craft of some kind, and their first thought that it was a tank wagon, much
like how fuel or other volatile liquids are carried on the back of a large truck. Both men were surprised to see
such a device out there in such an isolated area, and they told each other, "Where are they taking this tank wagon?"
Walking around this apparent craft were two men who Victor described as quote
strangers. Two young men dressed in gray blue overalls without hats, both
red-haired. Now, Victor and Boris decided to stop, smoke a cigarette, and speak with these two men who they
assumed were humans. And as they walked up, they noticed that this tank wagon
was in fact very unusual looking. As Victor says, it turned out to be
extraordinary. From the outside, it looked like a flattened ball. The side view was oval. The top view was a circle
with a diameter of 15 m, matte, dark silver in color. There were no windows
or hatches outside, and the surface looked absolutely smooth.
So these two human-looking strangers greeted Victor and Boris, and to their delight, speaking perfect Russian, these
two strangers offered to let them go on board the craft and that they would give them a ride back to the city. And as
Victor says, we gladly agreed. We thought a bulldozer would come soon,
take their tank wagon, and we would ride, but it would be better for us to ride rather than walk. A door opened and
the two strangers escorted Victor and Boris inside and the first thing he noticed was a strange icon embedded on
the door. As he says, I remember there was such a sign on the door. I do not
know what it means. Maybe it shows where to open the door was just opening up going inside the hall or maybe some kind
of emblem. The icon was pressed on the door. You can see it here. Going inside,
they could now see that this was clearly not a tank truck and instead was some kind of vehicle. And as Victor says, we
walked down the corridor into a spherical room with a diameter of 6 m.
Inside there were four chairs arranged in a semicircle. Two chairs had levers
on each side, a metal floor, a panel with buttons and inscriptions in the
form of unknown signs most similar to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. These were
located on the perimeter wall. The distance between the chairs and the panel was such that a hand could not
reach it from the chair. Above the panel was a transparent dome through which the
sky was visible. So this was amazing because from the outside they saw no windows. But both Victor and Boris were
about to get the most amazing shock of their life. The strangers told Victor and Boris to sit down. Victor sat on the
second seat on the left, one with a lever, and Boris sat to his left. These
seats were cushioned and had seat belts. Two of the seats were out of reach of the levers. And as Victor says, when
this damn thing took off, the floor became transparent and the ground quickly began to shrink. That's when I
suffered a lot of fear. I still can't forget. We thought we would fall out of there with the chairs. The strangers
were laughing, but it was all wild for us. Now, not really familiar with UFOs
or extraterrestrials, Victor and Boris assumed that this must be a miraculously
advanced military craft piloted by Russian military officers. But to their
amazement, this craft began to take a journey to the west, out of Russia and
into Europe. They were so shocked to the point that they felt quote not feeling
dead or alive. And as Victor says, I've never been abroad in my life, but here
we were taken for a ride across Europe. The craft then soared high, then dropped
low up to 100 meters above the European cities. After the shock, we and my
partner began to slowly come to our senses. Everything became interesting.
So they were able to look outside the craft through the transparent floor.
They traveled across Europe to many countries. One specifically included Germany. They came low right over the
Brandenburgg Gate in Berlin. Victor turned to one of the men at this point and asked, "Won't the border guards
shoot us down?" And one of the men replied, "Don't worry, they can't see us." Now, trying to figure out how this
craft was powered, Victor asked, "Won't you run out of gas?" And the men replied
that no, they won't run out of gas as their craft ran on cosmic energy and
explained that the energy for the craft is taken from a quantum vacuum, that the energy is endless and it's everywhere
around them in the environment. So, finally, Victor asked, "Where are you
from?" and one of the men apparently joking said that they are local from
Earth. They later decided that this was a joke. At any rate, Victor was sitting in one of the seats with the levers and
as the craft began the return journey, the man next to him who was piloting the craft offered to let Victor pilot the
craft. He explained that the lever would control the craft. And as Victor says,
surprisingly, it turned out to be very simple to drive the craft, easier than driving a car. And the craft flies
great, of course, with the feeling of omnipotence. During the maneuvers in flight, there was no feeling of geforce.
The only thing that caused discomfort was an unpleasant sound similar to a squeak, like a highfrequency transformer
under load. At one point, the craft landed, and as Victor says, when we were sitting on the ground, nothing squeaked.
It took off again and landed once or twice more. And on one of these occasions, both of these strangers
actually exited the craft, leaving Victor and Boris alone, still sitting in the seats. And it occurred to them how
easy it would be to steal this craft. But neither of them gave this a second thought. They did not dare do this. Now,
the total journey took about an hour and a half. Only towards the end of this journey did Victor and Boris realize
that these men were probably not Russians from Earth, normal humans at all, and that this craft was probably
not a military vehicle, but more likely a genuine flying saucer. And then, as
Victor says, we were dropped off on the road on the outskirts of Shenkursk. They exited the craft. They
found themselves on the same road, though now right on the outside of the village. They politely said goodbye to
these two strange men and went home absolutely astonished. They were totally
amazed. Victor did try to tell people about his adventure, but he soon found that most people were skeptical. As he
says, "I told this story to anyone I know. No one believes me." Some people
laugh and say, "How much did we drink that day?" Victor did finally tell his
story to Russian researcher Vadim Chernobrav who did take his story seriously. Unfortunately, by then his
friend Boris had passed away. But Vadim Chernobrav turns out that he became very
interested in how these types of craft are powered and did some really serious
research into free energy motors. How amazing is that? where these two
gentlemen are brought on board, sat down in the pilot seats, and actually allowed
to fly the craft themselves, go on a journey across Europe. I mean, that is
just amazing. There are not a whole lot of cases like that, but it certainly
does turn up consistently. If you're not aware of it, Grant Cameron wrote a book
called Sky Pilots, which presents a bunch of cases like these. And one of my
favorite contacties who you're probably aware of if you're aware of my research is Dolly Saffron who also describes
learning how to pilot these craft. So that I think makes this case super
interesting and super important. It's a fascinating case. Now let's move to
another one. I call this one a fight with strange humanoids. The onboard UFO
encounter of Ralph Fuller. This one took place on July 25,
1992 in Tutling, Germany. And this is an important case because it has some
details to it that I think everyone should know about. And also, it's
interesting to me because of how the witness reacted. This last and final case began on July 24, 1992 when Ralph
Fuller and his brother, who was eight years younger than Ralph, were driving from Eberswald, Germany to Tutlingen.
That night, tired from the drive, he stayed with his family on the balcony of their home, looking over the forested
hills. It was at 10:30 p.m. on July 24 that he noticed a star-like object
moving slowly across the sky and growing in size. He was standing alone at this
point. The others were a short distance away, but this object, he said, was white when he first saw it, but then
changed to red and blue and back to white. And it became clear to him that it was approaching because it was
getting larger. And when it came to within a mile, he could see that it appeared to be pyramidal in shape. And
as it moved, it left a series of after images behind it. Kind of like a time
exposure photograph is how he described it. He estimates that the size of the base of this thing was about 50 m, 150
ft. It appeared to be rotating and every few seconds a light would flash from underneath the base. He watched it for a
good long time, about 2 and 1/2 hours, at which point it moved off, moving in an S pattern, then shrunk down and
disappeared. And for some reason that even Ralph himself doesn't fully understand. He never called his family's
attention to this object and just watched it by himself. So following this sighting, Ralph and his brother left to
drive to another location in the city where they planned to spend the night. They arrived there around 2:00 a.m. and
went to bed. They were sharing a twin bed. At some point in the middle of the night, Ralph woke up and was shocked to
see that he was no longer in bed. Instead, he was in a small room about 5
m wide, 15 ft. The room was dark, weakly illuminated by a red light, and standing
next to him was a short figure. He said about 1.3 m tall. This is just over 4T.
and it clearly was not human. He said its face was shaped more like a rabbit.
He said it had closed set large dark slanted eyes, a very small mouth and
nose, no visible ears, a jutting chin, and short dark stubbled hair. He says
its arms were abnormally long, as were its fingers, and it was wearing a blue jumpsuit with a black belt and a dark
blue peaked hat. Ralph did notice a strange yellow symbol on one of its
sleeves, so he became quite afraid. He jumped up, grabbed the small being, and
began shaking it, saying, "What in thunder is the matter?" Now, at this point, three other
entities similar to the first, but a little shorter, appeared. They were wearing gray brown coveralls. They had
no hat, appeared to be bald. They grabbed Rolph's arms, one on either side, and tried to restrain him. But
Ralph realized he was much stronger than them and heavier. They weighed very
little. He hit one of them in the face with his elbow, knocking it down. The
two others were grabbing his right arm, and they tried to pull him to some kind of medical examination couch. He raised
his arm, easily, lifting up both of the two figures, then pried their hands from his arm. He then leapt in a somersault
maneuver over the couch. He grabbed it, lifted it up. He realized it was also very light. He was about to hurl it at
the short figures, and this is when he realized that he was trapped in this small room. There was no visible means
of escape, so he decided that was probably not a good idea. He set it down
and walked up to the first figure with the hat, who appeared to be the one in charge. That was his impression. He
called him the boss and demanded to know what they wanted of him. He didn't receive any answer, so he tapped the
figure's belly with the back of his hand and said, "That one, say something." Now, immediately, two of the shorter
beings grabbed both his arms, and a third one leapt onto his back. Ralph began fighting them. He kicked out at
the boss being, knocking off its hat. And then the being on Ralph's back
reached around his head and clamped its hand over Ralph's mouth, which caused him to faint. The next thing Ralph knew,
he was waking up in bed. This whole ordeal lasted about 5 minutes. But it
wasn't over yet. Now that he was awake and sitting up in bed next to his brother, who was still asleep, Ralph was
shocked to see that the entities were still there in his room, standing around the bed, five of them. The figures
proceeded to push Ralph back down onto the bed, onto his still sleeping brother. It was at this point he noticed
a strange detail. The figures seemed to project doubles of themselves. Finally,
all all of these doubles quickly merged into one and disappeared. Shaken, Ralph
still felt the need to defend himself and protect his brother. So, he pushed his brother out of bed. This woke his
brother up, who assumed that Ralph had just pushed him from the bed because he was hogging up the space on this narrow
twin bed. And at this point, both fell asleep. Now, another strange detail that really confused Ralph was that he was
fully dressed while on board the craft, even though he had gone to bed unclothed. And when he woke up, he was
unclothed. So, this made him really wonder about the experience. But the
fact was he was awake during the experience. And when he came back, he woke up and they were still in his room.
He also saw that UFO fully consciously just hours before all of this. So it
appears to be connected. But yeah, this was a really confusing and profound experience for him. And he believes he
was taken on board a craft and had this fight with short little ETS. One of the
most interesting and important details for me about this case is that the witness saw a UFO immediately prior to
his onboard encounter. This is a pattern we see again and again. A simple
sighting can be sort of a prelude, a warning, if you will, of an onboard
encounter that is imminent. And that is a pattern we see in a lot of cases. But
there's many interesting details to this case. Another that really fascinated me is his reaction. He became so frightened
he reacted violently. We do see this in a number of cases. In fact, I did a
whole episode about people who have lashed out physically at ETSs. I would
have included this case, but I wasn't aware of it. Also really interesting is that this witness describes the ETSs
being quite frail and light or not weighing much. This is a detail we see
in a number of cases. So yeah, some really interesting elements to it and I
think it adds to our knowledge of what's going on here as do all these cases. There are eight cases from around the
world. Again, pretty easy to dismiss 10 or 20 or 100 cases, but when we have
thousands and thousands of people all across the world reporting these kinds of events going back over a hundred
years, some involving multiple witnesses of high credibility, quite a few of them
involving various types of evidence. It's really, really hard to deny that
something important and profound is going on here. And I think it's pretty clear what's going on. We're being
visited by ETSs who are very concerned about our future. That is the pattern
that comes up again and again. I've said it before. ETS have an agenda of
guiding, teaching, healing, waking people up to their psychic abilities,
warning about future disasters. These are exactly the things that take place
when people have an onboard experience. We can certainly see that here in these
cases. This is not me speculating. This is me just reporting on the facts as we
know them. I think it's time for all the world to accept that on board UFO
encounters do take place. They cannot be explained as hoaxes, hallucinations,
misperceptions, or mental illness. Despite what our own governments would
have us believe, this is happening. So, thanks very much. I truly appreciate you
guys watching. It's because of you I do this research. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And until next time, please
keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun. I think that's
really the most important thing. That's why we're here on Earth. So, until then,
I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
