UFOS AND ROCKETS: SOMEONE IS WATCHING US
Aug 16, 2020

Summary:
Aug 16, 2020
Ever since the Modern Age of UFOs began in 1947, UFOs have been closely monitoring humanity's 
progress into space. When the U.S. military began to actively launch missiles at White Sands 
in New Mexico, UFOs immediately made their presence known, not only following the missiles in 
full view, but sometimes intervening to cause the missiles to fall to Earth. When more rocket 
launches occurred, UFOs were often there. Wherever rockets were being launched, UFOs showed 
up, including not only White Sands, but China Lake, Vandenburg, Holloman and other areas. 
While the U.S. military scrambled to deal with the sudden UFO presence, at the same time they 
aggressively tried to cover-up the events. 

But as the UFOs continued to show themselves, still sometimes disabling the rockets, whistle-
blowers recognized the importance of what was happening and courageously alerted the public 
of what was happening.

These are not simple sighting. Under the J. Allen Hynek system, some might be classified as 
Close Encounters of the Second Kind, during which UFOs affect the environment (disabling a 
missile.) But in actuality, they are all human-initiated encounters and are more accurately 
classified as CE5 events.

This video presents about twenty cases in which UFOs have showed up during rocket launches. 
As most of these events have been covered up, the actual number is certainly much higher.

The incredible events that have occurred at White Sands, Holloman AFB, China Lake, Vandenburg 
AFB and other areas have yet to be fully revealed. 

As this video will show, the UFO occupants' interest and monitoring of rocket launches is 
likely comprehensive, as there are cases in which UFOs have shown up during the launching 
of toy model rockets! Some UFO abductees have been told directly that we are being observed.

Why are UFOs monitoring and disabling missiles? What happened to all the camera footage showing 
these events? How many times has this happened? We all deserve to know the truth about the UFO 
presence on our planet. Cases like these are profoundly important and can be ignored no longer.

For those who would like to learn more, I have documented these (and other) cases in my book, 
"Not from Here: Volume Two," now available on Amazon.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  today i would like to talk about ufos and rockets
rockets have been around for centuries  but it wasn't until the 1920s and 30s that   serious research began and  this field really began to  
develop and progress we were using liquid  propellants at this time and able to get these   rockets quite high the atomic age began in 1940s  this coincides exactly with the modern age of ufos  
many researchers have pointed this out and  i don't think it's a coincidence this is  
apparently what caused a lot of attention to  be paid to our planet was our use of atomics  
in the united states our research was  centered largely at white sands in new mexico
this is where we exploded the first atomic bomb  and this is where we did an enormous amount of  
research with rockets and as soon as we started  doing this ufos showed up and really began to uh  
not only monitor these rocket launches but in  some cases intervening what happened at white  
sands isn't that well known i don't think but  it sure should be because what happened there is  
astounding and it's actually still going on  i'd like to present about 20 cases in which  
ufos have observed or intervened during rocket  launches and just let people know how closely  
we are being watched by ufos first case i'd like  to talk about occurred on may 15 1947 this is at  
white sands in new mexico a v2 rocket had just  been launched it reached about 40 miles high when  
another quote target appeared an unknown object  it came very close to this missile immediately  
afterwards the missile veered off course and two  minutes later crashed to the ground uh the team  
heading this launch all observed this it  was headed by lieutenant colonel harold r  
turner and after this missile falls to the ground  turner tells his commanding officer what happened  
and told intelligence investigators that the  missile crashed because of this object so the  
army was of course very concerned about this the  office of scientific research and development  
had a board of highly placed scientists and  military officials to study this and this board  
was actually headed by dr van avar bush who as you  may know has been implicated as being part of mj12  
the alleged government ufo study group so yeah  this was causing waves in very high circles  
and uh this was just the beginning on june  29 1947 just you know uh one month later  
there was another incident there was three naval  scientists dr zhan curtis rockwood and john koch  
who were overseeing a launch preparing for a  test involving their captured german v2 rocket  
when a silver disc appeared and started circling  overhead dr zahn reported it to army intelligence  
telling them very specifically that it was not  a balloon and following you know these incidents  
ufos were showing up during many of these rocket  launches this camera part of a flying laboratory  
is recovered by clyde holiday of johns hopkins who  prepared it for its trip to the upper stratosphere  
rivaling the fantastic imagination of jules verne  the camera brought back a record of a flight into  
the heavens of a captured german v2 rocket at  white sands new mexico the huge missile takes
off air force pictures show the rocket in flight  and the flying camera automatically takes over  
the huge projectile drops the earth behind at  the tremendous speed of 4 000 feet per second  
the rotation of the rocket causes  the planet to spin before the lens   and the camera photographs the earth 65 miles  straight down the horizon 720 miles away  
and the curvature of the earth are astonishingly  apparent in this still picture from the film  
an observer in the rocket could have seen san  diego salt lake city kansas city and san antonio  
approximately one million six hundred thousand  square miles of the earth's surface was revealed  
the rocket reached the 65 mile height in  three minutes this giant engine of destruction  
designed by hitler to annihilate allied nations  now serves the worthy cause of peacetime research  
on april 6 1949 several objects were observed over  white sands on this occasion observers were able  
to use a theodolite a theodolite is a telescope  which is attached to kind of a protractor it  
rotates vertically and horizontally it's used  for surveys and meteorology and at white sands  
they use it for missile tracking it allows them to  triangulate the missile determine its height its  
speed size distance and so on and when these  objects appeared yeah they were able to use  
a theodolite and actually watch these things and  there's a number of other cases like this it was  
about two weeks later april 24th 1949 another  ufo appeared and was observed using a theodolite  
the army was launching a skyhook weather balloon  when this ufo showed up the team was supervised  
by commander robert mclaughlin charles b moore  was heading the team and he was watching the  
balloon when he noticed that the theodolite  operator had apparently lost track of the balloon  
and was pointing the theodolite  at a different section of the sky   um charles moore berated the officer and said  you've lost the balloon and the operator said  
no i've got it right here and moore looks  up and sees this other object this ufo  
so he took over the the theodolite and observed  this saucer shaped object for about 60 seconds  
he estimates it was about 40 feet wide 100 feet  long it had very solid edges and was moving at  
an estimated 22 hundred miles per hour over 2000  miles per hour so fast they of course informed  
intelligence officers who sent in project  blue book and this is when things went  
south project blue book officers did not  seem at all interested in the case and uh  
really just showed no interest in investigating  it and uh this really upset the officers who were  
had seen this thing in fact charles moore was  very upset jay allen heineck was part of this team  
and he talked about this incident and i'm  quoting here this is jaylen heineck saying   moore was disgusted with the air force's  and my lack of attention to this sighting  
who can blame him it was typical of the air  force's practice of spending a great deal of   overkill effort pinning down cases for  which there seemed to me an immediate  
logical explanation in sight and devoting  only modest follow-up to a case that was truly  
baffling so yeah i mean clearly the cover-up was  already in place at this point and blue book was  
not interested in publicity of this incident  nevertheless they did label it unidentified  
and this case caused waves in very high circles  vannevar bush's team came to investigate  
and uh incredibly this event was leaked  to several newspapers and they were very  
concerned about these leaks more concerned about  the leaks apparently than the incident itself  
according to brad sparks and jerome clark both  ufo researchers the air force office of special  
investigations and i'm quoting here went into a  frenzy to try to hunt down the source of the leak  
they found some officers who had leaked  about it but it turned out the main leak  
they couldn't believe it turned out to  be commander laughlin himself uh he was  
who had had been heading this team he had  actually gone public and given an interview  
and just spilled all the means and i'll  quote commander robert mclaughlin here  
after observing this incident this is what  he told reporters flying discs have nothing  
to do with any experiments carried on by american  scientists or for that matter by anyone on earth  
if these things are real they come from another  planet where creatures are far ahead of us in  
science i have heard it said that they are  spaceships from mars which have been attracted   to the earth by our atomic bomb explosions  and fascinated by what they saw have continued  
to keep an eye on us later mclaughlin gave an  interview to true magazine and he said i am  
convinced it was a flying saucer and further that  these discs are space aliens from another planet  
operated by animate intelligent beings so remember  this is a commander in the army a pretty high  
level witness that's what i like about a lot  of these cases they're not only widely viewed  
under ideal commit conditions but using  telescopes and theodolites but are  
also being viewed by people who are themselves  actually you know rocket scientists engineers  
highly placed military officials who are  very familiar with aircraft so these are  
the kinds of sightings which are impossible for  skeptics to deny and especially because there's  
so many and what the activity at white sands was  incredible it was a magnet for ufo activity in may  
and june of 1949 two more v2 rockets were launched  both launches did attract ufos on the may 1949  
launch an object moved slowly over the launch pad  before the launch and then quickly zipped away  
in june the objects appeared during the  middle of the launch two disks appeared  
flew right up next to the rocket flew circles  around it literally and then zipped away   at about thirteen hundred miles per hour uh the  people who were launched the rockets saw this  
but there was at least five independent witnesses  on various locations over the base who saw this  
mclaughlin was one of the witnesses and  he gave a statement and said many times  
i have seen flying discs following and overtaking  missiles in flight at the experimental base  
at white sands where as is known the first  american atom bomb was tried out so this happened  
fairly regularly i think the few cases we were  hearing here are just the tip of the iceberg  
most were likely covered up because there was  definitely a clamp down on publicity on these  
cases another incident took place on april 27 1950  a missile was launched at hollaman air force base  
this is right next to white sands and it failed  and it fell down to the earth at which point  
four quote unknowns swooped down to investigate  uh not sure that they actually intervened  
or not caused this missile to fail but it wouldn't  surprise me because we do see this happening in  
other cases at any rate this was viewed using a  theodolite and observers were able to determine  
that these objects were at least 30 feet  in diameter they were only seen for a few  
moments before they darted quickly away  uh in 1954 there was another incident  
one of the witnesses was famous astronomer robert  schaldak who worked at lowell observatory but also  
worked in a civilian capacity for white sands  photographing and monitoring uh missile launches  
so he was setting up his ballistic camera  to monitor a launch when a ufo showed up  
and uh he's robert scheldeck saw  this he's an astronomer an expert in  
aerial phenomena and was not able to recognize  it as any kind of aircraft or meteorological  
phenomena said it was definitely not a meteor they  found another witness some 12 miles away so they  
were able to triangulate this object and determine  that it was moving at several thousands of miles  
per hour blue book officers were called in and  without any real investigation labeled it a meteor  
which is i mean incredibly offensive because here  they are they have no meteorological training  
certainly not to the level that a professional  astronomer does and they're calling it a meteor  
so that's clearly a debunking technique so while  all this was going on at white sands this was  
also happening in other areas another area where  a lot of rocket and weapons research was going on  
is in china lake in southern california up  in the desert there it's a very remote area  
in 1955 there was a lot of missile  and rocket launches taking place there  
one of the witnesses was elmer greene who  worked at the base he was interviewed by  
researcher richard thompson and elmer green  spilled the beans and told richard thompson  
that yeah there was a lot of ufo activity during  launches and i'm just quote richard thompson here  
from his interview with elmer green so this  is richard thompson talking in his position  
green frequently heard about incidents in which  ufos flew into camera range during weapons testing  
and were photographed he heard about good  quality films that had been made of ufos  
and he personally saw black and white still photos  of ufos that were made by people in his group  
he was aware of some 40 to 50 professional people  who had some connection with ufo sightings made  
during weapons testing so this is clearly uh  something that happens regularly and this is  
exactly what we're seeing a very famous  incident involving a ufo that showed up  
during a rocket launch occurred at vandenberg air  force base there was this is on september 15 1965  
some 120 people were present one of them was uh  lieutenant robert jacobs who worked to photograph  
these missile launches they were launching an  atlas f missile at vandenberg this had a dummy  
warhead uh attached to it it wasn't atomic  but you know was equipped to carry atomics  
and so they were filming this launch when the  launch mysteriously failed the missile suddenly  
veered off course and plunged into the ocean and  uh jacobs was reviewing the film with his superior  
major sunny mansmin when this ufo showed up  it was tracking the missile came up alongside  
mind you the missiles moving at several  thousand miles per hour at this point   and sends down three beams of light  at which point the missile fails  
and uh manson accident asks him what are we  looking at and jacob says well i think it's a ufo  
so jacobs has done interviews i'd like to play  a bit of an interview right here about what he  
says he saw it was around dawn the sky was light  when the rocket took off with an atlas f or an  
atlas d again i'm not positive because of security  clearance here on this thing but it was an atlas   rocket with a dummy atomic warhead in it i want to  emphasize dunny so we saw with our standard camera  
which had a 150 inch lens on it the rocket come up  out of the the ground fog over the pacific ocean  
and i shot it out there it is and the bu telescope  swung around and locked in on it and we watched  
all three stages of powered flight first section  dropped away the second section third section and   the dummy warhead sailed on into oblivion as our  film rolled on the back of the bu telescope end  
of story nothing strange there is there no the  next day in vanderburgh air force base after  
we had processed the film and delivered it we were  all quite pleased with ourselves that we've been   able to photograph all three stages of power  flight of a missile major manson called me into  
his office and as i went in i remember two guys  in gray suits civilian suits and major mansmen  
and a film projector and a screen nature  management said sit down bob he didn't   call me button call me lieutenant jacobs so the  lights dim the projector fired up and uh the sun  
came on and there coming out of the fog was the  missile that we'd photographed from 186 miles away  
and the bottom one third of that rocket filled the  frame from that distance so it was an enormously  
big image and i was pretty tickled the telescope  locked on as you've accurately pointed out by  
radar and it locked onto the thing and we watched  the first stage burn out the second stage burn out   and the third stage burned out and we watched  a smaller image now as the nose cone separated  
and opened up we watched the radar chass  deploy on screen wow this is amazing  
amazing photography this thing is now traveling  at eight or nine thousand miles an hour  
heading for annie we talked and we're watching  huge images of it the radar chaff deployed  
the dummy nuclear warhead was plainly visible  at this point and this whole package is flying  
along now at a as i said eight or nine  thousand miles an hour by this point   when suddenly and you have to try to grasp  an image of this on a tv screen suddenly from  
the left-hand side of the screen that is the  direction of which the missile was traveling   something else flew into the frame and something  else was circular it looked like two inverted pie  
pins stuck together with a gall with a golf ball  on top of it the best i can describe it this thing  
flew in following our dummy package and fired  a beam of light which struck the dummy warhead  
this thing then flew up over on top of the  warhead hit it again with another beam of light  
flew off toward the right hand side of the  screen it's doing a circle if you can imagine   circling our warhead fired another beam  of light at it which struck the warhead  
container disr came underneath it and fired a  fourth beam of light then came back 360 degrees  
and flew back out of the frame in the same  direction it had come literally flying circles   around it it's as if somebody is saying yeah  look what i can do film stop rolling the lights  
came on and and the guys in the gray suits were  looking at me and major manson was looking at me   major manson said lieutenant jacobs what do you  think that was and i said it looks to me like we  
got a ufo adrian manson then said to me were  you guys in any way screwing around up there  
he then said to me with while these two guys these  two civilian guys stood there and watched he said   lieutenant jacobs in order to say nothing  about this as far as you're concerned this  
never happened and i caught my breath having just  witnessed the most astonishing thing i had ever  
seen an exhibition of something that changed my  entire way of thinking about the universe about  
mankind about planet earth about so many things  and he said now i don't need to remind you of a  
severity of security breach do i and i said no sir  he said fine you're dismissed as i walked toward  
the door he came up and said satavochi in my ear  that is quietly in my ear apparently so these  
guys in the gray suits wouldn't hear he said um  if anything ever comes up in the future where you  
you're cornered and you just have to say something  say it with laser tracking and he escorted me out  
the door some very colorful events happened i  started getting telephone calls late at night  
i'd pick up the phone and voices would shout  obscenities at me they would scream you're  
going down quote unquote they would say rude and  unequivocal things about my wife and hang up they  
were so blatant about this that i had an answering  machine they would call up and leave threatening   messages on my answering machine one night i was  sitting in my living room it was about one o'clock  
in the morning and my mailbox blew up somebody  put a bomb in my mailbox in wisconsin that night  
and within a matter of half an hour there was  a telephone call and i have it on tape still  
today it said rockets in the mailbox at night oh  what a beautiful sight you're going down mother  
so i had that happen to me for three or four  years those calls went on even after i moved  
out of wisconsin a twit named philip j class  who's a famous debunker of ufos phil class  
got on my case and helped get me fired from  the university of maine by writing letters  
obscene outrageous letters accusing me  of unethical conduct as a professor of   journalism and so forth helped fuel the fires of  having me lose my job at the university of maine  
which is why i'm a little candy now about  telling people exactly where i live where   exactly where i teach although it's easy to  find out if you're if you're terribly interested
so yeah this was clearly a major incident uh  there was a strong attempt to cover this up  
mansman i mean jacobs did go public and as we  can see he was threatened uh he lost his job  
uh this is was not easy for him and  uh researchers actually contacted  
major sunny mansman to see if he would confirm it  and he did he absolutely confirmed this incident  
so this is another clear-cut case of a ufo  not only monitoring our rocket launches  
but intervening it wouldn't surprise me if they're  monitoring every single one of our rocket launches  
we just don't see them but sometimes they  show up and i think they want us to know  
that they know what we're doing another case  comes from dr stephen greer this occurred on  
in april of 1966 at seal beach california  this is a naval weapons station  
and this is where the saturn rocket was being  built and uh it was the middle of the night when  
a ufo shows up comes right down over the saturn  rocket and just hovers there this was a big disc  
it was apparently viewed by over 400 employees  and of course photographed these photographs as  
far as i know have not been released but yeah  there's got to be some great evidence here  
of ufos that because many these missile launches  are regularly photographed uh probably the biggest  
incident of this kind occurred at malmstrom air  force base in montana this occurred on march 16  
1967 robert salas was inside the launch facility  monitoring uh the base when he got a call from  
the guards saying that there were strange lights  hovering outside and robert sauce is like what do  
you mean ufo and the guard says you know i don't  know what they are but they're totally silent   and they're performing these incredible maneuvers  and uh called back a shortly later this the guard  
saying that the ufos were still there they  were now hovering right over the front gate   they were very close and the guards had their  weapons trained on these things because they did  
not know what they were so salus of course informs  his commander at which point uh all these weapons  
start shutting down one after another these are  minuteman missiles that are equipped with nuclear  
warheads so this is very serious stuff when one  by one these missiles were just going offline  
and nobody could explain why and that's when they  found out that this was actually happening at the  
other location echo site about 50 miles away  where another ufo is hovering right over  
the launch facility and 10 missiles just went  offline all the guidance systems shut down  
everything boom boom boom and as robert salas  saws you know there was this whole incident  
was covered up for years he did eventually  go public other witnesses have gone public  
but as robert salas says i'm quoting here so  that morning we lost anywhere from between  
16 to 18 icbms at the same time ufos were in the  area and were observed by airmen so yeah i mean  
i don't know if this was a display of power  a message or what but they certainly made  
it clear that they have the ability to shut  these objects down anytime they want of course  
robert salas is not the only one who's come  forward saying this another witness who was at the   echo site location it was don crawford he also  confirms robert salas's testimony so yeah this was  
going on wherever we were doing rocket research  back at white sands on june in june of 1967  
rocket engineer edward beatty was overseeing  a launch at white sands he had overseen more  
than 850 rocket launches in his career and  they were about to launch this uh missile  
when they saw a object high up overhead the launch  pad facility and it was circling around this tiny  
little black disk and would sometimes glint in  the sun so that it was clear it was metallic  
they called the radar stations and the radar said  no we don't have anything on radar so the launch  
went on ahead anyway they launched the rocket  when someone shouted out look at that and uh  
edward beatty could see that this disc had  swooped down and was now tracking the missile  
and i'll quote edward beatty here he says we saw  the rocket rising from the launch pad and the  
quarter inch disc was pacing alongside the  rocket going straight up all of us saw this  
i know we did not possess an aircraft at that time  that could fly straight up and pace that rocket  
i can't explain it so this was apparently  common knowledge at these air force bases  
in fact ralph and judy bloom who were  pioneering researchers wrote one of the first  
best-selling books on ufos ufos beyond earth they  interviewed an airman who worked at white sands  
who walked into the bathroom on the  white sands base and saw this graffiti  
i saw a disc up in the air a silver disc that  wasn't there two more weren't there again today  
oh how i wish they'd go away so yeah obviously  common knowledge and uh i'm not even going to get  
into the gemini and apollo moon missions  that's opening up a huge can of worms  
and i would be talking for hours and hours about  what occurred with them but suffice to say that  
yes it follows the same pattern we see in other  cases and there are numerous nasa insiders like   you know chris kraft and maurice chatelain who say  that we were followed both to and from the moon
so how close are ets monitoring us very  closely like i said it's probably every  
launch and the reason i think that is  because i found a number of cases in   which ufos have shown up during the launches  of toy model rockets by you know civilians  
a case took place on june 6 1968 at lake havasu  a young man had decided to launch a three-stage  
toy model rocket he put a little lizard inside and  this thing took off and it was a successful launch  
he came down to collect the rocket when this ufo  showed up very close overhead he said it looked  
like a sort of a tiny two-man submarine it was had  a chrome metallic like surface was totally silent  
and was there in a flash and then disappeared very  quickly and this is not an isolated incident in  
may of 1981 students at shawnee middle school in  westerville ohio were conducting a rocket contest  
and it was following the launch of all these  toy model rockets that a ufo showed up one of  
the witnesses was one of the last people on the  playground he and the principal and they were  
walking into the school when he noticed this  large object floating overhead and he said  
it was quote a large black 55 gallon drum looking  ufo it was rotating very slow and had no markings  
this object was completely silent he points it  out to the principal and they watch this thing   for several minutes and are not able to identify  it strangely after they saw this thing they  
just went inside and never talked about it and  yeah there are there are other cases like this  
another one i found occurred on september 2nd 2001  in linbrook new york a father decided to take his  
three sons out to shoot off some toy model rockets  they had 10 of them with class b engines and  
had launched a number of them when suddenly these  ufos showed up and it wasn't just one there was  
four or five most of them were pretty high up  there and they looked like white discs but one  
came swooping down it was clearly shiny metallic  with an aluminum-like finish and it was clearly  
interested in the uf or in the rocket which it  was tracking so this goes to show how closely  
these ets are monitoring our rocket launches  i mean if they're watching toy rocket launches  
they are surely watching our major rocket launches  and i think proof of that comes from a first-hand  
abductee case this occurred on march 12 1997  which was actually the day before the famous  
phoenix lights sighting in arizona but on that day  this man was driving home from nevada he was in  
death valley california when he saw this  triangular craft come over his car he  
got out next thing he knows he's inside  this thing and he's surrounded by these  
short bald-headed large-headed large-eyed  gray-skinned beings typical grays  
and they showed him this three-dimensional  map of our planet with all the military bases  
lit up and said that we must stop using these  devices that's what they told him they told him  
that they are watching all our military bases and  have the ability to turn our missiles off at any  
time and that they actually have done so so i mean  here's first hand evidence from the horse's mouth  
saying that yes we are perfectly aware of what  you are doing and this is still going on today  
a relatively recent case took place in china on  june 19 2012 when china launched the shenzhou  
9 rocket it had reached an altitude of about 5  thousand feet one mile high when two ufos showed  
up and went right by this rocket and this was  clearly visible on the uh film of this rocket  
and was totally unexplainable there's never been  an explanation for what these objects were a  
similar incident happened two years later on may  15 2014 when russia was launching the proton-m
it contained a communication satellite allowing  people to use the internet in more remote areas  
when this object crosses path with the rocket  at at this point the rocket immediately fails it  
explodes and crashes to earth and uh it appears  again once once again that this rocket known  
was not only observed by ufos but our ufo  intervened and caused the launch to fail  
hard to say but this is what we see in a  number of these cases oleg ostapenko was  
the representative of ross cosmos which is the  equivalent of nasa it's the russian space agency  
and he released a statement saying in part the  exact cause is hard to establish immediately  
but we will be studying the telemetry  needless to say no mention of the ufo was  
ever given or any explanation of why this  rocket actually failed so yeah these are  
incredible cases again what i love about them  is they are observed under ideal conditions by  
multiple trained witnesses often filmed there's  almost no possibility of misperception here  
the evidence is outstanding these are essentially  ce5 cases because these objects are being  
provoked into an appearance by rocket launches and  as we've seen they're watching us so closely that  
they even appear during toy model rocket  launches and the fact that they have  
intervened on multiple occasions shows that  they can and will intervene when they deem  
it necessary i did a study of these  cases in my book not from here volume 2.  
and yeah they come from all over the world  there's a lot of them so these are obviously very  
important cases that deserve a lot more attention  that they are getting than they are getting
