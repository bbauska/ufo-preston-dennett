Oct 25, 2020

Summary:
Oct 25, 2020
While UFOs are seen across the world and in every state in the United States, the state of Nevada has produced some of the world's strangest and most influential encounters. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences, UFO crash/retrievals -- Nevada has them all, and more.

This video presents the top twenty best UFO cases in the Silver State. Some are well-known, others have received almost no publicity at all. But each of them have contributed to our understanding of the subject and shaped our beliefs and feelings about the UFO phenomenon.

Weird cat and mouse games as UFOs terrorize motorists along desert highways, Blue Book unidentified cases, unknown metallic craft surrounding military planes, aliens mingling among the crowds in Las Vegas casinos, UFOs landing on military bases, giant fleets of objects, secret government projects reverse engineering alien technology...the Nevada UFO story is stranger than you might think!

These top twenty Nevada UFO cases will not only amaze you and inform you about Nevada's rich history of encounters, they will change the way you think about these strange visitors to our planet. 

Which cases made the top twenty list? What are the top three? You'll have to watch the video to find out!

For those interested in learning more about these and other encounters in Nevada, my book, "UFOs over Nevada: A True History of Extraterrestrial Encounters in the Silver State," is available on Amazon.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and today's episode is called the top   20 ufo cases in nevada i've dug really deep into  the history of encounters in nevada and come up  
with a list of what i think are the top 20 best  ufo cases i used various metrics to decide you  
know what is the best case these are cases  that are influential got a lot of publicity  
or perhaps widely viewed or have lots of evidence  or are unique in some way so these are the cases  
coming out of nevada that have really shaped  our understanding of the ufo phenomena i think  
a different researcher may have come up with  a completely different list but this is mine   and i'm really excited about sharing it with you  because some of these cases i think you'll have  
heard of but i've got new information on them  i hope and i think some of these cases you have  
not heard of for sure and they should  be much more widely known than they are  
so i'm going to start with case number 20  and move all the way to the very best case   number one so let's start with case 20. case 20 is  blue book case number 721 which was unidentified  
it's the first case investigated by project blue  book and declared unidentified in the state of  
nevada and it occurred on may 7 1950 to an elderly  couple and their grandson who were returning home  
from a picnic to their home in il ely nevada  they were about eight miles south of town  
and they saw this silver white object hovering at  treetop level and it's amazing because this object  
stayed in place for about 10 minutes then started  to oscillate a little bit and then suddenly   accelerated upwards very quickly and zoomed out  of sight they reported their case officially and  
blue book officers arrived to interview them  and were unable to come up with an explanation  
and actually declared the case unidentified this  is significant because it's only one of four cases  
that blue book declared unidentified in nevada  and really the only involving civilian witnesses  
now case number 19 is the ufo caught in a  spotlight this is a very rare type of ufo  
case there are only a few that i know of there's  one that occurred in california outside of in los  
angeles in 1942 it's often called the battle of  los angeles another very famous ufo searchlight  
case occurred in norwood ohio in 1949 and again  involved this ufo that was caught in the spotlight  
well this exact thing happened in nevada it's a  fairly recent case it occurred on december 1st  
2000 and appeared in the las vegas review journal  a couple of weeks later uh it occurred at the  
premiere opening of the thomas and mack rodeo  i'd just like to read you the first hand  
account and i'm quoting now some folks are still  buzzing about what some consider a ufo sighting  
high above the thomas and mack on december 1st  the opening night of the national finals rodeo  
dozens watched as a large on property searchlight  the largest in the world at 50 000 watts  
locked onto the cylindrical object which didn't  move for 45 minutes so they actually called  
nellis air force base and spoke with tech sergeant  charles ramey who was the air force base public  
affairs officer and he said that they had no  information about it and had not received any  
calls but it's a significant case because not only  its unique elements in terms of its searchlight  
connection but it was widely viewed and for a  long period of time over a pretty crowded area  
and a public event not a lot of cases like  that so it's definitely an interesting case  
case number 18 is a really interesting multiple  witness case this had military officers  
and uh all trained observers so this is a very  significant case because each of these guys were  
in independent locations this account appeared  in the la times shortly after it occurred and  
what happened was on june 24th 1950 captain e l  remlin and captain sam b wiper were flying a ual  
mainliner transport at about 4 000 feet over  las vegas when they saw this glowing object  
it had a bright blue center and a bright orange  corona around it and was flying in a horizontal  
trajectory about six thousand feet above them so  at about twenty thousand feet and it was pretty  
far away from maybe about twenty miles they  estimated and i was flying at a very high speed  
uh what they did not know is that  there were other witnesses there was   also an air force pilot who saw this there was  also a navy pilot who was flying in the area  
he observed it as well and finally there were  further army witnesses on the ground who reported  
seeing the same sighting and now we move to  case 17 a fleet of ufos at nellis air force base  
this occurred on april 17 1952 about five minutes  after noon and there were numerous witnesses uh  
technical sergeant orville lawson sheet metal  foreman rudy tonser sheep metal shop workers  
rk van hooten edward gregory and charles  rolfson all saw a group of about 18 objects  
darting across the sky they were in a sort of  random formation but all moved in a straight line  
all except one of them which was ahead of the  main group and was zigzagging back and forth  
so uh the first person to actually see this  was rk van hooten he alerted the others and  
they observed these objects for about 30 seconds  a whole fleet of them and estimate that they were  
pretty high up there about 40 000 feet and there  were no contrails or anything seen totally silent  
and a really interesting sighting because it  involved not only objects moving directly over a  
military base and were widely viewed by trained  observers but there were an awful lot of them  
18 disc like objects so a real  you know sizeable fleet of ufos
and now we move to case number 16. case number  16 is a top secret case which became revealed  
through the freedom of information act and was  finally disclosed 38 years after it happened  
this occurred on june 28 1947 at 3 15 p.m this  is actually only a few days after the really  
famous kenneth arnold sighting over mount rainier  washington the main witness in this case was first  
lieutenant eric b armstrong and he was flying his  f-51 fighter about 30 miles north of lake mead at  
an altitude of 10 000 feet and looking down he  saw a group of about five or six small white  
round discs all clustered together in a close  formation about four thousand feet below him  
he said they moved pretty smoothly in a gentle  path and at about 285 miles per hour which was  
matching his air speed and they paced his uh  jet for a little while his f51 fighter and then  
suddenly darted off at an angle and disappeared  over the distance off into the distance only  
months earlier that had been another report in  the area so armstrong's sighting got uh caused  
a lot of attention actually and it caused real big  waves at high levels and later became one of about  
20 cases that were included in a top secret air  intelligence report it's report number 100-203-79  
the title of the report is called the analysis  of flying object incidents in the u.s and uh yeah  
this remained secret for decades this report was  signed by both the usaf director of intelligence  
and the office of naval intelligence and remain  top secret for 38 years until declassified by  
the efforts of ufo researcher robert todd who  is able to obtain a copy using the freedom of  
information act so yeah definitely a significant  case case number 15 is blue book case number 1986  
which was also declared unidentified and this case  occurred on august 26 1952 at 12 10 a.m uh right  
over lathrop wells in nevada of course the main  witness is uh air force captain d.a woods and it's  
probably his uh credibility which really uh made  this case ending up to be un declared unidentified  
the fact that he was an air force pilot and what  he saw was one large very bright object with sort  
of a v-shaped contrail leading off of it and  it flew very quickly then stopped hovered made  
a 90 degree turn and followed by a gentle climb  and extra accelerated off very quickly into the  
distance now we move to case number 14. aliens  in casinos and believe me i know how this sounds  
but this is apparently a thing uh ets are seen  in public places i've seen this in many other  
states but it was particularly prevalent in  nevada and there were a smattering of cases  
in which people reported seeing ets in casinos  and the first case really surprised me but as i  
started encountering more of them i thought wow  you know this is a really interesting and unique   aspect to nevada's ufo encounters so i'd like to  cover a couple of these one of my favorite cases  
occurred in the mid 1980s i don't have the exact  date it comes from a great researcher who i've met  
many times her name is misha johnston and she's  a las vegas based ufo researcher and experiencer  
and she was approached by a gentleman who had  an incredible story it turned out he was uh  
worked in a casino he didn't name the actual  casino but it's his job to monitor the secret  
cameras situated throughout the casino uh to make  sure that people weren't cheating or stealing  
and so on and uh there was this incident that  occurred where these very strange figures  
were seen at a casino table and everyone was  monitoring this on the cameras they clustered  
around the cameras and were watching this  because these did not look like normal people  
there were two strange looking  people one was about five feet tall  
slightly larger perhaps than normal bald  heads dark eyes small nose and mouth  
they appeared to be wearing weird clothes white  tunics or robes and kind of were observing this  
game as it took place and no one seemed to  notice them that was another weird thing
so what really kind of tipped off the casino  security personnel was that these cameras that  
were observing them are all hidden behind  mirrors and are not visible from the casino  
itself or hidden cameras despite that one of  these figures at some point looked straight  
up into the camera the hidden camera so there  is apparently a video which exists of this  
however what's interesting is the security  personnel who was able to uh get out some uh  
footage from this got two still pictures  taken from this alleged video so it's a  
very interesting case and one of several  in which people have seen et's in casinos
another case involving the 18  casino occurred at the circus   circus casino it's a great case we've got  the name of the witness and everything it  
photographs the whole deal this occurred in  july 1990 to london native brian hampton he's  
a 47 year old professor of history who was  decided to visit las vegas in july of 1990  
and he went to uh las vegas and was had booked a  hotel at circus circus and it was actually outside  
the hotel on walking the strip and looking  at the neon lights and i was walking along  
a busy street just off the strip next to a casino  he saw two people two ladies looking up the sky  
and so he looked up to see what they were  observing and as he says there were in the   sky two round discs two ufos they bloody well  just hung there a few other people stopped  
and looked but nobody got excited i thought  these bloody yanks must have seen this before  
so he was really surprised and a bit confused  that this wasn't causing more excitement these  
objects were round gray in color with a dark  band around the edge and uh sort of a dark  
circle in the center they hovered closely  together almost directly overhead and he had  
his camera in his hand brian hampton did so he  took quickly snapped a photo at this point the  
objects began to turn white and he snapped a  second photo just as both objects disappeared  
so he was actually able to capture these things on  camera and here's where things go from strange to  
much stranger i mean this is bizarre he after  uh taking this picture he decided he would  
go to bed for the evening and uh it was this that  evening he went to his hotel room in circus circus  
and was undressing in his hotel room and  getting ready to go to bed when he heard   someone uh in the bathroom he first thought it  was children running down the hallway outside  
actually but realized it was coming from his  bathroom and the bathroom door was closed so  
he said who's ever in there come out now and uh  there was no answer so he slowly opened the door  
and uh the whoever was in the bathroom  slammed the door closed and i'll just quote  
brian hampton here directly as brian hampton says  i angrily pushed on the door and they pushed back  
with the door partly open once again i slid my  arm along the inside bathroom wall to turn on  
the light switch which i did but immediately they  turned the light back off and powerfully slammed  
the door now i was bloody well angry i got down  on the floor and braced my back against the closet  
wall my feet against the bath door and i kicked  it open this was a bad idea at this point he  
still thought he was dealing with children and he  could barely believe what happened next as he says  
when the door opened at least six dark gray  shielded things came jumping through the open door  
i know it sounds bloody crazy and i've  never told anybody but i know what i saw  
brian said that what he saw were actually  small gray-skinned figures with large heads  
wearing uniforms i says they looked very  much like the ets described by ed walters  
in the gulf breeze ufo case and as  brian hampton says and i'm quoting again  
they jumped on over and around me the last thing  i remember was a nasty musty smell that's it it  
all happened so fast i hardly knew what happened i  was blinded by a light and i must have blacked out  
when i woke up the next morning i was lying  on the floor next to the bathroom door  
so uh that is a very strange strange experience  and what's amazing about it is he has the  
photographs to back it up uh so i'm not sure  what to make of it other than this is apparently  
a thing you t's are visiting casinos uh there  is another case which actually comes from the  
national ufo reporting center reported anonymously  this occurred in 1990 a gentleman by i'll call him  
david uh he was traveling from new mexico to his  home in california and driving through las vegas  
he decided to stop for and do some gambling at  a casino so he went to the tropicana casino and  
was playing blackjack long into the night and  this is when he had a very strange experience  
and i'll just quote him directly because it's an  amazing account as the witness says i went to the  
restroom around 4 00 am and on my way back to the  tables i stopped and watched a peculiar individual  
walking up the stairs this person had a hat and  sunglasses on yet something wasn't right with  
the way he was walking or climbing the stairs it  looked like it looked like he was stuck in mud  
his knees sort of came out to the side as he  tried raising his feet to take the next step  
i noticed also that there were about three more  that looked just like him at the top of the stairs  
yet a bit taller they were all skinny tall and  i recall noticing their whitish like hair that  
seemed to shimmer as if light was bouncing off it  i had never seen hair like this before my reaction  
was what a freak well as soon as the witness  thought that the figure climbing the stairs  
slowly turned around and locked gazes with him  and the witness had the distinct impression that  
he had heard what he was thinking as if reading  his thoughts so he quickly returned to the table  
and didn't know what to make of it it wasn't  until years later that he read a similar account  
which actually comes from yet another  witness uh this next case comes from  
charles hall who actually made quite a splash when  he wrote about his encounters in a series of books  
he had encounters at nellis air force base while  he was stationed there as a weather officer   and said that he met tall white et's who he also  saw at casinos uh he visited casinos with them and  
they would wear wigs and sunglasses and hats and  a disguise to sort of disguise their appearance  
but were looked enough like us that they could  actually visit casinos firsthand so i don't know  
i mean these are the types of cases we're getting  i'm not sure what to make of them but there's  
enough of them that i think they deserve a second  look so now we're going to move to case number 13  
a physical evidence ufo case  this occurred on february 28  
1980 involved two anonymous gentlemen who were  traveling through nevada on their way to idaho  
uh they had a pickup truck which was filled  with all their belongings which they held in   place by tying a parachute over the flatbed  and they'd been driving for many hours they  
pulled over and got gas and always checked to  make sure that the parachute was still in place   which it was and around 10 pm on february 28th  they stopped along the road at a section near  
curry nevada this is just a tiny little  town with a population of about 20 people  
so a very remote area and it was a cold night  so they stayed inside of the cab of the truck  
while they started heating up some coffee  on a hot plate and as condensation began to  
obscure the windows that's when one of  them noticed shadows moving overhead so  
they cleared the windows and jumped out of the  truck and looked up and they saw this black   shape it was about about the size of a house they  said hovering only a hundred feet over their truck  
it was sort of oval in shape kind of like  a potato they said and uh yeah very low  
so they decided that they're going to take off  and get away from this thing and we're about  
to leave when they saw that their parachute on  their flathead had been quote torn to shreds  
the ropes and the nylon straps had  been either melted or broken so they  
secured it as best as they could with a stapler  and uh what resources they had and uh jumped back  
into their pickup truck and started the engine  to take off and they raced away and as they moved  
off this object followed them over their car and  their vehicle itself started to fail the engine  
coughed and sputtered and the speedometer and the  fuel gauge started malfunctioning and they could  
see that this object was still very low overhead  they coasted downhill as far as they could  
they tried they tried to switch to a second fuel  tank that they had but that also malfunctioned  
and a few moments later their engine suddenly  roared back to life and looking up they could see  
that this object was now gone they reported their  case to mufon the case was investigated officially  
by mufon field investigator cindy costello  and after she interviewed the witnesses she  
became absolutely convinced of their authenticity  so yeah a pretty exciting case uh which got  
a good deal of attention actually another case  that got even more attention is case number 12.  
and this case is very interesting and  somewhat unique and it involves a ufo  
that blocked the road not allowing two  witnesses to pass it occurred on june 25th 1964  
the two witnesses were george w rogers and his  brother burt rogers they were driving from their  
home in spring valley to the town of ely  nevada and at some point between the two towns  
they noticed a strange looking object ahead  of them it was hovering about four feet high  
alongside the road and uh they thought maybe  it was a car that had fallen off the road  
and as they drove alongside it this thing suddenly  rose up darted ahead and landed directly in front  
of them in the center of the road it was a had  a very strange shape it was sort of a bulged  
curved pyramid shaped top that tapered down  to a two foot long slender pedestal so not  
your average looking ufo uh they thought that  the pedestal looked like it was landing gear  
investigators later wondered if it could  have been a very strong opaque beam of light  
but the brothers thought it was composed of  shiny metal or plastic and the entire object was  
spinning rapidly but staying in the same exact  location they did notice a strange red insignia  
on the side of it but were unable to read  it because the object was spinning too fast  
so one of the witnesses george jumped out  of the car and ran up to actually touch  
this thing however as soon as he got close  it made a loud humming noise and zoomed  
10 feet up into the air and landed  back down 40 feet ahead on the highway  
so he ran ahead again and approached it  with and the same exact thing happened  
he did this another three times and each time  this object suddenly increased in noise and  
hopped ahead further on the highway as george  says and i'm quoting here it occurred to me that  
i was fooling around with something that i didn't  know anything about bert was yelling for me to get  
away from that thing i decided that was a pretty  good advice so i went back and got into the car  
at this point the object rose slowly and moved  east over a ridge and off into the distance  
they told newspaper reporters and this was  reported in the ely record on july 1st of that  
year and researcher frank edwards also wrote  about this case which yeah eventually became  
fairly well known and it's a very interesting case  and now we move to case number 11. this is a car  
lift case these are a very rare type of case in  which ufos lift cars off the highway nevada has  
i think three cases like this at least and this  is one of them it occurred on february 14 1974  
the witnesses were brothers both businessmen they  were driving a rented u-haul truck from idaho  
to california and we're heading through nevada  on highway 93 about 55 miles north of eli  
they were driving through the night so it was  about 4 15 a.m when one of the brothers who all  
called chuck he was driving he saw four luminous  blue-green objects kind of flying in a row at a  
very low elevation to the right of the highway  he turned to his brother and who was asleep and  
said wake up you know i think we're being followed  by a ufo and his brother who i'll just call dave  
he was asleep and didn't want to be disturbed he  said you're crazy no let me sleep and chuck didn't  
argue with him he still wasn't sure what he was  seeing but these objects continued to pace his   vehicle and after a few minutes one of them zoomed  forward about a mile ahead and crossed the road  
from right to left and hovered at an altitude  of about 10 feet right next to the highway  
as if waiting for them to approach so chuck again  woke his brother he says hurry wake up fast you  
have to see this so jake or dave woke up and look  he looked outside and could also see this object  
and as they approached this object which was  hovering to the left side of the highway now it  
suddenly turned into a bright orange luminous ball  and i'll just quote dave here says dave at that  
moment it felt like we had been hit by a blast of  wind or a force field it felt to me like a blast  
of wind hit the back of the truck and it felt  like it just picked it up and we were floating  
i was sitting there on the right hand side  of the seat watching him and he just kept   going like this with the truck and he couldn't  steer it he didn't have control of the truck  
uh chuck agrees he was driving he was  struggling to regain control of his  
of the truck and i'll just quote chuck here as  chuck says the only thing i can compare it with  
is if you take a curve or something on ice  how the truck sways from one side to the other  
this is how it felt to me but at the same  time the lights were flickering on and off  
the motor was missing and i was losing power i  kept my foot on the gas and i was losing power  
now i want to tell you that what it felt like  to me was was that i was actually floating  
it the truck was floating slightly  off the highway in the air none of  
the wheels were touching the highway uh  chuck's brother dave agrees as dave says  
the lights on the truck flickered on and off  and the engine started to miss he lost control   the truck and couldn't steer it i told him to  stop and before we could stop the transmission  
selector jumped out of drive into neutral and  we coasted to a stop at this point the orange  
ball of light disappears they get outside and  they inspect the undercarriage of the truck and  
the drive shaft was actually still spinning even  though the car was in neutral so that was weird  
they got back in the truck which was still running  and at this point they see another object a large  
silver colored object shaped like a ball but with  a dome on top and what looked like kind of sharp  
wings it was floating over a hill to their left  and at this point they saw another object an explo  
extremely brilliantly lit object and it was  landed ahead of them in the center of the road  
it covered the entire road it was just  this big luminous light enormous in size  
chuck turns to his brother and says what in  the hell is that and chuck says i don't know  
and uh uh this is perhaps you know they're playing  games with us and chuck definitely had the feeling  
that they were coming to get them and they became  very frightened uh so at some point dave jumps out  
of the car and starts approaching this object and  chuck's screaming no no get back in the truck and  
dave starts uh getting really scared uh because  he says and i'm quoting we felt that we were  
in a vacuum of some kind and isolated from the  rest of the world you felt like you were trapped  
in other words you couldn't go back i couldn't  go forward the truck wouldn't move we were just  
sitting there waiting for something to change  so this face-off lasted for just a few minutes  
and suddenly this object started turning  red sending off reddish beams of light  
and uh suddenly whooshed by them just  disappeared and none of the brothers could tell  
exactly how it left it just seemed  to suddenly disappear really quickly   they estimate that the entire encounter lasted a  full 20 minutes so it's a pretty major encounter  
uh the truck no longer worked the u-haul truck  uh they they were stranded on the highway uh so  
they had to call a mechanic and the mechanic was  amazed at what he found uh his investigators spoke  
with the mechanic and the mechanic told  them the back axle was twisted right off  
uh turned out that the drive shaft had been  welded into the rear end and when they tried to  
haul the truck away on a tow truck the rear wheels  just fell right off so that truck was completely  
torn up and these are really i think significant  and important physical effects and a very extreme  
case certainly which i think be classified as  a close encounter of the second kind so yeah  
now we're to the top ten and the case i chose  for number 10 is contactee truman bathroom  
it's an incredible case very controversial  truman bathroom was a highway maintenance worker  
in nevada he was working in the mormon mesa area  and on july 27 1952 he was working the night shift  
decided to take a break and was driving around  a very remote and deserted area of mormon mesa  
pulled over to take a nap and when  he woke up he was surprised to   see 10 short men surrounding his car they  were wearing jumpsuits had dark olive skin  
he jumps out and can see that there's  this 300 foot craft a disc metal  
sitting on the road next to him so these  men invite him aboard the craft he says  
on board he met the pilot she  introduced herself as aura reigns  
she's she was wearing uh bathroom says a black  bodice a black velvet bodice a red pleated skirt  
and a beret and uh he says the inside of the craft  was brightly lit and the captain aura proceeded to  
talk a little bit about the ship so that they  had others like then uh he asked if they were  
from a foreign country and she said no we're  interplanetary and we're visiting the earth  
and it was just a very short meeting she said  we have to end it now but we will meet you again  
and according to truman over the next three  months he had a total of 11 contacts always  
in the same area the desert area outside mormon  mesa and he was taken on board and would always  
have these short discussions he never got a ride  on board the craft he asked but they refused  
and the craft always remained landed but he did  get a bunch of information from aura reigns she  
told him that they come from a planet by the name  of clarion which was located quote behind the moon  
and they talked about other planets in  our solar system and claimed that they   were habitable this is something we've heard  from other contactees which is strange because  
according to nasa and all our space probes this  is not the case the planets are not inhabitable  
so that's a strange detail that turns up  in these early contact e cases and this and  
other details led a lot of researchers  to just completely dismiss this case  
others stand by truman and believe that there  is some authenticity to it so it's definitely  
a controversial case became very popular uh  truman bathroom did provide one piece of physical  
evidence a note which was allegedly written  by aura reigns leonard stringfield researcher  
leonard shrinkfield met truman bethram at a party  and asked about the note and if it could possibly  
be chemically analyzed and truman evaded the  question so he wasn't particularly impressed  
but other researchers were as i said  researchers bryant and helen reeves  
they wrote a book about their investigations  flying saucer pilgrimage they went across the  
united states meeting directly face to face with  various contactees including true and bathroom  
and they were very impressed with his uh sincerity  and i'll just quote what they said about truman's  
case as uh they wrote we cannot of course directly  verify mr bathroom's experiences because we were  
not present all we can do is convey to you our own  impressions of the man and his experiences as we  
discussed them with him we were favorably and very  deeply impressed with mr bathroom's unimaginative  
sincerity knowing the man as we do may we state  that we still regard his experiences as some of  
the greatest contributions in the entire saucer  saga so yeah they were convinced truman told them  
that the book had was ghost written and some  of the details were not translated correctly  
the author that he chose he says unfortunately  dramatized some of the incidents played up sort  
of a romantic angle between him and  the pilot which was not true at all  
so these and other details are what some of the  skeptical researchers latched on to sort of point  
towards this case being a hoax which truman has  always denied and there's never been any proof  
to prove that he's been hoaxing this so i'm a  bit on the fence about this case i've got the  
book i've read several times i do find it's got  some very interesting details to it i picked this  
case because it was widely influential he was very  popular he was just one of a handful of contactees  
of the 1950s who sort of also  ushered in the modern age of ufos  
so for that reason alone i think it's an  important case now we move to number nine  
the case i chose for number nine is another  blue book unidentified case this one occurred  
at 3 40 p.m on july 24th 1952 over carson sink  nevada and the main witnesses were both air  
force colonels there was air force lieutenant  colonel john mcginn and colonel john r barton  
they were both piloting a b-25 aircraft  over carson sink at an elevation of 11  
500 feet when suddenly they both spotted three  strange aircraft ahead of them and to the right  
and these are both command pilots  trained in aircraft recognition and  
at first they assumed that they were looking  at f-86 fighters which were brand new  
but these craft were in a strange v formation and  were flying much higher than regulations allowed  
and their b25 was on a course that would take  them much closer to the objects and as they  
approached they could see that these clearly were  not fighter jets instead they appeared to be quote  
bright silver delta wing craft with no details  and no pilot's canopy and it started to get  
much stranger not only did they appear weird they  were moving very strangely as they watched these  
objects suddenly turned to the left and approached  their own aircraft to within 800 yards about 2500  
feet this is very very close for two aircraft and  after about four seconds these craft darted away  
at super high speeds at least four  times the speed of a jet they estimated   somewhere in excess of a thousand miles per  hour so after they landed both mcginn and barton  
reported their sighting to air force officials and  because of their high level of rank and training  
their sighting drew quite a bit of interest  from the air technical intelligence command  
at wright-patterson the atic and  from the pentagon in washington  
the pilots told the investigators that  they had never seen any aircraft like this
an investigation followed and it was determined  that there were no other aircraft in the area   known aircraft there were no balloons or any type  of airborne devices and this particular sighting  
was actually only one of a more than a hundred  nationwide sightings on that day and at the time  
captain rupelt was heading project blue book and  he wrote about this case and he's he says maybe  
the colonels actually did see what they thought  they did a type of craft completely foreign to  
them so yeah this is an important case one of only  four in nevada that was declared unidentified by  
project blue book and a real great case and hard  to explain the case i chose for number eight is  
a very weird case uh probably should be more well  known than it is i think which is the contact of  
johnny sands johnny sands was a country musician  at the time still is and in mid january of 1976  
there had been a mini wave of sightings over  the city of las vegas where he was performing  
this occurred around you know eight to nine pm  a bunch of people saw a large cigar-shaped craft  
moving over the city and it was about two  hours later at 10 30 p.m when johnny sands  
uh was driving along the blue diamond  road returning to las vegas from pahrump  
uh when he first saw a very strange object  which she said looked like the goodyear blimp  
only it was longer it had flashing lights  and bullet shaped ends with a kind of darker  
donut-like ring around the fuselage he said  it was at least 60 feet long orange in color  
with portholes and uh was flashing  these red and white lights  
and he didn't pay much attention to it at first  until it started to follow him down the road  
and then his car engine started to sputter and  fail and he pulled over and parked to see what  
was wrong and as he was examining his engine this  craft came to a stop and hovered about a thousand  
feet over him and he's looking up at it and turns  back to his car and at this point he notices two  
figures approaching him two humanoid figures he  said that they were dressed in a black silvery  
overall type uniform with a white stripe  stretching diagonally from shoulder to hip  
and they had a white kind of patent leather  belt with all these multiple silver colored  
capsule shaped objects each about one inch  in diameter and they stood about five feet  
tall five feet seven inches he said uh they were  bald with no hair they had kind of squinty eyes  
and uh looked very strange they had kind of  pug noses very small mouths uh all a wrinkle  
wrinkly face and uh their mouths never opened uh  their hands appeared very much human-like as as  
sans told investigators the face was wrinkled  body wise he looked as fit as a 21 year old but  
in his face his facial structure something gave  me the idea this guy was 300 or 400 years old  
it was a very powerful face a very powerful set of  eyes he's not so ugly as he was powerful looking
so uh it a very strange conversation  followed the et's asked him all these  
very bizarre questions they wanted to know  why he was driving along this remote road  
and uh he explained that he was a performer  on his way to do a show and they asked him why  
all these people were clustered together living  together in one location in this city and he  
explained that the city was a tourist attraction  and that people liked to visit there and asked  
him how he communicated he didn't understand the  question which they kept asking him several times  
and they asked him other stuff  which he was was very reluctant to
to researchers uh they told him to not talk  about this meeting don't say anything and uh  
they told him that we we know who  you are and we will see you again  
though apparently this did not happen  this was his one and only encounter   he said that had a strange mechanical like quality  to their voice and it appeared as if their voice  
was not originating from them so much as it  was from an instrument attached to their body  
so he refused to release certain details  which he had been sworn to secrecy about  
this meeting was very short he said about 10  minutes at which point the et's walked back  
out into the desert after reaching a distance of  about 200 feet there was a bright flash of light  
and they disappeared as did the craft  that was hovering overhead so he called  
the police to report what happened to him the  police reformed him to nellis air force base  
and uh later investigators did call nellis and  confirmed that nellis confirmed that sans had  
in fact called them and had been interviewed by  an air force officer of special investigations  
jim and coral lorenzen heard about his case  and investigated it also timothy green beckley  
has done some really extensive interviews which  you can still find on youtube some face-to-face  
interviews with johnny sands so yeah it appears to  be a legit case very interesting he did take a lie  
detector test and according to the administrator  he was telling the truth and i'll just quote here  
from the administrator of the lie detector  test who says after careful examination of  
this subject's polygraph it's my opinion that  mr johnny sands was truthful in his answers  
to the above relevant questions i am not  attesting to the truthfulness of the whole  
story that mr sands has told only to the veracity  of his answers to the above relevant questions  
a very strange contact d case that i  think a lot of people haven't heard about   but very interesting to say the least so the  case i chose for number seven is fairly well  
known i think you may have heard of it it's  charles hall and his encounters with the tall  
whites charles hall was a usaf weatherman and  in uh march of 1965 he was assigned to nellis  
air force base as a weatherman at a location  outside kind of area 51 area indian springs nevada  
and uh started to have some ufo sightings  which were very disconcerting and somewhat  
frightening at first but he became more and  more comfortable as they continued to appear  
and the encounters became more and more dramatic  and closer to him and he eventually started having  
face-to-face encounters with these humanoid  figures who he described as tall whites he  
said that they were white-skinned beings  bald with large dark eyes wearing jumpsuits  
and when he first saw them he was  in denial that these could be ets   but after many months and many contacts over a  period of a couple of years he came to accept  
their presence and become more comfortable with  them and learn that he was apparently part of an  
experiment his superiors knew about the tall  whites and wanted to make contact with him  
so that's why why he was there he learned later  that there were a number of other officers  
who were put in the position he was and  they quit they left they couldn't handle it  
he was the only one who could handle it he was  in this position from march 1965 to may of 1967  
and had many many contacts with these tall  whites was eventually taken on board and had  
conversations with them it's a long fascinating  story uh way too detailed to go in depth here  
uh and the case is well known he's done the  lecture circuit he's written a series of books  
called millennial hospitality which he  initially published as sort of semi-fictional  
but now stands by them as truthful accounts  of his own experiences there in the nevada  
desert it's a very interesting story um he says as  i mentioned earlier that yeah sometimes these ets  
would actually uh leave the area and travel into  the city las vegas and actually go into casinos  
wearing disguises you know wearing wigs and wrap  around sunglasses to hide their eyes which did  
look unusual they said that they chose the nevada  area because it was very similar to their own  
environment where they originated it's a very  interesting case charles james hall has grabbed  
the attention of a lot of people in the ufo field  and has a pretty has had a pretty strong impact  
uh and it's never been proven a hoax and a lot of  people stand by him and he has really popularized  
the term tall whites so yeah very  interesting and significant case for sure  
and now we get to case number six which i  don't think is well known but it comes from   a great source leonard stringfield this is  about a landing at nellis air force base and
leonard stringfield published this in his first   series of status reports about ufo crash  retrievals and government encounters with ufos  
and he was able to uh interview an air force  sergeant who insisted on anonymity this air force  
sergeant was stationed at wright-patterson  in ohio he also interviewed a general  
who also worked at wright-patterson and according  to them according to the air force sergeant  
the sergeant was shown a top secret  document uh which was created  
by the general and it concerned a very interesting  incident in 1968 in which a ufo uh metallic craft  
actually landed at nellis air force base and  according to the sergeant this object had been  
seen hovering over the base for a period of three  days in a row three consecutive days and on the  
third day this large craft ejected uh some smaller  craft three smaller objects and one of these three  
craft actually landed on air force base grounds  and when the craft landed on the tarmac and stayed  
there a colonel was sent with an armed security  force to approach the craft and as they approached  
a humanoid creature emerged from the craft he was  described as short and stocky and at this point  
a beam of light was emitted from either the craft  or the being striking the colonel who immediately  
became motionless and paralyzed he said and the  next officer in command ordered the security  
troops to actually open fire at which  point all of their guns mysteriously jammed  
uh the colonel says that he saw a stream of  weird symbols and numbers equations and all  
kinds of information which was being kind  of telepathically beamed into him and after  
just a few moments this beam retracted uh the uh  being returned back to the craft which took off  
and returned to the mother ship as the  other little craft and the ufo left the  
colonel was traumatized and actually had to be  hospitalized though he reportedly fully recovered  
leonard stringfield was able to confirm the  identity of the sergeant and the colonel and  
as he says and i'm quoting obtained  additional corroborative information  
concerning the nellis afb incident so seems  to be a legit and important case and is one  
of several in which our own government has that  apparent of open official diplomatic relations  
with ets so this is the sort of incident that  really should have been disclosed immediately  
and our government should be transparent with  this and let us know that there is open official   contact going on with ets in military  circles uh clearly a very important case
the case i chose for number five is a very  important case which did not make the blue book  
unidentified list which is absolutely ludicrous  and in fact caused quite a bit of controversy  
within blue book this is a ufo landing outside  of tonapa nevada it occurred on november 23rd  
1957 to first lieutenant joseph f long he  was about 30 miles west of tonopah long  
was a member of the 97th fighter interceptor  squadron and had just completed his advanced  
survival school course at stead air force base  and he was driving back to his home in delaware  
when suddenly his car mysteriously stalled he  exited his vehicle at which point he could hear  
this high pitched whining noise and following the  source of the noise he was surprised to see four  
saucer-shaped objects landed on the ground  about 300 yards to the right of the highway  
so he could instantly see those were not normal  craft he walked towards them and got about 50 feet  
away from the closest object and as the official  usaf report on the incident reads and i'm quoting  
they were disc shaped emitting their own source  of light causing them to glow brightly they were  
equipped with a transparent dome in the center  of the top which was obviously not of the same  
material as the rest of the craft the entire  body of the objects emitted light they did  
not appear to be dark on the underside they  were equipped with three landing gears each  
that appeared hemispherical in shape about two  feet in diameter and of the same dark material
this report was written from the description of  officer long and according to long the objects  
were about 15 feet high each of them had a  dark rotating ring around the circumference  
he tried to approach closer at which  point the whining noise increased in pitch  
and the objects lifted up from the ground  but landing gear retracted into the craft  
the object rose to about 50 feet of altitude  and proceeded at a leisurely 10 miles per hour  
across the highway over some hills and  disappeared off into the distance so long  
went to the area where they had landed and  found several small impressions in the sand   where the landing gear had rested they were very  shallow and bowl shaped in a triangular pattern  
he drove directly to indian springs air force  base and officially reported his encounter  
his report was rooted to project blue book to  jay allen heineck and the other officers and  
according to jay allen heineck he felt like the  officers at project blue book were more worried  
about publicity from the case than investigating  the case itself and he said that the only reason  
they investigated the case was because and i'm  quoting the damage and embarrassment to the air  
force would be incalculable if this officer allied  himself with the host of flying saucer writers  
experts and others who provide the air force  with count countless charges and accusations  
in this instance as the matter now stands the air  force would have no effective rebuttal or evidence  
to disprove any unfounded charges so this was  one case that really started to wake up j allen  
hynek to the fact that blue book was not a true  investigative body but was in fact more interested  
in debunking cases focusing on cases with prosaic  explanations and trying to find a way out of cases  
that appeared to be legitimate or very dramatic  and in fact in this case they decided to look into  
the officer officer long's psychological  state and did a psychological profile  
on him seeing if there could be you know some  psychological reason for this report and uh  
they contacted a psychologist to examine him and  as the psycho psychologist wrote this is indeed an  
unusual report with one important exception it has  many of the characteristics of a deliberate hoax  
and reports of psychopathological cases this  exception was that it was made by an air force  
officer a pilot who presumably should be a most  competent observer on the basis of the evidence  
i can only offer conjectures on the nature of  the incident the psychologist wrote that quote  
there was the possibility of deliberate  hoax or it was possible that the officer  
was suffering from a temporary condition  such as sometimes been called road hypnosis  
brought on by excessive fatigue and loss of sleep  so clearly the officers at project blue book  
were fishing for a psychological explanation to  debunk this case and hynek vehemently disagreed  
with this and wrote that this was typical of  the air force to label an event is psychological  
while completely disregarding the evidence  as he writes and this is high neck talking  
what is so frustrating in these kinds of cases  and particularly in this case is the readiness  
with which a quote psychological explanation  was grasped without adequate justification
so yeah project blue book what a disaster   very interesting case and should be well known  and definitely one of my favorite cases in nevada  
and here's another one of my favorite cases and  it earned position number four this case involves  
ufos that observed a high altitude test flight  and in fact this was a record breaking test flight  
this was in 1962 when the air force was doing a  series of high-altitude flight tests using the  
x-15 aircraft the x-15 aircraft  is the highest altitude aircraft  
we have it can reach altitudes of over 350  000 feet it's also our fastest aircraft manned  
uh without any rockets uh and uh this  aircraft can reach speeds well in excess of  
4 000 miles per hour 4 500 miles per hour so  this was back in 1962 and we were setting records  
using this aircraft and according to a source  from leonard stringfield the first encounter  
during these fly altitude test flights occurred  on april 30th 1962 nasa pilot joseph a walker was  
launched from mud lake in nevada and was heading  towards edwards air force base in california  
he was climbing at a pitch of about 30 degrees  climbing in altitude and was at an altitude  
of about 200 000 feet when two disc shaped  objects appeared walker immediately radioed the  
control room at edwards air force base and said  quote two ufos just passed overhead according to  
leonard stringfield at least 20 people overheard  this radio message and when the pilot landed the  
aft fuselage camera was taken in for examination  and the footage turned out to be excellent and  
clearly showed two white silver discs flying  in tight formation and overtaking the x-15  
at about only a hundred maybe 200 feet over  his plane so they were kind of showing off  
i guess saying like yeah you think you can fly  high watch this so this is a fly you know so high  
up that clearly this could not have been any other  aircraft because the x-15 was the highest we could  
go so clearly not us and it was only a few months  later on july 17 1962 that there was a repeat  
performance again uh air force pilot major robert  white launched his x-15 from north delmar lake in  
nevada heading towards edwards air force base and  uh this was another world record altitude flight  
he reached a height of 314 000 feet when this  time a group of six disc shaped objects suddenly  
appeared in formation circling around his aircraft  white major white described the objects as being  
very much white like the color of paper and  they paced his aircraft for several moments  
he counted at least six but said there  could have been possibly as many as ten
so a very interesting case which remained  covered up except for the efforts of uh leonard  
stringfield so it's a really really remarkable  case and uh definitely one of the most important  
i think which occurred in nevada and now we get  to the top three and i'm sure you've heard of  
these cases but uh they're amazing and uh the top  three case that i chose is art bells ufo encounter  
art bell as i'm sure you know was a leading radio  broadcaster in fact had the leading radio show  
in the world midnight in the desert really neat  guy i was on a show twice before he passed away  
and uh he had always wanted to see a ufo in the  1990s his show was hugely popular it had like 15  
million listeners the most popular show in the  united states and in august of 1994 he and his  
wife ramona had their own personal encounter over  the nevada desert this was while he was driving  
from las vegas to per rump it was 11 30 p.m  it was a clear sky a nearly full moon and  
ramona noticed it first and a dark object coming  from behind them to the left and she blurts out  
what the hell is that and he stops the car and  they both stared in amazement as this huge dark  
triangle-shaped object floated overhead from south  east to northeast was moving at a slow leisurely  
pace much slower than a plane and appeared to  be at very low at an altitude of about 200 feet  
there was a white strobing light in  the front of the craft and two white  
lights uh on the rear that were not blinking it  was totally silent huge it says at least 150 feet  
long and moved so slowly it took about 10  minutes for this object to traverse the valley  
and at one point it sped up very quickly  and darted he said towards groom lake  
and area 51. and i'll just quote bell directly  here this is art bell talking as he says it was  
silent dead silent it did not appear to have an  engine maybe we have this kind of craft at area 51  
if we do that's a big story if it's not ours  then it's a big story either way it's a big story
uh artbell's wife ramona also uh  solves object as i said and as she says  
he always wants to see stuff like that but it  was one of those sites i could have really done  
without seeing for my whole lifetime uh  art bell was very deeply impressed by the  
sighting but he remains agnostic about what  it was you know whether it was ours or not  
so artbell was very impressed by his encounter he  knew he had seen something that was unknown he's  
not sure if it was military or not but as he says  and i'm quoting again it really doesn't matter  
that much to me if anyone believes me thousands  of people seeing the same thing cannot be wrong  
so yeah i think it's an important case simply  because art bell was so hugely hugely popular  
and influential and really got a lot of  people to recognize that the ufo phenomena  
is very real indeed so now  we move to case number two  
and it's an amazing case and i'm really  surprised it's not more well known than it is  
this is the las vegas ufo crash of april 18 1962.  this has never been proven to be a hoax and in  
fact there are thousands literally thousands  of witnesses to this and official air force  
documentation and confirmation it's an excellent  case and should be much more well known than it is  
this case began actually in the state of new york  in the town of onita new york numerous witnesses  
saw what they first thought was a meteor a bright  red fiery object moving eastward across the sky  
at very high altitude and it was immediately  tracked on radar which was confirmed by the air  
defense command who alerted military bases in the  area to check for this object and reportedly air  
force bases in kansas confirmed the object's  westward path soon other bases picked this up  
bases in montana new mexico utah and wyoming  also tracked this thing on radar and this thing  
was clearly not a meteor for a number of reasons  first of all it was moving on a very shallow  
gliding path getting lower and lower second its  speed was changing it was would move slower and  
then faster third it was changing directions  and moving in a random meandering zigzag pattern  
so this was clearly not a meteor and the air force  knew it from the very beginning uh because of  
these weird details uh due to the fact that it was  zig-zagging slowing down and moving in an incoming  
approach a very shallow gliding approach  and so they were tracking this from  
oh about a dozen air force bases including you  know as well idaho and california arizona and of  
course nevada uh two of two bases in particular  uh we're tracking this thing luke air force base  
in phoenix arizona and nellis air force base in  nevada they both uh launched jets jet interceptors  
to chase after this object so they were  again clearly convinced it was not a meteor  
and uh so they charted this thing moving in  this weird zigzag pattern across the entire us  
and by the time it had reached nevada  where it was apparently coming in for   some sort of crash landing uh it had  taken about a half hour 32 minutes  
so if this is true that meant its speed  was somewhere around 4 500 miles per hour  
now meteors move far far faster than  that so this is definitely not a meteor  
so if that's not enough there are at this point  hundreds and soon to be thousands of people  
witnesses across the united states who saw this  the first were in onita new york but people saw  
this all over the united states really became more  visible in utah uh the first people in utah to see  
it was were really the town of nephi nephi or  nephi nevada and uh one reputable witness was  
sheriff raymond jackson he heard a very loud roar  looked up and saw this object which he described  
as fiery and yellow white moved low overhead  and was sending off a series of explosions  
he said that these explosions were very loud  and actually caused had electromagnetic effects  
caused the entire town to black out  there was a city-wide power failure  
so many many witnesses saw this and they confirmed  the same details that this object was exploding  
some counted upwards of 20 or 30  of these explosions one witness  
is maurice mamat he said that this ufo was  so bright it lit up the surrounding area  
like daylight it was a very very bright light  and they kept their eyes on this object he and  
other witnesses near him one witnesses was dan  johnson and they said this object appeared to  
briefly land on the ground about six miles away  so yeah clearly not a meteor because this object  
did a controlled landing and then took off  again and after leaving the town of nephi  
it took off and headed over eureka which was about  30 miles to the west where more witnesses saw this  
at that time there was two witnesses  bob robinson and floyd evans they were   driving through the town and they watched it pass  overhead they said it was probably about 500 feet  
overhead and looked like a bright flaming  object at at first but as it got close they  
could see that this was actually a solid metallic  object and they could see portholes or square  
squarish windows on the side of this object  and as it passed low over their car their  
headlights dimmed and their car engine sputtered  and almost died so more electromagnetic effects  
so just a few miles away bob robinson's wife betty  she was in their home when suddenly she heard this  
loud roar in the interior of her house lit  up bright as daylight and this is what all  
the other witnesses described including eureka's  police chief chief joseph bermini he also saw it  
this thing this object was so bright that  the street lights in the town actually  
uh went out they became extinguished  because this they all thought it was  
daylight that's how bright this object was  so this object moved over the town of eureka  
and into the town of or into the  state of nevada and moved over reno  
at when it reached reno it turned southward  and it was spotted descending to the ground  
to the ground east of las vegas it appeared to  be like a huge flaming object and this is when  
thousands of people in las vegas saw this thing  thousands uh frank maggio described this object as  
a tremendous flaming sword crossing the sky making  a series of explosions disappearing east of the  
city and uh some witnesses could actually see this  thing as it slowed down or sped up and again radar  
stations were tracking this thing as it got lower  and lower and at some point it disappeared from  
their radar scopes it disappeared right outside of  the town of mesquite nevada this is the mesquite  
range about 70 miles south of reno and when it  disappeared from radar just a few moments later  
there was an enormous bright red white explosion  it was a huge huge explosion so this is a huge  
case the first investigator to really look into it  and do an investigation was frank edwards who was  
the leading ufo researcher at that time the author  of several books on ufos and frank as edwards  
was very well connected he had actually met the  president of the united states president roosevelt  
and had a really a lot of connections at high  levels and so he investigates this case and uh  
he became convinced it was in fact unusual and  got all kinds of confirmation and as frank edwards  
writes the glare was so intense that witnesses  said the streets of reno were lighted as though  
by a gigantic flash bulb the glare was reported  from five states and scientists in the area  
told newsmen that the flash was in their  opinion some form of atomic explosion
so uh there were other military officials  who saw this one was captain herman  
gordon shields who was flying a c 119 over utah  and actually came upon the actual crash site  
which he said was bright enough to light the  surrounding area and the terrain uh for miles  
around i said everything for the entire the  object itself was so bright you couldn't look  
at it and it lit up the ground for miles around  on he said it was quote bright as daylight  
so many many witnesses to this his report would  later be picked up by the air force and forwarded  
to project blue book there are people who reported  it to mufon as well one report comes from a civil  
air patrol field trip at carson city high school  this was a school bus traveling with about 12  
people students parents and a teacher they  were traveling southbound on u.s highway 95  
in nevada and the object was first cited on  the western horizon moving eastward across the  
sky it moved out of sight behind some hills it  was brilliantly lit and illuminated everything  
within the visible horizon and i was actually  bright enough like for daylight they said you  
could read a newspaper if you wanted  uh they heard no sound uh but did not  
think it was a meteor either because  it was there was no smoke no tail and  
this object was moving too slow it took about two  minutes or so to cross the duration of the sky  
and they've watched this object as it moved uh  behind the hills to the east and it got dark  
and it didn't see it anymore but about a minute  or two later there was an enormous bright flash  
so they apparently saw this thing at its  actual final crash site or the explosion rather  
they were concerned about a fire and they  actually went searching for this the next   day but we're not able to find any trace of  it because unknown to them it was actually  
much farther away than they saw thought uh this  thing was yeah in mesquite so meanwhile the clark  
county sheriff's office in this area was instantly  swamped with calls from people who had reported  
this explosion they sent out a search party they  conducted a ground search all night long and the  
next day looking for aircraft but were unable to  locate any evidence of this meanwhile reporters  
all across reno and other areas were trying to  get information on this incident so they called up  
nellis air force base and nellis air force base  was surprisingly transparent and forthcoming and  
said they released a short statement saying that  they had actually tracked this object and that it  
was not a meteor and later they released another  statement this was from lieutenant colonel herbert  
rolfe of the north american air defense command at  colorado springs in colorado they are responsible  
for tracking all the aircraft moving in and out  of the united states and he revealed that this  
object had in fact been observed and caught  on radar all the way from new york to nevada  
and that the radar readings revealed that it  could not have been a plane or a missile or a  
meteor or anything conventional so there was going  to be some real good confirmation of this incident  
so meanwhile reporters contacted uh stead  air force base and officials at stead air  
force base an air force spokesman there confirmed  the incident and i'll just let frank edwards uh  
say what he found out this is frank edwards uh  talking as he wrote the air force spokesman at  
stead air force base admitted that the object  had landed and that the power substation  
had not been in operation during the 42  minutes the object was on the ground near it  
he also told newsmen that the presence  of this object had not been admitted to   newsmen until the power station was in  operation again after the object left
so reporters were definitely on some real good  leads here they contacted the atomic energy  
commission who can made a statement to the media  that they had not conducted any nuclear tests  
in this area at that time so about two weeks  after this event on may 8th project blue book  
was commissioned to look into this event  and uh the head of project blue book at  
this time was major robert friend jaylen  heineck was a part of project blue book  
and uh they did a very cursory examination  of the evidence i just read a couple of  
eyewitness reports from some of the major military  witnesses or the more higher credible witnesses  
and did not even travel to the actual  location of the incident according to their  
report on the incident and this was actually  released by major c hart the air force public  
information officer the air force said that there  was quote insufficient data to reach a conclusion  
and that they believed the project the object  seen was probably quote a u2 or high level balloon  
now this is utterly ridiculous and researchers  have completely debunked this explanation  
there's no way it could have been a plane  due to the air force's own prior admission  
confession so here this is clearly a case of  them trying to backpedal and get get out of this  
situation they got the date of the incident  wrong they labeled it as two separate incidents  
they clearly bungled this very badly and  according to richard dolan one of several  
researchers who have looked into this incident  richard dolan says that their handling of this was  
so quote slippery and misleading that  intentional deception seems likely and uh  
yeah their explanation of a u2 or a  balloon he says is clearly not credible  
as he says all of the claims and suggestions  in this letter were entirely wrong a u2 is  
fast but not mach 7 fast and balloon as  an alternate explanation was nonsensical  
their respective movements and speed were totally  distinct so clearly not a balloon or a u2 uh  
and in fact uh contained in the blue book file  on this case is the report of douglas crouch  
the chief of criminal investigations at hill air  force base in utah his report he wrote preliminary  
analysis indicates that each of the observers  interviewed were logical mature persons and that  
each person was convinced that he had observed  some tangible object not identifiable as a balloon  
or conventional type aircraft the theory that  the object was a manned aircraft was abandoned  
due to the described shaped and colored flaming  tail of the object plus the fact that there were  
no reports of missing aircraft in the area no  unusual meteorological or astronomical conditions  
were present which would furnish an explanation  for the sighting no missile test firings  
are conducted in the immediate area other  than static tests the hypothesis that the  
object was a falling meteor is questioned  due to the flat trajectory of the object  
so you can see that there was a disagreement  among blue book officers themselves due to as to  
the nature of this object ultimately the blue book  official explanation was meteor totally ridiculous  
so yeah frank edwards was the first one to really  look into this he wrote an article for fate  
magazine which was published in august of that  year and he himself was frustrated by the complete  
lack of media coverage on this event initially  there was lots of newsmen who were interested  
but the story just died out very quickly and uh  he could not understand why this was not front  
page news this again seems to be a deliberate  cover-up and as frank edwards writes and again  
i'm quoting him directly here here was a case  where flustered officials confirmed that an  
object beyond their control had crossed most  of the united states had landed beside a power  
station which remained useless until the object  took off pursued by armed interceptors well under  
this pursuit the object had admittedly exploded  with a brilliance visible over five states quite  
a story but most people never heard of it for  the simple reason that the news services did not  
carry the report i recount the story here because  of its obvious importance both from the standpoint  
of what happened and because of the subsequent  disappearance of the story on a national  
basis another researcher to look into this case  is of course researcher kevin randall of roswell  
thane and major randall did a very thorough  investigation and was able to talk to several  
first-hand witnesses and despite being skeptical  of some of these other crash retrieval events  
uh major kevin randle says unequivocally  that this was not a conventional aircraft  
and he believes it was a craft from  another world flat out as he writes  
in his uh book on ufo crash retrievals and i'm  quoting here something extremely extraordinary  
happened on the night of april 18 1962 the  air force offered a series of explanations  
ignoring the facts but the witnesses  who were there know the truth they saw  
something from outer space and it was not  a meteor it was a craft from another world  
so yeah he was able to interview many people  who were involved in this incident and says he  
actually interviewed a person who was involved in  the recovery of this craft and according to his  
source following the crash he and 30 other people  were driving out to the location of the craft the  
next day they were loaded onto a bus with blacked  out windows they were all you know uh part of a  
team of crash retrieval air force agents and uh  one of the time windows according to the randall  
source had a tiny little peephole scratched out  of it and he could see this saucer-shaped craft  
through this little peephole which had apparently  crash-landed and was very badly damaged  
and these 30 witnesses were all let out you  know and uh given the task of retrieving  
this wreckage which was carried off to a secret  military base so here we have another witness  
from kevin randle who saw the actual crash site  itself but here's where the story goes dry and as  
frank edwards says it was just not published  really at all in the media it just dried up  
it's a very significant case and to this day no  one has been able to explain what this object was  
other than as an extraterrestrial craft many  investigators have looked into this incident  
as i said richard dolan was convinced this was a  real incident and as he writes this much is clear  
a ufo did crash or explode near las  vegas on the evening of april 18 1962  
and the air force hid the event from the public  and in its official records precisely what crashed  
remains unknown but the pursuit of the object by  u.s jets appears to preclude natural phenomenon  
or american experimental aircraft as the  explanation so that's the number two case  
and i think its spot is well earned and now  we move to the number one case in nevada  
i think some of you already know what what this  is and i'm sure all of you have heard of it   i'd say it's probably the most controversial and  complex case in nevada by far and this is area 51.  
it goes by many names it's called dreamland  paradise ranch the ranch skunk works  
groom lake watertown it's got nicknames for  the people who work there like out of town  
or nowhere uh the remote location uh the box  s4 so it goes by a number of different names  
it's a huge vast area north of las vegas  basically the nellis air force base complex and  
officially this base didn't exist for many years  i mean it was never talked about wasn't on the  
maps it was a no-fly zone for all civilian and  commercial aircraft and uh in the 1990s became  
this real sort of magnet for ufo buffs because  ufos were being seen so often coming in and out  
of this area what i found in my research for  ufos over nevada a book i wrote on this case  
or on all the cases in nevada is that a lot of the  ufo sightings originated or had something to do  
with area 51. many of the people who were seeing  ufos in nevada were seeing them on the outskirts  
of this vast bass area which is huge a lot of  people don't realize that the state of nevada is  
largely federally owned in fact 86 of the state is  federally owned that's more than any other state  
and the area of uh area 51 is so vast it would  take you days and days and days to drive around  
it uh so this is a very interesting twist i  think to the whole ufo situation in nevada  
and it makes the area 51 stories  so incredibly complex and amazing
so in the 1990s the area 51 story really began  in the late 1980s around 89 when physicist robert  
lazar went public with his story of working there  and being commissioned to uh examine about nine  
extraterrestrial craft and learn their propulsion  systems and he started bringing people to  
actually see these objects being  test flown in and around the base
so this really caused a lot of attention and uh  the area 51 story really exploded onto the scene  
and it became very controversial but the whole  story of course goes much back much farther than  
that officially the area the location was opened  in 1954 the vast dry lake bed of groom lake  
area 51 was established then and had at least 38  000 acres 39 000 acres and this is where the u2  
spy plane was developed the lockheed sr-71  blackbird and throughout the 1970s and 80s  
the b-2 stealth bomber and the f-117a nighthawk  fighter were both constructed and tested here  
so this is where we did a lot of our secret  aircraft work so by the mid-1980s aviation  
enthusiasts and ufo buffs were beginning to hike  up to this area to observe these strange craft  
and figure out what they were and uh rumors really  began to fly that this these were extraterrestrial  
craft when robert lazar went public with his story  he was worked there for about 15 months uh he was  
taken into the space in a bus with blacked out  windows and he saw all kinds of amazing things  
he says he got the job in december of 1987  after being approached by naval intelligence  
and they offered him the job to work there it  stemmed from lazar having met with edward teller  
earlier at los alamos in new mexico and so lazar  agreed to work there worked there for the next  
15 months and uh while at the base he was very  closely watched given physical examinations  
and given sodium pentathol and hypnotized and made  to drink weird liquids as all parts of security  
measures and he says he was charged with the duty  of reverse engineering the propulsion systems  
of various ufo craft that were being held at  area 51. he was shown books about the alien races  
shown photographs of their bodies and their craft  autopsy reports he was told an alternate history  
of the uh the human race from the viewpoint of  the et's who called uh humans containers and uh so  
it's a very interesting story which yeah you can  find a lot of information out in different areas  
reportedly the et's have been interfering with our  race for a long time and have made over 60 genetic  
corrections to the development of the human  race over a period of thousands of years  
and he saw nine separate et craft which  he said were clearly made for very small  
people because the chairs were really small  and he of course talks about element 115  
element 115 which is used to amplify gravity  waves which is how these craft are run  
that point element 115 was unknown we do now know  about that element and everything that lazar said  
is being confirmed presently at this time um  he was initially uh got a lot of uh i would  
say a not debunking but certainly attacks on his  character and uh on his story but before long lots  
of other people were coming out with very similar  information from what's going on at area 51.
so at some point lazar he left the base  no longer worked there it was too intense  
but he would take other people up in the  surrounding area and show them these ufos he said  
that were taking off and landing and being piloted  by humans and that there was reverse engineering  
he went public with his story and he really broke  the whole area 51 story wide open with the help of  
researchers john lear and especially george knapp  so he started bringing them up there and they  
observed ufos and this brought in a lot of other  witnesses and soon that became the thing to do  
is uh go up to the area surrounding  area 51 and look for ufos of course the  
air force started nabbing up more acreage around  the area making this harder and harder to do and  
it was too late at this point the area 51  story had exploded and people were flocking  
to this area in large numbers to see these ufos  and there was one ufo that appeared so often  
it was called old faithful it was very predictable   so george knapp grabs the bull by the horns and  publicizes the story and and breaks it wide open  
and started getting a lot of other witnesses he's  interviewed dozens of people who have confirmed  
his basically what bob lazar said as george knapp  says the story about alien technology in nevada  
did not begin with bob lazar nor does it end  with him he's interviewed many people who told  
him about wreckage being taken from to area 51  including the roswell craft and he spoke about  
more than 20 separate witnesses he's interviewed  who have contributed information about what's  
going on there uh one guy was in charge of video  documentation and he saw actual test flight of uh  
alien craft one was a biol biologist who was  his job was to test the alien tissue samples  
there was radar operators radar technicians  who confirmed that there are unknown objects  
zipping around at speeds of 7 000 miles per hour  george knapp was the researcher who really broke  
the area 51 story wide open but at this time other  whistleblowers were coming forward one went by  
the code name condor we now know his identity as  captain robert m collins and according to condor  
area 51 was the location of reverse engineering  of ufos but also he said that aliens and humans  
were working together live ets and that the  ets had made a secret treaty with the us  
government where the ets were allowed to sort  of conduct their operations meaning abductions  
and in exchange the u.s got advanced alien  technology and help in reverse engineering it  
so yeah according to researcher robert hastings  condor was the code name for captain robert m  
collins uh who went live on tv actually during  the ufo cover-up live television program  
and so reportedly he said that area 51 goes down  many many levels and that each succeeding story  
requires a higher security clearance  to enter and that the bottom levels are  
only accessible to those with the very  highest levels of security clearance  
and this is where you start to  find the et's working with humans
uh there was another researcher who was actually  an aviation researcher an aviation writer by the  
name of james goodall who started to get reports  from people in area 51 groom lake and he asked  
one employee flat out a 12 year long employee  if he believed in ufos and the employee replied  
absolutely they do exist and james goodall  asked would you please expand on that  
and his source was unable to said he's not  allowed but later did tell goodall that  
quote we have things in the nevada desert  which would make george lucas envious so  
good all knew other employees at the base and  was able to get little bits and pieces out   about what's going on out there he talked to  a chief master sergeant who served three tours  
at groom lake and this sergeant told goodall and  i'm quoting we have things out there that are  
literally out of this world better than star  trek or anything you can see in the movies  
researcher linda multenhal says that she  has interviewed some area 51 insiders  
including a retired military officer who told  her quote the alien technology is so advanced  
and the beings are so strange that no one would  believe it keeping the public and media away from  
what's really happening isn't difficult it's a  story no one wants to tell that no one knows how  
to tell the truth is stranger than fiction many  researchers have got information about area 51.  
colonel wendell stevens a very well respected  researcher is no exception he interviewed an  
area 51 security guard who went public derrick  hennessey who said the base had at least four  
levels that he knew of and that military personnel  were actually forbidden from entering the bottom  
two which were for ets only uh or mostly ets  he said that alien bodies and alien craft are  
definitely being held together there as well as  live extraterrestrials who actually live on the  
base uh he heard hennessy heard that scientists  had been unable to learn how to operate most  
of these craft and stevens was absolute colonel  wendell stevens was convinced by hennessey's story  
for a number of reasons including the fact  that he had already interviewed other area 51   insiders and had uncovered similar information and  got a lot of corroboration from derek hennessey
one area 51 insider has gone public   he he goes by the name bill you house i've talked  to him personally now he seemed very sincere to me  
and uh he says that he worked directly at area  51. he was a military mechanical design engineer  
uh who researched the flying craft at area 51.  he asked his superiors if he could talk publicly  
about his experiences and was actually given  permission he said which i find very interesting  
and according to u-house the humans yeah  were unable to fly most of these craft  
or really any of them but uh says that they were  able to reverse engineer some of the technology  
to improve our own craft he says he worked with  directly with gray aliens on at least 20 occasions  
to get the needed the data he needed to do his  own research as he says we took their avionics  
and transferred them to our science and  technology and used the avionics we know  
now you house says that the et that he usually  was matched up with went by the name of j-rod  
or as you house says i called him j-rod of course  that's what they called him the alien used to come  
in with dr edward teller and some of the other  guys occasionally to handle questions that maybe  
we'd have bill ewhaus describes j-rod as being  quote his skin was pinkish but a little bit rough  
that kind of stuff not horrible looking but to  me he wasn't horrible looking uh says that when  
he was there he worked on about two or three  dozen ufo craft of various sizes and feels  
that these craft were in fact now are being uh  piloted by humans who are taking them into space  
so we've been able to reverse engineer enough to  build our own ufos and are now flying them around  
is what you house is saying and there are a lot of  whistleblowers and a lot of researchers coming out  
bill hamilton is another  prominent researcher who has   written about ufos and he had an  abduction actually outside of area 51.
he's also interviewed area 51 insiders uh he  says that he interviewed a lady who says that  
she was actually abducted as a young child and as  an adult and was taken into the underground levels  
of area 51. the witness he spoke with said  that a number of women are taken there  
for hybridization projects and he  believes that the greys are acting  
under the control of reptilians and  the et's again are working alongside   humans to abduct women or experiment upon them  or at least this is what his witness told him
so he's interviewed a number of other witnesses  at area 51 including a radio technician   who saw a landed saucer on the ground said it  was about 20 30 feet wide and totally silent  
when it went through the air other witnesses  have gone public one appeared on the billy  
goodman radio show he explained that he was hired  on the base as an electrician and while there was  
taken to deep underground tunnels to work and  saw doctors in white lab coats transporting four  
little alien bodies on gurneys and afterwards  he was partially intimidated by security guards  
and threatened not to talk but this guy told   billy goodman that he knew of 50 other people  who worked at the base who were excited that  
lazar had gone public as they felt the public  had a right to know what was going on there
one alleged insider is the nephew of admiral  richard bird who is you know well known for  
playing over the arctic and the hollow earth  theory a very controversial figure for sure  
as is harley bird his nephew who claims  to have inside information about area 51  
harley bird says that he served the pentagon  in the late 1950s early 1960s and got a very  
high level uh secret clearance ultima 3  he says which gave him access to area 51  
and he believes there are seven levels to area  51 with the main the top level for transportation  
level two is for aliens and cryonics and uh  this is where he says et's are working along  
and you can workers there see et's walking around  hybrids as well but the bottom levels he says are  
much darker and this is where genetic experiments  go on mutilations and you know things like this  
um levels six and seven the lower levels  are where the grays and the ets are  
using uh doing genetic experiments  and trying to procreate their race
level seven he says is even worse and  this is where the uh reptilians are and  
he says he's pretty worried about them
and of course there's the series of books by  charles james hall the millennial hospitality  
series which i already mentioned he goes  into quite a bit of detail with the tall  
whites which seems to confirm that there's  weird activity going on in this area
to me one of the most interesting  whistleblowers coming out of area 51
was a colonel a colonel whose story actually  was written in the book rachel's eyes by helen  
littrell if you have not read this book rachel's  eyes i highly recommend it it's incredible  
helen littrell got involved in this  whole story when her daughter went to   school and had a roommate who turned  out apparently allegedly to be an  
e.t hybrid from area 51 who was being  taught how to live on the outside world  
and it's an incredible story and helen littrell  uh was able to meet this hybrid on one occasion  
her daughter who roommate was a roommate with her  was actually uh legally blind so it was able to  
work out where they lived together for a number  of months at any rate helen littrell also talked  
to the colonel who was trying to uh take this  hybrid into the outside world this hybrid girl  
rachel was brought back into the fold or wherever  they keep their hybrids there at area 51.  
but the amazing part of the story is what  the colonel who she calls colonel nadine  
told helen littrow he told helen that he  had joined the air force at a very early age  
and was assigned to the atic air technical  intelligence center and uh had no family  
a guy alone in the world his  security clearance was upgraded   until he found himself in the secret  military complex about 80 miles south of eli  
which is really the northern edge of the vast  area 51 complex he said most of the facility was  
underground and the purpose of it was to  retrieve the ets and ufos craft that were either  
landing on purpose or were being shot down by the  military and he says there were numerous craft  
which crashed or would just land there and they  would go and reconnaissance with them so it's  
an amazing amazing story which i won't get too  deeply into you should definitely read the book  
so there are many reports coming out of very 51  from various eyewitnesses little puzzle pieces  
everywhere here's a little uh case which  i don't think a lot of people have heard  
this comes from an anonymous witness who reported  her experience to mufon she said that she and her  
husband were flying across the u.s in 1956 her  husband had a top secret clearance and they were  
flying to l.a los angeles and the plane was coming  in for a landing this is the middle of the night  
a moonlit night and her husband was asleep this is  no one else on the plane this is a deadhead flight  
and uh she realized looking out the  window that this was not an air terminal  
this was not any airport she recognized it  looked like some sort of army base perhaps  
area 51 is what she now speculates because  of what she saw she saw that this was a large  
complex with many hangers and single storied  buildings and she saw one of these hangers and  
it was wide open and i'll just let her describe  what she saw as she says that's when i saw the  
large hangar with its dart doors completely open  and all the lights on inside stood a saucer shaped  
disc that filled the center of the hanger it had  a clear dome on the center and stood on three legs  
various objects were attached protruding  out from the edge and underside   and the words united states air force were painted  on the top of the disk near the sausage edge  
i was shocked but completely fascinated  i didn't believe in ufos or saucers   but here was one about 150 feet here was one  about 150 to 200 yards from me in plain sight
she tried to wake up her husband  but uh he wouldn't wake up and
the stewardess refused to answer her  question when she asked where they landed  
and just said that they had to make  a quick drop off so they took off and   landed in los angeles when she got there she asked  her husband about it and he became very angry  
and warned her never to speak about it ever again  and that he was endangering her job or his job  
so she agreed and didn't speak about  it for over 50 years and kept silent  
but she finally went public and said that  this is what she saw so there's so many bits  
of information i mean there was that time somebody  called into the art bell show uh panicking he was  
this guy who claimed to have uh worked at area 51.  and uh i won't get too into the call it's a very  
famous call but what this guy uh said basically  is that what we think of as aliens are actually  
uh extra dimensional beings and uh  that they are not what they claim to be  
and that they have actually infiltrated  deep into our military especially at area 51  
and he claimed that all kinds of terrible natural  disasters are coming and that there's going to be  
a lot of really big changes coming up in our  future he was weeping during this entire call  
so lots of weird stuff going on at area 51 to say  the least and let me just close it with this kind  
of really really weird story which comes actually  from fate magazine fate magazine decided to do  
an experiment this was in february of 2003 and  they wrote a little article asking anyone that  
they knew to psychically any of their fans their  readers to psychically view area 51 and see what  
they could see see if they could uh you know  remote view it or have an out-of-body experience  
or get re-psychic compressions and the results  were truly amazing they really were they got  
a number of responses uh interestingly almost  all of them were a woman uh all you know no men  
uh but they all reported basically what these  whistleblowers have been reporting all along  
and it was really really interesting one  of the ladies catherine from virginia  
said the base was organized into four  main areas genetic experimentation   reverse engineering also food enhancement and the  other was hybridization they also did studies on  
art and culture and that there was a species known  as quote the ancient ones who resided in the lower  
lowest levels and they had the ability to do time  travel another lady phyllis from indiana said that  
they were doing experiments involving magnetics  and levitation and could actually make objects  
turn invisible and we're also doing experiments  with time travel another witness francis she said  
she could see the base in great detail  saw many hangers with large tunnels  
and uh that alien craft were would travel through  these tunnels to the lower levels of the base  
mary of arizona said that she had a  psychic impression of being inside  
very large cavernous rooms and she  saw what appeared to be intergalactic  
vehicles with a shimmery metallic sheen and that  the interior of the craft was kept very cool  
carol of michigan she reported back her  impressions as a professional clairvoyant  
and she saw some very interesting things she  saw people being transported to area 51 by buses  
and planes she saw many of these hangers held  craft she said the base is several levels deep  
and that each level is devoted to a different  area of research which is exactly what other  
whistleblowers have said she said level one is  really just admission administration and security  
level two was for alien encounters and  communications which is that's what uh admiral or  
uh admiral byrd's nephew had said so that's  interesting uh she said that level four was  
for medical experimentation level  six was experiments to make new  
substances and materials and level eights and  stuff uh she said levels eight through ten  
were for the much more secure stuff that  included germ warfare and things like this  
uh and she felt and this i found very interesting  because i had not heard this from any of the other  
whistleblowers she said that she felt some  of the employees at the base were actually  
genetically enhanced by the aliens themselves  so that i thought was very interesting uh  
so a number of reports let me just tell you  a couple of more patricia from new mexico she  
said that she could see the hangers on the base  and they held very shiny metallics silver ships  
she also saw gray ets walking through corridors  and she was traveling while out of body  
and she was very surprised to see  that the greys were actually aware   of her presence and did not like it they were  very hostile and resentful and did not want her  
you know getting this information out so that was  pretty interesting another witness was kathleen of  
vermont she had very similar impressions  she said that the base went many levels deep  
that there were gray et's there and she also  had the distinct impression that they could  
sense her and were watching her closely i'll just  quote kathleen directly she says they know that i  
and others are here there's anger malice  meanness and a frustrated inability to stop us  
so again she's verifying what the other witness  said that the greys were not happy that they   were being spied on by humans she said that  there was definitely hybridization going  
on there to make humans adaptable to  space travel she felt that innocent  
humans had actually been abducted and taken to the  base and had become victims of genetic experiments  
so that's interesting that's pretty much what  bill hamilton's first-hand witness had said  
uh she also sensed higher  level employees of the base   had been genetically altered and enhanced using  alien technology which is very interesting  
because that's what the other witness  the professional clairvoyant carol   had said so there's more confirmation that these  employees are being implanted in some way or  
altered another witness just one more is teresa  of nevada carson city nevada and she saw also that  
innocent citizens were being abducted and taken to  the base for medical and hybridization experiments  
uh she said that some of the employees of the  base work in close cooperation with the et's  
and have been given et technology to give them  a longer life so here we have again employees  
being physically altered as teresa says they have  been mated with robotic parts that perform vital  
functions until these people are nearly immortal  she says that mostly the space is devoted to  
hybridization and genetic experiments she thinks  to make people adaptable to life on other planets  
which is what we're seeing again so yeah that's  very cool the psych compressions of very 51.  
so i definitely believe that uh there's all  kinds of stuff going on at area 51. so more  
and more information continues to come out about  area 51 more evidence that it's real um some very  
exciting events happened in 1994 when george  washington washington university law professor  
and attorney jonathan turley decided to represent  a small group of about half a dozen area 51  
employees who were suffering very severe health  problems as a result of their time working at  
area 51. they claim to have been worked at area 51  and have been exposed to hazardous materials which  
were causing a wide variety of health ailments  and in one case at least death of the witness  
so turley agreed to take on  the case and soon realized he   had gotten himself in very hot water he  kept encountering obstacle after obstacle  
especially involving some  of these deceased workers   for months the air force told him he had no case  because the witnesses claimed to be working at  
area 51 and air force said that there was no  such place as area 51 that area 51 did not exist  
and so turley was able to obtain  evidence that area 51 did in fact exist  
and as soon as he did the government would take  the evidence and they would promptly classify it  
so at this point he realized what he was up  against and he decided if they were going to   play dirty so so would he so he threatened to  call forth another witness he had a witness at  
a russian embassy military attache who told turley  that he would be happy to disclose under oath what  
russian military intelligence had learned about  area 51. and incredibly this tactic seemed to  
work the air force relented and did officially  tell jonathan turley in regards to this case  
that there was quote an operating location near  groom lake where these plaintiffs were employed  
so the government of course had  an attorney lieutenant colonel   richard sarver and he was asked to comment  on the case but he said quote it would be  
wrong to address anything of substance there is an  answer but i can't give it to you it's classified  
so this case started to get a lot of attention  jonathan turley really you know took this case  
to the public to try to get some movement on it  and the air for air force as a result released  
an official statement actually admitting to the  existence of area 51 saying in part we do have  
facilities within the complex near the dry lake  bed of groom lake which are used for testing  
and training technologies operations and systems  critical to the effectiveness of the united states  
military forces specific activities conducted at  nellis cannot be discussed any further than that  
so it took four years for a ruling to come  out on this case it was in january of 1998  
and an appellate court protected the government  declaring that everything involved at the base  
was a state secret which include house  which includes how the base handles toxic  
materials the judge ruling on the case judge  pamela ann reimar wrote that the government  
may use the state's secrets privilege  to withhold a broad range of information  
accordingly if seemingly innocuous  information is part of a classified mosaic  
the state secrets privilege may be invoked to  bar its disclosure so the court found that the  
information surrounding this case was actually  so sensitive that they ended up classifying  
turley's entire office and all his files and  everything to do with that that he touched  
anyone even inspecting his office would be  charged with uh violating national security laws
so yeah that's the story of jonathan turling  what happened when he tried to tackle area 51.  
so yeah the judge ruled in favor  of the government on this case   she did order the environmental protection agency  to do an inspection but the judge ruled that  
following this inspection the results were not  to be publicly disclosed as long as an executive  
presidential order is passed exempting the  disclosure so all kinds of uh interesting  
tidbits come out you know september 20th 1999  president clinton uh actually renewed this  
executive order exempting the base for  environmental laws he first signed it in 1998.
so the whole area 51 is so bizarre because  at some point it has become a tourist  
attraction and the government the nevada  government latched on to this in may of 1995  
assemblyman roy nabors introduced  a bill to change the name of state  
route 375 to the extraterrestrial highway  apparently in a bid to gather more tourist  
attractions and it passed on april 18  1996 it passed and the highway is now  
named a 98 mile section of this highway  is named the extraterrestrial highway and  
even more recently there's more information  coming out with senator harry reid of nevada  
in 1993 after groom lake had been making  all sorts of land purchases uh senator reid  
was given a tour of the base and uh people were  really hopeful he would do some disclosures  
and when asked all his only comment was no  comment about what is going on at area 51  
but now he is making comments and a lot of really  interesting interesting information in which he  
appears to uh pretty much say that yeah ufos  are real and our government is working with them  
and it's time for them to disclose so hopefully  more information will be coming from his corner  
in 2013 president obama made history he was at  the kennedy center honors giving a tribute speech  
to shirley maclaine and during his speech  he actually mentioned area 51 as he says  
now when you become first president one of the  first questions that people ask you is what's  
really going on in area 51 when i want to know i'd  call shirley maclaine and later president obama  
made a comment on this and said i think i just  became the first president to ever publicly   mention area 51. how's that surely he i think  he knew exactly what he's doing i think he was  
trying to disclose in a way that he could do  without getting in trouble hard to say only he  
knows the area 51 is definitely nevada's biggest  story but as you can see it's not the only one  
so that's my list for the top 20 ufo stories  in nevada their sightings landings abductions  
crash retrievals the whole bit and as you can see  nevada has its own particular flavor of sightings  
and some famous some well-known and some i'm  guessing yeah you haven't heard of before and uh  
that's why i wanted to do this video because after  doing research on a number of different states  
each state has a really powerful contribution  to our understanding of the ufo phenomenon  
and nevada is right at the top  of the list there with how we   think about ufos so that's my presentation thanks  once again for listening and keep having fun
