TEN TRUE HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Feb 23, 2024

Summary:
Feb 23, 2024
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the UFO phenomenon is when people have direct face-to-face contact with humanoids. Sightings are undeniably interesting and add to our knowledge of the subject. But humanoid encounters are so close-up that they allow little chance for misperception. They also contain a lot more information. There are far more cases than most people realize. This video presents ten cases from across the world involving direct contact with humanoids of all kinds.

THE HUMAN ETS. On the morning of Jul 20, 1965, milkman Ramon Eduardo Pereyra was making deliveries in Quilmes, Argentina when he saw a strange craft land nearby. He exited his vehicle and hiked to the location. To his shock, he came upon a small craft with a man inside. Suddenly another man approached, ignored Ramon, entered the craft, which promptly took off.

THE INVASION OF AVEYRON. Starting around Jun of 1966, residents of a farmhouse in Aveyron, France began seeing glowing white spheres on their property. They also saw a tall cylindrical object landed nearby. The encounters continued, and on Jan 11, 1967, one member of the family chased a white sphere in his car, and came upon the cylindrical object which took off. Then he saw a saucer-shaped craft with two humanoids inside. The encounter affected him profoundly.

THE LITTLE GREEN SPACE PENGUINS. On the morning of Feb 14, 1967, Claude Edwards woke up to feed the cows on his farm in Tuscumbia, MO when he saw a saucer-shaped craft landed a short distance away. Small gray-green figures scurried around beneath it. As he approached, they went inside the craft. He threw a couple of rocks at it, but they hit some kind of forcefield. Shortly later, the craft took off, leaving behind strange landing traces.

THEY WERE NOT BEINGS LIKE US. On the evening of Apr 16, 1974, Mauro Bellingeri and his wife, Carla, were returning to their home in Casale, Italy when a saucer swooped down and hovered over their car. Looking up, they were amazed to see three or four humanoids in an illuminated transparent dome on top of the craft. When the figures turned to look at them, Carla fled in fear. Mauro watched as the UFO suddenly took off at high speed.

THE ALIENS IN THE ROAD. Trucker Maximiliano of Salamanca Spain never believed in UFOs. But all that changed on the night of Mar 21, 1974 when he came upon a landed UFO blocking the road. Another hovered overhead. As he watched, two humanoids emerged and pointed at him, then returned to their craft, which took off. He drove off in a panic. The next night he had another encounter along the same stretch of road. This time, the humanoids chased him.

ALIENS ON TOP OF THE HOSPITAL. On the night of May 7, 1974, Margaret K Roffe (a nurse’s aid) stepped out of the Veteran’s Hospital in Coatesville, PA where she worked when she saw a small silver saucer landing on the roof of the hospital. Next, three bald, big-headed, gray figures emerged. One looked down at her, and seeing her, they scrambled back into their craft, which took off at high speed.

THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME. On the evening of Feb 24, 1977, friends Lothar Schafler and Rudi Grutsch observed two glowing craft at Langenargen, Germany. The craft disappeared, but when they returned home, the UFOs came back, now much closer. Rudi was inside his home, but Lothar was outside when the craft shone down a beam of light. Suddenly he saw two small humanoids right next to him. He panicked and broke a window to get inside. He thinks he had missing time.

THE ALIEN IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT. One night in May 1977, an anonymous man was fishing along the Amose River in Amosen, Denmark when a saucer-shaped craft zoomed toward him and hovered overhead. He was amazed to see humanoid figures looking down at him. Then the craft sent down a cone-shaped beam of light, and the witness observed another humanoid in the beam. 

THREE DARK FIGURES. While driving home from the hospital in Temperanceville, VA, Marlene LaRose (a nurse) came upon a hovering craft along a remote highway near her home. Looking up, she saw three humanoid figures looking down at her. The craft was close enough that her headlights shone directly on it. She watched it for seven minutes after which it moved forward over her car and off into the distance.

THE JOSZA UFO LANDINGS. Throughout 1986, many people driving along a small stretch of road outside of Josza, Hungary reported seeing UFOs, being followed, and watching UFOs land in the fields. Then, on Jan 9, 1987, a highway worker came upon a landed craft and three short humanoids. One stood in a doorway, while the other two stood beneath the craft. The witness fled in fear. Meanwhile, the encounters continued.

These ten cases represent just a tiny fraction of the actual number of humanoid encounters taking place across our planet. With so many reported cases, it is undeniable that Earth is being visited by ETs of all kinds. It’s time for humanity to wake up to the fact that we are not alone.

Hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal thank you very much for
joining me I think I've got a really interesting episode for you today pretty long one I call this one 10 true
humanoid encounters as I'm sure you know by now I absolutely love those humanoid
cases they're super interesting they contain a lot of information about ETS
who they are where they come from why they're visiting our planet and these cases that I've chosen today
10 I chose because I think they have something unique to offer some really
interesting insights are particularly well verified and deserve to be more
well known these cases come from all over the world we got one from Argentina
some from across the United States and all across Europe Denmark Italy Spain
Hungary where else uh Germany and I think that's it but yeah quite a few
cases a lot of witnesses a whole lot of evidence of different kinds Landing
traces animal reactions electromagnetic effects physiological effects the whole
gamut and of course a wide variety of humanoids which I always find super
fascinating about a lot of cases to cover so let's just get started and the
first case I'd like to talk about today occurred back in the 1960s most more
specifically on July 20 1965 and I call this the human
ETS and I give it this title because there's some serious questions about whether or not these are ETS or
actually actual humans in a reverse engineered craft the primary witness in
in this case is a gentleman by the name of Ramon Edward Pereira he's a Milkman
he was on Route delivering milk in his milk truck on a cloudy morning around
800 a.m. on July 20 1965 when he had his encounter it began
when he noticed movement to his left it caught his eye and he saw what he first thought was a glowing parachute falling
from the sky and seeing that it was unusual he watched as it landed behind
some trees on a hill just a short distance away about 12200
ft so he became curious stopped his truck got out and actually walked
towards this area where this object seemed to have landed and sure enough it
did he came upon a small clearing and he saw that this parachute like object was
actually an egg shaped silver object resting on little Landing legs and was
very small he says it was about the size of a small car maybe 6 feet in diameter
the top half was composed of a transparent Dome the lower part was
shiny smooth silver there were absolutely no seams at all on it but he
did see what looked like holes or pipes or some sort of apparatus coming out of one side and inside the Dome he could
see two seats they were faced back to back and he saw what looked like a
little control panel which had a yellow and a green light in front of one of the
seats so curious he walked right up to this thing close enough to touch it and
looked inside and to his surprise he saw a man sitting perfectly still on one of
the seats he was facing the operate opposite direction from Ramon so he
couldn't see his face but he could could see that the man had a hood on his head
and at this point Ramon was tempted to touch the craft but seeing this other
person inside of it he decided not to touch out touch this craft out of he
said politeness but it was at this very moment that Ramon saw another man
walking very quickly towards him and the craft and this man when he first saw him
was about 100t away and to Ramone appeared to be angry now Ramon described
this person as being totally human looking with short blonde hair he was wearing a tight fitting gray plastic
like one piece suit with a hood short boots and a large belt in one hand he
was carrying some what looked to Ramone like a paper he saw what looked like a pair of binoculars draped around the
man's neck and a satchel with something inside of it on his side
so this guy walks right up to Ramon who says what's the
matter and the man did not answer and as Ramon watched the man lifted up sort of
this little cap on the clear Copa of The Craft entered inside of it closed it the
craft immediately Rose upward about 60 ft making a humming noise which Ramon
said sounded like a welder the craft itself glowed slightly and then darted
off at very high speed leaving Ramone actually speechless and astonished and a
little concerned as Ramone says I was a little upset as if to say I'm crazy I'm asleep
I'm Dreaming you're left with something weird which you can't incorporate right away well I turned around and walked
around rather bewildered what I saw baffled me now part of the reason for
this I think is that Ramon had always been skeptical of UFOs and even after
this experience he still wondered what he saw as he says I saw something real I
didn't see a flying saucer I don't believe in flying saucers but that was a rare thing that went down in the bush it
baffled me what came down on the mountain was something unusual that
Disturbed me so he was really confused by what he had seen as he said he had
real difficulty incorporating this into his belief system but he knew it was unusual so he went straight to the
police and reported it the police did investigate the incident and Ramon
believes they did find some unusual Landing traces but he could not confirm
this however the police did inform reporters who interviewed Ramon later
about his encounter a truly fascinating case I think you'll agree with some interesting
in insights into the UFO phenomena I find it fascinating that the witness himself wasn't ready to call these guys
ETS because they looked totally human and also interesting is he was not going
to go public he told the police and the story leaked out it's another reminder
that we don't hear about most cases but such an interesting case
because he was able to walk right up to this craft looked right inside of it he could have touched the darn thing he
didn't but wow what a fascinating case and now we go to the next one which
I call the invasion of Aon this occurred of course in Aon
France the date of the encounter is January 11 1967 that's actually the culmination of
a series of really interesting UFO sightings in this one particular area
which ended up on that day January 11 with a really interesting humanoid
encounter some very interesting details in this case this very complicated and
unusual case was researched by F lagard of the French publication lumier
Donan that means lights in the night and of course several other
researchers involves a series of events which began around the night of June 15
1966 when residents of a farmhouse in the area of Aon France observed multiple
unexplained spheres of light in the fields around their home now the first
to see them was the grandmother of the house she saw three of them darting around now she's looking at them she had
never heard of UFOs she's trying to figure out what they could be were they fires but they were moving around there
was no smoke she realized something very unusual was happening but she didn't have any explanation for it so she
called over her son-in-law who also saw them and to his surprise one of them
came right up to the house others were out in the field he started counting them he counted about six of them when
he first saw them they were off in the distance and he tried to explain them perhaps as tractor lights though they
clearly weren't and as he watched they started moving off towards this object
off in the distance which was a glowing sort of vertical shaped object quite
tall and he and his grandmother thought for a second it might be a tree on fire
because they could see little glowing appendages coming out of the side but these spheres these balls of light raced
to it and attached themselves to these little appendages so they were quite overwhelmed by this point just glad that
these balls of light were gone and off in the distance and they decided to just go to bed the grandmother said it
frightened her so badly that she went to bed fully clothed in case they returned
now at this point they still weren't thinking UFOs really at all as the main witness says I couldn't understand what
it was now there were repeated sightings of
this Apparently one before this and some after it but events came to a climax on
January 6 19 1967 and on that evening one of the
spars returned and actually followed the father he went outside and this sphere
was sort of tracking him uh he kept trying to run around the house and it
would block his way and then started following him as he says that their
thing followed me all along the path and as it was following him he considered
throwing a rock at had it but he decided that would be unwise as he didn't know what he was dealing with but he did get
inside and call his son who also saw it he told his grandmother but she's like
no I'm not looking outside she refused to look outside and his wife was so
frightened she was actually weeping with fear but meanwhile the son who was very
curious about all this looked outside and again saw this tall almost rocket
shaped object standing out in the field in the distance he called it the shell
and he could see that it was glowing this dark maroon red color he again saw
these weird appendages like branches on it very thin and he washes these glowing
white spheres which were not super large were again flying around and attaching
themselves to the little appendages on this object he also saw a beam of light
coming from the very tip of this object which was swinging around and actually
at one point hit their house and lit up the interior of the house completely as the witness says just as if it was broad
daylight and then suddenly it just faded away so events were still in progress
because the next night this thing was back again both the father and son saw
it this sort of tall vertical rocket-shaped cylinder object as they're
looking at it they sent their dogs toward it and the dogs took off approached the object at which point it
faded away but still things were going on because on January 11th another one of
these glowing white spheres was back the sun was in his car or actually he saw it
he jumped in his car and followed it down the road and it just kind of floated ahead of him and as he's
following this thing he came upon this same apparently the same this large vertical object now he's much closer he
could see that this thing was big about 40 feet tall and as he's watching it
trying to figure out what the heck it is suddenly this object rose up a little
bit releasing a cloud of sort of green blue steam it looked like said it then
tilted at a 45° angle and took off at high speed meanwhile this white sphere
was still in front of him right in front of him on the road and he continued to follow at a short distance when suddenly
his car engine died the Lights Went Out Of course he tried to restart his car
and it wouldn't work and as the witness says then I saw the saucer it was coming
down and it was it was this classic Flying Saucer though quite thin very
small he said it was red and color and it was really interesting because it had
these two small transparent domes on the top and each of these little tiny domes
was lit with green light they were kind of the shape of a bell jar or terrarium
but really small and as the witness says inside the two domes I saw two people
like human beings cosmonauts they wore overalls like an air Crew green trimmed
with white uh he could see that they wore helmets he couldn't get a good look at
their face but this object was hovering and pitching back and forth in sort of
this rocking motion this point he was unable to move he felt a sense of
paralysis he also felt an intense wave of heat coming from the object hitting
his face at this point a metal signpost near the object began to vibrate
violently back and forth at this point the witness also heard a soft Whistling
noise noise coming from this object and he watched this object
suddenly climb up to an altitude of about 150 ft then swooped down as if
falling in fact he thought it was going to crash but instead it stopped on a dime instantly about 6 to 10 ft above
the ground then began moving in this zigzagging motion and finally took off
towards the east and the witness says that as it accelerated away the saucer
like object became very bright yellow white this point his car started
normally and that was pretty much the end of this series of events but there
were some very bizarre and interesting After Effects because the witness noticed that after these encounters
particularly this one with the saucer he suffered really badly from first
insomnia but after that he began to suffer from excessive sleepiness and
would sleep almost the entire day for about two months that's he says about 20
hours he spent in bed and 4 hours awake so this really had a profound effect on
him physically and he said that on at least four occasions he woke up and was
totally unable to move kind of like sleep paralysis but he says he felt as
though he was Rising above his body and having an outof body experience erence
as he says it seemed to me as if I was floating above my
body so they were quite emotional about all of this they had a difficult time
explaining it all to researchers and events are a little bit garbled up in terms of a timeline but certainly an
amazing series of events involving a lot of witnesses I think there's a lot to learn
from this case it shows how people are absolutely astonished
and quite a bit frightened when they're confronted with something they've never even heard of I me they had no idea
about UFOs at all some very interesting types of evidence in this case with the
car engine stopping the blast of heat I was really fascinated by the main
Witnesses After Effects involving first insomnia and then really excessive
sleepiness and what appeared to be outof body experiences but a really fascinating
humanoid encounter that deserves to be much more wellknown and that's why I wanted to include it in this collection
and now we move to the next case which I call the little green space penguins and
I didn't make that up this is kind of how the witness described these ETS I suspect this was probably a uniform of
some kind you can make up your own mind about it it occurred on February 14 196
67 in tuscumia Missouri and it's a super
fascinating case very well verified and researched with Landing traces a witness
who is very reluctant to come forward and speak about it but wow some truly
interesting details in this one it was just before sunrise at 4 minutes before
7 a.m. again on February 14 1967 when farmer Claude Edwards then
aged 64 stepped out of his farmhouse in tuscumia
Missouri now it was already bright out even though the sun wasn't quite up and
he was carrying his feed bucket and making his way towards the barn and
looking over at his cows he noticed that they were all staring out into the field
just east of his barn and looking at where they were looking he immediately
noticed a strange object about 335 ft away from him and it was hovering
just a few feet above the ground this point it was partially obscured by trees
so we began to walk closer to get a better look he walked up to the barn
first and dropped off his bucket and then approached to about 180 ft of this
strange object and he got a good look at it now he could see that it was gray
green in color and looked to him almost like quote a giant
mushroom he had a fleeting thought that this might be a parachute that had come down on his property except he could now
see that it was resting on this very narrow column which came out from the
central underside of the object this column was about 1 and 1/2 ft wide and
extended all the way to the ground the object itself was Dome shaped and you
could now see several very bright right multicolored lights flashing around the
circumference of this Dome shaped object and as he says they were all the colors
of the rainbow so multicolored so he decides he's going to walk closer to this object and he gets
about 70 ft away and this is when he notices several very short figures
scarring around directly underneath this object he estimates they were about 3
and A2 feet tall sort of grayish green in color with wide bodies weird lever
likee arms very wide set eyes a weird protuberance where the nose and mouth
would be no visible legs that he could see and he said they almost looked like
quote a penguin not human with no visible
neck as Claude says quote the Little Critters or whatever they were he said
they began to enter this column and were disappearing very quickly from view so
now he's fully aware that something really unusual is in his field he said the craft quote looked just like a big
shell grayish green looking outfit and he noticed another very
interesting detail he said it was it was a smooth as silk there were no seams no
rivets of any kind just smooth texture and it was pretty big he estimates it
was about 18 ft in diameter 8T tall the central column again 1 and 1/2 ft wide
about 3 feet tall it wasn't making any sound at all these lights that were
around the circumference were quite large about one foot wide and spaced one foot from each other and as he got
closer he said that they were so bright it hurt his eyes to look at them as he
says they were so bright you couldn't see when you got up there so here's
where this account gets very interesting what Claude did is quite
unusual as he says in his own words and I quote I picked up two rocks pretty
good size one of them was I got up to about 30 ft of
it and it was sitting there kind of rocking slightly and I thought boy here
goes I'm going to knock a hole on that thing and see what the hell it is
he told one of the investigators of this case that he had the intention to quote
knock a hole in the thing and keep it on the ground so he approached to about 15
ft away at this point the sun is rising so he can see sunlight on this object
but as he approached within 15 feet something very unusual happened he came
upon an invisible force field that prevented him from approaching ing it any closer as Claude says in his own
words there it was I just walked up against a wall I couldn't see it at all
there was just a pressure so he stepped back a little bit and threw the first rock and as he says
quote I cut down on it and the Rock stopped along about 15 ft from it and
just hit the ground the next Rock I thought I would throw on top of it and it just hit something and
bounced so he was totally styed he just stood there and watched from the edge of this
force field getting as close as he could and he says the object then began
to rock back and forth it did this about six times and then started to rise and
as Claude says when it took off it just rocked back and forth and moved real
fast the left of that Ridge and disappeared in seconds the shaft was
pulled up into it as it took off the whole thing took over 5 minutes maybe 10
I never seen anything like it so after this object finally departed
Claude could now see that the ground where the object had rested was all dried up desiccated and there was a deep
impression in the soil and he also noticed that there was a small hole where the central column had touched the
ground later an investigator from AO the aerial phenomen a research organization
arrived and interviewed Cloud also Ted Phillips very well-known investigator
specializing in landing Trace cases he visited the location about 3 months
after the incident and interviewed Claude extensively though as Ted says
boy this guy didn't want to talk about it he didn't like talking about the event at first but became more
comfortable as we discussed the weather and world event so after warming up to the researcher
Claude finally got the whole pulled the whole story and then looking at the actual
Landing site Ted Phillips could easily discern these Landing traces and I'll
just quote Ted Phillips directly as he says the site was still quite visible
there was a 1 M slightly irregular Circle where the shaft had rested the
soil was extremely dehydrated in contrast with the surrounding soil there
was a depression 20 mm deep sloping to 30 mm at the central area in the center
there was an imprint oval in configuration 100 mm x 60 mm the imprint
extended vertically downward to a depth of 100 mm with an extension 25 mm long
the depth of the imprint shaft what I love about that case is the
very unusual description of the humanoids and the fact that the case was researched thoroughly by Ted Phillips
who is of course the expert on UFO landing Trace cases and he saw the
landing traces himself not too long after the encounter occurred so a really
fascinating and unusual case that deserves like all of these I think to be
more welln and now we move to another somewhat briefer case I call this next one they
were not beings like us this is what the witnesses felt to be true it occurred on
April 16 1974 at Casal moner Italy and I like
this case because it's got multiple Witnesses who saw UFO and humanoids very
close up so close up that there's really really no possibility of misperception
it was around 12:50 a.m. pretty much the middle of the night again on April 16
1974 as Morrow bellingeri and his wife Carla were returning to their home in
Casale monado Italy and they were just really close to their home about a fifth
of a mile their home was located at Santa Maria Del tempio which you can see
here and this is when they saw a strange object hovering in the sky now his wife
shouted out that it was getting lower and coming towards them cuz it was when
suddenly it stopped about 50 ft above the ground quite close to them at this
moment Morrow turned off the car and they both jumped out and looked up at
this thing now this craft was totally silent and not moving it was round
saucer shaped he noticed small red green and yellow lights flashing or moving around the
center and on top there was this transparent Dome or cockpit which was all lit up
inside they estimate the craft was about 30 ft in diameter now his wife Carla she
saw what looked like two dark Rings under the craft Marl said it looked
almost kind of like a tripod to him so perhaps these were Landing legs or
something but the craft was still up in the air and it was Morrow who noticed these
figures inside this Dome as he says you could see three or four individuals with
a helmet we distinctly saw human beings their helmets and anything up to their
mouth I cannot say that they were beings like us now they could see that the
helmets on these figures were gray it looked like they had a hose likee apparatus attached to them leading down
to the torso and this is when his wife Carla became so frightened she ran she
did not wait for the car she ran the rest of the distance home and it was at this point that the
figure that was closest to Morrow because they were sort of sitting in a row figure that was closest to him
turned and looked at him then turned back and then all three beings three or
four of them appeared to rotate in unison and it was at this point that
Morrow says Jets of fire were emitted from the base of the craft at the same
time the central portion with all the colored lights began to revolve very
rapidly the craft emitted a loud whistling sound and there was a huge blast of air as the craft accelerated
away at high speed so he quickly went back into the house and joined his family and Merl's
family said they did hear this strange sound but they assumed it was a plane
Morrow reported no After Effects but he did say quote I'm just a little shaken
and nervous now they did have a dog in the house which didn't react at all to
the presence of this object an important case for sure with multiple Witnesses
it's interesting that the dog did not react at all uh of course this does seem to
affect people really profoundly emotionally speaking with the wife becoming so frightened by the appearance
of this craft right over their car that she ended up running back inside but the husband didn't and he got
a very close look at these humanoid beings who he says he's convinced were
not humans like us but again humanoid seems like all these ETS are humanoid in
form and that speaks to what appears to be the case that the humanoid template
is universal because as it turns up again and again and again I think that's an important takeaway from cases like
these and now we move to another case one of my favorite in this little collection because it's quite extensive
a lot of witnesses and really unusual I call this one the aliens in the road it
occurred on March 21st 1974 near Salam Mona in Spain and the
main witness a young gentleman by the name of maximilan wow what an amazing series of sightings
he had involving a very very close-up encounter with humanoids it involves
Landing traces and as we shall see a series of events with multiple Witnesses
it got a lot of attention a lot of press attention and coverage in Spain and was
widely publicized in various UFO Publications but I'm not sure a lot of
people know about it and they really should because it's such an unusual case
this is definitely my favorite case of this Bunch or certainly one of them the
main witness is a young gentleman by the name of maximiliano eaus and I'll just call him Max Max
never really believed or thought much about UFOs he was a truck driver it was
around 2 A.M on March 21st 1974 that he was returning to his home
in lagonia near salaman Spain and this is when he saw a dazzling
bright light ahead of him on the road now his first thought that it was another truck heading towards him so he
kind of flashed his headlights at it but as he approached more closely he saw that this was actually an object sitting
stationary on the road about 600 ft ahead of him it said it looked he said
like a quote saucer P placed on top of a plate which was larger than the saucer
was round so kind of Saturn shaped you might say at any rate it was covering the
entire length of the road and this is when he noticed that Above This saucer
this landed craft about 60 feet away from him so closer than this other one
was another object hovering in the sky so there's two of these craft now and
he's watching both of them and this is when he saw two humanoid figures emerge
from The Craft on the road in front of them and one of them they were both
gesticulating and one of them actually pointed towards his truck both then
re-entered the craft which immediately took off the other craft that was up in
the sky and closer to Max remained motionless but now Max was thoroughly
spooked he took off and left the area now he did stop briefly to turn around
and see what was happening and he saw that one of these objects was Landing
again but he went home and he went straight to bed he told nobody he didn't eat dinner and he says he never actually
slept that night he was so amazed by what he saw the next morning he did tell
his girlfriend she begged him not to go out but he did and it was the next night
very next night he's again returning home this time it was around 11:30 p.m.
and he's reaching the same exact location and this time he saw three of
these silvery glowing objects again one was on the road blocking his way
covering the entire width of the road the other two were landed in the field
to his right and this time Max's car engine died he later told resarch res
Archer JJ Benitez that he really had no choice even if his car engine had not
failed he would have had to stop because there was no way he could get by this craft it was blocking the
road uh there was a lot of researchers who looked into this another was Vicente Rio Jill who after interviewing the
witness found him very credible but I'll just let maximiliano describe what he
saw next as he says in his own words I Switched Off the ignition because the
Lorry refused to go I got out of the cabin and saw four figures outside the
objects but I cannot say for sure whether they were already there or if they had just all lighted from the other
objects they came towards me and I ran away frightened I struck off across the
field running towards horo that's another town and as Max says they were
right behind me running faster than I could I was exhausted and I hid in a ditch
full of mud they passed within about 2 meters of my Hiding Place but didn't see me but I saw them go by they were very
tall about 2 m and had arms and legs but I didn't see their faces I didn't hear
any voices at all when I saw them disappear into the distance I returned to my Lori I remembered that I had left
the door open and now it was closed so maximiliano had the definite
impression that these beings were looking for him and he says he ran a full kilometer or two before finally
diving into that ditch and trying to hide from them and he had a distinct impression that they were looking for
him though he can't say for sure so he's now back at his truck he's wondering who
closed the door CU he left it open and he's climbing into his truck and this is when he saw these figures again and as
Max says they looked at me again they made signal with their arms and got
inside the three objects this point he did notice something in their hands
weird tools which he later speculated were some kind of shovel or something
because strange holes were found dug in the ground in this
area now he wanted to drive off and get out of there but he couldn't because his truck still wouldn't start even after
the objects were gone uh it turned out his battery was totally dead but he felt
relief as these objects took off with a loud Whistling noise and left the area he said the sound of these objects was
very loud so loud it almost deafened him so this time he did tell the police
the Civil guard were called in and they inspected the area and this is when they found some very interesting Landing
traces they found a weird hole in the ground uh later the soil was tested and
scientists believed it had been heated to at least one ,000 de and there was
apparently some evidence of radiation now Max got a lot of publicity
from all of this uh and didn't want to talk about it but reporters haunted him down but as he
says everything I have said is true and anyone who wants to believe me may do so
and those who don't want to are free not to I had no prior knowledge of such
things as these now I am recovered from it all and I have just one thing to say
if on that second night instead of being alone I had someone with me who had not
been afraid then I wouldn't have run away I'd have remained to see what would have
happened but events weren't over yet it was one month later on April 29 that Max
was with his girlfriend when they both heard a loud noise this was at midnight
they looked up and saw this bright glowing object about 2,000 to 3,000 ft
overhead and later in early may just a week or two later Max was driving with
his girlfriend and an uncle when a bright light appeared ahead of them and swooped down towards their car passing
it at such a low altitude they actually feared that it would collide with them
in fact Max's girlfriend broke into tears when she saw this thing coming
towards them at speed so max yeah he did talk to
researchers he didn't want to talk to reporters but they found out about his encounter hunted him down and his story
was widely published appearing in newspapers and in several UFO Publications a lot of researchers talked
to him later researcher anel Delo was able to locate other Witnesses who saw
strange lights on that same night as Max's first encounter in that same area
what's really interesting about this case is following this Max quit his job
as a truck driver and became a police officer and he was interviewed over and over again until he just got sick of
being interviewed in one of his final interviews he said about the ETS I don't
think they were waiting for me it was my turn as it could have been anyone else's
I think if I had stopped and not hidden I would have been caught I don't know if they would have hurt me maybe we would
have just started talking but he says the whole series of events and
especially that humanoid encounter scared him very badly as he said before
I did not know what fear was but now indeed I know what it is there's a lot
to learn from that case um I found it interesting that the ETS he described were basically human although he didn't
get a really really close up look at their face it's interesting that they
blocked the road not once but twice so I don't know if they were
expecting cars to come by or not but that's certainly what happened and I
find it interesting also that the witness was very reluctant to talk about it publicly and only did so after being
hounded by reporters which again speaks to the fact that most Witnesses are not
looking for any attention public fame or anything like this it's a very
well investigated case with Landing traces a lot of witnesses he clearly
telling the truth it's an amazing case and now we move to another one which I
find super fascinating for a number of reasons and I call this one aliens on
top of the hospital you heard me right this is a case where a UFO actually
landed on the roof of a hospital in Pennsyl pania this occurred on May 7th
1974 in Coatsville Pennsylvania the main witness is a nurse someone I think of
pretty high credibility who did allow her real name to be used though again
like most Witnesses very reluctant to talk to people feeling that she might be
ridiculed or disbelieved but she did go public the case was investigated by a professional
researcher and it's super fascinating because there are quite a few cases
where UFOs are hovering around or landing near hospitals as far as I know
this is the only one where a UFO landed on top of the hospital itself I wish I had more information
about this really unusual report which was investigated by respected researcher
George faucet and the main witness in this case is Margaret K Roth who is a nurse Aid
and at the time of her encounter in 1974 was working at the Coatsville
veterans hospital and this is where the encounter in fact occurred was around
9900 p.m. again on May 7 1974 she was standing outside of the
hospital when she heard this swishing sound coming from the trees surrounding
the building she looked up and there was this disc hovering at very very low
altitude right directly over the building itself and as Margaret says in her own words as I watched the disc
descended slowly down to the roof of building one which is four stories tall
the surrounding leaves were moving violently all the while and soon four silver colored legs eased slowly down
from the dis shaped craft to the roof so this was a classic Flying Saucer which
is landing on the roof of this Hospital now she wanted to run at this point but
watched in absolute disbelief as a door opened and a ramp
with steps came down from the disc to the roof and three humanoids came down
the ramp now she could see this all very clearly as the roof was well lit and as
Margaret says in her own words each creature walked to one of the jutting legs of the disc and appeared to be
examining it and at this point she could actually hear them talking audibly in a
voice that she said sounded quote hi squeaky like so many
birds but she is absolutely convinced that these beings were not human cuz she
got a good look at him as she says the being nearest the edge of the roof had a
very large elongated head grayish looking skin arms that extended well
below the knees and what looked like claws instead of fingers his legs
appeared rather short she said that the beings were bald she had the weird impression that they
were quite old one actually turned and looked at her as she was looking up at
him and as she says the one that saw me first must have said something to the
others because they moved to the steps and went slowly up them now moments
later the disc Rose from the roof again caus cusing the leaves on the trees to shake
violently and Margaret watched as this craft lifted up the stilt like legs
retracted into the craft the craft moved off into the trees and was gone but this
really shook her up and as Margaret says I told no one of what I saw because of a
fear of ridicule I knew they wouldn't believe me anyway most people will not
believe anything they do not see themselves I don't care if anyone believes me I know what I saw and I
still keep thinking about it so she remains absolutely convinced she saw
extraterrestrials from another planet and she says they must be far more
technically advanced than us or else they surely wouldn't be here so George
faucet who researched this case published it in The Saga UFO report in
the spring 1975 issue unfortunately the main witness Margaret
rth has passed away so we can't get any more information on this truly
fascinating case I really wish I could have interviewed this lady firsthand
because I've done a lot of research into cases involving healings and I really
wonder if that's why the UFO was there because there are quite a few cases with
UFOs not only over hospitals or next to them but people people reporting seeing
ETS inside hospitals just heard about another case just last week so yeah this
is definitely a thing I suspect that's what was going on here pure speculation
I can't prove it but given that there are so many cases around hospitals seems like a logical conclusion very hard to
say for sure and now we move to another very
interesting case somewhat brief but certainly fascinating I call this one
they were looking at me this occurred on February 24
1977 and I'll try to get the name of this town right langen naren Germany and
actually you know I said this is a briefcase it's actually quite complicated really it's got quite a few
Witnesses it does appear to involve missing time for one of the witnesses
it's so very very closeup encounter with quite unusual humanoids particularly
unusual in how they were dressed with their uniform but a super fascinating case
with a lot of interesting details and very well investigated this really amazing case was investigated primarily
by a researcher by the name of elbron Van ludger the main Witnesses are two
gentlemen one is loar schaffler a young Railway employee and
his friend Rudy grush a little older uh he works as an inkeeper it was on the
night of February 24 1977 they went together to a club in
Langan Naran this is off the coast of Lake Constance in
Germany and as they were returning home Rudy was exiting the car when lther
shouted out look what's up there there and this is when they both saw two
bright shining lights off in the distance over the lake at a height of about 300 ft loar exited the car and
watched and both of them could see that these lights were dazzlingly brilliant
and as Rudy said later I've never seen anything like them before he described
these as two oval objects which approached them quite quickly stopped in the sky about 1500 ft away
and hovered for a full 5 minutes all the while setting down these spotlights and
searching the ground as they got real close to the gentleman they both could hear the soft
whistling sound coming from the objects but they were so bright in fact they described it as quote brighter than the
sun it was immediately obvious to both of them that these weren't helicopters they did see other cars
driving by and the people inside these cars looking up up at the strange two objects both men were absolutely
speechless at what they saw but after about 5 minutes the objects blinked off
the men assumed that the encounter was over but really it had only just begun was now about 2:30 a.m. as loar
dropped Rudy off at the Inn he owned there's some confusion about time here uh Rudy owned an inn which is
called the wall deck Inn he went inside and was going upstairs when he turned
around and looked out the window because there was this bright bright light and he saw it was apparently the same two
objects now only about 450 ft away and 150 ft high and moving closer so Rudy
walked over to the window to get a closer look and this is when he suddenly realized he was paralyzed he couldn't
move whether this is from fear or something else he's not sure but he says he wanted to shout out to loar who was
still outside but Rudy says he couldn't speak either and all he could do was
think to himself it's impossible it's really impossible it's over us but he
could see loar who was now running around in the yard in a total panic
trying to hide from these lights behind various bushes in the front yard but he
couldn't find a good hiding place now Rudy did see a weird shadowy figure
somewhat close to where near loar was hiding behind one of these bushes but he
looked back up these objects and was astonished because they seemed to merge together apparently into one object it
was moments later that he heard glass breaking and loar screaming in
fear now Rudy he was still unable to move and fear swept through him and this
is when he suddenly found that the paralysis said broken and he dashed up
to his bedroom where he found his wife who had woken up because of the sound of breaking glass turned out their nextd
door neighbors also heard this breaking glass the burkards and Miss Burkhart called out to
them to call the police she didn't have a phone now back to loar he says that
right after he dropped off Rudy he also saw these strange craft approaching and
he was about to run to his car but became frightened when he saw that these two objects were merging into one so
he's trying to find place to hide he says he ran first to the back door of the inn and tried to get in but it was
locked so he ran to the main entrance but it was also locked and this is when
he's darting back and forth trying to hide in the bushes which is what Rudy
saw it was at this point that everything lit up bright as day and this absolutely
Ely terrified him so he decided to run to the next door neighbor house the
burkart's and as he reached their door he heard a strange weird whistling sound
felt a strong blast of air and turning around he got an incredible shock
because standing right next to him were two 4ot tall figures standing side by
side literally only 2 or 3 feet away although they looked humanoid he can
easily see their not human first of all they had perfectly round bald heads no
visible neck large slanted eyes just two little holes for a nose a round
fish-like mouth with thick lips and long arms that reached down almost to their
knees you also noticed that they had only four fingers but both were wearing
these strange green jumpsuits with what looked like a weird harleyquin like
collar he noticed that one was a few inches smaller than the other and this
small one was close enough to lothar that he could actually Reach Out And Touch it if he wanted to and as he says
I was looking at these people and they were looking at me finally I couldn't
stand it anymore because of the fear now he says they made no hostile gestures but he was absolutely panicked
with fear so this is when he ran towards the door screaming and trying to open it
but it was locked this is the neighbor's door and he thrust his fist through the
glass on the front door and opened the door from the inside and ran screaming
bloody murder into the house he didn't turn around he just ran inside and fell
to the floor and suddenly the bright light winked out this is when the birk
Hearts came downstairs and found loar on the floor his hand bleeding quite badly
they called the police the police arrived they actually confirmed that loar was not drunk they did a blood test
on him uh he was taken to the hospital to treat a cut on his hand and this case found its way to
investigators and this is when investigators learned that there were quite a few other Witnesses about 300 ft
away a lady by the name of Miss brel Meer woke up to hear a loud whistling sound sound and then a screaming sound
she looked outside and she could see a bright light in the sky which winked out a short time later there was another
witness Mr buger who lived less than a mile away he woke up thinking it was
morning because it was so bright outside but realized it was after midnight and
the light was coming from an incredibly bright object in the sky another witness
was Wilhelm Mir he lived about a mile away from the inn and he also saw a brilliant object in the sky he looked up
saw it was hovering still and watched as it darted away at a dizzying speed and
after that and hearing about all the other events he also recalled that earlier in the evening he had heard a
strange whistling sound of something flying overhead which actually was close enough
to his house to cause the windows to Rattle now there were many other people who didn't see anything but they did
hear loor screaming now lothar says he felt quite unwell the
next day he was not only emotionally shaken he was physically shaken he
actually vomited a few times it affected him quite profoundly he his the people who knew
him says he became less outgoing less cheerful he began suffering from
insomnia and bad nightmares uh and after going over and
over the incident he does believe he may have had about an hour of missing time
so he later went under regressive hypnosis but didn't really recall
anything new the only detail that was at all new was that he recalled this weird
feeling of being swept off his feet and then maybe being returned he's not
really sure but then turning around and this is when he saw these two figures standing right next to him what's
amazing about that case is here are these two gentlemen being chased by this
UFO one goes inside the little hotel in there and the other is outside and
that's where he has an encount his encounter which scares him so bad I mean he actually breaks a window to try to
get inside but what's so amazing is so many people in this area verified this
incident either seeing this UFO in the sky seeing the bright lights hearing the
main witness screaming in fear it's an extremely well verified case and quite
unusual it's a shame that the witness wasn't able to recall what happened during this alleged period of missing
time but certainly a very compelling
case and now we move to another one this is the briefcase I mentioned uh this one
occurred in Denmark I call this one the alien in the beam of light it's a pretty
interesting and very close-up case of a gentleman who saw a UFO multiple
humanoids this occurred one evening in May of 1977 near amosin this is in Western
Zealand Denmark it is a single witness case but it was professionally
investigated and has some really interesting details in it this next case
was investigated by the Danish UFO group sfoi uh which stands for the scan
Scandinavian UFO information now the witness is anonymous
and he was fishing for eel along the Amos Creek just west of the amamos s
road pictured here was shortly before midnight when looking up he saw a yellow
light approaching him in a jumping sort of zigzag
motion as he watched it crossed over the creek that he was fishing in and stopped
about 900 ft feet away from him and this was when he was amazed at what he saw a
typical Flying Saucer he said it was Flawless in its construction the bottom section was
black the top was sort of a medium dark gray the object was large about 40 to 45
ft in diameter and was just hovering there but as it hovered it did sort of wobble in a jerky Manner and as he
watched a row of brightly lit Port holes appeared on the upper
half at the same time a cone shaped beam of white orange light was emitted from
the bottom of the craft with the wide part of the cone facing up and the point
coming down to the ground about 152 ft above the ground it was then that the
witness noticed the dark silhouettes of two humanoid figures moving around
inside the craft you could see them only from the chest up but it totally fascinated him and he stared at them for
several moments when he suddenly noticed that third figure which was now actually levitating in the middle of the cone of
light coming from the bottom of the craft and he didn't see it come you know
from above or below was he just suddenly noticed it there but as he watched he saw that this figure was definitely
floating upwards and into the craft and in just a few seconds this
figure was inside the craft the cone of light slowly retracted the
Flying Saucer then began to move around the area heading towards the west and
moving away and as it did so the witness noticed that a ring of glowing white
light appeared around the edge of the craft and then it was gone so the entire sighting was quite brief about 5 minutes
the only strange effect noticed by the witness was an eerie silence during the time the craft was in view can only
imagine what it must be like to see a UFO that close up ETS looking down at
you this beam of light coming down an ET floating in the beam of light it's a
really super fascinating case I also find it interesting that so many people
report this Eerie silence when UFOs are around and certainly this witness did a
lot of details that we see in cases again and again and again and now we move to the the next
case which I call three dark figures this is a interesting case which
occurred in Temper Ville Virginia it is a single witness case who was driving
along a lonely Highway late at night when she had a very very closeup encounter with a UFO and humanoids quite
a few cases of people driving around late at night on a remote Highway when a UFO shows up not sure if that's
coincidence or not but given that this craft was that close to her car I have
to wonder a really credible witness in this case uh professionally investigated
by a field investigator from the mutual UFO Network so I think it's a totally
legit case again very little known and
deserves to be well known which is why I included it this next pretty brief casee
was researched by muon state section director Bob Graton and it involves a
nurse by the name of Marlene lose now at the time of her counter
Marlene age 36 was employed at the Northampton aquamac Memorial Hospital
near Temperance Ville and it was a clear night around 11:00 p.m. on November 9
1982 she was returning from work to her home and driving along Route
701 very close to the intersection of Route 692 as you can see here and just
as she was approaching the intersection she saw this green light hovering about
30 to 40 feet right above the field directly in front of her and as Marlene
says I didn't know what to think I thought at first it was some new helicopter or aircraft belonging to NASA
or the Air Force but she could see it clearly uh because there was a bright
moon on that night she could see this object had a gray silver surface which
was reflecting in the Moonlight and she saw this bright beam of light coming down from the craft and into the field
ahead of her she had the feeling it was searching for something and as she says
then I realized there was no loud noise you should hear from a helicopter or
aircraft and it sure wouldn't just stand in midair with a beam of light directed to
the ground now she could see that there was a green light on either side of the
craft and right next to it on the inner side were a pair of red lights and in
the lower center of the craft there was this transparent window or cockpit which
was brightly illuminated and as Marlene says in her own words as I was watching the the
lighted area I noticed three Dark Shadows moving about I was afraid but my
curiosity was greater and I had to stay there to see what it was going to do so
looking at these figures she could see that they were humanoid and form but were only visible from the waist up and
she was fascinated she just sat there in her car with her headlights almost shining on this object and just watched
it and as Marlin says a few seconds passed and the beam of light
disappeared the object then raised up to Treetop level and started moving slowly towards my car I just kept watching
finally it went right over the top of my car I was shaking when that thing went
over the bottom was black I couldn't see the sky because the object obstructed
the view it had a humming sound to it like a generator I stayed there and
watched it disappear in the woods behind me so Marlene had looked at the object
when she saw this object and again as it left and she says the entire sighting
lasted 7 minutes long she says her car engine was not affected in any way nor
was her radio which was on she didn't feel any strange effects at all but she
said she had never given much thought to UFOs but after that object moved off she
was absolutely convinced she had seen a genuine UFO and later reported her
sighting to muon and was it was again investigated by state section director
Bob greton seven minutes is a pretty long time to see a UFO that close up
it's a sh a shame she didn't get to see these figures more close up I wonder
about this case she heard a low buzzing sound coming from the craft but I wonder
if some of the are reverse engineered with uh human beings inside
of it but then again why would they Buzz her car like that it's curious either
way but as I said it certainly convinced the witness that she saw a genuine UFO
and until we can identify it as you know extraterrestrial or what have you it
remains a mystery and now we move to another
case and this one is super fascinating I love this case for a lot of reasons
because it involves so many witnesses this UFO that kept Landing over and over
again in the same exact spot where we know pretty much exactly where it is
some really compelling Landing traces great Witnesses I call this one the josa
UFO Landings this occurred over a period of months but the main humanite encounter
occurred on January 9 1987 again in josa Hungary and I think
you'll find this a super important and interesting case this last and final
very intriguing case was researched by Hungarian researcher karoli hargate it
involves multiple encounters the most interesting to me which involves
humanoids now the first of this series of events occurred on April 22nd
1986 when an ambulance driver and a delivery truck were both followed by a
huge glowing sphere as they drove from deis to haidu jog this is just a short
distance there were three people in the ambulance the driver his assistant and a
patient who had dislocated his arm and was being rushed to the hospital so they all saw it and this object had a rim
around the Center was somewhat Saturn shaped they could see two Flames being emitted out from either side of the
bottom of the craft but this thing it actually followed them right alongside the road for a good 15 minutes or so and
then as they watched came in for a landing and as it did they said this object was so bright it lit up the
countryside brighter than the sun itself brighter than daylight now they had to leave later as
the ambulance was returning the patient back to his home in josa the UFO
reappeared and again began to follow the ambulance so they slowed way down so did
the UFO they sped way up and so did the UFO it was deliberately clearly keeping
Pace with them now they wanted to get out and examine it but this is against the rules they had a patient with them
they're not allowed to leave the vehicle but they drove off and later they went
to where they had seen this UFO touchdown and they found something astonishing this is very wet ground very
moist but they found this area where the craft had landed and it was still
smoldering with flames the area all around it yeah was wet grass it did
notice that the area where it landed was not too far from some high tension
wires so that's the first incident and it was several months later one evening around 2:30 a.m. in late December
1986 when a road maintenance worker was driving along the same stretch of
highway when he saw this weird object parked in the middle of a remote
field he said it was shaped kind of like a trailer you could see that had Windows
All Along The Edge and the spot where this thing was
in the field was really close to the original counter about a half a mile away from where the ambulance drivers
had seen the landed UFO months earlier so he drove off and it wasn't
until he later was able to inspect the area that he realized no there's no trailer out there there's nothing out
there so he couldn't figure out what it was a few weeks later another witness
apparently saw the same object again landed there in the same spot but the most interesting encounter
occurred a little bit later January 9 1987 was late in the evening another
road maintenance worker was driving along the same exact route now he knew nothing about the previous sightings it
was around 2:30 a.m. and as he approached the spot of these previous UFO
Landings he saw what he first thought was a brilliantly lit Farmhouse now he
he knew the area well he knew there was no Farmhouse there so he slowed way down
and looked at the structure and he got an incredible shock because what he saw was absolutely he was sure of it a
genuine UFO he said it was disc shaped it had a row of round Port holes around the
perimeter eight or 10 of them each of these windows was emitting a
brilliantly bright but kind of a warm yellow colored light
there was a weird Center section which was flashing yellow light upwards every two to four
seconds now just below the windows in the center of the object the witness saw
an opening or doorway and he could actually see inside this object he saw this light colored
floor that was ramping up towards the center of the craft but his attention
was more attracted to two entities who were standing right outside the craft
and a third entity which was standing in the illuminated doorway each of these
was wearing dark overalls and they were quite short now the witness estimates that the door
itself was about four or 5T in height but the entities were much shorter
perhaps about 3 ft so realizing now that this was absolutely
unearthly his fear increased to the point where he was unable to just remain there observe and he drove off now he
wanted to return to inspect the site but the next day it snowed quite heavily and the snow continued for several days but
after it stopped snowing he returned to the site and he saw something
astonishing several hundred crows had gathered on the site exactly where this
craft had landed that was weird meanwhile more sightings continued there
was at least three other sightings in the area over the next few months but none involving
humanoids but this series of events certainly impressed the primary researcher coroli harate who writes the
sightings they reported to me are remarkable they are honest hardworking people with University degrees the
question arises how many such similar flying objects could be swarming our
skies if only a handful of people have seen so many of them in such a
comparatively small area and within a relatively short
time great question but I bet the answer is a lot so what a interesting series of
events that was perhaps these ETS were attracted to these high tension wires
because we do see a lot of cases where UFOs are hovering over high tension wires the theory is that they are
scooping up the electricity that's being lost and radiated from the these high
tension wires which by the way are not super efficient they're just scooping up
electricity that I believe is already being sort of emitted from these because
yeah it's not super efficient and we're not actually using that electricity so I wouldn't say that they're stealing it in
any way but using it in some manner because there's so so many cases like
that but interesting case because I mean we're dealing with ambulance drivers
people who are well educated a lot of witnesses a whole series of UFO
sightings really fascinating Landing traces but yeah that's the landing the
last case of this bunch and uh just goes to show there's a
lot going on and I really and I've said this so many times I really think we
don't hear about the vast majority of of these cases and that says a lot because we're
only getting a tiny piece of the puzzle here I think that we do have enough cases to provide a pretty clear picture
of what's going on but if the general public had any idea how common this is I
think it would change a lot of people's minds so I want to thank you once again
for watching I truly appreciate it and I hope you found it interesting and
perhaps even learned something but until next time keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth
don't trust our line governments they're not going to ever fully disclose I don't
think I think if we want to know the truth about UFO contact you have to look to the witnesses and that's why I do
this research so thank you once again I love you all and until next time keep
having fun bye for now.
