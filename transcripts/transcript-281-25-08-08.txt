ONBOARD AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT: FIVE FANTASTIC FIRSTHAND CASES
Aug 8, 2025

Summary:
Aug 8, 2025
<p>It is the closest of all UFO experiences: being taken onboard a craft. Cases like these 
represent the frontline of research. They contain more information than any other type of 
UFO encounter and offer the opportunity to answer the many questions that surround 
extraterrestrial contact, such as, who are these mysterious visitors to our planet, where 
do they come from, and why they are here. While some people remain skeptical that cases 
like these take place, the truth is that there are tens of thousands of reports, with 
indications that they may number in the millions. This video presents five particularly 
extensive and lesser-known onboard UFO encounters from across the world--cases which 
involve long interactions and conversations with extraterrestrials. Most of the cases 
involve multiple witnesses, each of who were given amazing information about the ETs 
and/or the future of our planet.</p>

<p><b>I HAVE NO FEAR</b>. On the <b>night of February 4, 1974</b>, a family of three was camping in a remote and isolated area of the vast Sonoran Desert in Mexico. In the middle of the night, they were awakened by a beeping noise but couldn’t locate the source. The next morning, the mother had the impression that a UFO had visited them in the night. Years passed, and they decided to explore the incident under hypnosis. Together, they recalled being taken onboard the craft by gray-type ETs. The father was given harrowing predictions about the future of humanity. The son recalled being shown strange alien symbols. The mother could only recall being led up to the craft. All four say that the strange encounter remains one of the most mysterious events of their lives.</p>

<p><b>I HAD A ROLE TO PLAY</b>. One <b>night in June of 1975</b>, a newly engaged couple were in Minong, Pennsylvania when they saw a UFO and experienced a period of missing time. They alerted their family who also saw the object. They flashed a light at it, and it flashed back and disappeared. Later, the couple realized that they had missing time and went under hypnosis. The woman recalled being taken onboard and meeting a glowing being face-to-face. He told her that the world was on the verge of catastrophe, and that she had a role to play in helping humanity. The man recalled only that the ETs were concerned for the world. Both say the encounter was benevolent.</p>

<p><b>MY WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSE CHANGED</b>. In <b>1975</b>, Frank Johnson of eastern Pennsylvania began meditating in the hopes of making contact with ETs. Immediately, he and his wife Alice experienced a series of close-up sightings outside their home. Then, one evening, the room lit up and the couple saw a UFO outside. The went outside and were suddenly pulled onboard the craft. They saw three human-looking figures in blue jumpsuits. The two were separated. The woman was given a physical exam and healed of a chronic medical condition. The husband held a long telepathic conversation with the ETs about astronomy, other dimensions and humanity. The two were then returned to their home. Later the woman had another missing time encounter.</p>

<p><b>OUR MISSION IS ONE OF PEACE</b>. On the <b>night of January 28, 1978</b>, a man was hiking near Lago Vichuquen, Chile when a massive saucer-shaped craft appeared overhead, struck him with a beam of light and pulled him into the craft. He was greeted by three human-looking figures wearing tan-jumpsuits. Frightened at first, the witness calmed down as the ETs explained that they just wanted to speak with him. A very long conversation ensued, during which the ETs answered all the man’s questions and offered volumes of information about themselves and the history and future of humanity.</p>

<p><b>A PURE LEARNING EXPERIENCE</b>. At <b>2am on July 1, 1996</b>, two men were driving near Coates, Minnesota when they heard a loud buzzing noise, and saw a glowing craft alongside the road. They stopped the car. One of the witnesses exited the car to take a closer look. The next thing they knew, hours had passed, they were approaching the next town, and it was morning. Later one of the witnesses went under hypnosis. He recalled being struck by a blue beam of light and pulled into the craft. He was greeted by two grays and a human-looking man. The ETs said that they had brought him onboard to teach him. The witness was shown many things and was told that he was part of their “plan” with humanity.</p>

<p>The importance of cases like these cannot be understated. The witnesses themselves have been deeply changed by their experiences, and the information they have been told firsthand by the ETs themselves has profound consequences for all humanity. the five cases presented here are just a tiny fraction of the true number of cases. The witnesses don’t have the luxury of disbelief. The question is not, are these cases taking place. The evidence speaks for itself. The question is, will humanity heed the advice given by the ETs?</p>

Aug 8, 2025
Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs 
and the Paranormal. I have a very special episode for you today. It's a nice long one all about 
onboard UFO encounters. This one is called, "Onboard an Extraterrestrial Craft. Five Fantastic
Firsthand Cases". I love this aspect of UFO encounters. I think it's the cutting edge of UFO 
research. It's cases like these that are absolutely undeniable. People could not possibly be 
misperceiving because they are actually inside these craft. The five cases I've chosen for you 
today are extraordinarily extensive. In every one of them, the witnesses received quite a bit of 
information. Some of them actually hold fairly long conversations with the ETs. And also of these 
five cases, three are multiple witness cases. And really, another one does have an outside witness. 
So, one technically is just a single witness case. 

These cases come from a wide variety of areas, including Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, 
Mexico, and Chile. I am very interested in these kinds of cases. I think they contain the most 
information. They answer a lot of the questions that surround this subject. Such as who are these 
ETs, where do they come from, and why are they here? And yeah, these cases are very very extensive 
and do involve a wide variety of extraterrestrial types. So, let's just get started. 

In the first case, I'd like to talk about I call I have no fear. This one occurred in <b>February 
4, 1974</b> in a remote area of Sonora, Mexico. This involves a family of three who were taken on 
board. It was initially shrouded in missing time, but after a hypnosis session, the details came 
back and it's quite an extraordinary case with some really profound revelations from the ETs. This 
case comes from Dr. Leo Sprinkle. It first appeared in his private publication, "The Proceedings
of the Rocky Mountain Contactee Conference". This case involves a family, a father, mother, and 
son. All of who shared an onboard encounter. They are
anonymous and are known only by their initials, RD, GD, and MD. 

For the purposes of this video, I will call them Roger, Mary, and David. David is the
son, and he was 13 years old at the time of this encounter. The three of them
were on vacation in Sonora, Mexico. And in <b>February of 1974</b>, they decided to
visit the remote and somewhat primitive Indian village called "El Dembboke". This
is located along the Gulf of California in the middle of the Sonorin Desert, which is quite vast. 
So, to get there, they left the town of Koborca and headed southwest towards this village. Then
began to drive through the back country. They drove throughout the day, and when night arrived, 
they found themselves in the middle of nowhere with the nearest ranch about 30 miles away. 
They were still quite some distance from this village. So, they parked their truck at the foot of 
a small rocky hill, cooked dinner over a campfire, and went to bed in the camper shell on the back of their pickup truck. It was about two hours later, again on the <b>night of February 4, 1974</b>, 
that something very strange happened to them. 

And I'll just quote the father, Roger, directly. As he says,
"We were jolted awake by beeping noises that sounded electronic. The noises were
clear and sharp about 1 second apart. We looked out of the windows to locate the
source of the noise. The night was clear and moonlit, but because of the heavy
desert brush, we could see only 40 or 50 ft. The beeping continued. So, Roger
wondered if this beeping noise was because he had forgotten to turn off the radio or the CB in his truck, but he
checked them and both were off. So, he wondered then if perhaps they weren't as isolated as he thought, and that there
might be some kind of relay station near their camp. He vowed to check the next morning, but throughout the night he
awoke a few times to still hear this strange beeping noise. Now the next
morning he and his son climbed up to the top of this small rocky hill, and there
was nothing visible for miles around them except the vast featureless Sonoran desert. Now, weirdly, as they ate
breakfast, Roger's wife, Mary, announced out of the blue that she felt as though that they
had perhaps been visited by a UFO that night. She had no reason to say that,
but later that morning, she began her menstruation cycle. This was sudden and
unexpected, and that was it. Or so they thought. But as Roger says, we sometimes wondered
about the strange events of that night in the desert. But how does one find answers to this type of question?

Had we been visited by UFOs? It was 5 and a half years later that Roger felt compelled to write to
researcher Leonard Stringfield and he asked him in his letter, "Do you ever hear about beeping noises in connection
with UFOs?" Stringfield requested a meeting with the family. And after meeting with them, he
suggested hypnotic regression. So they all agreed to give it a try. And under hypnosis, they remembered an onboard
experience. Roger recalled that all three of them woke up with a sense of anxiety. Then
without warning, four or five short figures appeared and began to walk around the back of their truck. As Roger
says, they were about 4 feet tall and dressed in space suits with helmets. One
of the figures places his face against the right side of the window. The face has slanted eyes. So this was under
hypnosis. And the next thing Roger recalled seeing under hypnosis was a blindingly bright light in front of him
slightly above the ground. Two of these little short figures are leading him by
his elbows towards this light. The next thing he knows he is underneath it. And
as Roger says, it is huge. The body of the craft is at least 15 feet above the
ground. The bottom is curved. Four legs arch down and support the craft.
Something is still at each elbow, guiding me. A stairway extends from the belly of the craft to the ground. We
walk towards it. 

Now, Roger was feeling some fear at this time, but the next
thing he knows, he's actually inside this craft, and all of his fear was gone. Again, as Roger says in his own
words, "I am walking up a curved stairway. I have been in the craft for
some time. For the first time, I experienced color. Everything is light
blue. Also, for the first time, I have lost my fear. I neither fear for myself
nor for my wife or son who are not with me. I must explain the blue. Everything
is made of a material that is solid but which is somewhat translucent. I'm
standing in a room. Everything is still blue. To my right, the structural ribs
of the craft come out of the floor and the wall and arch overhead. In the wall
is a rectangle of very dark blue about 2 feet by 3 feet. I think it is a star map
as I can see many yellow dots on it. By my left side is a desk attached to a
vertical wall. Before me is the fuzzy outline of a man about my size. I feel
that he is the commander of the craft. I have no fear of this man. I think of my
wife and son, but also have no fear for them. I am quite content to be here. 

So, at this point, Roger knew he was having a very strange experience and he stared at the star map and tried real hard to
memorize it. But he found that it all became a blur in his mind. It was at
this point that the commander of this craft gave Roger a message. As Roger
says, he doesn't actually speak to me, but I know what he is saying. The
picture he gives me mentally is indefinite black and white. The skyscrapers are all black. Behind them,
the sky is a brilliant white. I think no, I know it is an atomic explosion. I
think the place is New York, but I am not sure. The picture is a warning. So,
the figure continued to speak telepathically to Roger and as he says, "There is another message. The figure
tells me that my wife and I are handling our chore correctly. I think he means
about building the cabin and storing food there. So throughout this hypnosis session, Roger did experience lapses of awareness. The next thing he knew, he was back in this same room with the
commander again, trying to study the star map and remember it. 

He did recall seeing three stars on the left side with sort of tails trailing behind them. But
the commander then told him to forget the map as that was not why he was here.
He then showed him another unusual looking map which lay on the desk beside them. As Roger says, I feel that it has
been there all the time, and if I hadn't been looking at the star map, I would have noticed it. The map on the table is
one of the reasons for me being here. The commander is now beside me. We are
leaning over the desk, studying the map. He is now less fuzzy. He is wearing tight red pants. The rest of him is
still unclear. I recognize the region of the map. It is the eastern Mediterranean
area. There are two regions on the map that impress me. The fertile crescent
and north of the Black Sea. The map is strange. As I look at it one time, it is
very detailed with the names of each city, village, and mountain range and is in color. But as I look at it again, it is very plain with only the fertile crescent and the black sea outlined. It
is as though these are the important points he wants me to see. 

Roger did notice an X located at the extreme top
of the fertile crescent at which point the ET told him, quote, "An important
battle will be fought there." As Roger says, I am surprised because I think the
next battle in that region would be fought on one of the borders of Israel. The battle will trigger a later battle or catastrophe. When the first battle occurs, we should prepare. Then the
commander points to an area north of the Black Sea. On a river is a dot with a
dark circle around it and the word Kiev. The commander tells me that this is by
far the most dangerous place. I picture rockets coming from there, but that may
not be the true picture. I also picture an assassination. The commander says that bad things are
happening in Kiev and I must stop them. So, at this point, Roger protested and
told the man, quote, I know nothing of Russia and have absolutely no control
over what happens there. Per Roger, the man seemed to become irritated and told
him, "If the bad things are not stopped, a catastrophic war will occur." Roger
then asked when, and the man replied, "In six years." That is really all Roger
was able to recall. He woke up the next morning with no memory of the event other than that strange beeping noise.

Now, his wife Mary also went under hypnosis, and she could remember very little. Really, the only memory she was
able to bring back was standing alone under the craft and looking up at the open hatch. Now, their son, David, aged
13, did recall some impressions of the interior of the craft. He said he saw a
being with an abnormally long head, huge eyes, gray skin, about 4t tall. He also
recalled seeing a sort of crystalline device which he said showed him letters
that he felt he was supposed to learn. Now the catastrophic event that the ETs told Roger about that was supposed to
occur six years later was supposed to occur in 1980. Interestingly, the Iran Iraq conflict
escalated into outright war in September of 1980 and endured for almost eight
years, finally ending in August of 1988 with no clear winner, but the loss of
over a half million lives. Now, following this hypnosis session, Roger
and his family are really still left with more questions than answers. As Roger says, "Where my wife, my son, and I
actually taken on board a UFO that night in 1974, or did my son and I create for ourselves
the story? I have asked myself this question countless times." What an
amazing case that is. And you can see how profoundly it affected the witnesses for a very long time. I know there are
people who are skeptical that cases like these even take place, but the fact is
there are so many cases. It's not just one or two or 10 or 20 or even a hundred
or a thousand. It's closer to tens of thousands with good indications that there are millions of these kinds of
cases. And when there's a multiple witness case, it becomes even harder to deny. But you can see the witnesses
themselves struggled with this with what happened to them. And you can understand
why. If they themselves have a hard time understanding and processing an
experience like this, I think it's just as hard for people who haven't had that experience. This is why I like doing
this research because I think these cases are important. A lot of people out there are having these encounters and I
think the evidence for them is increasingly undeniable because here's
another case equally astonishing and also a multiple witness case. 

This is
another one you probably haven't heard before. I think most of the cases in this episode you probably haven't heard.
I would be surprised if you did, but this one is amazing. I call it I had a
role to play. This one occurred some evening in June of 1975
in Minong, Wisconsin. And yeah, a multiple in this case involving a young
newly engaged couple who had initially a missing time encounter started to have
flashbacks and did elect to go under hypnosis. Now, I know hypnosis is
controversial, but what's really interesting is these people are recalling essentially the same details
and done correctly, hypnosis has been shown to be able to accurately retrieve
people's memories. At any rate, I think you'll find this case quite interesting because once again, the witnesses did
receive some very compelling information from the ETSs themselves. It was a
wonderful day in June 1975 for Dennis Moroska and Karen Clinger. The young
couple was deeply in love and Dennis had just proposed to Karen. She of course accepted his proposal and they decided
to take a short drive around a small lake near Minong, Wisconsin that evening. And as they're driving around
this little lake, this is when they noticed that the moon was very low in the sky. But then suddenly without
warning it was gone. So this was very puzzling to them. As Karen says, there
was no cloud cover or anything. So we were very confused. We were like, "What
happened? Where did it go?" So they drove back to this cabin where they were
staying with Dennis's mother and a few other family members and friends. They then walked down to a small pier by the lake and this is when a UFO appeared. As Karen says, all of a sudden, something
that looked like a bright orange star zipped above the trees over our heads and began to dart around in diagonals
from one end of the horizon to the other like a falling leaf. This bright orange
star that was along the horizon of the trees on the other side of the lake zipped right to the top of our heads and
we looked up. There were two other identical objects that appeared. Her fianceé Dennis confirms this as he says,
"There was one star-like object. It was a little bit brighter than a star, kind of an orangey color that seemed to stand
out from the others a bit. I really didn't think anything of it at the time, but my focus kept going back and forth
to that particular object. And after a while, I noticed some odd things about it. I think the best way I could
describe the flight is like that of a dragonfly. would zip here, stop, zip
here, stop, zip, zip, zip, zip, real fast. And I was like, "What are we
watching?" I was fascinated by it. I just didn't want to stop looking at it. I was just glued to it. And we finally
started calling my folks down from the cabin so they could watch. So, they did that. And now, all six adults watched as
these objects moved closer and appeared larger and larger. All of them were
amazed to see what appeared to be a single object split into three and then
rejoin as one. At this point, one of the witnesses pulled out a high beam lantern
and flashed it four times at one of the objects which responded by flashing
exactly four beams of light onto the ground. So that impressed them. They flashed the lantern again in a certain
sequence and the craft returned the flashes in the same exact sequence. So
they realized at this point that they were seeing something very unusual. Dennis's mother in particular became
quite afraid, hysterical with fear, and started screaming, "They're going to kill us." As Dennis says, "My mother was
a little scared." By this time, we knew we were watching something that we had no explanation for. It was really
strange and definitely appeared to be intelligently controlled. After just a few minutes, the objects
move off behind some trees and were gone. The sighting they estimated lasted
about a half an hour. But as Karen says, "Then we went back in and drank a bottle
of wine. They talked about what they had seen, and everyone confirmed each other's testimony. They all described
seeing the exact same thing." Says Karen, "We looked around everywhere the
next day, but never found anything. So that was it." or so they thought. And as
time passed, they never gave much thought to the sighting other than it was unexplained. But as the years went
by, they did occasionally discuss it. And one thing that puzzled them was the apparent disappearance of the moon. They
knew it had been hanging low in the sky and then suddenly it was gone. And in fact, during the sighting with the rest
of their family, the moon had apparently already set. And the more they thought about this, the timeline just didn't
make sense. What happened to the time between when the moon was in the sky and when it was
gone? As Karen says, we figured it would take at least an hour and a half for the moon to set from the angle we saw it at
before it instantly disappeared. And so, at the very least, there was an hour of
time that elapsed where we were unaccounted for. When both of us finally discussed this two years ago, this was
1994, and realized what had happened, I felt almost nauseated at the thought of
it. It was around this time that Karen heard about the so-called Alagash abduction case investigated by Raymond
Fowler. He wrote a book about it. This occurred actually in June of 1975 in
Maine, the same time as Karen and Dennis's encounter. The Alagash case
involved four men who saw three objects on a rural lake in Upper Maine. They
also experienced about an hour of missing time. They also had shown a flashlight at the object. So hearing all
this, Karen was really struck by the similarities to her own encounter. As
Karen says, after first seeing this, I felt sick. I thought, oh my god, the
case has such eerie similarities to our story. And that's what prompted me to see a hypnotherapist. They reported
seeing the exact same things we did. Now, years later, she and Dennis had
divorced and they hadn't spoken for a year except to handle the custody of their child. But apparently, Dennis also
saw this same program about the Alaggash case. And the next time he saw his
ex-wife Karen, he brought up their encounter and asked her if she might consider hypnosis.
So they both agreed to contact the Center for UFO Studies and they were referred to a psychotherapist by the
name of David Clayton, PhD. He agreed to see them. They scheduled an
appointment and Dr. Clayton said he would hypnotize them. Dr. Clayton had
initially been very skeptical of such claims of onboard encounters, but he said that after the sessions, he became
much more convinced. Now, Dennis did originally insist upon being anonymous. He's a physics teacher at a big school.
He didn't want to discuss the experience publicly, but more recently, he has gone public. And under hypnosis, he recalled
that while driving around the lake, a very bright light shone down on their car. As Dennis says, we both got these
images of a grid-like pattern, almost a primitive type of structure, almost like a derigible or something. Now, Dennis
couldn't recall much other than that, but he was left with the sense that the encounter was benevolent in nature and
did involve a message of warning. Now, Karen is also a teacher under hypnosis.
She recalled that when this light hit her car, it was so intense. She thought she had actually fainted and going under
hypnosis was a huge turning point for her. It was very frightening for her and it took multiple sessions to remember
what happened. But as Karen says, there was a feeling of being enveloped by an intense white beam. I was facing a form
that had static electricity around it. I received messages telepathically of what
it was trying to convey. The message was that the world was on the verge of an
environmental catastrophe and I had a role to play in the rebuilding process.
They told me they weren't going to allow the people to destroy themselves. They told me to feel free to tell anyone I
wanted to tell about it, but to be forewarned that I would not be taken seriously, which generally happens to be
the case. So, that's all Karen really tells about what happened. She did share her experience with family members who
were understandably shocked. And as Karen says, "Whenever I've brought it up, my parents get funny looks on their
faces and they kind of get squirmy and try to change the subject right away. I
don't discuss it with them anymore because they're so judgmental about it. They're kind of like, "Aren't you taking
this kind of far?" So both Karen and Dennis agreed that the purpose of the encounter was not to hurt them but
actually to help humankind. Both came away from the experience with the same message that the fate of the planet is
intertwined with other alien worlds and that the people of Earth are not doing a good job taking care of Earth. Karen
does have some advice for other people who are going through this experience. As she says, "If you feel that this has
happened to you, by all means, do whatever it takes to uncover the information because it's worth the
risk." Karen hopes that by coming forward, it will encourage other people to share their own experiences with UFOs
and extraterrestrials. Now, if you wait to the end of this video, you can see Karen and Dennis tell
their story in their own words. There's a testimony at the very end of this
episode. So, if you get a chance, check that out. A really amazing case. And kudos to both the witnesses for having
the courage and strength to step forward because again, most don't. I do hope you
check out their firsthand interview at the end of this episode because it's really interesting to hear from the
witnesses firsthand. So, now let's move to the next case.
This one is really amazing. What I like about this case, it is a multiple
witness case involving a young married couple. And this one is also interesting
because they did not use hypnosis to recall their encounter. And it actually
happened as a result of doing C5 work. By C5, I mean they meditated to try to
reach out to the ETs and initiate an encounter. and it was wildly successful
beyond their wildest imagination. They absolutely were taken on board a
craft and their stories corroborate down to the tiniest detail and they actually
have proof that they were taken on board because the woman was suffering from a
medical condition that was chronic and was actually healed of her chronic
condition as we shall see. So I call this one my whole concept of the
universe changed. This occurred one evening in 1975 in Eastern Pennsylvania.
This case comes from researcher Eugeneia Mer story who published it in Pursuit
magazine volume 13 number four in the fall of 1980.
This case involves a couple from Pennsylvania who insist upon being anonymous. In fact, they had no
intention or interest in going public whatsoever, but were tracked down by
Eugenia, who heard about the case from a friend of the couple. Eugeneia has given
the couple the pseudonyms Frank and Alice Johnson. Now, technically, this
case is what we call a C5, a human initiated UFO encounter. The couple had
long been interested in psychic abilities and the paranormal. And one day in 1975,
Frank decided to see if he could use telepathy to call down UFOs and communicate with the ETSs. He had become
somewhat depressed with life and felt like he wanted to leave the earthly plane. So this was why he was doing
this. As Frank says, I wanted very much to make contact. I was very much into
astronomy at the time and studying the constellations. So he meditated and to the surprise of
them both, they began to see unexplained lights over the Mount J area. This is
probably Jack's Mountain. It's the only mountain in Pennsylvania beginning with a J. So this was not far from where they
had a small cottage house. And they'd see these lights and they would usually stay among the mountain peaks. And each
time Frank would rush out and try to contact them. As he says, I was seeing
lights once or twice a week over the highest peaks. I kept trying to make contact by flashlight every time I'd see
a UFO in the sky. Then one evening, the contact Frank had been seeking finally
occurred. As Frank says, I think we were in bed just about to fall asleep. All of
a sudden, we were compelled to go outside. It was very calm. I'd wanted to make contact and I wasn't nervous at
all. We saw a round luminous object up near the electric light pole and then we
just felt like we were sucked into it. We were definitely floated up towards the entrance to the ship. Now Alice
confirms her husband's testimony but actually adds a little more detail. She remembers that they suddenly sat up in
bed when the room filled with light. As Alice says, Frank was sitting beside me
and then we were up out of bed facing the door. I could see through the door the shadow of a figure about 6 ft tall.
Then the door was open and we were out on the porch. The ground was very white like snow. And on the road through the
trees, I could see a vehicle of some sort about the size of an average car.
They were picking up samples of rocks and stuff and putting them in containers. Then we saw a light over the
side of the house. We were lifted and somehow floating. I couldn't feel the sensation of somebody pulling me up
under the arms, but I just felt very light. As we were approaching the craft,
a circle of light seemed to open, and I knew that we were going in there. Now
later both Frank and Alice would consider the possibility that they had perhaps a shared out-of- body
experience. But some of the details they describe point to this being a physical experience as we shall see. But Frank's
next memory was being inside the craft in a strange room. As he says, "We
entered up into this chamber. There was no one in the chamber at first. It was circular and we were floating, bobbing
in midair. Suddenly, doors opened and beings in suits came out. They had eyes,
nose, and ears, but not as much of a mouth as ours. They were bluish silver.
There was a female. She grabbed Alice and took her into another area, and I stayed behind. There were two men. They
showed me some Star Treks and about the universe and how much more there is beyond us. So, the ETs were
communicating with Frank and also with Alice telepathically. The two men with Frank continued to teach him about the
subject that interested him most, astronomy. As Frank says, there were
three charts on the wall. Once we started talking, others started gathering. I guess these were the crew.
I told them I was studying astronomy. On the charts, I did recognize the Milky Way in the midpoint range of the stars,
and I pointed that out. Then they showed me another star region. But the captain,
the one in charge, he wasn't really concerned with the stars. He was just concerned with trying to enlighten me.
He told me that there's more beyond the star regions in this physical dimension than I could imagine. And that's when my
consciousness, my awareness became expanded. There are other dimensions,
physical dimensions, not just this one physical dimension. They used this kind of subtlety and it was very interesting.
I picked up telepathically that there were other dimensions. It came to me that I was locked into this
three-dimensional mode of thought escaping to other planets via flying saucers, which is wrong. There are other
dimensions. These beings, I think, come from another sub-level dimension to what
we call the astral plane. So Alice at this time was having her own experience.
She was separated from her husband. But like Frank, she first remembered just
floating in this first chamber. As Alice says, once we were inside, we just sort
of floated there in this little room, bobbing around in the air. I don't know if we were being decontaminated or what.
I was half asleep. Then the partition opened and two men and a girl came into
the room. She motioned to me to follow her. I went down a curved hall following
her. It was curved at the top and the walls were luminous panels. These panels
lit up for us automatically as we went down the hall. They were all wearing the same sort of suit. There were bulb-like
things over her eyes, rounded at the top, and somewhat rounded at the bottom. And I figured it must be something to
protect the vision, but she knew I was looking her over. Alice, this woman had a very small nose, not much of a mouth.
She was taller than Ellis, but definitely female. She had a long face. The blue suit went up around her head,
covering everything but her face. And the room she found herself in reminded her of a medical clinic, complete with
an examination table and screens on the walls. And as Alice says, she lifted her
hand and I was just lifted up and set on the table. I felt her telling me telepathically that it was all right,
that she was not going to hurt me. She brought an instrument with a light on it down towards me and began to run the
light over my body. As she began to run the lights over me, I realized she was
checking this on a wall panel. I looked up at the wall and I could see the ridges around my skull and the outline
of my head and the shape of my brain. And then as she moved light down my tongue, when I swallowed, this was all
projected in blues and purples. And I thought, "Wow, that is fabulous." As she
went down, I could see my lungs taking in the air and my heart pumping. The
deeper blue of the blood was going down the aorta. And I thought, "This must be done by some sort of heat process." She
responded to that thought. She told me telepathically, "Yes, something like heat radiation."
As the light moved still further down, I saw my stomach partially full. Then she
went down over the intestines and into the genital area. And when she got there, I just couldn't help but feel
curious. She had heard my question and stopped for a minute to ask exactly what I meant. And then she told me that the
problem could be fixed easily. As it turned out, from a very young age, Alice
had suffered from bleeding ovaries. This caused her painful cramps, abnormal
menstrual cycles, and doctors advised her that she could not have children told her that she was in effect barren.
But now, while being physically examined by the ETSs, she wished that the ETSs
would fix this problem, and the lady apparently heard her and said, "Wait until we're finished." The woman then
moved to a desk and appeared to fill up paperwork. She then moved a rack of instruments over and choosing a sort of
drill-like instrument, placed it about 6 in above Alice's abdomen. At this point,
Alice could feel a tingling and stinging sensation. The woman apologized for the pain, but
then traced Alice's abdomen with the instrument. Alice believed that she was following the fallopian tubes and going
down towards the cervix. The lady brought out another smaller instrument and used it briefly and then said,
"That's it." To Alice, it felt just like a doctor's visit. Says Alice, I felt
funny when I sat up because I was tingling. It wasn't painful at all, but I could feel a strong tingling in my
abdominal area. After she helped me off the table, I followed her down the hall.
So, she was taken to what looked like a sort of elevator and then found herself in another room where she was reunited
with her husband. As Alice says, we walked into a room where five or six of
the alien men were standing around Frank casually talking telepathically. They
were questioning him and he was talking about fuel. They asked what sort of fuel we use for cars and before he could
answer, one of them just picked it up out of his mind and said, "Fossil fuel, decomposed animal matter." This was all
telepathic. We got into a real conversation with the aliens. Frank was asking questions about pollution and
ecological balance, and they really surprised us by saying, "Have faith in people. Human beings are farther
advanced than you think. At least you are aware. There are others who are as
aware as you are. Pollution will be corrected. Alice remembers seeing what
looked like a living star map and a console of some kind. She recalled being amazed and delighted by being able to
communicate telepathically so easily and a little embarrassed that she didn't fully understand where the Milky Way was
on the star charts. The next thing they both remember is waking up in bed that next morning with no idea how they got
there. Alice said she nearly forgot the whole experience, but was able to remember, and both at first thought it
might have been a dream, but they then began to compare notes and realized that their memories matched up. Alice
insisted it really happened, and Frank eventually did, too. Both of them were
profoundly affected by this encounter in different ways. Prior to the event,
Frank, as he said, had been somewhat depressed. But after this experience,
his depression was gone. And he also felt that his awareness had been expanded to unbelievable degrees. As he
says, after that encounter, my whole concept of the universe changed. That's
all they wanted to do really, to enlighten me and expand my awareness. Alice says that she was physically
affected. That tingling sensation in her abdomen persisted for a few days. She
went to a medical clinic shortly after the experience and was told that she had a normal healthy reproductive system.
This really amazed her. Apparently, her chronic problem was gone and a few years
later she became pregnant. Now, during her pregnancy, she woke up one evening and did see strange lights outside the
house. And as Alice says, the next thing I knew, I was in the kitchen and the light was on in the living room. 45
minutes had elapsed since I saw the light out the window. Alice immediately realized what happened. She believed she
was taken again, and she knew with an inexplicable certainty that her pregnancy was going to proceed as
normal, that she would have a healthy child, which she did. She had no
memories of being on board other than telling them that she would remember the encounter and them telling her that she
would not remember. She couldn't recall anything other than this, but she remains convinced that she was healed of
her medical condition in that first encounter by the ETSs. That one is probably my favorite case because there
are multiple witnesses because they had a very friendly, benevolent encounter
with the ETSs because both were able to hold long conversations. The woman was healed. It's truly an incredible account
and very well researched by a professional UFO investigator. So cases
again like these are very hard to deny. Clearly something very profound is going
on here. So let's move to the next case. This one is extraordinary because
although it does involve a single witness, this gentleman was able to hold a very long conversation with the ETSs
and they provided him with volumes of information about them. They patiently
answered all of his questions and he had a lot of them and they also volunteered
all kinds of information about themselves as well. So this one I call
our mission is one of peace. This occurred on January 28, 1978
in Lagoquin, Chile. So, this is an amazing case in so
many different ways and I think you'll find it quite interesting. This case was first published in the UFO forum
communad mystery planet, but it also appeared in Albert Rosali's excellent
volumes humanoid encounters. The witness has insisted upon anonymity, but he did
leave a lengthy firsthand testimony regarding his experience. The witness, I'll call him Fernando, that is a
pseudonym, is apparently a company manager, a professional. At the time of
his encounter, he had joined a group of people to hike in the lake, the Chukuin
area of Chile. They went to the top of a large hill which overlooked the Pacific
Ocean, very close to the town of Leo. After returning to camp, Fernando
decided to take a hike alone back up the hill. He took his compass with him and a
map. Weirdly, the compass didn't work. And it was around 7:30 p.m. on January
28, 1978. He had just started to return to camp from this hike when an intense
blue light shone down on him from above. And as Fernando says, I was terribly
frightened. I wanted to run away to escape, but a kind of total paralysis took hold of me. And then in a matter of
seconds, I felt myself being pulled upwards into an immense body surrounded
by lights located about 8 or 10 meters above my head. I don't know how I was
dragged into that object. So immediately, Fernando found himself inside of a dome about 30 ft wide,
metallic and shiny like stainless steel. He saw what looked like circular honeycombs on the wall which were
rotating around him. He also saw a giant machine which kind of reminded him of a
computer. Three people were in front of him. Two were standing and one was
sitting. And while they did look human and were of normal height and weight, they did have some differences. They had
very pale complexions and were wearing cream colored jumpsuits. The ones who were standing had a hood over their
heads. All of them were wearing shiny black gloves and boots. They all had
overly large, lightcoled, and penetrating eyes. Now, the one who was
sitting was wearing a large belt. On the jumpsuit, Fernando could see what looked
like two pockets on his chest, and one of them had a kind of shieldshaped emblem with three concentric rings
inside. His head was covered with sparse white blonde hair. Fernando also noticed
that these people moved slowly with incredible grace and elegance. And the
one who was sitting instructed Fernando to sit next to him on this ledge on the side of this craft. The man's voice was
deep and guttural, but still very calming. Fernando said he was still quote very scared. In fact, he said his
hands were sweating and his heart was beating wildly. Says Fernando, "They
told me to calm down, that they wouldn't hurt me, that they just wanted to talk to me. They asked me many simple
questions such as what my name was, what I did, if I believed in life on other
worlds, what my culture was, and if I knew anything about numbers, things like that. The man spoke very calmly, and
Fernando began to relax enough to ask some questions himself. And this is when
a lengthy conversation followed during which Fernando learned many things about these people who had taken him. He has
reconstructed the conversation to the best of his memory. So this is what Fernando remembers. He asked them, "Who
are you?" And their reply was, "It's still early for you to know, but it
won't be too late when everything becomes clear. In one or two more periods, full contact will be
established between our peoples. You shouldn't be worried about the constant appearances of us in the skies of your
planet. We do this so you will grow accustomed to our presence and there will be no panic when the ties of
communication between us strengthen. Fernando asked them outright if they plan to invade Earth or destroy it. And
they replied, "No, nothing of this sort. We are not warriors, nor are we driven
by the desire for expansion. The universe is very large, too large for so
few beings. Our mission is one of peace as it has been for thousands of years.
Fernando then asked them how their craft work and the man replied, "We create our
own flight field." The energy we accumulate, the creation of a magnetic field, and the application of
directional coordinates, the use of submolecular reaction has allowed us a
scientific foundation far superior to what you have achieved. The waste of
time on military research has resulted in the backwardness in the knowledge of earthlings which can hardly be overcome.
Though Fernando then asked, "Are you the only ones who have communicated with us?" And the man told him, "No, that
humans ignore a lot of the UFO activity on this planet." He said that they are
able to travel interdimensionally. And he told Fernando that although he himself appeared to be about 40 to 45
years old, he was in fact 300 years old. And that thousands of years ago, people
on Earth also used to live anywhere from 500 to 700 years, but that quote, "You
yourselves created the deteriorating environment and today can hardly live a
100red years." So Fernando then asked them, "How long have you been observing us?" And the ET replied, "Humans have
lived on Earth for thousands of years." He then explained that our technique of using carbon dating is flawed and
incorrect. And he said, quote, "Life on this planet is very recent. All this
time, we have accompanied the evolution of the inhabitants of Earth. Right now,
our concern is greater than usual because the discovery and use of weapons that are too powerful and destructive
beyond the control of their uses and entails not only the danger of the total destruction of this planet, but also a
chain reaction that will endanger the entire solar system. The deviation of
the Earth from its orbit would cause unforeseeable consequences. So Fernando
then asked, "Has your presence left traces or evidence of your passage on
Earth?" And the ET replied in the positive, "Yes," and said, "Humankind is
only just beginning to properly direct their investigation into our presence here. We have perhaps left too much
evidence of the existence of life on other planets. And more than this, we
have left culture, instruction, and assistance that you have not been able to take advantage of. The case of the
Egyptian pyramids is conclusive proof of this assertion. You have only just
realized that they were not erected simply for the sake of it. The energy they can retain guiding the other
celestial bodies in space. The diagramming of their forms, what they bring with their construction contains
teachings that would be immeasurable to you. It is necessary to search every
corner of this planet for a series of traces and constructions superior to the
scientific capacity of your time to understand and accept that other minds
guided in experienced hands. Now, Fernando did notice many colors on the
craft, colored lights, and he asked him, "Why do you use so many and such intense
colors?" And the ET had a very interesting answer. The man said,
"Because of the practical utility they provide. You must direct your studies
towards the application of colors, the intensity of luminous fluxes, sounds,
and the power of your minds. The essence is the wisdom and happiness that is given by nature itself. Color, light,
sound, and the human mind. Color and light have unlimited fields of
application. They cure many illnesses, calm the nerves, prevent general
imbalances, and provide inexhaustible strength and energy. sound has almost
identical applications in addition to being an excellent cutting instrument and a powerful weapon when combined with
other elements. Fernando then asked them if they had contacted other people than himself and the ETSs told him that yes,
he was not the only one chosen. They said, "It happens that many who have been in contact with us and remained
silent, forgetting our request to divulge certain messages. It seems to me
that they were afraid of being considered crazy or not being believed. They told him that they contact many
people for tests and exams, but quote, "None have been injured or harmed."
Fernando asked them why they don't contact the leaders of the earth. And the ET said that doing so is difficult
as leaders are surrounded and protected by many other people, but that they have in fact contacted at least two rulers
and only one admitted to their existence. They said that many different types of ETSs from different places are
contacting the people of Earth, but that quote, "The mission is the same. We
remind you that you must return your path to other goals and free yourself from Bellose ideas, worship your
creator, and obey his commandments, his laws. The arrogance with which many
leaders guide you is leading you towards the destruction of everything established and will only provoke
tragedy which will affect other planets. Whatever path you take from now on,
there will be a great catastrophe, but we wish to prevent it from being greater than you can imagine, destroying a large
part of your inhabitants or destroying everything. The ETZ told him, "We have
analyzed every inhabitant on your planet in the same capsule you are now in. It
is rare that we can be with someone who asks us questions, who is not afraid, and does not despair. Your case is one
of few despite your great agitation." What we do not understand for our part
is why the inhabitants of earth cannot develop greater intellectual capacity
and limits himself to using so little the capacity of the mind. The ET said that their craft had been observed
captured on radar many times. They told him also that they are not much different from humans and also
experience natural limitations. But at some point the conversation finally ended and the next thing Fernando knew
he was back at his original location and he estimates that the duration of this
encounter was about 3 hours. Now the witness's identity is apparently known
to several prominent Chilean UFO researchers. They refer to him as quote
an elite witness because apparently he is of high standing and respected in the community. The witness himself has many
questions about his own encounter and does admit to the possibility that he may have dreamed the whole thing.
Publisher of this case, Vaness says that he got the information from quote the
former Chilean delegation of the Cosmic Fraternity Studies Center. This was a
short-lived Chilean UFO study group. A truly amazing case and apparently
thoroughly researched by Chilean investigators. And I can understand why the witness has elected to remain
anonymous. Apparently, he is a person of professional standing, but it's a shame.
The ridicule and disbelief that surrounds this subject prevents the vast majority of people from going public.
And we know it's a lot of people who are having this experience. And the messages
this gentleman was given are very much corroborated by the many other people
who are receiving these same kinds of messages as we see in this one episode
which is only five cases. But here's another one equally amazing, equally
profound. I call this one a pure learning experience. This one occurred
around July 1st, 1996 in Coats, Minnesota. This is a very
small town. The main witness was driving with a friend through this area late at
night when they came upon a UFO and of course had a period of missing time.
They did recall it through hypnosis, but still a really compelling account that
matches up perfectly with those who consciously recall their encounters. This is one of the reasons why we know
hypnosis works. But I do think you'll find this case particularly fascinating. This last and final case comes from a
gentleman. I call him Scott. That's a pseudonym. He sought hypnosis after having a scary missing time encounter.
It was 2:00 a.m. on July 1st, 1996. Scott and his friend were driving to
their home in Rochester, Minnesota. His friend was driving. Scott sat in the front passenger seat. They were heading
north on Highway 52 and had just passed through the small town of Coats. Without
warning, something strange happened. As Scott says, I heard a low humming sound
which got louder. I could feel a vibration all over my body. I looked out
of the passenger window and I saw a bright light at treetop level about 200 f feet away. So Scott shouted out, "Stop
the car." His friend stopped the car and seeing the UFO and humming noise became
almost hysterical with fear. Scott, also afraid, grabbed a tire iron from the
under the seat and stepped outside of the car to take a closer look. As Scott
says, I got to the ditch and that is the last memory I had. The next thing I
remember was me and my friend pulling into a restaurant. We were both in a days and couldn't figure out how the
time got to be 5:30 a.m. So, we had a large chunk of missing time. In fact,
they were missing at least 3 hours of time. And beginning to research the subject, Scott decided that he would try
regressive hypnosis. He found a hypnotist and scheduled a session. And under hypnosis, he was able to recall
much of what happened during these missing three hours. He recalled the buzzing sound and the UFO. He remembered
getting out of the car. He remembered standing by the side of the road and being hit by a blue beam of light which
actually levitated him over to the craft. He could see it had no visible windows. A ramp opened up and he was
brought inside and he found himself inside a strange room. As Scott says, a
door opened and a tall gray and a normalsized gray entered. The tall gray
had on a black jumpsuit. Then a human entered, also wearing a black jumpsuit.
He was smiling. At this point, the man spoke, saying, quote, "There's no reason
to be afraid. This is going to be a pure learning experience." Scott immediately
found his fear dissipating. And as Scott says, he brought me into the cockpit
area and told me to look outside the windows. The windows were one way where I could see out, but the craft did not
look like it had windows. He showed me the control panel and how to operate it.
He took me into another room where there were an assortment of monitors on the wall. The man spoke. "Follow along with
the images," he said, "and they will teach you what you need to learn." So
for the next two hours, Scott watched these images on these screens. He says
he was somehow able to understand what he was watching, but apparently doesn't remember it in any detail. But the man
then returned and said, quote, "It is vital that you understand these things
because there may come a time when we won't be here to teach you." They told him that he would have to continue quote
the big plan in their place. And as Scott says, he said he didn't know when
that time would be, as there are many factors involved that could change the outcome. Then the two grays came back in
the room and the ramp opened. The smaller gray escorted me out of the craft into my car. He put a small device
on the side of my head. I became paralyzed and my vision went black. So
that's all Scott is able to recall. He did contact his friend after going under hypnosis. He learned that his friend had
in fact been having flashbacks of this event, but that he quote doesn't want to
be involved in any way. There are many really interesting things about that
case. Here we have a case of Grays and apparently a humanlooking ET working
together. There are quite a few of those. I also found it interesting because they took the witness up to what
we would call the control room, the helm, and were showing him how they fly the craft. This is another detail that
turns up fairly consistently in these onboard UFO cases. But as you can see,
these are the kinds of cases that do answer a lot of the questions over and over again. ETSs are relating the same
message. They're very worried about our warlike ways. Clearly, they're very worried about how we are destroying the
environment. These are the kinds of messages that are received over and over again. So really, the question is, will
we listen? Will we take these messages seriously? Because we can see these things coming true right before our very
eyes. It's one of the reasons I think these cases are so important. They're
very interesting. I mean, they're incredibly fascinating, but I think they're very, very significant, very
important. The ETSs see that we are on the wrong path and are doing everything they can short of coming down and taking
over themselves to correct things. I think this argues for the benevolence of
the onboard experience. I've said this many times. Yes, a close encounter can be incredibly terrifying, very
traumatic, especially in the beginning. But most people do not feel that the
ETSs are evil or here to take over or intentionally hurt or harm people. And
we can certainly see that in these onboard cases which follow a very set
pattern. This is exactly what happens when people are taken on board. They're physically examined. Then they are
perhaps given a tour of the craft. They are perhaps healed. they are given all
kinds of information which again involves these same kinds of messages and warnings. So this is something we
have to take a good objective look at. So that's it you guys. Thank you for
joining me tonight on this amazing episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. I
hope you enjoyed it, perhaps learned something. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions, keep
searching for the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun and remember, stay tuned. There's a little additional
segment where you get to hear the witnesses speak firsthand about the
encounter that occurred in Menong, Wisconsin.
Time suddenly slipped away in the blink of an eye. Then there were three bright
orange lights in the sky. Was it a trick? A hallucination? The questions
went unanswered until Karen saw a recent sightings report on alien abduction and something about the story struck a
resonant chord.
[Music] Memories of that moonlit night in 1975
were incomplete, but strangely compelling. An engaged couple on a family vacation steal away for a quiet
drive through the north woods of Wisconsin. There's something strange about that
ride that they can't figure out yet. Back at the cabin, the couple stroll
down to the lake. The night is clear. There's a bright star, but then it moves
and they realize this is no star. There was one uh
star-like object was a little bit brighter than a star, kind of an orangey color that seemed to stand out from the
others a bit. Really didn't think anything of it at the time, but my focus kept going back
and forth to that particular object. And after a while, I noticed some some
odd things about it. This bright orange star that was along the horizon of the trees on the other
side of the lake zipped right to the top of our heads when we looked up.
The stargazing couple were Karen Clinger and Dennis Morowska, and what they saw
would haunt them for more than 20 years. I think the best way I could describe the flight is like that of a dragonfly.
It was just it would zip here, stop, zip here, stop, zip, zip, zip, zip really
fast. And like, what are we watching? I had I I was fascinated by it. I just I
didn't want to stop looking at I was just glued to it. And we finally started calling my folks down from the cabin so
they could watch. And my mother was a little scared. The
whole family got down to the lake in time to see the single light split into three. then rejoin as one. It was a
fascinating spectacle that drove one family member to try something illogical.
Jenny's sister's boyfriend went into the house and got a large beam flashlight and flashed at the UFOs three times.
Suddenly, they just completely disappeared. And about maybe a couple of seconds later, they flashed back at us
the same amount of times as we had flashed it in. After a few minutes of this strange communication, everyone
reached the same impossible conclusion. By this time, we knew we were watching
something that we had no explanation for. It was really strange and
definitely appeared to be intelligently controlled. The bizarre communication went on for half an hour. Then, in less
than the blink of an eye, the UFO was gone. The encounter had a profound effect, but Karen and Dennis wouldn't
know just how profound for another two decades. By then, they had married, had a son, and an acrimonious divorce. In
fact, in 1994, they were barely speaking when Dennis and Karen met to exchange
custody of their son. Well, this particular evening, he got out of the car, probably for the first time that
he'd talked to me face to face in a year, and he knocks on the window of the car, and the first thing that comes out
of his mouth was, "Have you ever considered hypnosis?" And and I said to him, I said, "You saw that program."
The program was sightings and our report on the abduction experience of four men
camping in the Alagash wilderness of northern Maine. They too had seen a UFO in the sky. Like Karen and Dennis, they
had used a flashlight to signal the spacecraft. And most importantly of all, the Alagash 4 had missing time
around the lake, which is uh exactly a 4 mile radius. Doesn't take very long to
cover at all. That at one point we looked up and the moon was directly
in line with the um rearview mirror of the car. And by the time we got back to the lake,
which shouldn't have been very long, the moon was setting.
It never occurred to me until that moment that there could possibly be some
missing time involved. I felt sick. I felt I mean, I literally felt nauseated
at the thought of it. But what happened during that missing time? Dennis asked Karen if she would
consider hypnotherapy as a way to find the answer. I think the the nature of a repressed
memory is that there is no conscious access to this memory. It's not something that somebody remembers once
um or occasionally and then sticks back in a locked vault someplace in their mind. Dr. David Clayton agreed to
hypnotize Karen. He had no faith in the abduction experience. But as he worked with Karen, he realized that she was not
unlike other patients who he'd seen relive past trauma under hypnosis. Karen
was recalling a very intense white light that approached the vehicle that she and
her former husband were in at the time. And when this white light approached the
side of the vehicle, uh it was so intense I think Karen at that point um felt that she had fainted. Under Dr.
Clayton's watchful eye, Karen revealed traumatic contact with extraterrestrial beings, something Dennis couldn't or
wouldn't recall. But their descriptions of the craft were nearly identical. We compared notes later. They
corroborated very closely with some of the points that Karen uh had brought up under hers. We both got these images of
a grid-like pattern, almost a primitive type structure, almost like a derigible
or something. Independently, Karen and Dennis insisted that the purpose of the abduction was not to hurt them, but to help all
humankind. They each felt compelled to deliver the same message. The fate of
Earth is intertwined with alien worlds throughout the cosmos and earthlings are
not doing a good job of taking care of our part of the universe. It's a message that abduction support group leader Mary
Keroot hears a lot. As far as the phenomenon in general, some people's experiences can truly be
described as abductions. They are taken kicking and screaming, struggling
against their will. Others evolve over time as they understand what is
happening to come very cooperatively and become associated with the beings that
they're working with in a in a participatory role. The Chicago Center for Encounters
support group was formed in 1993 so abductees and experiencers would know
that they are not alone. It's enormously exciting for the members of our support group to to compare experiences because
as soon as you find someone who has some aspect that is similar or exactly like
yours, you feel much more validated. At first, abductees were paras
inventing a new mythology. But after three decades, the phenomenon is not going away because abductees insist
alien contact is a reality. If you feel that this has happened to you, by all
means, do whatever it takes to uncover the information because it's worth the
risk. Just as she was reassured after watching our Alagash abduction report, Karen
Klinger hopes that her personal story will encourage more people to come forward or at least to seek help from a
certified professional hypnotherapist or from one of the hundreds of support groups forming around the world.
