Summary:
Jun 14, 2024
While governments across the world now admit to the validity UFOs, they still refuse to discuss firsthand contact cases. The heart of the UFO phenomenon is not the craft, but the UFO occupants themselves. The evidence shows clearly that UFOs are craft, piloted by living beings. The thousands of humanoid cases can no longer be denied, ignored, or explained away. This video presents ten cases of very close encounters with humanoids of all kinds. They span more than 100 years, come from across the world, and many contain compelling evidence to support them.

THE SMILING EXTRATERRESTRIAL. One morning in the Summer of 1915, Bjarne Westvand (age 6) was playing outside his home in Jakobsbakken, Norway when a craft landed, and out stepped two three-foot-tall figures with large heads, long hair, gray skin. One walked right up to him then turned around and departed. It was an experience he kept secret for 65 years.

QUARRY ALIEN. At 2:05 pm on May 30, 1971, Pierrette Debofle stepped outside her home in Dannes, France to collect some grass for her rabbits. Looking up, she saw a strange craft in the chalk quarry behind her house. Then she saw a three-foot-tall figure with a large glowing head and a bulky torso, walking and floating near the craft. Suddenly it went inside it and the craft took off at high speed.

THE GITCHIE-MANITOU UFO WAVE. One night in mid-April 1976, Linda Sehr of Lyon, Iowa saw a UFO near the Gitchie-Manitou State Park. To her shock, it followed her car home. One month later Andy and Joel Rygh (age 8 and 6) were playing the park when they saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid. They ran and told their two older brothers, and all four saw a craft dart away. Soon more encounters would occur.

CURED OF ARTHRITIS. At 8pm on September 6, 1976, Leoncio and Elena Torres were driving through a rural area of Carabaya, Peru when a UFO landed on the road in front of them. Two human-looking figures came out, approached them, and touched them both on the back. They felt burning heat and the figures left. Afterward there were landing traces on the road, and both Leoncio and Elena were cured of their arthritis.

THE LITTLE MAN OF DUNN, NORTH CAROLINA. On October 12, 1976, eight-year-old Tonnlie Barefoot was playing outside his home in Dunn, NC when he saw a little one-foot-tall man staring at him. The tiny man ran away. Tonnlie told his mother and others, but nobody believed him. Then they found the footprints. Two weeks later, Shirley Ann McCrimmon was entering her home only a few miles away when she also saw a little man. But was this an ET or something else?

THE ALIEN COUPLE. On the night of August 30, 1977, Ceferina Vargas Martin was walking home in Escalada, Spain when a powerful light hit her face. Seconds later, she saw a very odd-looking man and woman with large eyes, two slits for a nose, a thin mouth and yellowish skin. Both wore strange clothes. A powerful weakness swept over her and she fainted. Upon awakening, the couple was gone, and so were some of Ceferina’s belongings.

A VERY CLOSE ENCOUNTER. On November 1, 1980, sisters Kristina Rydhold and Nina Grundin were driving to their parents’ home near Hovsta, Sweden when a UFO began to circle overhead. Without warning it approached to within 50 feet, close enough that they could both see two humanoids inside it. Their car stalled and began to shake mysteriously. Finally the craft left, but this was only one of several close encounters in the area at that time.

PICNIC WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL. On the afternoon of April 26, 1984, a few hundred teachers and students went for an outside picnic at rural Monte Sant’Antonio near Macomer, Italy. A teacher and student went exploring and both saw a strange short humanoid. They were unable to move until it left. Moments later, a craft rose from the ground, leaving landing traces. Soon, another student saw the strange humanoid.

MISSING TIME IN MIRABEL. Around 4am one morning in August 2012, a man and woman traveled by motorcycle outside of Mirabel, Canada. Suddenly a UFO appeared overhead. It sent down a beam of light, striking them. The man saw strange humanoids looking down at him. Afterwards, they drove off and forgot everything. Months later, the man suddenly remembered the encounter. The woman, however, had no memory of any humanoids.

THE ALIEN IN THE RECTANGLE. On the night of September 8, 2012, Konnonova Irina Dmitrievna was outside her home in Penza, Ternovka, Russia when she noticed a glowing rectangle of red light in the sky. As it approached, the light changed shape and she could see a humanoid inside, facing her. It soon moved off. But a short time later and a few miles away, another woman saw a very similar object.

Ten cases, each offering a glimpse into what it’s like to have a face-to-face encounter with strange humanoids, each providing another piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. The evidence speaks for itself: we are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal today's episode is called
face to face 10 very close encounters with extraterrestrials I'm not going to do a
long introduction this time you know what my episodes are about I love talking about the closest of all
encounters I think we have a lot to learn from the humanoid cases and I've picked 10 which I think you probably
haven't heard before coming from all over the world including France Italy
Norway Spain Sweden Canada of course the United States Peru and even Russia and
I've got about a 100e spread here because the earliest case is 1915 and the last case is
2012 so I'm hoping these cases you find interesting and they helped provide some
insights into what ET contact is like why they're here and what is going on
with this whole situation so let's just get started because this is going to be a pretty long episode and the first case
I like to talk about I call The Smiling aliens I like this case CU it's a very
early case it occurred in the summer of 1915 long before UFOs were really a
thing or even the idea of extra trust ruls visiting our planet was in the popular culture this took place in
Norway specifically in a rural area known as Jacobs bachan and it's a really
interesting case that illustrates the type of encounter that happens over and over again where UFO lands humanoids
come out and provide a very short meeting with a witness this very early
case comes from researcher oie Johnny Brin and it is among the first
documented UFO landing and humanoid reports in the country of Norway it was
published in the 1981 volume four issue of the Norwegian magazine rort nit the
main witness is Bjorn West vand and it took place in a very rural area of
Norway known as Jacobs bachan this is located in sulit gelma not far from a
large and active Mining facility this may be significant here vjn was 6 years
old and had been playing with the other children in the area he was walking home when a bell-shaped object appeared in
the Western sky and began to land behind a small Hill near the town's mining
site when this happened bjarn was rooted to the spot he said unable to move and
this is when he noticed two humanlike figures coming from down the hill towards the road in front of
him they suddenly turned around and began to walk directly towards him these
two beings spoke briefly to each other in a loud booming voice though bjarn was
unable to understand what they were saying they then one of them stopped
while the other continued to approach him now according to bjarn this humanoid
had a smile on his face he was very short about 3 feet tall very close to
BJ's own height this figure had an abnormally large head long wavy hair and
grayish skin he was dressed in a brown jumpsuit the one that had remained
behind was dressed in a similar jumpsuit although of a darker color and this was it basically then the
two humanoids returned down the road climbed back up the small hill and
disappeared behind it and moments later this bell-like object that he had seen
land reappeared rising from behind the hill and it quickly darted off into the
sky now at this time yarn had no idea about flying saucers or
extraterrestrials he was unable to understand who these people were or where they might have come from and he
wasn't really able to process or interpret this experience but later as an adult he heard about UFOs heard about
cases like his and it was about 65 years later after his encounter that he
finally reported it to UFO researchers what an interesting case that is admittedly it is a single Le witness
account purely anecdotal but I find it fascinating that even the witness himself didn't jump to the extra
terrestrial explanation until many years later when he started hearing reports that were very similar to his it's
certainly a fascinating case because it occurred so early I've heard many people
say there aren't any humanoid reports before the 1940s and that's simply not
true as this case illustrates so ly and now let's move to the next one which is
also a really fascinating case I call this one the Quarry alien this ET was
seen in a quarry this is a pattern we see in a number of cases where ETS seem to show interest in mining areas so
perhaps that's what that's what was going on here it took place on May 30th
1971 in an area known as Don France and I like this case because this
witness got a very good look at this UFO and this very interestingly described
humanoid the main witness in this case is Madame pet deboule she's a housewife
in her 40s she had no interest in UFOs when at 2:05 p.m. on May 30th
1971 she stepped out of her home in Dan France to pick some grass to feed her
rabbits at the time of her encounter her home was located about 1,000 ft away from
this chalk Quarry and cement factory which you can see here she then noticed
something else odd because looking up towards the Quarry she saw a dark gray
metallic looking object shaped kind of like an upside down bowl with a dome on
top and it was hovering just a few feet above the ground about 2500 ft away she
said it was motionless fairly large about the size of a nearby bulldozzer
and she estimates maybe about 10 ft wide 4 to 5T high so not terribly large and
examining the area around the strange object she immediately noticed this dark
silhouette of a strange figure stepping out from a field of clover and walking directly into this Quarry she said it
was easily visible against the white background of the chalk and she was puzzled because this figure was quite
short her husband actually worked at the Quarry and she had seen him there on numerous occasions so she could easily
see that this figure was much shorter than her husband it was also odd because
this was a Sunday and she knew good and well that nobody worked in the quarry on a Sunday in fact she first thought that
this might be a child who had wandered in there but there were some other strange details this figure had a a very
bulky torso an abnormally large round head and the head had a sort of shiny
halo around it now this figure also walked with a strange oscillating gate kind of
waddling like a duck at times but at other times seemed to Glide above the ground and it was moving up and down
along with the terrain so at this point she realized that this was probably not
a child but something quite strange it was definitely taking up more and more
of her attention and she watched it bend down and pick up something which she presumed had to be a piece of chalk as
there was really nothing else out there but the longer she watched it which was almost 10 minutes the more intrigued she
became and she began to slowly back up towards her home in order to let her husband know about this strange
figure now she saw again that this being was walking at times but at other times
gliding and started moving towards this object that she had seen and when it
reached the object she says it stooped down slightly and went below it and then seemed to be immediately sucked up
inside it the craft then promptly Rose moving diagonally gliding up the slope
of the Quarry and seeing this unusual craft rising up off the ground she knew
she was seeing a UFO at this point and she began to run home to get her husband
but the craft then darted away at lightning speed making no noise whatsoever that she could detect and as
it did this it emitted a powerful burst of white light she said it was quote as
fast as an arrow and without the least noise so seeing this she stood there in
total astonishment for a few moments then broke out of this spell and ran to tell her husband and her daughter and
when they both came out to look the object was already gone now her husband however said that his
wife was in a state of panic when she ran inside to tell them of this UFO later her husband and neighbor
checked the location but found no evidence in terms of Landing traces but they did report the case to
investigators and they found her very believable and very sincere and in fact they reenacted the incident and
confirmed that the details pet described were consistent from the location of her
observation so there you go it's another case of a landed UFO in humanoid seen at
pretty close range it's quite fascinating it is again a single witness
case with no real supporting physical evidence though it was professionally researched the investigators again found
her quite credible and yeah I think the case has something to offer our to our
understanding of what's going on here because we have so many cases like this
where UFOs land in geographically or geologically interesting
areas and now we move to another case this one is super fascinating because
it's actually a series of events multiple Witnesses so there's quite a bit of corroboration here uh including
Landing traces as well I call this one the gchi Mana 2 UFO wave this occurred
on July 5 1976 in the gii manitu state park in Iowa
it's a fascinating case and one of my favorite in this little collection here
throughout the spring and summer of 1976 the gii manitu state park located
along the border of Iowa and South Dakota had been the location of an incredible series of UFO encounters
including a multiple witness UFO landing and humanoid case complete with strange
Landing traces now one of the the first incidents occurred at 11:30 p.m. one
evening in mid April of 1976 when Linda s age 20 was heading
south on County Road 115 which approaches the park and then veers East you can see it here and as
she approached this corner she saw ahead of her car a large oblong glowing white
object with lights flashing she said like Sparks around the edges
this object was shaped she said kind of like an army helmet was glowing dim on top very brightly on the bottom and had
a dark line around the circumference where there was this line of glittering lights and she said it was so low that
it looked like it was actually going to land so she slowed down to avoid it at
which point it moved very fast with a kind of wobbly motion to the side of the road over a field as she continued her
trip she said the craft actually followed her pacing her car she raised home ran inside to tell her
parents but by the time they got outside the craft was gone her parents however could tell that she was quite frightened
and it wouldn't be long before she had another encounter now meanwhile it was just over
two months later around 900 a.m. on July 5 1976 that two young boys Andy rig age 8
and his little brother Joel age six had they had walked a short distance from
their home to the gii manitu park and were playing under a picnic shelter when
they started to hear these weird unidentifiable noises they stopped their play and
listened at which point they heard this grunting sound followed by a high shrill
whistle and looking towards the source they saw something they could hardly believe about 70 ft away right behind a
bush stood what appeared to be a figure about 7 ft tall while I couldn't see
much detail of his face or body one of his legs was clearly exposed and they
could see that he was wearing some kind of shiny blue clothing at this point the noises
started to become louder so the two boys ran about a quarter of a mile back to
where their older brothers Chris age 11 and Tom age n were this happened to be
the very corner where just a few months earlier Linda SAR had had her
encounter so the younger boys excitedly described what they had seen to their older brothers and pointed to the area
and at that moment all four boys saw a glowing object emerged from behind a
tree about 150 ft south of them again in the gchi manatu park this object Rose
just above the trees paused for about 5 seconds and it was close enough for for
all of them to hear a humming noise coming from it they said it was shaped like a hay stack very similar in size it
was glowing white and pulsating in brightness and then immediately this object sped rapidly off to the South
disappearing in the distance now the encounters weren't over yet because it was one week later that
Linda rusen boom who lives 34s a mile north of the rigs said that she was
awakened by her dogs at 1:30 a.m. and looking out the window saw a pulsating
object hovering one mile to the southeast very close to where the previous two encounters had occurred and
as she says I tried to think of what it could be but it was just too big to be
anything I knew of it wasn't a normal light it was white or bluish white so
she immediately woke up her husband but by the time he got up the object was just beginning to fade and then it
disappeared as the witness says I don't know if it went off or landed or left after that I
couldn't sleep for two weeks I kept getting up to see what every little noise was so by this time news was spreading
through this small community that UFOs were being seen and another Resident of
the area Sarah strike said that around this time her dog started barking at the
sky and quote carrying on something Fierce now she didn't see anything but
fearing a Prowler she called the police the police came out they patrolled the
area but said they saw nothing they left and her dogs were still barking so both Sarah and Linda rusen
boom said that they talked to others who had seen the UFOs but they were too afraid of ridicule to come forward so
apparently a lot of people were seeing this one witness who did have the courage to come forward was Jack Wright
who said that he and his wife saw a UFO earlier just north of the park just
South of Highway 38 and he said it was about as long as four football fields it had two giant
yellow lights 5T in diameter and was moving very slowly at Treetop level
right over them and the highway scaring them quite badly he first thought these
were separate lights but as the object came closer he could see no this was one solid object
and they both watched it move off and could see red lights on the back of it and it was moving slowly they said no
faster than 10 mph now again events were still in
progress N9 days after the rig boys sighting this same witness decided he
was going to go to the area where this UFO had hovered and he found that some
of the leaves on the oak trees exactly where the boys had seen the object come up showed signs of high heat he said the
upper leaves were yellowed and the lower leaves were splotched and curled so he visited again 5 days later
and saw that all the upper leaves on this tree had died and fallen off as he
says the boy's story became really believable for me because of those trees
it really Spooks me I wish I hadn't seen them and sightings continued into August
Linda Seer the first witness saw saw the UFOs a second time Rick Schultz who
lives in Hartford South Dakota which is about 25 miles to the Northwest said
that he saw a quote big red ball of fire which actually came up from the ground
and accelerated away changing directions three or four times as Rick says it
really scared me I've never seen anything like that he also called the
police and later learned that the police had received multiple reports of strange lights in the area so even a half a year
later reports were still coming in because in early March of 1977 Doug Wilkins of haarden about 40
miles from the gii manitu park also saw an object which he says quote speeded up
when I did and slowed down when I did I began to get scared when it started taking curves with me so he went home
and alerted his family and all saw it so and this appeared to be the end of the
wave or at least the witnesses stopped talking interestingly gii manitu this
word is uh an Native American word and it means the great Creator God of the
anes shabi and many neighboring alanin tribes as well the name literally means
great spirit which is a common phrase used to address God in many Native
American languages UFO activity does sometimes seem to come in little flaps
little waves clusters of activity and that's certainly true here there must have been something going on in this
area that was of interest to the ETS because it did go on for quite some time
and I always love it when there's independent Witnesses who aren't aware of each other's accounts and are still
seeing really unusual activity and of course the landing traces in this case are quite compelling and were verified
by multiple Witnesses so it's another fascinating case and here's one that I
find of particular interest because I have done a lot of research into cases of UFO healings and that's what
apparently occurred in this case which I call cured of arthritis this occurred on September 6th
1976 in a very rural area of Peru called
carabaya now these Witnesses were driving along on a highway as we'll see when they had their encounter but it's
such a fascinating case in so many ways this very interesting case was widely
published in local newspapers and involves again both an apparent healing and Landing
traces the two witnesses include a married couple leonio Jara Torres and
his wife Elena it was around 8:00 p.m. September 6 1976
as they drove their truck through the very rural area of carabaya this is
Sever several hundred miles Southwest of Lima Peru without warning they saw a UFO drop
from the sky and land 100 ft ahead of them on the road this craft was pretty
big about 10 ft High 65 to 70 ft in diameter they said it had two Port holes
and was emitting a quote powerful light there were also colored lights on it and
as soon as this craft landed their truck stalled and almost immediately two glowing figures emerged and immediately
approached them in their truck and as Leoncio says from the craft descended
two human-looking figures they looked human They Carried two powerful flashlights that they used to Blind us
and limit our vision they shown the two flashlights on us approached the truck
and touched us on the back my wife fainted i instead was dumb I couldn't
think of anything I was scared stiff now leono reports that these ETS
were both male about 5' 8 in in height and wore CL quote shining
clothing they approached the truck with very short steps he said that the touch
of the ET was very hot and that he had the feeling of quote as if something
burned me an intense heat that went to my bones the heat went to our very bones
we felt a terrible Heat their hands practically burned our bodies we
remained as if hypnotized now all in all the encounter was very brief about 1 minute after
these apparent ETS placed their hands on both lono's and Elena's backs they left
the couple alone and as leano says the Luminous beings then went back towards
the craft and after entering it took off vertically at terrific
speed it took the couple a few hours to recover from this encounter afterwards
they went directly to the police who began an investigation the story quickly leaked
out to reporters who also went to the site and found quote strange traces on
the ground now the witnesses did go to a doctor where they were found to be
perfectly healthy and were treated only for quote intense nervousness important here is prior to
the encounter both leonio and Elena suffered from arthritis but following
the encounter they found that their arthritis symptoms had been alleviated I
think that case is quite important I wrote a book about UFO healing cases outlining some 300 plus cases this case
isn't in it I wish I had known about it cuz I would have included it CU I have a number of cases of people cured of
arthritis and just judging from the series of events that took place in this case I honestly think and I am
speculating here but I honestly think that that was the purpose of the encounter given that it was quite brief
the ETS came out walked up to the car placed their hands physically on both
Witnesses and essentially cured them it's a really fascinating case and I Al
like it because it has electromagnetic effects with their car stopping and Landing trace evidence as well so it's a
pretty well-confirmed case that certainly got a lot of attention at that time now moving along I love this next
case because it provides an important insight into what's going on here there are all kinds of humanoids on our planet
and some of them perhaps are not extraterrestrials as we would think of them but perhaps more correctly defined
as cryptoterrestrials humanoids who exist on our planet but have yet to be accepted or identified by
mainstream science and I'm speculating that that's what's going on in this case
which I call the little man of dun North Carolina it's a fascinating case with
multiple Witnesses and some what we would call Landing trace evidence Footprints actually but it occurred on
October 12th and October 25th both in 1976 in this little town of dun North
Carolina and it's such a fascinating case of a very unusual humanoid this I
think is an important case because it allows for a different interpretation of some of these humanoids not all strange
humanoids are necessarily ETS and might be something more akin to leprechauns
gnomes elves faery or little people that are reported in many countries all over
the world and have been reported for centuries consider what happened here I
mean this case involves multiple Witnesses and footprint evidence it comes from researchers Janet
and Colin Bard and the incident took place in Dunn nth North
Carolina this city was actually formerly known as luck now now the first witness was 8-year-old
Tomley Barefoot who around 5:00 p.m. on October 12 1976 six was out playing in
the field of dried cornstalks near his home located at the intersections of
Jonesboro Road and haj's Chapel Road Again in Dunn North Carolina his mom was
nearby picking peas from the garden and looking a short distance away Tomley was
surprised to see a little man who he said was quote not much bigger than a coke bottle this little man was watching
him with an open mouth he said this figure had a mustache wore a blue shirt
with a pretty white tie and trousers made of quote shiny stuff he also had a
black German type hat with a weird emblem on it that looked to tley like
crossed rifles on his feet he wore black boots and when this little man saw that
tley had noticed him he peronally quote let out a little squeal like a mouse and
then ran off among the cornstalks so needless to say this quite impressed tley and he immediately ran
off and told his mother who unfortunately did not believe him and in fact nobody did which really upset him
in fact he cried all that night the next day however he was Vindicated when
numerous little Footprints were found exactly where tley said he saw this
man and 2 Days Later a second set of tiny Footprints were found about 4 50 ft
away and were allegedly photographed these Footprints measured at 2 and 1/4
in Long 1 in wide at the heel and had boot marks in
them so what's interesting is tle always stuck to his story for years in fact
years later Tony's niece heard the story from her uncle and she says that quote
it is a true story and very real when my uncle Tomley first told me the story I
didn't believe him I thought he was losing his mind but I was wrong he showed me pictures and took me to the
exact place he had seen his little Leprechaun he called it it's
incredible and in further confirmation of what Tomley saw thankfully for him
about 2 weeks later and only a few miles away there was another sighting of apparently this same strange little man
it was 6:20 in the morning of October 25 19 1976 as 20-year-old Shirley an
McMan who lived at the 800 block of East hartnet Street she was returning home
from a party she unlocked her door went inside and left it a jar so she could
find the light switch so she turns on the lights and goes to close the door
and this is when she hears a strange noise coming from outside like someone moving around in the bushes so she
looked out and she was shocked to see a little man about 1T tall she said he had
light brown skin and appeared to be wearing a thin garment though she can't be sure about that but she did see he
was wearing boots and no sooner did she see him than this little man Shone a tiny yellow
light across her eyes she let out a loud scream and this little man ran away
scampering around the side of her house at which point her dogs began barking
now she later went outside to investigate and did find a little footprint and wisely she tried to
preserve it by covering it with a plastic container she told her neighbors about
the sighting showed them the footprint they hadn't seen anything and they were kind of
disbelieving but she was serious about this serious enough to call the police who came to
investigate a reporter actually heard about the sighting and was interviewing her and was about to look at the
footprint when a child accidentally destroyed it when he tried to lift the container that was preserving the
footprint and accidentally erased it but looking around they did find a second but fainter footprint it was still
legible and when measured it turned out to be the exact same size as those reported earlier by
tley now I suppose it's possible that that one foot little man was an ET but
there was no UFO scene the way it was dressed the way it was described sounds a lot more like a little elf or a gnome
or a fairer as the main witness set a leprechaun I think we struggle to
categorize and Define these little people but they are seen in cultures all
over the world and as you can see still being seen so it's an important case
because people I think are trying to conflate perhaps fairy folk and little
people with ETS and I'm wondering if they are completely
separate phenomena this is very hard to prove but that's what it looks like to me just my two cents and for that reason
I wanted to include this case because I think it speaks to all the different things that are going on here on our
planet all right moving along here's another really interesting case
involving a face Toof face encounter with apparent extraterrestrials this I call the alien
couple it occurred on August 3rd 1977 again in a very rural area of
escalada Spain and while this is a single witness case there are some
really profound apparent physiological or perhaps emotional
effects and also some other really strange things that happened during this encounter which make it unique and
certainly of Interest the only witness in this case is 20-year-old sephina
Vargas Martin and she is described by the researchers of her case as a quote
balanced quiet person they said she's well respected by her family and Neighbors in this very small town of
escalada located in the middle of the Sierra Moren mountains in Spain it was
around 7:30 p.m. on August 3rd 1977 as the witness sephina was
listening to a soap opera on the radio and then left her home to visit her grandmothers in order to help with
household chores her grandmother lived about 1 and a half miles away in the
village of lacorte so along with her she carried a
purse with her identity card some bus tickets and other items and off she set to her grandmother's house she had
walked for a few minutes along this isolated and Rural dirt path in a Gorge bordering a stream there were high
mountains surrounding her and it was now near dusk when strange things began to
occur the first was this dazzling flash of Light which hit her face and it
seemed to come she thought from the stream next to her she thought it might be a piece of broken mirror or glass in
the Stream but for some reason it made her nervous and she began to walk faster
along the narrow path or at least she tried to because weirdly she felt as if
some strange Force was slowing her pace so she's moving along about 50 ft
further along the path and she was momentarily blinded by another flash of
light in her face which she likened to a quote lightning bolt she said this was
more like a beam of light coming from a bicycle headlight and was very painful to the eyes and at the same time that
this light hit her she felt a strange weakness coming over her body so now now
she's quite nervous and scared and wanting to hurry along but directly in front of her she saw that there were two
strange figures a woman and a man standing on the path less than 15 ft in
front of her precisely from where this dazzling light had come the woman she
said was taller than the man about 6 feet tall she estimates the man again
was slightly shorter maybe 5 and 1/2 ft but sephina was mostly shocked by their
very unusual appearance an and attire the woman had flat blonde hair
very long reaching down to the center of her back she had very large eyes with
high eyebrows her nose was quite unusual consisting only of two small openings
vertical slits and her mouth was just a thin line this woman was dressed in a
dark green robe which seemed to Sparkle brightly with tiny lights and although
female appeared to be flat chested this tunic had wide sleeves and
reached all the way to the ground and this woman was gesturing with her arms
and seemed to be speaking though she didn't hear anything now the man had very similar facial features but his
hair was quite disheveled and he wore a light brown robe that also seemed to Sparkle with light it didn't reach the
ground but just down to his knees and from the knees down he wore a darker tunic which also flashed with light
light and had this strange design of wavy vertical lines on it now even
weirder both these figures had unusual yellowish skin and there was something
about their faces that sephina found quote repulsive though she couldn't say
exactly what it was and their behavior was unusual they just kind of stood there looking at her
with indifference and as they stood there sephina felt herself becoming overcome
with weakness and very quickly she began to pass out she just had time to sit
down on a stone next to her when she lost Consciousness now when she woke up it
was now dark she quickly ran back to her home arriving at about
8:50 this walk which would normally take about 20 minutes had lasted almost an
hour so at some point sephina opened her purse and found something very unusual
her identity card was missing also missing was the crown of her watch and
some of her used bus tickets so words spread quickly and some
men of the village went to search the area and they were joined the next day by the Civil guard they did find a few
of her bus tickets but there was still no sign of her watch or ID card there
was no other sign of anything else strange that was found found but that
night she suffered from nightmares waking up her mother when shouting out that there were quote beasts in the
house I mean it affected her quite strongly emotionally she remained in a State of shock for several days but did
quickly recover at no time did she see any UFOs but she does feel very strongly
that the strange flashes of light she saw came directly from these strange entities that she was face to face with
with what a strange case that is and I have to wonder if somewhere on some UFO
the witnesses ID card and used bus tickets are still up there I don't know
they were never found she had them before her encounter but afterwards they were gone impossible to say but
certainly an interesting detail to this fascinating case and now we have another
case which is equally fascinating I call this one a very close encounter it
occurred on November 1st 1980 in Hava Sweden it's a really compelling case
because there are two witnesses who had a very close encounter with the UFO and humanoids but there are also
corroborating Witnesses in the area who saw UFOs not only at that time but
around the same time as well so this is probably what's happening in most of
these cases that there's UFO activity preceding and following an encounter
it's just that most people don't report it so I'm glad the witnesses did report
it in this case and that this case was researched by investigators because
again most aren't most people don't report it and the cases that we do see are clearly just the tip of the iceberg
this case was published in the April 1981 issue of the Swedish publication
sarin and it involves two Witnesses who were sisters Christina ridol age 30 and
Nina grunden age 20 it began on a summer afternoon
actually in 1979 as Christina her husband and six-year-old daughter were taking a walk
by Lake Langan when something weird happened as Christina says we heard a
whistling sound and all of us saw a strange grayish blue oval object which
hovered and vibr ated in the air a while later this object disappeared towards
Oro this is very close to where she saw it and they didn't think too much about it not until one year later when the UFO
returned on this occasion it was 5:30 p.m. on November 1st 1980 as Christina
and again her younger sister Nina were driving along the road next to Lake
Langan near the small town of Hosta this this is where their family had a small summer Cottage and looking up both
sisters simultaneously noticed a bright object maneuvering in a strange large
counterclockwise circular pattern it could immediately tell that it was not a Plane by its movement and appearance in
fact Christina was a licensed pilot the unusual nature of the object became even
more obvious to both of them when it suddenly stopped moved lower in the sky
and appeared to make this strange vibrating motion so now had their full attention
the object then began to move again making another Wide Circle about a half mile wide this time it began to move
even closer to them so close that Christina who was driving stopped the
car and both of them asked each other what are we seeing to their amazement the object
moved directly towards them and by now it was at Treetop level and in moments
it was less than 50 ft away it was dark out at this time so
they couldn't really see the shape of the object clearly also because there were two brilliant lights shining from
the front of the object but they could see a wide curved window along one side
which seemed to indicate that the object was oval in shape but more amazing was
that they saw figures behind the window as Christina says inside we could see
two gray black creatures moving about as if they were walking to and
fro suddenly the two lights on the UFO went out the object seemed to move away
the sisters began to switch seats so Nina could drive now the car was running
the whole time so they don't know if the object was making any noise they couldn't hear any but nah pulled the car
onto the road and started to drive off when suddenly the car engine mysteriously stopped the headlights
failed and for the next 30 seconds the entire car began to shake and vibrate at
this point neither of them were able to move they felt as if they were quote locked up and Christina said she had a
weird oppressive feeling in her head and I'll just let her describe it as she
says it was like when you meet a large truck and the car gets blown by the wind
we sat there looking for the Curious object but there was nothing to be seen neither on the sides nor in the front or
back of the car maybe we thought it is immediately above our car as the
vibration stopped we rediscovered the object through the front screen and now
we were able to drive off we saw the object go back to its circular path and
return towards the kbur mountains at the back of it were red and possibly yellow
lights it was strange and we were terribly frightened I was shocked and had an uneasy feeling when I got home I
had many thoughts about the incident I called the tab airport but they had closed for the
day now later researchers after interviewing the sisters learned that
other people had seen the object at the same time of this sighting Kathy wodell
and her husband were only a few miles away in their home at nearby Rinke when
they saw r yellow lighted object circling at Treetop level they watched
it for several minutes as it moved off now on November 3rd just two days
after this sighting another witness gunar Peterson was in his home in the
adjacent town of Oro it was about 10 p.m. when he saw a brilliant and strange light shining
through his window and again I'll let gunar describe in his own words as he
says it was so strong that my attention was drawn from the TV what I saw
surprised me very much at a distance of no more than 400 m and at an altitude of
about 100 m Came Upon a cigar shaped object
floating it had a very strong greenish light and yellow windows in a row it
moved slowly and no sound was heard at the same time time my TV set went all
black and stayed so until the cigar had disappeared out of sight I have never
seen anything like it before what an unusual case that is with the UFO coming
so close and the car shaking as it did interestingly that is a detail that does
appear in a number of accounts not exactly sure what's going on there but perhaps the UFO the ETS are doing that
intentionally or it's a byproduct of the magnetic fields that are surrounding a
craft really hard to say for sure I just don't know but I can say that it has
been reported before and I also like that case because of the corroborating Witnesses including the gentleman whose
TV malfunctioned when a UFO came real close to his house so many interesting cases and this
next one is probably my favorite of this episode because it is quite unusual and
does again have multiple Witnesses and Landing traces I call this one picnic
with an extraterrestrial this occurred on April 26th 1984 in Italy more specifically in Mount
s Antonio this is a pretty rural area and a bunch of people were there
unfortunately only a few saw the humanoids and the UFO but enough to
provide multiple confirm and of course Landing traces were found
as well so it's a super fascinating case of a really unusual humanoid this case
involving multiple Witnesses and impressive Landing traces took place in a very rural area just west of momer
Italy in Sardinia this is a picnic and camping area known as Mount s
Antonio a large group of about 300 people from the cesari school had
gathered there including teachers parents and students they had just
arrived and were parking and bringing food in and starting to cook this area does contain picnic table benches
campsites fire pits some fences and of course the roadway and parking lot but
is otherwise Untouched by civilization one of the professors feder
Rico V went walking into the woods surrounding the area to look for some firewood and while doing so he heard a
strange rustling noise and saw strange flashes of light he also noticed that
the tops of some of the bushes were swaying around kind of like a helicopter
was about to land but of course there was no helicopter so this was unusual and he
returned to the campsite where the janitor was beginning to set up the cooking and he told him about it but the
janitor sort of dismissed it and said it was probably wild bores which were known to frequent the area
so they started cooking and setting up when two other people an adult by the name of Aldo c and a 10-year-old student
by the name of Pierre Luigi they decided to check out the area around the campsite and by coincidence
hiked out to where feder Rico had just been they were going to admire the natural setting and take some
photos reaching the area they both heard a strange banging noise kind of like an
axe hitting a tree and turning to look they were amazed at what they saw a very
strange humanoid standing only about 25 ft away with very short 3 to 3 and 1/2
ft tall robust strongly built it was only visible from the chest upwards but
they could see that it wore a light gray full body jumpsuit and a gray helmet
with these weird kind of golden spikes that seemed to shine with iridescent all
these different colors the helmet did Cover the entire head and had two small round holes where
the eyes would be now Pierre as he says it was like a Roman helmet that covered the whole face
it looked like an overturned pot with nails stuck in and metal leaves around
them now these spikes were about a few inches long covered the entirety of the
helmet and again seemed to change color as the figure moved moved now although
his description is a little different he said that the jumpsuit looked green and the helmet had what looked to him like a
visor but both also noticed apparently this craft sitting on the ground by a
dense row of trees just a short distance away Aldo the adult became upset and
asked young Luigi if he also saw the humanoid Luigi said yes and encouraged
Mr Aldo to remove the camera from his shoulder and take a photograph now Aldo
says he tried to do this but found himself mysteriously unable to do so he
said the camera seemed to suddenly become impossibly heavy to the point where I actually gave up on his
efforts the figure then held up one of its hands horizontally with the Palm facing upwards and moved the other on
top of it much in the manner Luigi says of writing on his palm that's what it looked like to Luigi and all the while
was staring at the two astonished Witnesses both Aldo and Luigi had the
impression that the covering on the figure's hand was metallic Aldo did say it looked almost like the being may have
had some kind of tablet or something in its hand at this point Aldo made further
efforts again to lift the camera but still was unable to do it all this time
an eerie silence enveloped the area all the CHP buring of the birds and the rustling of the leaves disappeared
completely everything was totally silent then something even more odd happened as
this figure continued to stare at them both Aldo and Luigi felt a strange
lightheadedness almost as if they were being levitated up into the air in fact
Aldo turned to Luigi and said tell me if I am up in the air Luigi looked and saw
that Aldo was still on the ground but Luigi says he also felt this strange levitating sensation and said it felt
like he was also quote in the air as Luigi says I looked at our feet and our
feet were on the ground though I saw everything lower I felt like I was taller so Aldo made yet another effort
to lift the camera and after great effort this time he was able to pull it off his shoulder but as soon as he
lifted it up to take a photo The Entity disappeared was just gone the two
witnesses at this point were quite unnerved and they ran back in a panic to the cooking area shouting out to the
janitor a UFO a UFO we saw a UFO they
estimate that this encounter lasted a full 10 minutes now another boy was standing
near the cooking area and he heard this loud hissing noise and looking towards the source of the sound saw a dome
shaped object with a flat bottom rise up about 15 ft from the ground at which
point it tilted showing a red Underside then darted off to the Northeast
disappearing from sight in about 20 seconds so Luigi was losing his mind at
this point he located his father and fearfully explained what happened the head teacher said that the other boys
were beginning to panic and to control the situation he told investigators they
actually decided to accuse Luigi of making up the the story and began to ridicule the teacher who as a result
would later refuse to speak to anybody about what happened needless to say discussion
about what happened continued and finally the head teacher Luigi's father
Luigi himself and feder Rico returned to the area where they had seen all of this
and found these weird circular Landing traces nearly circular about 13 ft wide
it looked like the grass and vegetation had been crushed and yellowed or burned
there were also two parallel grooves 6 fet long a few inches wide and 3 ft
apart depressed into the soil less than 1 in deep Luigi noticed several strange
Footprints a few where the entity had stood and a few next to the burned
section so lunch was served at this point but both feder Rico and Luigi were too shaken to eat and instead they
decided that they were going to go to the city of momer just a few miles to the east to make a report to the
newspapers unfortunately the office was closed so they returned only to find
that a young female student was now in tears she had been heard screaming
moments earlier and returning to the camp she said that she had seen this
strange humanoid apparently the same humanoid she said it was standing by a rock and seeming to write on it with a
pencil like instrument an undeniably amazing case with some really
interesting details I'm glad there were Landing traces I'm glad there were multiple Witnesses because that provides an extra
level of credibility to this account I also found it fascinating that the
witnesses described some really unusual effects both feeling the sense of lightness or even levitation makes me
wonder if there's something more going on there extra levels of contact that they were not aware of but it's also
fascinating because people often ask why doesn't someone take a picture and here we have a witness trying so hard to take
a picture but could not do it just could not get to his camera reporting this
real sense of heaviness of the camera to the point where he could not get it off his shoulder and finally broke free of
whatever this was and of course that's when the ET had had disappeared it's a
very interesting detail but certainly does turn up in a number of cases all right moving along and the
next case I'd like to talk about I call missing time in marabel this is another multiple witness
case August 2012 in marabel Canada and a really fascinating case
because not only are there two witnesses but they have some really interesting
issues in terms of what they remember about this encounter that alone is a
very important detail that I think speaks volumes about what actually happened here it was early August 2012
as an anonymous man and his girlfriend soon to be his wife were going for a ride on his motorcycle to enjoy the warm
weather in this area of Mirabel Canada so after a day of this it was
around 4:00 a.m. and they were driving the back roads they had just passed the autod Drome at St EES as you can see
here and they were moving at about 40 m hour when he noticed a light on the
horizon and he first wondered if it might be a bright star or perhaps a plane but it was unusual so he pointed
it out to his girlfriend and asked is that a star she replied that she had no
idea but together they kept an eye on it watching as it moved toward WS them becoming increasingly bright and they
were both puzzled because it seemed to be moving far too slow to be a plane it was also at a very low altitude right
over route 148 directly ahead of them so he sped up to intercept it realized that
he had miscalculated its speed it was going slower than he thought so he backtracked a short distance so he could
continue to watch this thing more closely he parked the bike they both got
off to better observe this object there was no other traffic on the road at this time and the next thing they knew this
object was directly overhead and the witness says he was struck with a beam of light as he says
in his own words heat pierced my body I was alone in the world as I tried to
accept what we saw my girlfriend who was a few yards to my left no longer existed
for me I was so entrenched in my bubble I lost all my bearings transfixed by the
lights on the object I could not under any circumstances stop
staring now he said that this object was now extremely close he felt like it was just feet away from him it was circular
it had a row of what looked like rectangular Windows around the edge kind of reminding him of store Windows he
said a rectangular box stuck out from the bottom of this object and it was
surrounded by powerful and very pure looking white lights so the object was
causing a gentle wind to blow down on them but most amazing was that there was
the silhouette of a humanoid looking down at him from one of the windows they both both watched as this
object moved slowly overhead over the field behind them then suddenly
something very strange happened as the witness says curiously we were promptly
Seated on the buik well before The Disappearance of the object on the horizon now the witness does not
understand this why they didn't stay off the bike to watch this object until it moved off but now all they could see was
a small red light moving away another weird thing is that they did not discuss
this sighting afterwards another detail he couldn't understand they just drove off as if nothing happened and didn't
think about it again in fact he pretty much for for got about it it wasn't until a few months later when a friend
of his Yan vad who happens to be a prominent Canadian UFO
researcher called the witness to talk about some of the recent sightings he had investigated and this is when the
witness immediately and spontaneously recalled his own encounter which shocked
him so bad he said it was like quote a punch in the face he turned to his wife
and told her about the sighting to his shock while she remembered the sighting she had no recollection whatsoever of
seeing a humanoid in the window so he's now pretty certain there was some kind of missing time he's
considering hypnosis I don't know if this was ever done and that is now where this case stands thus judging from the
witness's description of what happened to them and the fact that the wife has no memory of seeing the humanoid he
found himself suddenly back on his motorcycle the feeling that he had of being utterly alone in the world and
this pervasive silence all of these details Point towards a possible much
closer encounter I think the missing time really is a dead giveaway he has not undergone hypnosis
as far as I know but certainly a really fascinating case of a very close-up
encounter with a humanoid and now we move to the last case of this episode which is quite
unique and I call this one the alien in the rectangle it occurred on September
8th 2012 in a city in Russia called Penza
turova and I like this case because there does appear to be some interaction between the witness and this UFO and
humanoid it's quite an unusual description and I also like it because
it is a multiple witness case with another w witness seeing apparently the same object from a different perspective
so that makes it an important case we also don't hear a whole lot about cases
from Russia so that also I think makes it important and it points to what we
already know that these cases are going on all over this planet this last and
final case was investigated and illustrated by Russian researcher Vladmir
konikov of the Penza cosm po Group which is dedicated to studying
UFOs it was about 8:30 p.m. September 8 2012 as a Woman by the name of konova
yina dmitrievna noticed a dark red rectangular object floating in the
Western sky she said she could see it easily because it contrasted sharply against the darkness and it was about
she estimates maybe 300 to 350 ft away she estimates it was about 5 ft
long and maybe 2 and 1/2 ft wide now when she first noticed it it appeared to
be still in the sky but very quickly it began to move and descend towards her at
the same time seeming to change in shape to a trapezoid and it continued to move
towards her until it approached to a distance of about 150 ft very close and
this is when she noticed something amazing in the center of this object was a dark almost black figure with its legs
together and its arms extended from its side she says it kind of reminded her of
those little glowing figures you see at stoplights crosswalks now other than this being
less than 3T tall it did have normal human proportions again seemed to be
floating in the center of the object this object itself which had been a solid red now seemed to be overlapped
with a series of crisscrossing grid lines forming a series of diamond shaped
patterns no more than 5 in wide she estimates now kanova found herself
becoming weirdly elated at the sight of this object in fact she had the feeling
that the occupant of this object had noticed that she was observing it and had come closer specifically to allow
her a closer view she thought this particularly because it was facing her
directly once it reached its closest point it retreated it moved to the North
and then disappeared from view behind a neighbor's house and it was gone now
interestingly just over one month later on October 18 Again 2012 about 3 miles from Kanon noa's
sighting there was another incident the witnesses elanora pavona s Bina and she
was in her home in nearby machinski when she looked out her window
and saw an almost identically described object this glowing vertical red almost
rectangular object she said it did have a rounded top it was there was this
light coming from the top which sort of gave it this rounded appearance but she
said that this object was very close to the same size and width uh that the
other witness described Kanon NOA now she was able to get an accurate estimate of its size because it was
hovering very close to this nearby cell tower only about 900 ft away and there was again this brilliant
red light shining from the top this object was moving towards her when suddenly it appeared to split into two
both of which moved off pretty quickly into a cloud now there's a weird synchronicity because it was that same
evening that elanora was watching TV and k k noa's sighting was being aired on
the television so Elanor was struck by how identical the appearance was that of the
object she saw so she concluded pretty quickly that she had seen the same
object there you go 10 cases reaching all the way back to the 1900s up to 2012
all different types of humanoids coming from all over the world really closeup
interactions with humanoids it's so clear to me by this point that we are
not alone and I understand that there are Skeptics out there and I understand that people have different ideas about
who these guys are and where they come from which is fine and that's why I
present these cases in a factual basis just giving you the facts as we know
them and letting you guys decide for yourselves what's going on here so I
hope you've enjoyed this episode I really want to thank you for watching again it's because of you I do these
episodes so I truly appreciate all the support you give and the wonderful
comments and input on each episode and each case so thank you thank you thank
you and until next time keep searching for the truth because it's out there
keep asking those hard questions because it's up to us to find the truth our governments are not going to give it to
us and most of all keep having fun that's why we're here What would life be
if we weren't having fun so I'll see yall next time have a good week bye
