A ghost encounter can elicit a wide variety of emotions. They can be funny, sad, scary, awe-inspiring...and some can be downright creepy! This video presents three really creepy ghost stories, the kind that sends little icy shivers down your spine.

CASE ONE: THE GHOST THAT CAME TO BED. Shortly after moving into their new home in Merced, California, Sally Sanders (pseudonym) began to experience weird activity. Her husband never noticed anything strange, not at first. But Sally did. Late one evening, she woke up to feel someone climbing into her bed. But when she looked, nobody was there! She first thought it might have been her imagination, and that it would never happen again. But it did. A few weeks later, she again woke up to feel the mattress press down and the bedsheets rustle. But when she looked, nobody was there. As she always did when this happened, she fled the bedroom and slept elsewhere in the house.

It happened again and again, and Sally grew increasingly concerned. She knew that she had to take action. She decided to try an experiment. Knowing that the ghost always crawled into bed in the same spot, she moved the bed. This, she hoped, would stop the weird events from happening. Instead, it caused the haunting to escalate. It wasn't long after that when Sally not only felt the ghost crawl into bed with her, but this time it physically touched her!

Sally and her husband decided to move. But the ghost wasn't done with them yet. About two weeks before they moved away, the ghost attacked, crushing and trying to suffocate Sally as she lay in bed. It was the single most terrifying experience of her life.

CASE TWO: A VISION OF BLOOD. In the 1980s, Dorothy Hudson worked in a business office in Los Angeles. One of Dorothy's co-workers was Margery, (pseudonym), a bill-collector. Dorothy and Margery did not get along. One day the two of them got into a disagreement. The next morning, Margery was supposed to go pick up a debtor's check in Van Nuys, and come back to the office afterward. But Margery never showed up at the office.

Meanwhile, Dorothy was at the office and went to visit the restroom. Walking inside, she was shocked to see that the clean white tiles of the bathroom were dripping with blood. It was all over the walls and floors. Blood was everywhere. Dorothy blinked it shock. And when she looked again, it was gone.

A short time later, Dorothy answered the office phone. It was Margery's husband asking for Margery. Dorothy explained that his wife was supposed to pick up a check, but that she had failed to return to the office. "Oh, my God, no!" Margery's husband cried.

"What's wrong?" Dorothy asked. Margery's husband explained that he wasn't sure, but he had just received a call from the police, and he hung up the phone. A few hours later he called back with devastating news. Margery had been killed. She had been run over by a truck after picking up the check. Dorothy's boss visited the accident location and learned that Margery's body had been crushed under the wheels of the truck, and that blood was all over her car, the street and the sidewalk. The time of the accident was about the same time Dorothy had seen the vision of blood in the bathroom. Somehow, Dorothy had picked up on the terrible tragedy. It was an experience that sent chills down her spine and left her pale and shaken.

CASE THREE: A BROTHER'S GHOST. In the early 1970s, Tom and his older brother Jeffrey (pseudonyms) lived in a modest home with their parents in Los Angeles, California. The two of them were very close. Jeffrey had recently fallen in love with a woman and was about to get married. Then tragedy struck. Jeffrey was in a tragic car accident and died of his injuries at the scene. The entire family was devastated, but Tom was perhaps the most affected.

He spiraled into a deep depression. The senseless death of his older brother, whom he loved and idolized, was an event which left him with a crushing sadness. He just couldn't understand why his brother had been taken from him. Life no longer seemed worth living. 

Then one day, Tom ventured into his brother's room, sat on the bed, and began to play some of Jeffrey's rock music. Jeffrey loved to sit in his hanging chair and listen to rock music. A favorite song of his was "Comfortably Numb," by Pink Floyd. Tom decided to play that song and reminisce about the all the good times he had with Jeffrey. That's when it happened: the hanging chair began to swing back and forth by itself! Tom soon learned that he could call on his brother's spirit anytime he wanted.

These three cases show how ghosts can manifest in a wide variety of ways. If you'd like to learn more, check out my book, California Ghosts. Now available!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal it's 
October Halloween is approaching so in honor of that I thought I would present a show about ghosts 
I have three really creepy ghost stories I'd like to share with you today and in fact that's the 
title of today's episode three really creepy ghost stories each of these ghost stories is different 
and I think reveals a little bit about how ghosts manifest and the various types of hauntings that 
there are the first case I'd like to talk about I call case one the ghost that came to bed 
this involves lady I will call Sally Sanders who lived with her husband in a new home in Merced 
what would you do if you woke up one night feeling somebody crawling into bed with you and when you 
looked nobody was there and what if it happened not once or twice but over and over again what 
would you do Sally Sanders that's not her real name she did not have the luxury of forethought 
when this experience happened to her as I said she had just moved with her husband into their 
new home in Merced California and they had lived there for only a few months when she began having 
strange experiences every once in a while she would wake up in bed to feel someone crawling 
into bed with her when nobody was there it felt to her just like there was a person lying next 
to her on the bed the Bedwood Creek and the blankets would rustle as Sally says it was 
really funny but it scared me I never laughed when I was alone and I would go to bed I would 
get into bed and I would feel something get on the bed turn and lay down on his side of the bed 
and all I would do was get up and go into the other room and I would spend the night in there 
it was kind of scary I don't know what it was exactly but it was kind of weird 
so the first time this happened Sally was scared and upset but she figured 
it was a unique experience and that it wouldn't happen again 
she was wrong it happened again and then again and each time it was the same thing 
she would feel someone slip into bed and when she looked nobody was there each time she got 
more and more frightened and when it happened she always went into the other room to sleep 
and when it kept happening she became increasingly concerned that their ghost would never go away 
so one evening Sally decided to try an experiment since the ghost always laid down in the same spot 
she decided to move the bed to the other side of the room she was hoping it would make the ghost 
go away instead it appeared to make things worse as Sally says and I quote it stayed so long that 
I felt as though it was a bad experience so I turned my butt around it was that same spot 
it was where the end of the bed hit that spot and that ghost used to lay there one night it 
touched my toe I felt it I actually felt it it was weird it felt like something brushed my toe 
now at this point the haunting seemed to increase moving the bed around had only evidently made the 
ghost angry Sally however decided to stick it out but only for one reason they had decided to 
move out of the house Sally was very glad to be leaving the ghost was making her very concerned 
she knew she couldn't live with it much longer and that's when the ghosts apparently attacked 
as she says it was about two weeks before we were to move and I woke up one night when my husband 
woke me up and I couldn't breathe I had this feeling that something was on my chest I felt 
like something was sitting on my chest my husband woke me up and he said that I was making all this 
noise it was as if I couldn't breathe and it was really aggravating me and he woke me up 
but it felt like something was crushing me almost crushing me like I was an accordion 
it was really weird but it never bothered me again and we stayed there only another two weeks 
so Sally found this experience utterly terrified and terrifying and she was very happy to be moving 
she never experienced anything like that after she left she doesn't know who the ghost was or why he 
kept coming to her bed and she doesn't really care she just wants to forget about this experience 
and if she had it her way she would never think about it again so I think you'll agree that was 
a pretty creepy ghost story and the second ghost story I'd like to present to you today I call 
a vision of blood this involves a lady by the name of Dorothy Hudson I interviewed 
her first hand she had a very creepy experience involving what I would call a crisis apparition 
so her story actually takes place in Los Angeles California at a business office so 
I'll just quote Dorothy directly because she described her experience very vividly 
as Dorothy says one experience that I had was a very very emotional experience 
I was working with this woman that I did not get along with she was a bill collector she 
was just an ugly person inside and out and she and I had not an argument but a disagreement 
she left that day and we were not speaking to each other the next morning she was supposed 
to go out to Titus Street in Van Nuys to pick up a check that a person owed her they told her you 
come out there and pick up this check which once in a while she did but not very often 
she was going to pick up the check at 8 30 in the morning and be to work by nine 
but by 9 30 she didn't come into work and we didn't have a phone call from her which we thought 
was a little strange around 10 or 10 30 I went to the restroom the ladies restroom is all white 
I walked into the restroom and when I opened the door I saw blood spattered all over the floor all 
over the walls and then that flash went away it was a momentary thing and I said oh my God what 
the hell did that mean Dorothy just shook her head and tried to put the vision out of her mind 
she told one of her co-workers who thought that it was not a good sign Dorothy had already 
figured that much out but she hadn't connected it to her co-worker who was inexplicably late 
it wasn't until a few hours later that Dorothy found out what had caused her vision of blood 
as Dorothy says and I quote around 11 o'clock this woman her name was Marjorie her husband 
called and asked is Marjorie there and I told him no she went out to Titus Street in Van Nuys 
this morning to pick up a check and she hasn't called or anything and we don't know where she is 
he said oh no oh my God no I said what's wrong he said I don't know I just got a call from 
the police I'll call you later well a couple of hours later Dorothy says he called up and said 
that after Marjorie picked up the check she was jaywalking across the street to her car 
a Mayflower Moving Van did not see her coming backed up knocked her down on the ground and ran 
over and killed her my boss went to her car and he said that she was killed just a few feet from 
her car and that there was blood all over the street all over the car just blood everywhere 
and that whole incident happened when I saw blood all over the bathroom it happened approximately 
an hour after she was killed because she died at approximately 9 to 10 in the morning 
and it was 10 o'clock when I went into the restroom 10 15. 
and I knew something was wrong someplace there was a lot of blood she was literally run over by 
this truck a huge big Mayflower van it was kind of traumatic for me to walk into a room and see 
blood spattered all over the walls but it was just a flash I came back in I told my boss's daughter 
I just really had a bizarre thing happened I just walked into the bathroom and I saw this she said 
oh my God Something's Happened to somebody and I said I don't know but it never dawned on me that 
it would be Marjorie someone that I immediately worked with or that it would happen within the 
hour that she died and the third case I'd like to talk about today I call a Brother's ghost 
this is a very poignant story about a young man who lost his older brother to a tragic accident 
and how his brother's Spirit appeared to him and let him know that he is still all right 
one of the saddest of all of life's tragedies is the death of a child when a young life 
is cut short it is much different than the death of someone who has lived a long life 
the death of children is hard to understand and for many of the surviving family members the grief 
can be overwhelming not only do the parents have trouble adjusting to the lost but the deceased 
person's siblings can be just as deeply affected Tom Walker that is a pseudonym of Los Angeles 
California was living a normal life with his mother father and brother then in the early 1970s 
Tom's life was drastically Changed by the death of his older brother Jeffrey that's also a pseudonym 
but Jeffrey had a good job at the time and was about to be married when he was involved 
in a tragic car accident he died at the scene of fatal injuries sustained in this accident 
Tom his little brother was of course devastated by his brother's death 
he became very depressed and couldn't stop thinking about what had happened he simply could 
not let go of the brother whom he had idolized and loved and for many weeks afterwards he remained 
gloomy not wanting to live a life that suddenly seemed so empty his parents tried to help but they 
were also distraught by Jeffrey's death and there was little they could do then offered their love 
Tom's friends were also unable to lift him out of his dark depression everyone knew that Tom 
was depressed by his brother's death but nobody realized how far his depression actually went 
however his love for his brother was so strong that he found a way to transcend 
the barrier between life and death before his death Jeffrey the older brother who died 
had his own room and in his room he had a large swinging chair hanging from a hook in the ceiling 
this was a heavy chair so he used metal chains to hang the chair and one of his favorite things 
to do was to sit in this chair and swing back and forth while listening to rock music 
Tom would often find his brother spending his time this way 
and it was a few weeks after Jeffrey's death that Tom made a bizarre discovery he had been mourning 
the loss of his brother and For Old Times Sake he had been playing some of the rock music his 
brother used to listen to while swinging in this chair so one day mourning the loss of his brother 
Tom decided that he would just go into his brother's room and play some of the rock music 
that his brother used to listen to while swinging in the chair he turned the music on very loud 
and just sat on the bed imagining and remembering what it was like when his brother was still alive 
and suddenly to Tom's amazement the hanging chair began to Creak and slowly move back and forth in 
less than a minute it was swinging back and forth in huge arcs just as if somebody was sitting on it 
Tom stared at the swing in awe he knew instantly what was making the swing move or rather who 
it was his brother there was no doubt in his mind whatsoever he just knew that it 
was his brother sitting in that chair at that moment listening to the music in fact he could 
literally feel Jeffrey's presence eventually the swing stopped however Tom was transformed 
his brother was still alive he was a ghost yes but he was still around 
Tom was delighted and it wasn't long before he tried to call his brother's ghost again his spirit 
and Tom soon discovered that he could call his brother to the swing anytime he wanted 
all he had to do was turn on the tape player to high volume and play a certain song 
the song was Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb and every time Tom played this particular song the 
swing would start to rock back and forth by itself just as if somebody was sitting on it 
Tom couldn't believe what was happening and finally he decided to share his secret with 
someone he chose his good friend Christine Dennett one day he invited Christine over and told her his 
secret that he could call on the spirit of his dead brother for her if she wanted him to do so 
So Christine was a little bit shocked a little bit concerned but she saw no reason why not to 
try it and see if he was telling the truth it sounded interesting and Tom certainly was sincere 
she was sure he wasn't joking but she could hardly believe her eyes when Tom turned on 
the music and the chair began to move all by itself as Christine says and I quote 
he had a chair that hung from a chain that didn't touch the ground it was a swinging chair 
and he said that he could get his dead brother to sit in the chair and swing it when the music was 
on and it turned the music on really loud and the chair would swing I saw it happen he would just 
turn on the music and the chair would slowly start in a teeny little swing and then get bigger and 
bigger and bigger and then it would just swing all by itself nobody was there making it swing and it 
was a heavy chair but it was taught as if somebody was sitting on it it wasn't floating in any way 
Christine tried to figure out how this event could have been faked but it seemed impossible 
the chair was behaving exactly as if somebody was swinging in it Tom seemed very casual about 
the whole Affair and seemed comfortable with the knowledge of his brother's Spirit was still around 
this incident convinced Christine even more that ghosts were real she had had previous encounters 
but she had never experienced anything like this but for Tom it made all the difference 
in the world he slowly lifted out of his depression and began to lead a normal life 
he eventually stopped calling his brother's Spirit as there was simply no need to do so 
he was satisfied he now knew that life continues after death and one day he would see his brother 
again and this is just one more case of how love can trisan transcend all barriers including death 
so those are the three really creepy ghost stories I wanted to present to you today 
I did write about them in my book California ghosts so if you want to learn more about them 
you can check that out but the reason I wanted to do this video today is to not 
only let you know that ghosts are real but how they can manifest in a variety of ways 
the first case the ghost that came to bed is an active haunting and shows how people 
can interact directly with ghosts even to the point of touching them and feeling them 
this was quite a negative encounter for the witness and she is happy to forget about it 
the second case is really interesting because this is a good example of what investigators call 
a crisis apparition well technically she didn't see an apparition she got Advance warning that 
someone she knew had passed away often people who have a crisis Apparition it involves someone that 
they know well or are emotionally attached to in some way what's interesting about this case is 
Dorothy and Marjorie were not really getting along they weren't exactly friends in fact they were 
angry at each other but there was an emotional connection there so I think that is probably why 
Dorothy had this vision of blood I think it's also probably because Dorothy herself is a bit psychic
and the third case a Brother's ghost the reason I wanted to present that is because it shows how 
powerful love is to the point that even it can even transcend death and this I wouldn't call a 
haunting I would call this a spirit visitation I'm pretty sure the brothers knew he had passed 
on and really just came to visit his little brother to let him know that he's still fine 
so those are the three cases I hope you've enjoyed this episode today I 
really appreciate you watching and until next time keep searching for 
answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun happy Halloween
