IN THE PRESENCE OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS: TEN TRUE CASES
Feb 2, 2024

Summary:
Feb 2, 2024
In the presence of extraterrestrials! There is no experience quite like it. Seeing a UFO is interesting, but having a face-to-face interaction with an ET brings things to a whole new level. And it happens more often than you might think. This video presents ten extensive encounters in which people have been in the presence of ETs. These cases come from all over the world, involve a wide variety of witnesses and span six decades. Many have multiple witnesses and physical evidence.

A UFO LIKE A SILVER BULLET. One day in Aug 1956, a young boy, “CS,” played football with his friends in Badajoz, Spain. Suddenly a loud roar filled the sky, and looking up, they saw a silver, bullet-shaped object zoom towards them at fantastic acceleration, slow down, and then stop. And inside they saw two figures. About 30 people ran forward, gesturing for the UFO to land. The ETs waved back, but then flew away.

US OR THEM? One evening in autumn of 1965, Keith Meiers (a farmer) looked out the window of his farmhouse in Ross, ND and saw a landed flying saucer in his field. Inside, through a transparent dome, he saw two human-looking figures. He used the telescope on his rifle to get a closer look, until the craft silently departed. The next day, he went to the spot and saw three depressions in the field. Was it alien or military?

YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW THE WORLD. On Jul 2, 1968, Oscar Iriart (age 14) was horseback riding near his home in Sierra Chica, Argentina when he saw two odd-looking human figures. A small flying saucer sat on the ground behind them. They told Oscar that later they would take him for a ride. They gave him a note and returned to their craft, which took off, leaving three holes in the field. Later that night, the UFO returned.

EVERYTHING IS GOD. One night in Jul 1968, Walter Rizzi was driving through the Dolomite Mountains of Italy when he came upon a landed craft. Walking up to it, he saw a short humanoid figure who held a long conversation with Walter about their craft, themselves, their home-world, their agenda, the meaning of God, and even future Earth prophecies. Walter begged them to take him with them, but they refused.

HUMANOIDS IN THE TIJUCA FOREST. In Aug 24, 1974, Regina Conceiacao and four friends stood in front of a home in Alto da Boa Vista, Brazil. Suddenly, they saw two figures, clad in shimmering golden space suits, floating two feet above the road and moving towards them. They fled in fear. Only days earlier, numerous people had seen floating humanoids in the Tijuca Forest which surrounds the area.

“I CAN’T GET IT OUT OF MY MIND” One night in Jul 1975, Frank Slotta and his family drove near their home in Edgewater, British Columbia, Canada and saw a strange light hovering by the road. Later, Frank, now alone, returned along the same road and saw the light again, only this time he saw it was a craft, with occupants visible inside. He became entranced. The next thing he knew, almost two hours had passed.

I DIDN’T DARE SAY ANYTHING. As 10-year-old Jean-Claude Silvente returned to his home in Domene, France on the night of Jan 5, 1976, he was shocked to see a dome-shaped craft land next to him. A door opened and out stepped a tall, blond-haired human-looking figure who chased Jean-Claude. He ran home in fear. The next day he saw the figure again. Soon, many people in the area saw UFOs and aliens.
 
I SAW A FIGURE! On the night of Jan 19, 1976, Kay Peterson and Vi Camp stepped out of their home in Heislerville, NJ and saw a huge UFO hovering nearby. They called out the neighbors and all of them watched as the craft moved overhead and stopped. One of the witnesses saw a humanoid inside a clear part of the craft. The craft left, but people all over the area began reporting UFOs, including the police.

THE BRANCEPETH LEPRECHAUN. At 7:10 am, on Jan 2, 1995, Diana Newton drove along the A690 Road in Brancepeth when she noticed a short little man walking alongside the shoulder. Slowing down, she was shocked to see that he was yellow in color and had large dark eyes and no hair. He bobbed along in a strange bouncing gait. Frightened, she took off. Weirdly, the experience left her mind for a full day.

UNABLE TO MOVE. One night in Nov 2008, Segundo Godoy Lopez was working on top of a building in downtown Santiago, Chile when he saw a strange aircraft approach. Next, it came to within 30 feet of him, and he could see two short, bald, gray figures inside staring directly at him. He tried to alert his co-workers but found himself paralyzed. Finally, the UFO moved away. But Segundo would never be the same.

These ten fascinating cases show that there are many types of ETs visiting our planet, and that a close encounter can happen to anyone, perhaps when they least expect it. They show how truly strange a UFO encounter can be, and that being in the presence of ETs is something that affects a person profoundly for the rest of their lives.

Hello everyone welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal today's
episode is called in the presence of extraterrestrials 10 true cases as you
know if you watch this show I absolutely love talking about ETS humanoids aliens
call them what you will but to me face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials are the most
interesting kinds of all UFO cases there's so much to learn from them
they're just so darn fascinating there's so many of them they provide all kinds
of evidence and really answer a lot of the questions about what it's like to have contact and why the ETS are here
where they come from what their agenda is and so forth so these 10 cases I've
chosen today are mostly little known cases I love digging up those ones that
most people haven't heard of before and as as always they come from all over the world so I've got cases from Canada got
cases across Europe England Italy Spain France as well as across South America
Brazil Argentina Chile and of course all across the United States and the cases
I've picked today start way back in the 1950s and move all the way up through the 2000s so some pretty recent cases as
well and as always involving a wide variety of humanoids all types of
evidence lots of multiple witness cases and cases with unique and interesting
elements that I think have something to provide something to help us understand
what it's like to have ET contact so this is going to be a long episode let's get started in the first
episode I'd like to talk about today I call a UFO like a silver bullet and this
took place in August 1956 in badja
Spain I like this case because it's a quite early case it's pretty unusual
it's a clear example of a UFO display ETS showing themselves off and it's also
got a whole lot of witnesses the primary witness in this case one of 30 Witnesses by the way has
requested anonymity and is known only by his initials
Cs and it was one sunny afternoon around 2 p.m. in August of
1956 and the witness CS was about 5 years old and he was playing football
with a group of about 20 other kids in a large Meadow that all the kids used this
was in the village of grna day Torah Hermosa and this is where they would
play each day and so they're out there playing football when suddenly a roaring
noise fills the air and coming from a distance was this silver bullet shaped
object swooping over the houses in the distance and coming towards
them now I will just quote the witness directly he did give an interview in
French and I found the original article with his testimony and as CS says in his
own words we saw a machine arrive at fantastic speed and there were two guys
inside it arrived by doing this he made a circular motion the object came roughly from the
north towards the west then veered towards the east it happened like that we were playing it passed over us and
stopped 500 M away as it arrived we heard a strange absurd noise first we
heard the noise we were playing football and it was because of the noise that we began to look
it was like a jet plane a very loud noise it was an extraordinarily loud noise it was crazy it's incredible speed
but it stopped like an arrow in a straight line I don't know what they were doing but they seemed to be looking
at us then people from the street came running women especially because the men
were at work in the fields or elsewhere they were alerted by the noise and cries
of others we had never seen a machine like that it started to slow down and we
started running behind it slowed down more and more and stopped a half kilometer away it happened very quickly
a very rapid deceleration and then hovered in the air without anything
touching the ground about 3 m from the ground and there were two guys in it I
couldn't tell you how it was made it was transparent but not all of it we could see inside we saw the people but we
could couldn't see their legs we only saw the head and shoulders I thought they were sitting because it wasn't very
wide the thing maybe 1 meter in diameter so everyone there was totally
amazed nobody had ever seen anything like it and many of them were familiar with aircraft having recently been
through a war this object was sleek and shiny metallic they said it looked like
aluminum and as CS says we could see the heads of the two men inside so there
were 30 people who came running and at least I was one of the last because I
was kicking the ball I had to pick it up so let's say I was 30 or 40 m behind the
others but everyone was running and then when they were about 50 m from this
object it took off again and it was out of sight of us in a second practically
it went away like a bullet at fence fantastic speed I've never seen before it left like that towards the
east so this craft left when the people had gotten pretty close to it about 150
ft and the main witness got close enough to see that these figures inside did not
appear to be wearing any flight suits he said they had a skin color unlike anything he'd ever seen as he says quote
kind of greenish though otherwise he says they looked human but he did also
see what looked like some sort of antenna on the top of their heads and he had the very strong impression that the
occupants of The Craft had stopped intentionally so that everyone could see it and in fact after it stopped the
figures inside the craft turned their heads and looked at all the witnesses
some of the witnesses at this point waved at the occupants gesturing for them to land the occupants waved back
but instead of Landing took off and strangely afterward as we see in so many
of these cases there wasn't much talk about it at all but as the main witness
CS says it made a huge impression on me it was something he would remember for
the rest of his life certainly an interesting case I think it's even more interesting that the witnesses waved at
the ETS and they waved back before quickly taking off so a really unusual
case but there are others like it and here's another one which I really wanted to include because I think it has some
interesting takeaways to it I call this one us or them and this took place in
the fall of 1965 in the very small town of Ross
North Dakota actually outside of Ross North Dakota I like this case because it
was professionally investigated by a mufon researcher and it involves a classic
Flying Saucer with humanoids but are they ET or could they
possibly be humans so this is a case which I think we need to take a real
close look at this case was investigated by Richard Moss of muon the mutual UFO
Network and again it shows how careful you have to be when trying to determine the nature of a UFO landing with
occupants and it took place just outside of the very small town of Ross North Dakota and the main witness is a farmer
by the name of Keith Meyers and in fact the incident took place on his farm it
was a moonlit night around 11:00 p.m. one evening in the fall of
1965 Keith was inside his house looked out the window and noticed a strange
object had landed in his Fields reflecting in the Moonlight not too far
away not super close either and as Keith says I saw the craft after noticing
light reflecting off of it I then took a rifle with a good scope set it on the
window ledge and viewed the craft I could see it had two occupants in Flight
helmets and wearing military type flight suits I could see faces through the
helmets after I switched my refractive telescope they were human and I presumed
most probably military so while the figures did appear to be human looking the craft most
definitely did not look conventional and as you can see from the drawing made by
the witness it appeared to be very much your classic Flying Saucer and as Keith
says in his own words the craft was grayish silver saucer shaped with three
supports or tripod struts a windshield wrapped partly around the craft in front it had what I now assume
were flight surfaces but but not flaps or such as traditional winged craft
used it sat there for perhaps less than an hour I was doing something in my room
while I sat on my desk watching it my eyes got tired viewing through the scope
and when I looked up it was gone no engine sound or Roar
so Keith wasn't quite sure what to make of this so the next morning he decided
he would go to investigate the landing location and as he says in his own words
I did go to where I thought the craft had sat and in rather freshly cultivated
field the pads made imprints about an inch and a half to 2 in so this was a solid object clearly
wasn't his imagination something had landed there but he was puzzled human or
ET us or them either way what was it doing in his
field and a few days later he received some startling additional information
about this encounter as he says in his own words while driving back roads we noticed an
enclosed wagon setting off the road in a real rural area with an Air Force pickup
sitting beside it an Airman was standing with an M16 on guard we stopped and
began talking with him and eventually with the two others inside and asked them what they were doing as it had a
radar dish on top of the wagon they replied that they were supporting helicopters while the minute man
missiles were being installed however perhaps after about 2
hours or so I asked the first Airmen what they were really up to and I told
him about the craft I had seen he said said that's what they were really up to
supporting this new surveillance craft so here we have a military officer
telling a farmer that the Flying Saucer he saw was military but again if so what
was it doing Landing in Keith Meyers field and furthermore what is a military
officer doing revealing State Secrets could this have been a deliberate misleading of the witness I don't know
the witness came way believing it was a military craft but again it shows that
just because someone sees a landed UFO with occupants you can't assume anything
really about where it's coming from so as I said I mean you can't be careful enough when interpreting these cases I
think it's very possible that that was in fact reverse engineered ET technology
then again can't be sure I find it quite unusual that they would just land right
in this farmer yard like that I also find it unusual that the military
officer that the witness spoke to admitted so freely that this was ours
could that be sort of a red herring or disinformation I don't know again you'll
have to make up your own mind about it but I thought it was important to include because this question is
something we do need to take a close look at and here's another case which I
think is clearly extraterrestrial this one did get quite a bit of publicity I'm not sure you've
heard it before though it is fairly well known in its country of Argentina and I
call this one you are going to know the world this is mostly a single witness
case involving a young teenager however there were some outside supporting Witnesses it took place on July 2nd
1968 during a huge wave of sightings in this area the actual location of this encounter
was Sierra chica Argentina and it's quite an unusual case
with some very interesting physical evidence and a very unusual to say the
least interaction with extraterrestrials who look largely human but clearly
aren't quite like us the main witness in this case is 14-year-old Oscar
iriart and he had an experience which would cause a local sensation in his small town of Sierra chica
Argentina now at the time he was working as a bookkeeper at a local bakery so
he's an upstanding young man but it was around 11:30 a.m. he was horseback
riding not too far from his home he had his young puppy with him and as he came
around a bend in the road he saw two men ahead of him gesturing for him to
approach they were out in the field and kind of approaching towards the road and he
thought at first that they were bird Hunters he says they were 5 and 1/2 ft
they had short white hair they wore red shirts white pants black shoes but they
were unusual looking for sure and they looked identical as Oscar says apart from the
constant unblinking way in which they gazed fixedly at me with their deep set eyes
they might have been just any ordinary men such as we see every day here in Sierra chica I approached and they told
me to get off the horse and that they were going to take me so I did and they
told me they were carrying a load they said they came loaded so at this point they pointed to
a landed craft just a short distance behind them in a culvert in this field
and according to Oscar this craft with saucer shaped silvery metallic not very
big about 6 ft long very thin it stood on three Landing legs as he says the
apparatus was oval with three legs I couldn't see anything
inside so at this point one of the men spoke to him in Spanish out loud and
said you are going to know the world and Oscar said yes of course when
I have money enough and the visitor the visitor said no we will take you we
cannot take you now as we have a big load now at this point Oscar started to
notice some very unusual features in fact it looked like these guys legs
looked almost transparent he could see the barbed wire fence behind them through their legs so this was very
confusing to him but he became distracted when one of the men reached down and handed Oscar a
note and he said it had a message for him but first before reading this note
this man asked Oscar to dip the note into a puddle of water a strange request certainly but
Oscar did as he was told he walked up to a nearby puddle the two men walked right
behind him following him and as he dipped this paper in the water he was
surprised to see that it remained completely dry and so did his hands
so that was very unusual and this is when he looks down at the note and reads the message which is written in
Spanish and uh there were the words you are going to know the world and it was
signed P saucer or apparently signed you can see the note
here now this is very strange uh the word u isad in Spanish was missing the
last letter D so it's appear appear to be very crudely written now at this point the men walked
back over to the craft kind of lifted the top climbed inside and closed it at
this point very quickly the machine took off vertically at high speed in total
silence but with a brilliant flash of light and in just a few seconds it was a
tiny spot high in the sky and was gone and as Oscar says in his own words
I didn't feel anything strange they talked to me and I answered them I didn't feel anything those who study say
they spoke to me by telepathy but I saw that they spoke to me as you are talking to me now finally when they left they
told me they weren't taking me because they were carrying cargo the apparatus opened upwards and the two guys got in
like that standing inside I didn't feel any noise or anything and it went
straight up without a sound until it was lost so at this point Oscar felt almost as if
he was waking up from a dream or something but realizing he had experienced something very unusual fear
flooded through him and he wanted to rush home but as he approached his horse
he found that his horse was paralyzed and so was his dog they couldn't move
and they remained that way for the next 5 minutes which absolutely freaked him out but finally they broke out of this
paralysis Oscar got on his horse and galloped the Half Mile home crazed I
mean some people saw him and were surprised at the state of his panic and fear arriving home his parents were very
concerned by his wild-eyed terrified State uh he very excitedly told them
what had happened showed them the note so they were astonished by this somewhat
skeptical and disbelieving but they could see that their son was very emotionally distraught so they and some
neighbors immediately returned to the spot where Oscar said this happened and
they were amazed to see three holes in the ground in the shape of a triangle a perfect oses triangle 6 feet on one side
and 4 and 1/2 ft on the other two and the holes were about five or so Ines
deep so words spread fast and military officials from nearby olaria showed up
to take soil samples meanwhile Oscar's father ariberto
Antonio art went to the police and reported the incident to Sergeant rul
coronell who refused to take any action refused to take the story seriously he
believed it was just too ridiculous to be true but events weren't over yet
because that evening this Sergeant Sergeant coronell was at the Sierra
chica social club with a group of other men and they began talking and joking
about this incident in Oscar's crazy experience and all of them were
skeptical but just on a lark they decided to go visit the landing site
they brought a powerful flashlight they arrived at around 11:15 p.m. went to the
area they verified that there were holes in the ground but they thought that
these holes could have been easily faked the soil was quite loose but that that's
when one of these men his name is Carlos Mar Marin Angeli he's a butcher he
shouted out to the others look out a light is coming in our Direction and
they all looked and sure enough there was this brilliant object approaching them it was only a few meters above the
ground but it was zigzagging in the strange pattern towards them and the men
became quite frightened they threw themselves to the ground and as the light approached them and in fact the
sergeant Sergeant coronell pulled out his revolver and was about to shoot at the light when the other men dissuaded
him told him it probably wasn't a good idea this point the object moved across the field suddenly increased in speed
then immediately darted straight upwards at super high velocity and was gone so
needless to say all five of the men were convinced now that UFOs were real that
probably Oscar had described a real experience and they returned to the station where they were questioned by
the other police there and reporters and they described what they saw and said
yes the flying saucers do exist not surprisingly Sergeant coronell
was chastised later by his superiors for talking to the Press without first having submitted a report to
them but this just created an absolute interest in what Oscar had experienced
and soon crowds of people began to mob the eie Arts to stake out the field
where these UFOs had been seen no the neighbors did say that the irie Arts were respectable family and
Oscar's whole family stood by him as Oscar says everyone in my family belied
me because they know me as a child as I am I'm Catholic now we wasn't a strict
Catholic but apparently he's known as an honest child and in fact his mother said
that Oscar refused to set foot in that field for nearly a year afterwards
that's how frightened he was nor did he want to go out at all because everyone wanted to talk to him about what had
happened and as she says now he doesn't talk about those things
anymore now in further support of Oscar's experience is the fact that during this time Argentina was
experiencing a massive wave of UFO activity in fact as investigated by
Argentine researcher Gustavo Fernandez just a few weeks after Oscars
encounter the same month and about 50 miles away in toalk
Argentina three soldiers of the Argentine Army said that They Came Upon
three humanoids and a landed craft these humanoids were just walking around the craft they went to investigate and get
close but as they approached they said the ETS shot a beam of light at them at
this point they weren't unable to move and could not move until these ETS got
back in the craft which departed so certainly a fascinating
series of events oh yeah I mean I don't know that casaste is really unusual
given that the kid was given a paper note by the ETS and honestly I probably
would have dismissed it if not for the outside supporting Witnesses and the landing traces and the fact that his own
family really stands behind him and believes he was telling the truth about
it because it's such an unusual case it's definitely a bit of an outlier but
appears to be legitimate and this witness was followed up through the
years and he's still sticking to his story to this day so make up make of it
what you will because there's always another case uh and that's what's so amazing about
this phenomena is the huge number of cases I've said it before but it Bears
repeating the general public has no real idea just how common this is and again
most people don't talk so we're just looking at the tip of the iceberg here and here is another case which is
probably my favorite in this little collection because wow this witness was
able to converse with the ETS and just get loads of information about them I
call this uh this particular
segment everything is God and yeah a very unusual case which took place in
July of 1968 grod pass in the Dolomite mountains
of Italy it is a single witness case though there is physical Landing traces
in support of it there are some who are skeptical of it but honestly I think
this case is legitimate given the details that this gentleman
describes uh in fact you can hear a firsthand interview with him if you search out the internet I know the
channel eyes on Cinema covered this case briefly but it definitely is worth
taking a deeper look into because it's a fantastic case the main witness in this
case is Walter Rizzy and as I said his encounter occurred in July of
1968 but there's a little bit of a prequel to this case because back in
1942 Walter Rizzy was working as an interpreter between the Italian and
German air forces in Greece and it was here that he had the opportunity to meet
a local holy man who was allegedly more than 100 years old and gifted with all
kinds of psychic ability astral travel to other worlds he says would give
Prophecies of the future and things like this and so he sort of became friends with this holy man and at one point this
holy man told Walter Rizzy that one day in his future he would have an encounter
with quote beings from the cosmos and Walter was very impressed
because the old man had already shown him many miraculous things then decades later one evening in
July of 1968 Walter was driving through the grodner pass in the Dolomite mountains
of Italy and be came fogged in so he had to pull over as the fog was so thick it
was too dangerous to navigate the pass and he pulled over and was dozing in his
car when he woke up because he could smell something burning and he thought
it might be his car which was turned off but going outside clearly wasn't his car
and then through the Mist he saw a brilliant bright light and as the Mist
parted he saw this quote enormous thing which had landed on the ground not too
far away from him now he instantly thought of the Holy man's prophecy that was given to him many years earlier and
realized that the prediction was likely now coming true and he became filled
with this fantastic excitement he quickly grabbed his flashlight and approached the craft but he discovered
something very interesting he could only get so close to it before he hit a strange invisible barrier he tried to
get closer but he couldn't something was holding him back so he just stared up at the craft in amazement and as Walter
says in his own words the object was wonderfully beautiful silvery in color
and about 80 m in diameter standing on three legs about 2 m long and about 2 m
thick at the bottom the UFO was bathed in a fleecy white light the transparent
coua on the top of the craft now lit up brightly and I saw two beings in it who
were looking down at me on the right hand side of the machine there was a
robot about 2 and A2 M high and with three legs and four arms you can see it
pictured here and as Walter says it was holding the outside of the craft and
making it rotate from the center of the craft came a beam of light Violet and
orange in color and from within this beam of light I saw coming down out of
the craft a being dressed in a tight fitting suit and with a glass Hood over
the head he came right up to me until was no more than 1 meter from
me so Walter says that this being was just under 5T tall had a wide head short
hair kind of looked like fur he said wide set slanted green blue cat-like
eyes a very small nose and mouth very smooth olive green skin broad shoulders
a very thin body and he says that this figure held up its hand Palm first in
greeting and as Walter says I find it quite impossible to describe the emotion
produced in Me by the sight of this being he had very beautiful eyes which
gave me a strange and very sweet sensation I felt myself as free and
light as a feather at the same time I also felt quite calm and I gazed at him
eagerly now it was at this point that a lengthy telepath conversation ensued and
in fact as soon as Walter was able to form a question in his mind it was
instantly answered he first asked where do they come from and the being replied
that their planet is 10 times the size of Earth and has two sons resulting in
very long days and just a brief night he said they have vegetation and animals
very much like ours but of slightly different shapes and sizes says that
they have very high mountains and immensely tall trees the being told Walter that all
their work is done automatically that they are able to accomplish all kinds of physical tasks
using psychic abilities he said that they subsist on fruit and vegetables and
Grains Walter is asking all these questions and he's answering them he said that they have cured pretty much
all illness and disease on their Planet this said Earth's gravity was quite
light for them and in fact that matched what Walter said because as this being
approached it kind of approached to him in a light hopping Manner and so he's
staring at this being and he asked this being was he a man or a woman and the
being replied that he was neither and that they reproduce in ways that are different from ours at this point Walter
reached out to touch him but felt this same sort of magnetic force field which
prevented him from approaching the craft he tried a couple of times to reach out and touch this being but could not do
it and the being started to describe the craft and told Walter that he was
looking at a smaller craft and that it actually came from a mother ship which was the same basic shape but much larger
about 5 kilm in diameter and that it contained many other craft both man and
unmanned uh Walter asked how they travel throughout the Universe and they said that they use what he would think of as
a magnetic Drive they said that they could not stay too long in Earth's
system as it causes them to age rapidly but when he asks how old they were he
says that they live about a hundred times longer than humans at one point Walter asked them if
they had defensive weapons and the being said that they can disintegrate anything even at Great
distance and offered to actually demonstrate this to Walter he instructed
Walter to throw a rock at the craft so Walter picked up a rock and threw it at
it as he says I hurled the stone with all my might right at the coupa
whereupon a whitish lilac lilac colored beam of light shot out from it and the
stone EXP loaded with a dull report and I saw not even a single fragment of it
fall to the ground so this was absolutely a very long involved conversation as Walter
says I asked him why they are not willing to help us with their technology
and remain on our planet and also how long it would be before we had their
kind of Technology he gave me to understand that first there are not allowed to interfere
in the development of another planet secondly he said we would never reach
their level of evolution since the crust of our planet is far too variable and
that in the near future there will be a displacement of our poles in the process of the adjustment
to this polar shift an enormous crack would develop on the surface of our planet and this would entail an upheaval
on the earth that would destroy 80% of all living things here leaving the
survivors to carry on in a habitable strip of the planet so this was quite alarming that
certainly does match up with what other Witnesses have learned from the
ETS and then Walter asked the ET if they believed in God he said the ET seemed
surprised by the question and said that quote everything is God we nature the
planets rocks grass in fact everything that
exists and it was about this time that the robotic looking device began to float up and
enter into the craft and Walter understood that it was time for the ET
to go the other being that was still up in the Koopa made a gesture of acknowledgement to Walter Walter then
asked them for an artifact of theirs and the being said no as it would be harmful
to him to Walter at this point overcome with emotion Walter began weeping and he
actually knelt down and first asked and then begged for the ET to take him with
them he was ready to leave Earth and everything behind but the ET said that no neither Walter nor anyone from Earth
can go with them but that he was very lucky to have met them and had this
conversation the being then returned to the craft and Walter says this force field pushed
him uh a further distance from the craft and at this point the craft grew dim
this opposing force field pushed Walter further away and the craft then lit up
Rose from the ground made a loud whistling sound and shot straight up at
super high speed and disappeared at this point Walter became
absolutely overcome with despair he realized he was covered with sweat he
returned to his car in a complete days after recovering he went to his destination he tried to tell his family
and friends what happened was very disappointed to discover that they were
skeptical and because of that he ended up keeping secret about his encounter for about a
decade however he did return to the site about 20 days later and saw Impressions
on the ground where this heavy craft had pressed into the soil he also noticed
something else the grass around the area where this craft had landed was three
times larger than any of the grass around it another thing he noticed his
watch began losing about 2 hours per day and for a month after the encounter he
said he was unnaturally tired and did experience some hair loss thankfully he
did recover from this but overall the only lasting effects was how it affected
him emotionally spiritually mentally as Walter says the experience changed my
character greatly and had a profound effect on my attitude to all questions of religion or
politics I have come to the realization that we humans are really still very
crudely constituted and that as the being said to me we have animal like
Tendencies a lot of interesting elements to that case the fact that this holy man
predicted the witness would have an encounter and then he did the feelings the witness described upon seeing the
craft seeing the ETS all the descriptions the ET gave the description
of the ET themselves the description of the craft I mean all of it lines up with so many other cases I think it's a
legitimate case just my opinion as always it's up to you to determine what
you think about each case and here's another so many I like
this case too it's quite interesting because it is a multiple witness case of a bunch of young wom who saw two ETS
very close up I call this one humanoids in the Taja forest and this one occurred
on August 24 1974 in elto daoa Vista Brazil which is
surrounded by the tzuka forest and there had been reports of humanoids being seen
prior to the witnesses seeing humanoids in this case and while it is a somewhat
brief case compared to most of these in this little collection which are quite extensive I still think it has some very
interesting elements to it this next case did occur in a very rural area of
Brazil the main Witness is Regina cona and she had always been interested
in the Paranormal but what she and her friends saw on August 24th
1974 gave them quite a scare Regina and her four friends their names were
Janette ingred Viola and Maria Teresa were all University students and they
were standing just outside the Gate of one of their homes on this street called
Estrada davista sh and this is again a very rural area
outside of Rio De Janeiro in Brazil now when it was Maria Teresa who
first saw something moving along the road and shouted out to her friends what's
that and this road as you can see is surrounded by Forest and it was not
unusual for them to see animals of all kinds but what they saw was definitely not an animal it was walking on two feet
they saw two humanoid figures and they were floating almost 2 feet above the
street these figures were dressed identically in Golden jumpsuits with
helmets and what looked like visors and while they were floating above the ground their legs moved in
this watching walking motion their legs and arms were moving but they were up in the air both Figures were side by side
Regina did notice that they kept their arms fully straight and did not Flex them at
the elbows she says their outfits reminded her very much of astronauts complete
with helmet and boots but that the texture and the color was quite unusual was a scaly golden metallic
texture they estimate that these figures were about 5 1/2 ft tall but seeing that
these beings were moving towards them all five of the young women immediately became frightened and ran back into the
house and locked the door because as it turns out earlier they had heard reports
about floating humanoids being seen in this area of the tzuka forests in fact
multiple people had said that they'd seen these humanoids and some were reporting seeing
UFOs these sightings were causing a minor Panic among the town's folk of
this area though when researchers contacted authorities in the town to verify this authorities denied the
reports Regina was interviewed by researcher Irene granchi she provided
drawings of the beings for Irene and while Regina did get a good look at them
she said that she was unable to see through the visors on their heads because they were too reflective they
were reflecting the sunlight and also she said that she couldn't does not
remember seeing what their hands looked like that these were clearly not normal
people I really wonder what the ETS are up to in all of these cases just
floating down the road like that towards the witnesses about a foot or two off
the road all dressed up in their little shiny jumpsuits it's a fascinating case I find
all of these super interesting because we're only seeing just little bits and pieces of what these ETS are up to I
imagine that most of what goes on is not witnessed by humans in any capacities so
again this is just one piece of the puzzle that we're getting and now on to the next case
which I call I can't get it out of my mind that being of course a direct quote
from the witness who had this encounter which is actually a multiple
witness encounter though it isn't just one simple sighting in fact this
gentleman apparently did have missing time this case occurred in July of
1975 in Edgewater British Columbia Canada and it's a super fascinating case
which shows how missing time can be almost seamless when someone has a very
close encounter and of course he saw humanoids or what appear to be humanoids
the main witness in this case is Frank SL he's pictur here and it was one
evening in July of 1975 that Frank was driving his wife
home to their place of residence in Edgewater his wife worked at the Radium
Hot Springs Lodge and in fact so did he so he went to pick her up along with him
was their daughter Linda as well as two of their neighbors and they left the Radium Hot Springs Lodge and had just
reached the Highway and gone about a mile when they noticed all of them an unusually bright star-like light
directly above a ridge to the right and Linda shouted out that light's
moving and she's pointing at it uh they could see it was unusual so Frank
quickly stopped the car they all rolled down the windows to get a better look
and as Linda says the light moved a little more blanked out then all of a
sudden it was over the hill above the power station and by that she means a sort of Transformer unit that was
alongside the highway so they were all a bit puzzled by it but they just decided to continue
driving home now Frank worked at the radium Lodge as a night Watchman and he had to
return there in just a few minutes for his shift so he dropped his wife and everyone else off at the house and
turned around and began his drive back to the lodge and coming around that
corner where they had seen the unidentified light there it was again
and as Frank says in his own words I looked up and saw the light real close
right above the power station so I slowed right down and then and there I
saw there were three Strang looking sort of orangey beams shining down they were
large and I could see everything even the needles on the pine trees so
realizing he had stopped in the middle of the road Frank pulled over stopped the car on the side he said other cars
continued to drive by but strangely none of them stopped none of them seemed to
notice this very obvious UFO cuz Frank could now see that this wasn't just a
light was some sort of craft and as he says it was a double shaped deal about
40 ft wide maybe more on top there was a part with rectangular Windows lit from
the inside and Below there was a larger part with lights shining out from the
rim so this craft as you can see is pretty much saucer shaped circular with
a dome on top he estimates this Dome was somewhere about 6 to 8 ft high and it
had a long window in the center he was close enough that he could hear it making a low swishing noise and as he
stared at it Frank noticed that there was movement inside something alive was
inside of it but he found himself almost hypnotized and entranced by the sight as
he says for some reason I couldn't take my eyes off of it twice while I looked I
saw a shadow moving by as if there was somebody inside I couldn't see a head or
anything it was just a shadow and it seemed that maybe there was more than
just one and Fin finally and suddenly Frank came out of his trance and pulled his
eyes away from the object and fearing that he might be late for work he looked
at his watch and he got an incredible shock because more than an hour had passed while he watched the object and
as he says I thought it was more like 10 minutes so he quickly drove to the lodge
only one mile away and as he exited his car he looked over towards where the
area where he had seen the object and was amazed to see it off in the distance
brilliantly lit it had moved upwards and was now visible above the ridge where it
had been hovering and he had the impression that it was almost as if the occupants of
this object had wanted him to see it so Frank rushed into the lodge and
called his wife on the phone and this is when he learned it was now 1:30 a.m. he
was supposed to start work at midnight so he definitely had missing time the
next morning he returned to the site in hopes of finding some evidence he had to find a back road that took him farway up
the Ridge and Hike the rest of the way he was determined but as he says but
there was nothing I spent an hour looking around but there wasn't a sign it had been there so it must have been
in the air all the time even though it looked as if it was on the ground the
only thing he did notice was that there was a power pole right below where the object had
hovered but it was an experience that he would remember for the rest of his life
there you go one more case one more piece of the puzzle towards understanding what is going on on our
planet I mean so many cases I don't know how Skeptics still exist on this planet
there's just far too many cases far too much evidence far too many witnesses for
this all to be explained his hoaxes hallucinations or misperceptions as our government has
tried so hard to convince us for so many decades and now let's move on to the
next case another favorite for sure in this collection I call this one I didn't
dare say anything and what's interesting about this case is it started out with a
single witness who saw a landed UFO a very unusual humanoid but the case continued on over
for a period of days and ended up involving more than a dozen
Witnesses so it's a really remarkable case with multiple Witnesses involving
some absolutely unusual interactions with different types of ETS
as it turns out the location of this next encounter in domain isia France is
a tiny little town and it was at 5:50 p.m. again on January 5 1976
that 10-year-old Jean Claude silvente had a remarkable encounter that would
actually prage a series of even more exciting events he was outside his home
walking through a vacant lot when without warning a craft landed about 30 ft away from him it was he estimates 15
ft High blowing white and was resting on five thin Landing legs and as Jean
Claude says suddenly I heard a whistling sound I turned around and behind me in
the Brushwood I saw lying on the ground about 5T away a craft which had a cone
shape all illuminated with several colors a door opened and a man came out
he was very tall with long hair he ran towards me stretching his arms
out so this was a very unusual looking figure yes he was mostly looking but he
was very tall blonde hair long blonde hair but he wore this tight fitting kind
of shiny fullbody jumpsuit that was very unusual and even more unusual Jean
Claude noticed that there were strange glowing green objects or rings on his
hand at this point Jean Claude sneezed the tall visitor turned and looked at him and that's when it started coming
towards him and John Claude panicked and ran and as he says
I thought I was dreaming when I got back I didn't dare say
anything now his mother could see that something had clearly frightened her son
as she says my son was terrified I had never seen him like that but he didn't
want to talk about it and it was the next evening January 6 that was even more amazing because at 6: p.m. Jean
Claude went outside his home to get some milk and saw this same tall figure again
he didn't see the craft just the figure but this figure was following him down the sidewalk about 80 ft away and as
jeanclaude says in his own words coming back at the side of the road under a
tree I saw the same man as the day before he was wearing a shiny jumpsuit
and once again he stretched out his arms wanting to run after me on one hand he
had a big green ring so jeanclaude ran home he spilled the all the milk he had
collected his mother again seeing her son terrified became very curious about
what was going on and as she says in her own words I wanted to get to the bottom
of it with my daughter Alon and a friend of hers Marcel
suvini we took a flashlight and ran to the place indicated by Jean Claude no
sooner had we arrived at this place that we saw a big red headlight coming down
from the sky which advanced in our Direction I had never seen such a thing
we did not ask for more and I immediately rushed rushed to the je Dari
which happens to be very close to my house so these are the police and all of
these Witnesses felt that this object was coming down almost as if it was going to land right on top of them this
is what they told the police the police listened and returned to the encounter
location by this time there was nothing unusual to be seen however it turned out
that many other people had seen this same object on that night there was a
missure tal tther who was the mayor of the nearby town of Clay he said that
around 5:00 p.m. he saw an unusual luminous object moving around in the sky
to other young children in this area Ana and Hiner so that they saw the same
strange tall being that John Claude had described in fact one of the girls
confirmed the details described by Jean Claude saying that the being wore a shiny jumpsuit and held in his hand
quote something very shiny and green so the police started conducting
an investigation and they found a total of at least 15 people who said that they saw UFOs in that area on that
night and was only two days later on January 8 that a 17-year-old boy again
in domain went to the police to report that he had seen a UFO land in the same
exact spot that Jean Claude had seen the UFO the 17-year-old told the police and
I quote Thursday around 9 when I was at the entrance of domain I saw arriving in
the air a big bright light red and yellow when it approached I
distinguished a conical object about 20 m in diameter at the base the object went to land not far
from the National Road on a deserted ground taken by fear I ran
away so he said the object was 25 ft High and the reason he ran away because
he saw this glowing humanoid form emerged from the craft and that was
enough for him but events were still in progress because the next evening
January 9th in the town of CH which is very close to domain a gentleman by the
name of jeene dolei was driving home when he saw this weird ball of light
zooming across the sky coming towards him as it was descending and he watched
it as it landed by the side of the road he said it was about 40 45 ft wide 50 to
60 ft high and cylindrical in shape with a narrow Center and I'll just quote Jean
dolei firsthand because as he says regarding this craft it had the shape of
an Italian coffee maker it shown as if it were covered with silver paper I
certainly thought it was going to crash onto my truck or right in the middle of the road I break then pulled over to the
right fascinated by this light I cut off the ignition left my lights on and got
out of the truck I don't believe the machine was resting directly on the ground because the bottom of it emitted
a bizarre light which did not diffuse around I admit that I was afraid I
retreated a few meters without daring to get back into my truck then in the upper
part of the sphere a door opened that looked to be about 2 m High I felt more
and more disquieted suddenly three forms were framed in the opening three forms
that seemed to be dressed in aluminum diving suits they were not men no I can
assure you of that rather they were giant robots of the same height as the
door it descended very rapidly from the machine I saw then that they had small
legs and for arms a sort of telescopic pole that made me think of a fishing rod
as to their heads they resembled a square shape the three beings moved away from the sphere they walked like
mechanical toys by jumps wagging their poles up and down I did not move I could
hardly breathe I could only think that the headlights of my truck which I had left on would surely attract them but no
they didn't even seem to notice me after about 10 minutes the robots re-entered
their CR the door closed again and the lights went out except for the top level of the
sphere which remained the same blinding white then the machine took off
disappearing at dizzying speed I got back in my truck once in the cab I made
the sign of the cross I was trembling so much I couldn't get started but there
was only one thing I wanted to do to get home so this really quite frightened him
and events were still in progress one day later on the morning of January
10th a political science student by the name of Hubert Martin saw a glowing
bright light sitting on the ground near the village of Veno he said this object
was about as big as a house and it was that same evening a missure masseron was
sleeping in his trailer in nearby kados when he was woken up by banging sound on
the trailer followed by scratching noises and then his trailer began to actually shake so looking outside he saw
a glowing egg-shaped object not too far away about 5T wide or tall 3T wide and
it was landed or close to it on the ground he says it was greenish on top
reddish on the bottom and as he watched it rose up in a strange spiral motion
hovered at 50 ft then disappeared appeared and he opened his door to
investigate and he heard voices talking saying what sounded like letters and he
saw the dark silhouette of a human form running by but wasn't normal because it
was tilted at a very strange angle and unknown to him around the same time
there was a Mrs Zamora who lived in the same trailer park she woke up also
hearing a strange voice which she thought was saying what shall I do and
she heard another voice answering do as I do and looking outside she saw the
same craft which appeared to be yoyoing up and down and later researchers
investigating the area says that they did find strange Footprints at the site
so with this the whole series of events came to an end or people stopped talking
but it certainly left many people convinced in that area that there was something about that area
that was drawing in UFOs as for the first witness Jean Claud
svente he was left pretty traumatized by the encounter and especially by all the
incoming reports and according to his mother Jean Claude refused to go outside
at night and stayed locked up inside the house when evening approached so that's
the kind of case that makes me wonder because it may have all gone completely
unreported if that first witness jeene Claude silvente hadn't come forward
because it was only the fact that he came forward and his case was publicized that other people started coming forth
so if he hadn't the whole series of events could have gone completely under the radar we would never know about it
and I suspect that's what's happening with most even ones that are reported people go to the police and we don't
hear about it so again much more common I think Than People realize and what an
interesting series of events that was with these robotic like humanoids this
really tall human looking ET with long blonde hair I'm always wondering what
these guys are up to visiting our planet and here's another case which
also got quite a bit of publicity and led to more people coming forward to share their accounts of their Encounters
this one I call I saw a figure this occurred on January 19
1976 in the very little town of Heisler New Jersey and it's such an interesting
case because there's a group of seven Witnesses two families two you know
neighbors of each other who had a very very closeup encounter with a UFO and
one of them saw humanoids looking down at her through the window
it's a fascinating case it was around 7:30 p.m. again on January 19 1976 that
Kay Peterson and VI Camp friends were leaving Kay's home on Schoolhouse Lane
pictured here in heislerville New Jersey a very tiny town and they both saw this
very unusual object with two extremely bright lights on it hovering over the
woods at Treetop level to the west of their house about 900 ft away it was
immediately apparent to them that they were seeing a UFO that's how unusual it was so they immediately called out their
neighbors Wayne Tomlin his wife and their two children who came running out of their home to see the UFO at the same
time Kay's son also ran out of the house to watch it so now there's seven
Witnesses watching it and as VI Camp says we couldn't hear a sound it was
just just sitting in mid air just above the trees so all seven of them watched this
object for just a few moments they said the lights were really too bright for them to discern what kind of shape this
object was though they could see it was a solid object but finally VI became
curious and decided to approach a little bit more close to this object and as she
did the bright white lights on the object suddenly became dim and turned a
golden Amber color and this frightened VI and she immediately ran back to the
gr group at which point the lights became bright again so they continued
watching and a few moments later the lights became dim again turned that same
golden amber color and now began to move in a straight line right towards them
and in fact it came directly over their heads and stopped and this is when they
could see the shape of this craft that it was actually sort of boomerang shaped you can see their drawings here on the
bottom some of the witnesses saw a series of three or four red lights on
either side of the v in the center was a large illuminated orange circle with
weird looking sort of grid lines to it now VI apparently the Curious one
decided to walk over to the street to get a more headon view of this object
and doing so she was able to see a dome or bubble-shaped cockpit in the front
top section and looking through this transparent section she was amazed to
see a quote man-sized silhouette showing the upper torso arms and head of a
figure as Vice says I saw a figure in a small window it was all dark but it
appeared like a figure form from the waist up the form of a body
now one of the witnesses Miss Tomlin says she also noticed what looked like a glass cabin lit up from the inside and
she says she did see movement inside as well but she couldn't say for sure whether this was a figure or perhaps
just Reflections moving around but she was certain that the craft itself was
very unusual and it was so close at this point that all of them could hear this
low humming noise and they saw what looked like short stubby wings or
protrusions on the edge of this V shape and as Miss Tomlin says we see airplanes
helicopters and crop dusting planes all the time but I never saw an airplane
move so slow and without making a noise except it sounded like a refrigerator a
low humming so finally this craft moved off towards the East Point Lighthouse and
unknown to them about 20 mil to the north in the town of Dorothy uh Mrs Charles Morris was at her
home on Cape May Avenue around 7:45 p.m.
and she describes seeing an object as quote red with brilliant lights off it
and extending below it it wasn't a steady beam but brilliant flickering
light I called to my son to look and we watched while it hovered and made a small Circle then disappeared as though
it was rotating on its own access and the lights just faded away right on the
spot I never saw anything like it I was captivated by it any events were still
in progress because it was the next morning at 500 a.m. that patrolman Frank
and gargia who you can see here and a press reporter said that they both saw
strange lights near ventner New Jersey and in fact patrolman said it approached
to within a th000 ft of him and frightened him to the point that he drove off to evade this object which
then began to Pace his police cruiser so he reported this other
policemen were seeing objects as well there were quite a few Witnesses actually the Coast Guard dismissed these
as lights from a fishing boat reflecting off the clouds but it was this report
which appeared in local newspapers that actually prompted VI camp and the others
to go public with their own sightings and VI Camp talking about her sighting
says I thought about it all night I couldn't hardly sleep but I thought
everybody would think we were crazy then when I heard on the news about the police inv ventur seeing a UFO I thought
it must have been the same one we saw so sightings continued through the end of
January and there were a few other or at least one other report of a possible strange humanoid walking down the street
but apparently VI Camp is the only one who reported seeing uh the person inside
this craft it's a very unusual series of sightings some researchers have
speculated in that case that that could have been reverse engineered I suppose it's possible but it is your classic
sort of boomerang shaped UFO and there hasn't been a lot of reporting on
reverse engineered craft of that kind and I also wonder because this craft
came so close to the Witnesses in that type of behavior that we see so often a
display it looked to me like it was showing off it's also interesting because of the follow-up
encounters uh particularly with the police officer who tried to run away from the UFO and it just followed him
right down the road and military officials try to describe it as
reflections of a fishing boat off the coast which is absurd because this craft
came within a th000 ft of this witness and as a police officer he's a trained Observer he knows what he's looking at
oh the debunking efforts in this field just such a shame all right moving along to another
Super interesting case this one I call the Brans path
leprechaun and this is how the witness perceived her encounter this with this humanoid cuz she didn't know what to
think of it she called it a goblin at one point a leprechaun a little man as
you'll hear from her description it's quite unusual case which occurred on
January 2nd 1995 1995 in the little town of brth
England uh it's a pretty Brief Encounter but super interesting it was about 710
a.m. in the morning January 2nd 1995 as Diana Newton drove along the a690 road
pictured here towards her place of employment in Durham now she was in brth and had just
passed the brth castle on her right and was going up a slight incline in the
road which was lined by a small fence with Fields Beyond which you can see
here and as Diana says through the front windscreen of my car I saw this small
object moving in a puppet likee action I slowed right down alongside it and
looked out of the left passenger window and saw what appeared to be a little man
walking about less than table height 2 foot something I would estimate as I slowed alongside it I was
quite amazed and I tried to to take it all in and I was amused as well at first
I thought someone was playing a trick with a remote control it was quite dark but I could see it from the front
windscreen I caught it in my light I could see it from the side view as well
when I pulled alongside it I would estimate it was 2 yards away I slowed
right down to observe it virtually to a stand still so I was in first gear and I
watched in amazement as it was walking I was more amused with its puppet-like
movement and I took particular notice of the detail of its head and the shape of its body the head was not pointed at the
top but fairly oval and the chin was slightly pointed and I could see an
almond shaped eye it was like a side view as it was walking and I sort of
just looked at it but it didn't look at me I was alongside it and it was to my side and I was looking out the window at
this side side and it sort of kept on walking but I could see like an almond
shaped eye at the side of its head I didn't see any other features on this character just mainly this eye and its
movement so this creature which Diana described alternatively as a goblin or a
leprechaun or a little man was a sort of a dull mustardy yellow in color she said
it was very slimly built and was bobbing along in this strange gate with its arms
swinging like a puppet though it clearly wasn't a puppet cuz there was no strings there was nobody else around she says
the whole body was the same color all one color as if it might be wearing a
full body jumpsuit but she wasn't sure about that the only dark thing she said
on it was its eyes or rather its eye that she saw and with her car at a
virtual stop she says she watched it for almost a full minute and as Diana says
it was Bloody unbelievable you don't see anything like this I watched it for a
while until it walked on a bit further then I started to pull away with the car
as I pulled away I got a few yards and I stopped the car I was going to put it into reverse gear I looked in my mirror
and there were no cars or anything behind me then I decided better of it and I thought no I'll carry on and go to
work so Diana said that she felt no fear and was really just more Curious and
amused by the encounter but when she was asked by researchers why she didn't stop
and get out of her car she says I don't know I can't explain that the only thing
I could think of was that it was a leprechaun my perception of this little man was a leprechaun and it was a real
live one it was a little man and that's all there was to it so after driving off
Diana went to work and weirdly The Experience largely left her mind and in
fact she didn't even mention it to her family until the next night which is
totally out of character for her as she says and her family confirms she can't
explain this and can only speculate on the reason and as she says well I'm not
really into fantasy and unbelievable things I generally just read true stories and things things but it was too
unbelievable thankfully she did remember she did talk to her family about it she
actually even called the durhan police she told them about her sighting and
they told her that she should contact a wildlife expert Diane explained to them
that no she saw a little man not an animal some kind of life form that she
did not understand but the police didn't apparently want to hear about it
on January 4th Diana's sister decided to contact bu for the British UFO research
organization and shared her story with researcher Dave Newton and Jenny
randles they both went to Diana's home and to the location of the
encounter Diana's family vouched for her character and told Jenny randles if that
is what she said she saw then that is exactly what she saw as she is not prone
to Fantasy though the whole family was puzzled by the fact that Diana didn't
tell them about it until the next day now the researchers also called the
police who confirmed that Diana did in fact call them as Jenny randles says
I've spoken with Diana several times by telephone as well as speaking to her at home she's absolutely adamant that she
saw the creature she describes is a leprechaun and frankly I can see no
reason at all for her to be inventing a story of this nature she does not want
any publicity at all it is the opinion of both investigators that Diana Logan
saw a very unusual creature at the side of the road we feel most strongly that
he has she has related to us precisely what she felt she
saw and the other re researcher Dave Logan says there's little doubt in my mind that
Diana believes she saw this strange little creature by the roadside this is not a hoax so there you go woman's just
driving along and sees this strange little figure walking along the side of the road it's a shame she didn't get out of
her car to take a closer look but I can understand why she wouldn't do that some
an event like this typically is very shocking for Witnesses and they have a hard time trying to interpret what
they're seeing and once they realize how unusual it is they usually get on
moving so certainly an interesting and unusual case which I also like because
it was thoroughly investigated by professional researchers and now we move to the final
case of this episode some of you have asked you know why aren't there more recent cases involving humanoids and the
fact is there are and there's quite a few of them the 50s 60s 7s and 80s were
kind of the Heyday for this I think because coverage was a little bit more open but the coverup is no joke and
people have been frightened out of reporting their encounters and often it takes them years if not decades to come
forward there's a lot of reasons I think why we don't have as many modern
accounts as we do ones that are you know from earlier on but this next case I
call unable to move it occurred in November
2008 in Santiago Chile and I like this case because the witness got so close to
this UFO like 30 ft as he was working on top of a building in a very crowded area
of Santiago Chile this last and very unusual case
comes from Chilean researcher rul gajardo Leopold who was also published in Albert
rosal's book humanoid encounters the others Among Us it is a single witness
case the sole witness being 50-year-old sugundo Godoy Lopez who around 600 p.m.
one evening in November 2008 was working on the rooftop of a building on the very
busy and Urban Street Alonso de Cordova in Santiago Chile as you can see here
and feeling a strange quote urge to look up in the southern Sky he saw a dark
gray metallic object about a half mile away to the South but slowly it began to
move towards him and he could make out more details and he could see this was not a plane or a helicopter or anything
normal and as it got close he could see that this object was about 300 ft long
and 30 ft high with a rectangular front section at two large rectangular Windows
while the back section looked very strange uneven and kind of serrated with four
points and looking at the right window of this strange
craft the witness sugundo could see two humanoid figures from the waist up
standing right next to each other both of these figures looked the same they were light gray in color their arms
rested on the lower frame of the window and as sugundo watched these figures
moved in sort of this clumsy sideways fashion in unison as if they were
looking for something or perhaps watching the landscape that was his impression he thought they were looking
at the environment around them which is in fact as you can see filled with many
unusually shaped buildings with unique architecture but this craft got closer and closer and
he saw how unusual this craft and humanoids were at which point he decided
it might be a good idea to alert his co-workers who were on the lower floor
but the moment he had that thought he found himself unable to move his body he
says the only part of his body he could move were his eyes he felt no fear but
he says he did sense an increase in atmospheric pressure which became more
dense as the object approached more closely and in fact it came very close
he estimates to about 30 ft away from where he was working again on the top of
a building and stayed there for just a second and then moved off very slowly in
a straight line toward towards Mount monu of the nearby range of the Andes
Mountains so sugundo isn't sure what these ETS were up to sightseeing showing
themselves off he doesn't know he had no lasting physical effects but it
absolutely convinced him that UFOs are real there you go another amazing case
what's super interesting to me about that one is that this UFOs is just hovering over this major city center I
have to believe there were a lot of other Witnesses who just didn't report it hard to say perhaps they were showing
themselves off particularly to this one gentleman which could be because I also
find it fascinating that as soon as he thought of getting other Witnesses that's when he found that he was unable
to move but the fact that it came so close to him literally eye to eye 30 fet
away with these little guys staring right at him that makes me think this was an
intentional display I don't know how else to put it but again and as always
you can make up your own mind about it so there you go 10 amazing cases of
people who are in the presence of extraterrestrials again I do think that's what we're dealing with I mean
here we have clearly metallic craft which are leaving Landing traces they've
got Port holes windshields there's little people inside of them they're doing their thing as we're doing ours uh
I honestly do believe that most of these cases can be explained as extraterrestrials in the classic sense
but what I just want to do is present the evidence so everyone can make up their own minds about it but as you can
see these cases have been going on a very long time all over the world a lot
of people are seeing them there's all kinds of evidence supporting them and I think it's important that people know
and that's why I do this research so once again I really want to thank you
for watching I truly appreciate it I hope you enjoyed this episode and until
next time keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth it's a journey most of all keep having
fun until next time bye for now.
