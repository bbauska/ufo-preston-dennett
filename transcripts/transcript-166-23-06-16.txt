BEAME BY A UFO: TEN TRUE CASES
Jun 16, 2023

Summary:
Jun 16, 2023
UFOs are known for sending brilliant beams of light onto the ground, onto vehicles, and especially onto people. These beams come in many different colors. They can be wide or narrow. And they exhibit many properties that far exceed the capabilities of normal light beams. They heal wounds, cause burns, levitate, paralyze, pull people through solid objects, and much more. They make it very clear that our own understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum remains woefully incomplete.

Why are UFOs sending down these beams of light? How do they produce these amazing effects? What is it like to be “beamed by a UFO?” This video presents ten firsthand accounts, spanning decades and coming from across the planet. They vividly recount people’s experiences of being struck by a UFO beam of light and answer many of the questions surrounding this unique aspect of UFO behavior.

AUG 25, 1972: TITUSVILLE, PA. Driving along Route 408 in Rockdale township, newspaper editor Frank Holowach is puzzled to see a strange twinkling light in the night sky. Frank realizes he is seeing an actual UFO. At first he's excited. But then it moves closer, shines a light on him, and his car begins to vibrate. Then he feels himself vibrating. And when he feels an odd magnetic force pulling on him, he is filled with fear.

FEB 1956: CHOISY-LE-ROI, FRANCE. Mademoiselle Roi is driving along Road 186 when she hears a hissing noise and sees a bright object. She pulls over and sees a landed UFO and short humanoids beneath. She jumps from her car and runs to the ETs, trying to grab one of them. Then a beam comes from the craft and strikes her, paralyzing her.

APR 1960: PUY-DE-DOME, FRANCE. Baker and former Air Force officer Germain Tichit is drawn outside by colored lights and a loud noise. Going to investigate, he sees a landed UFO. A small figure emerges. Realizing that it's an ET, he lunges forward to capture it. The ET whips out a tubular device and points it at Germain, striking him with a laser-like beam of light.

OCT 30, 1967: BOYUP BROOK, AUSTRALIA. It was 9:20 p.m., as Alexander Spargo drives at 65 mph along the Kojonup-Mayanup Road. Without warning his motor stops, his headlights go out and a brilliant tube of light focuses on him from above. Looking up he sees a huge saucer. To his shock, his car has come to a complete stop. And when the beam retracts, he is shocked to see that his car is racing along the road.

APR 5, 1974: MOUNT OLIVE, NC. Newspaper reporter Nelson Bland had heard about recent sightings in the area, but driving along Hwy 117, he is shocked to see a strange pulsating light in the sky. As it zooms closer, he sees a classic flying saucer. He grabs his camera and is about to take a photo when he is engulfed by a brilliant beam of light. “I almost fainted,” he said.

May 26, 1977: SALISBURY NORTH, AUSTRALIA. When three teenagers go biking in the fields behind their homes, they have no idea that they are about to have an unforgettable encounter with a UFO. After setting down their bikes in a creek-bed, a beam of light shines down on their bikes, causing them to glow. One boy jumps forward and touches the beam. He is thrown to the ground by the beam. The other two boys dive for cover. 

SEP 1978: DILHORNE, ENGLAND. It was 1:30 a.m., and Stephen Colclough and his girlfriend are driving along a country road and see a strange red and white lights in the sky. Without warning, a huge black object looms in front of them and strikes them with a powerful searchlight. Says Stephen, “It was absolutely terrifying.”

SEP 10, 1981: PLYMOUTH ENGLAND. As Denise Bishop steps into her apartment, she looks up and ses a massive UFO shining down colorful beams of light. She is entranced by its beauty, but realizing it's a UFO, she turns to rush inside. The UFO sends down a pencil-thin green beam of light, striking her hand, stopping her in her tracks. As it retracts, she runs inside. Then she sees the burn-mark on her hand.

NOV 28, 1981: STARKS, ME. Kenos Henry drives to his home when he saw a UFO. It sends down a thin beam of red light into his eyes. As he rushes away, the craft follows. Later that night, Harold Hendsbee and his wife are confronted by a UFO which blocks the road and strikes them with a brilliant light. The UFO wave in Starks, Maine has just begun.

JAN 8, 1984: FRAMINGHAM, MA. An anonymous witness wakes up in bed to a startling sight. A mysterious green shaft of light is shining in his window, aimed directly into his right eye, causing heat and pain. He hears a strange whirring sound and sees the faint outline of a being.

These cases show how powerful these beams of light can be. They show that the ETs have a profound understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum, and they know how to use it to do things that border on the miraculous. Cases like these have much to teach us about light, and about how ETs behave, and their agenda on our planet.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I call this episode beamed by a UFO and of course this involves cases of people who have been struck 
by a beam of light from a UFO craft and there are so many cases like this in the literature 
I've certainly investigated a number of cases myself which I have covered in previous episodes 
I would like to mention one briefly which I covered before but it's interesting because 
this gentleman was driving through Michigan in a rural area of Michigan and Arbor area 
and he had this UFO hover low over him he got out of his pickup truck and this thing sent down 
a beam of Light which struck him and it had some really unusual properties to it it was the Smoky 
beam of light and he says as soon as it struck him he felt like it moved right through him and he had 
this weird coppery taste in his mouth he said it felt like it was actually scanning him so this 
is one of many cases I've personally researched involving people who've been struck by beams of light sometimes it'll render a person paralyzed sometimes it'll lift them right up into the sky 
all kinds of things happen it can pull you right through the roof of your house the ceiling or a 
wall so really amazing properties it can also heal one case I do love involved a young boy 
from Florence Kentucky his name is Chuck Doyle and he was in his backyard when a UFO appeared 
over well in his neighbor's backyard hovering there and it sent out a beam of Light which 
actually struck Chuck and as it was coming towards him he turned to run and this beam 
struck him and he was instantly Frozen to this spot and actually at 45 degree position 
and as soon as it struck him he said it was like being hit with a bucket of ice water 
it was weird because all these strange pictures started flowing through his mind he saw weird 
geometric equations all kinds of strange shapes colors he saw weird Landscapes and buildings so 
there was communication going on as well that's another factor that turns up in a 
number of these cases and this beam retracted he fell to the ground again because he was at a 45 
degree angle ran inside and that's when he noticed that his head cold his severe head cold was gone 
so yeah these beams of light can do all kinds of amazing things and that's why I wanted to explore 
this topic today sort of see what these beams of light can do and so many cases to choose from so I 
picked 10 coming from all over the world involving a wide variety of witnesses multiple Witnesses in 
many case many cases stretching back to the 1950s all the way up to the 1980s and there were so many 
cases to choose from and I wanted to choose ones that have really unusual elements to them or have 
some sort of insight into the nature of these UFO beams so these are not just sightings these 
involve Landings as well in a number of cases involve humanoids I love those humanoid cases 
uh these would all be probably categorized not as close encounters as the first kind but second and 
third because they are affecting the environment there are physical evidences of various kinds 
and just some really fascinating cases some are really extensive actually 
so I'm just gonna have fun exploring these I'm going to present these 10 cases chronologically and let's see what we can learn about these strange UFO beams of light 
so the first case I'd like to explore today I call it felt like a giant magnet this is 
a really interesting case from Titusville Pennsylvania and I like this case because it 
involves a newspaper editor so a professional gentleman and very intelligent and I'm just 
going to quote him directly because he describes his amazing experience very vividly this case took place on August 25th 1952 again in Titusville Pennsylvania 
and the main witness is Frank s hollawock he is as I said a newspaper editor 
and I again am just going to quote him directly this is Frank talking and I quote 
I joined the fraternity early yesterday morning of those who have seen strange lights in the sky 
I'm not definitely sure what I saw but I am not up to joking about the matter yet because at the 
end of the observation period I was a jittery fellow I felt as though I was brushing the 
supernatural there may be an explanation for what I saw there's also probably an 
explanation for the way I felt but I know this I don't want to go through the experience again 
you can laugh if you want and I'd like to join you but I felt as though an invisible magnetic 
force rocked my car and tried to pull me out of it that's a pretty tall order for 
anyone to swallow but let's just go through this thing once over Lightly for the record 
I'm not asking anyone to believe anything I almost don't believe it myself to begin with it happened 
at half past four yesterday morning at that time I was on Route 408 five miles Southeast of Cambridge 
Springs Pennsylvania in Rockdale Township I saw a light turn on in the Sky low Over the Horizon 
to my left it was a bright hard light but not much bigger than a star in fact it looked just 
like a star and twinkled or turned before I was sure I had seen anything the light went out and 
seconds later it reappeared almost directly ahead at the far East extreme of the horizon 
I stopped my car and turned off the lights nothing happened probably a shooting star I 
thought so I started up and went around the next curve the light reappeared riding low in the sky 
this is what you've been wanting to see one of those reported lights at night let's try to find an explanation for this embarking upon the matter in somewhat the manner of a scientist which 
I'm not I began taking notes of just what was going on and also set down possible explanations 
it was a cold night and clear where I was although foggy in the lowlands I was enjoying myself and 
glad I had finally seen something I got out of the car and stood in the roadway while my 
eyes got adjusted somewhat to the night the light flickered on and off like a firefly 
could it be a firefly no I doubt that is a white light it covers too much space it doesn't go away 
there's only one light and it seems to cover a regular route the lights skated around the horizon 
I was on rather in elevation looking to the Northeast across a low valley 
the light appeared to be just above the next Ridge Brown Hill north of little Cooley the 
light flickered like a car headlight going past trees then it went out then it reappeared further 
north and then South again always just above the Horizon but sometimes going up a little and then 
coming down a little at a slant now imagination is a powerful thing as I look back I don't think 
one stray thought entered my head about anything Eerie or Supernatural I was just matter of factly 
doing a reporting job or I thought I was I looked to see how the Eastern sky is getting brighter 
and I feel the car vibrate uh shivering because your feet are cold huh the car moved again 
this time I was watching myself and I don't think I moved to make the car shift like that 
I look at the valley light it seems to be increased in intensity and beamed right at me 
for some reason my skin begins to crawl I told you imagination is a powerful thing the car 
vibrates and I vibrate cut this out you're thinking things nothing's going to hurt you 
watch the car radio aerial against the sky and it'll show you nothing is shaking the car 
but the aerial is shaking I looked at the light in the valley it stared at me and it seemed some 
force was pulling me through the open window it felt like a giant magnet was drawing My Flesh 
well I'll be frank with you my imagination went to work right then my hair seemed to stand on end 
somehow I felt as if I was going to disintegrate disappear doesn't that light want anyone to watch 
it right then I switched on the car key started up and went away as if something was chasing me 
the white light came out and moved ahead of me the sky in the East was Crimson edged at the horizon 
white fog lay in below places the countryside was a thing of beauty in that first half Morning Light but by that time I was 
seeing infernal machines behind every bush in the beginning of the day seemed eerie I haven't 
had such a crawly feeling since the night a big dog sneaked up on me when I was eight years old 
so yeah that is the case from Frank hollowock it's funny he says I'll be frank with you when his name 
is Frank but yeah I mean gosh did he get taken I think it's possible because he felt himself being 
pulled up he believed through the windshield his hair was standing on end it was vibrating his car 
so there's clearly something going on here physically as you can see that experience 
affected him really profoundly I can only imagine what it must be like to be struck by a beam of 
light from a UFO like that but we'll find out because there are a lot of cases and I call 
this next case which is so interesting don't try to capture the alien this is a really interesting 
case involving a lady from France Who Came Upon A landed UFO and she ran out side of her car 
right towards this landed UFO and it's a little ETS outside of it and did something I don't know 
if I would do it's hard to say how I anyone would react if they come up on a landed UFO in occupants 
but I think you'll find this case particularly fascinating this case occurred in February of 
1956 and the location is schwazi in France and the main witness is Mademoiselle Ray who at the 
time was 41 years old and on that evening in February it was around 9 30 p.m at Manuel Ray 
was driving alone on road 186 where it intersects with Road 7. she was driving from schwazi Lara to 
the town of Fran this is south of Paris and she was crossing over the bridge that goes over Road 
Seven when she heard a loud hissing noise and saw a bright shiny lighted object on the road 
so she pulled over to get a closer look and I'll just quote Mademoiselle Rey directly as she says 
then I noticed a person about one meter 30 centimeters high that's four feet moving about 
near it and there came into my mind the thought of flying saucers of which there was occasional talk 
in the newspapers and I got the sudden idea that maybe if I could grab an occupant and take him to 
the newspapers What a fine thing that would be for me small and thin as the little chap appeared he 
would not be very hard to carry so Mademoiselle Rey got out of her car she opened the trunk to 
deposit the little guy in and approach the quote machine she said the shape of this ship was 
like a flattened pumpkin and there were luminous portholes going all around it and she now saw that 
there was eight little figures who mostly appeared to be focusing on the ground Around The Craft 
but looking through the portholes she saw two other guys inside all of these figures wore gray 
blue tight-fitting one-piece suits she described them as having very large heads large black eyes 
two little nostril holes and a slit for a mouth so pretty much typical grays and as she's walking 
towards them all these beings turn and look right at her and as she says in her own words 
when they saw that I with no signs of fear was approaching them they were off as quick as 
rabbits into an opening in the base of the craft the last one of them the one I was aiming to grab 
turned around and fixed his big black eyes on me intensely as if wanting to say something 
but just as I thought I was about to get him a beam of light shot out from one of the windows 
on the upper part of the machine and engulfed me and paralyzed me on the spot I couldn't move any 
part of me except my eyes and it was only then for the first time that I really began to get scared 
so now Mademoiselle Rey is frozen to the spot all these little ETS return into the craft the beam 
retracted at which point she could move and she ran to her car got inside and she became Frozen 
again she's not sure if this was in effect from the craft or the ETS or just from fear but she 
couldn't move and as she says I went on waiting for a while 10 minutes or so and I was desperately 
anxious to be gone but I couldn't operate the gears and was totally unable to leave so she 
watched as this craft made a loud hissing noise and Rose up to Treetop level paused it then turned 
orange as it started to move and turned red as its speed increased and it moved off into the distance 
now the witness has no reason to believe she was taken on board or had missing time but 
she does admit she was profoundly Changed by the encounter both mentally emotionally 
and psychically in fact as she says and I quote I found I was no longer quite the same as I had been 
I was now more assured even more intelligent every time that I came to a Crossroads when driving my 
car I now knew what was going to come from other directions sometimes I would say to my husband 
look out there's a big truck or a fast car is coming and that was before anything was to be 
seen and I was right every time sometimes had we not slowed down we would have been in an accident 
at the same moment when danger loans I get a little tickling feeling in the tips of my fingers 
I also have premonitory dreams with exact scenes and places so this is an effect we see quite a 
bit people are profoundly psychically awakened I'm not sure if that's from the beam of light 
or what exactly is going on here but it's a really interesting effect to say the least 
now this case was investigated by Claude Rafi who notes that this case is in fact very similar to 
another case which occurred around the same time and the same place involving another Witness by 
the name of Granny Jay-Z and she saw a craft as you can see that looks very much like what 
Mademoiselle Ray describes what's interesting about that is the craft that the Jay-Z saw was 
also seen by many witnesses at Orly Airport and tracked on radar for several hours in fact 
so there's more independent corroboration of this event really amazing case so that 
might make you think twice about running up to a landed UFO and trying to grab one of the 
ETS but apparently this is not unique because this next case is pretty much the same sort of thing 
and I call this one shot by an alien laser beam so this is a really interesting case to me because 
again it involves a landed UFO and the witness was a former Air Force Officer army officer 
and uh he was quite Brave and when he came up on this landed UFO and occupants he did 
not turn and run he ran towards it and as you see when people react this way it can open you 
to the possibility of being struck by a beam of light from these et's and certainly that's what 
happened here this case occurred in April 1960 and the location again is Pue de Dom France and 
the main witness is an Air Force officer by the name of Jermaine titchet who investigated the case 
describes Germaine as quote a solid Fearless type of man his frankness and honesty are self-evident 
it is quite clearly not the sort of Man Who Would concoct a story and his his desire is to describe 
what he saw precisely as he saw it simply and directly he has never sought publicity over it 
and in fact German actually kept his secret for years and after his Air Force service he became 
a baker in the pueda dome area of France and it was in the wee hours of the morning in April 
1960 at around 2 A.M that he heard a strange noise he described as kind of a rumbling noise 
coming from outside and at the same time he saw a multi-colored lights coming in through the window 
so this is not far from the pueda Dome Church and running outside he saw an enormous object 
landed on the ground and although the terrain was on a slope the craft itself was level 
and it was sitting on this sort of weird accordion looking device and according to Germaine a strong wind was swirling around the craft he had the 
impression that the top half of the craft was spinning and as he's examining it he sees that 
there's a ladder extended down to the ground and out came this very short humanoid figure 
according to Germaine this figure was wearing tight-fitting clothes sort of a gray green jacket 
and a helmet which actually had a chin strap to it that's quite unusual it wore a belt and 
had four small little boxes attached to his belt and here's also a very strange detail 
Germaine looked at this figure and saw what he thought was a curved sword hanging from its side 
now mind you he is an Air Force officer so perhaps that colored his perception hard to say but yeah 
this craft Jermaine says appeared to be like a spinning top it was about 45 feet wide 15 feet 
tall the top half looked transparent and he could see colored tubes yellow red and blue in color 
so he realized instantly that this was nothing normal it was a UFO and the figure was probably 
an extraterrestrial so he took immediate action he jumped forward and as he says I wanted to 
catch the little chap well this turned out to be a bad decision because as soon as Jermaine stepped 
forward this humanoid figure held up a little quote tube like a fireman's torch a flashlight 
and Jermaine says he was struck on the chest and head by a dazzling hard white beam of light 
and as he says the beam was absolutely straight there was no light lost from it and when it struck 
him he felt a number of unusual effects he was unable to breathe he felt dazed and blinded he 
felt partially paralyzed although he was able to throw up his hands in front of his face 
to stop himself from being blinded and he's a very determined guy so he held his face and head down 
and actually Advanced forward towards this figure and this figure seeing Jermaine coming towards him 
quickly turned around went up the ladder and into the craft the door snapped shut he could hear it 
he says it was like a metal door banging when a big bolt is shot this being retracted the machine 
Rose vertically almost 100 feet away then shot away to the south in a weird undulating matter 
manner so Jermaine watched as it joined a group of similar looking objects in the sky 
a whole Fleet of them which all moved off together into the distance and were gone 
so Germaine felt fine he'd had no permanent effects from this beam of light the only after 
effects were were some crushed vegetation in the area and as far as Jermaine his only regret was 
that he was unable to catch this little E.T again that might make you think twice about running up 
to a landed UFO or an occupant because if you act aggressively they will clearly defend themselves 
here's another case which I find super fascinating because it illustrates some 
of the really unusual properties of these UFO beans I call this case a sudden stop and this 
occurred in boyop Brook Australia again these cases are worldwide and this one apparently 
involves missing time I think probably this gentleman was taken on board hard to say 
but it was reported to the police it was very well investigated and again I think it's worth looking 
into because of these unusual things that happened when this gentleman was struck by a beam of light 
this next case took place on October 30th 1967 again in boyup Brook Australia and this case was 
thoroughly investigated by UFO researcher Peter Norris and the main Witnesses Alexander Roy Spargo 
he was 37 years old when this occurred it was 9 20 in the evening and Alexander was driving 
from the town of kojo nap to boyap Brook along the kojo nap Mayan up Road 
news about 10 miles outside of mayanap as you can see here when his car engine suddenly conked out 
the motor stopped the headlights went out now here's what gets interesting he had been traveling 
at 65 miles per hour but without any sensation whatsoever of slowing down he realized his car 
was suddenly stopped just like that as Alexander says in his own words if you suddenly stop a car 
that's going over 60 it's like getting shot out of a slingshot but I found I wasn't moving it had 
no sense of having stopped all I knew was that I was the focus of a brilliant beam of light 
so yeah this beam of light was shining on him and looking up he saw a large oval shaped craft 
he estimates it was about 30 feet wide and was hovering very low about 100 feet above the road 
right in front of his car as you can see here and as Alexander says I could make out the shape of 
the ship and it was glowing with an iridescent light I'd say the color of bluish lightning best 
describes it the tube came out of the bottom of the ship at an angle of about 45 degrees I seem 
to be surrounded by it it was about two to three feet in diameter and Brilliant on the outside yet 
I could see up to it and there was no glare or anything inside it it didn't worry my eyes at all 
I got the impression that it was lighting up the inside of the car but I didn't look around to see 
I had the most extraordinary feeling I was being observed through the tube 
I felt compelled to look up the tube but I didn't feel any fear and I don't remember 
thinking of anything in particular I just sat there and looked up that tube of light 
so while this car was stopped right in the middle of the road and this light was on him 
Alexander says there was in fact an eerie silence enveloping the whole environment 
there were no crickets or frogs or anything like that which there usually is 
and this beam of light stayed on him for a good number of minutes his estimates about five minutes and then suddenly Switched Off at this point the craft sped off to the west and 
was gone and two seconds flat and this is when Alexander got another amazing shock because it 
was without any warning that he realized his car was speeding along again at 65 miles per hour 
and he had no recollection whatsoever of starting the engine or accelerating his vehicle 
so he quickly stopped he got out of the car and looked around nothing was out of the ordinary 
but this was a really amazing experience so he drove directly to the police in Boya Brook and 
filed a report as he says I felt the authorities ought to know about it right away but I asked 
them to keep my name out of it now the only other effect he noticed was that his watch was now five 
minutes slow and it was not long after this when this case became well known and words started to 
spread he learned that there were at least three other Witnesses in the nearby town of kosron up 
would apparently seen the same object quite an amazing case yeah a truly remarkable case and 
I suspect there's so many like that one and here's another case which I call no pictures 
allowed people often complain that there's not a lot of pictures of UFOs photographs which is 
simply not true there are there's just really difficult to verify and the fact is it's not 
always easy to take a photograph of a UFO in this case illustrates that this one occurred 
in Mount Olive North Carolina and the main witness is actually a newspaper reporter so a good Witness 
and he describes his experience really vividly in quite a bit of detail 
so this is why I wanted to present it this one to you today because I mean this one is just a 
real fascinating case this case occurred on April 5th 1974 again near Mount Olive North Carolina 
and the main witness is a reporter for the Tribune newspaper his name is Alan Nelson Bland he goes 
by Nelson Bland and he reported that he was traveling along Highway 117 going north from 
the town of Faison to Mount Olive when he saw a quote strange erratically moving light in the sky 
and he was approaching an overhead bridge when he saw this and as Nelson says I'm colorblind 
and don't know what color it actually was but it appeared to be either red green or yellow 
and as he watched this thing just got brighter and brighter and as he says it looked weird 
the lights were not blinking but were sort of pulsating nothing like I had ever seen before 
so realizing that this was quite unusual he parked his car he left the motor running 
and he got his camera which has a telephoto lens ready and through the lens he could see that there 
were actually three lights one bright one and two smaller ones and he started snapping photos he 
took three photos which when he later developed didn't come out all he saw were tiny specks of 
light on the film so this object continued to come closer and closer as it moved South so he 
decided to continue down the road to try and get closer to it he was between Route 117 the 
business route and the Route 117 bypass and he was still seeing these three lights when as he says 
suddenly without any noise and at incredible speed the object appeared to come about 300 or 
so feet away from me and about 75 or 80 feet in the air over a field near Scott and Jones company 
I can see the shape and color of the object it was oblong and the lights were reflecting onto 
the top part which appeared to be metal anyway it was yellow or orange in color the bottom part 
I could not distinguish the color but could see the outline silhouetted against the sky 
all this took place in about four minutes from when I first saw it until it came down close 
so I think this object was probably showing itself on purpose it made a b line directly for him he estimates it was about 30 feet long maybe 10 feet high and he got out of his car 
to take a picture and this is when it got to be really interesting as he says I started to aim 
when suddenly an intense extremely bright beam of Light Came From the Bottom of the craft and beamed 
directly onto me and the car during the whole episode I felt eerie but when that light beamed 
down on me I almost fainted so somewhat frightened he dropped his camera and sped away in his car 
and as he says the bright light stayed on for about three seconds after I dropped my camera 
it went out but I didn't look back or up to see where the object went since then I have been 
extremely nervous especially when driving alone at night I hope to God I never see another one 
So after talking about this event with others he learned that there were many other Witnesses in 
the Mount Olive area but apparently we're seeing this same object there was a Marty Brockton who 
saw a UFO along Route four Mark Bryant saw one along Route One many witnesses Dudley and Mike 
granthin saw a UFO along Route 1 in Goldsboro David Neal I saw one along Route 1 in Princeton 
Mark Quinn saw one over Mount Olive all of them reported seeing the same are similar objects 
a lot of witnesses Gail Stroud a Dublin County school bus driver and Marion green a student 
also saw objects Johnny Davis a student Jeff Parker another student 
solve similar objects in the sky and commenting on the witnesses to all these sightings 
he says and I quote personally I didn't believe them and I made ridiculous remarks to them but 
after Monday night I remember the old rock song that was popular several years ago I'm a Believer 
so yeah this affected him profoundly what I love about that case is while 
this gentleman was alone when he had this experience of being struck by a beam of light 
there were a lot of other Witnesses who saw UFOs in that area at that time which provides 
definitely a level of corroboration to what he saw and let's move on to the next case 
this one is really unusual this is another case from Australia actually near Adelaide Australia 
and I call this one our bikes glowed it's got a really unusual effect here from a 
UFO beam that's why I wanted to include this case it's quite brief but I think definitely 
earned a spot on this uh in this collection because it's got some really interesting insights 
just an unusual case as we shall see this next case took place on May 26 1977 in an area called 
Salisbury North this is just North of Adelaide Australia and this is a very strange UFO Bean case 
again there were three Witnesses all teenage boys were biking in the Hills near their homes it's a 
pretty rural area when this is our Brenton Clark he's 15 years old his friend Alex medaris age 14 
and their other friend who is not named they had dismounted their bikes and set them down 
in a little creek bed and they were laying down in a nearby Field about 30 feet away from their bikes 
when this very powerful beam of light Shone down from the sky straight down targeting their bikes 
they estimated this beam was about nine feet across it totally engulfed their bikes and as 
one of the witnesses Alex says the bikes gave off a metallic glow while the beam was on them 
it's bizarre I mean they weren't themselves struck by the beam of light was aiming at their bikes 
but they were very much intrigued and they jumped up and ran to investigate more closely 
and one of the kids Brenton decided to reach out and touch this beam of light 
and he regretted it quite quickly because as soon as he struck as soon as he stuck his right hand 
in the beam of light he says that he was thrown violently backwards onto the ground almost 10 feet 
and his two other friends quickly died for cover moments later they all got 
up except for Alex who was still laying on the ground and at that moment the beam disappeared 
and they heard a noise coming from a Grove of trees to the right about 60 feet away and as 
they watched this object rose up out of these This Groove of trees Alex says of the noise 
it was a low pitched room sort of a noise he described as sort of like a muffled jet sound 
and as they look towards this source of noise they saw this blue green conical shaped object 
rising from this these trees it hovered over this one gum tree and then it quickly moved 
off into the distance leaving behind they said this odd and Eerie Stillness over the whole area 
now they ran straight home and shared their accounts with adults in the area one of them 
was their friend Carol Robbins who said that the boys were absolutely sincere and honest and 
as she says I believe it each of the three boys told me the story independently and each told me 
the same story if they weren't telling the truth they couldn't have been unanimous on the details 
so this case was investigated by UFO researcher Colin Norris and he went directly to the scene 
and he noticed that one of the trees did appear the gum tree were over which this object hovered 
did appear to be wilted and affected in some way but as he says it's a shame none of the 
boys thought quickly enough to look up to try to see what was at the top of the beam the Stillness 
which the boys said they noticed immediately after the beam disappeared is consistent with many other 
reported sightings he also noted that there were power lines in the area and a water source both of 
which he says are known to attract UFOs I'm glad that these Witnesses had each other when they went 
through this the three boys can only imagine how difficult it must be to go through something like 
that alone and this case was really interesting because it was thoroughly investigated and there's 
so many more here's a case from dilhorn England and I call this one the most frightening thing I 
have ever seen and the reason I wanted to include this case is not So Much from the physical effects 
of the beam of light but the emotional effects because it can be an extremely alarming and 
surprising and shocking experience to have a UFO swoop down and beam you with this beam of light 
so this one does involve multiple witnesses as well and I think you'll find it pretty interesting 
this next case occurred in September 1978 and again this is in dillhorn England it was 1 30 A.M 
when Stephen colclough an engineer about age 20 at the time was driving with his girlfriend Patricia 
and they were driving along a remote Country Lane through the town of dilhorn on their way 
home to North Staffordshire and I'll just quote Stephen directly as he says 
some friends of ours were in a car in front suddenly I noticed two lights one red and one 
white moving across the sky and seemingly out of nowhere this enormous black object loomed up in 
front of both the cars and shot a beam of light at us it was as bright as a powerful Searchlight and 
remained on both cars for about three seconds we stopped immediately it was absolutely terrifying 
I'm shivering now thinking about it it was the most frightening thing I have ever seen 
so as you can see he drew the craft it's quite an interesting shape he describes this craft as 
concave and ribbed he says it moved in complete silence he had never had any prior interest in 
UFOs so this really left him quite shocked in fact after he and his girlfriend Patricia and their two 
friends Stephen Iyer and Susan Hartley composed themselves they searched the sky for this object 
and sure enough there it was but it was now quite high in the sky all they could see were two lights 
so this really affected particularly Steven very profoundly as he says 
I realized that the whole story sounds absolutely ridiculous but I can assure you it happened 
now Derek James of the northern UFO Network says and I quote on the face of it this sounds like 
a fascinating sighting it seems very similar to a number of other reports we have received from 
different parts of the country over the last few weeks so there's more confirmation there and as 
you can see rarely are these singular events many people are witnessing probably these same objects 
it was a pretty brief case yes but as you can see uh shows how amazing these beams of light can be 
and here's a case which did get quite a bit of attention you may have heard of this one before 
it got a lot of newspaper coverage I call this one stopped dead in my tracks and this is one of the 
most important UFO beam cases on record I think because it's so well verified well there was one 
main witness there were corroborating Witnesses in the area some unusual animal effects as well 
and physiological effects that are absolutely indisputable it's an amazing case which occurred 
in Plymouth England this case occurred on September 10 1981 in Plymouth England 
and the main witness is Denise Bishop pictured here she was then 19 years old and worked as an 
accounts Clerk I'll just let Denise describe what happened and she says I had got out of a 
taxi and was walking up the steps to the Bungalow between 11 15 11 30 PM when I saw a spaceship that 
was the same shape as the body of a crab it was a massive ship with pink and purple and white lights 
the colors were pastel Shades not vivid colors the shell of the ship was metallic 
gray it was just hanging there a massive ship with a rounded top it didn't make a 
whisper of a sound it just hovered silently in the moonlit sky the object was unlit but coming from 
underneath it and Shining down on the rooftops beneath it were six or seven shafts of light 
so these shafts of light as she says were different pastel colors pink purple and white 
the craft was quite large she estimates it was about 125 feet long was very close and she was 
absolutely mesmerized almost hypnotized by just the sheer beauty of this craft and she stared at 
it for a little while and suddenly she snapped out of her sort of trance and disconcerted turned to 
rush inside but she never made it inside as she says and I quote as I reached for the back door 
a lime green beam of light came down on the back of my hand it Zapped my hand on the doorknob I was 
absolutely helpless I couldn't move a muscle I was more amazed than anything I was stopped dead in my 
tracks the beam stayed on my hand for at least 30 seconds in which time I could only stand and watch 
the UFO I was very frightened although the UFO was a fantastic sight to see it was huge and Silent in 
fact the whole area seemed very quiet then the beam went back into the ship and I could move 
it was as if someone had stopped a film and then started it again I opened the door and rushed into 
the house and as I did so the UFO lifted into the sky slightly and moved away and out of my sight 
so Denise rushes inside and tells her sister Carrie what happened they went back outside but 
the UFO is gone and they looked at her hand but there was no sign of where the beam had hit her 
at least not at first but is only a few minutes later that Carrie's dog started sniffing Denise's 
hand and Denise felt the stinging sensation and looking down she did see a burn mark as Denise 
says I noticed spots of blood and after washing I saw it was a burn it was like some horrifying 
Nightmare and I kept hoping that I would wake up safe in my own bed but it wasn't a dream it was 
real and I still have a scar where the green ray struck me so you can see the burn here in fact a 
doctor who looked at the photos of this burn Mark said that it showed the features of a laser burn 
and after about one week this wound this burn started to scab over two weeks later the scab 
fell off leaving a pale red mark which remained on Denise's hand and investigators of course converge 
to interview her they confess the neighborhood and found other Witnesses there was another lady 
by the name of Elsie who claimed to have seen a UFO on the same night in the same area the only 
real difference is that Elsie said the object was emitting only three beams of light when she saw it 
but she drew it as you can see here and it's very similar to Denise's drawing of the object she saw 
now prior to this incident Denise had never thought much about UFOs but she certainly 
does know as she says now I wish I had paid more attention at the time and that I wasn't so shocked 
I'm very curious about it because it is the sort of thing you hear and you don't really believe now 
I feel sorry for all those people who have been saying similar things and not been taken seriously 
she doesn't feel that this was necessarily a negative experience and in some ways is 
actually glad to have had this encounter although it was frightening at one point but as she says and I quote this sort of thing was never interesting enough to me to even think 
about I suppose I believe it was just one of those things but now I have joined the converted 
but the problem is converting everyone else it is so strange that you think twice about 
speaking about it if it hadn't been for the burn I wouldn't have said anything 
now I believe in UFOs but the but the encounters people have are so strange that it makes you 
think twice about talking about it you don't want people to think you're insane so plymouth-based 
UFO researcher Bob Boyd investigated her case and after questioning Denise's neighbors he did find 
two witnesses who said that at the time of this sighting their pets were acting quite strangely 
he is absolutely convinced of the authenticity of Denise's case and as he says 
I cannot stress stress how unusual this is in virtually every other UFO sighting there's never 
any physical evidence left after the event we can only accept on face value what Denise says and 
there doesn't seem to be any reason to disbelieve her the burn mark adds Credence to the fact that 
it wasn't a figment of the imagination so I'm not sure where Denise Bishop is now but this 
is definitely something that really affected her profoundly for the rest of her life she said it 
totally convinced her that UFOs are real obviously if it leaves you with a burn mark on your hand uh 
that is going to affect you in a number of different ways it's a really remarkable case 
but this next case wow what a doozy I call this one you shall not pass and I initially thought 
that this was just a singular event but it turned out to be a much larger conglomeration of UFO 
events over this little town in Stark's Maine and it's a tiny little town of about 400 people and it 
put this town on the map this was an enormously complicated wave of sightings involving numerous 
people actually who were struck by a beam of light and some things happen that are just beyond 
strange so this is my favorite case of the bunch by far and as you will see it's just incredibly 
interesting this case occurred on November 28 1981 again in the little town of Stark's Maine 
one of the first Witnesses was kinos Henry he had just pulled off of Route 43 onto bran Mills Road 
pictured here when he saw a UFO and this was not the first time this was in fact the third 
time he had seen UFOs over the past few months third time however he got beamed by this object 
as he says it was getting awful big awful fast I thought I was seeing things but I hadn't had 
anything to drink for four or five days suddenly it darted to the left and back to the right much 
faster than any plane could fly and it kept getting brighter closer his dog Willie began 
barking up at the sky and racing around crazily in the yard and as this object approached 
kinos was about to back out of his yard and onto the main road when he says this object shot a red 
beam of light down through the windshield directly into his eyes and as he says I don't like telling 
people this because they think you're nuts but man what I saw I said to myself I'm not going 
to get any turkey I'm getting this car out of here so this was on Thanksgiving weekend 
I grabbed the dog turned the car around and I left snow and ice flying for about 40 feet 
so kinos quickly pulled out of brand Mills Road onto Route 43 and drove one or two miles to the 
home of his friend Mike Daigle the object he said seemed to be chasing him down the road it 
was still growing in size he could now see green and blue lights within it still beaming down at 
him as if it were chasing him and he drove in a near Panic into Mike's driveway as he says I was 
shaking he opens the door his dog Willie jumps out of the car and starts barking again at this UFO 
and inside the house was Mike Daigle his friends Lisa prieball who was by the way 
eight months pregnant and Artie corrieri they were all relaxing at the kitchen table when 
kinos came roaring through the door pale and wide-eyed and he said man you want going to 
believe this there's a satellite or something up in the sky and it's sending lasers down at me 
now Artie says I thought he was playing a trick on us I thought it was a joke 
but at kinos's insistence they piled into his car to go have a look they called for his dog 
but the dog was nowhere to be found so they drove over the hill towards kinosa's house when of course this UFO reappeared it was high up in the sky like a glittering star they said 
Kino said look there it is and pointed at it his friend Mike Daigle said no that's the North Star 
and already said no that's Venus and then suddenly this object drops down towards the ground and as 
already says no kidding it dropped 15 degrees in about two or three seconds down to the horizon 
at this point it just hung there in the sky ahead of them it was clear to all of them that this was not normal and as Kino says I thought maybe it was a mirage or the way the road was 
because every time I'd go ahead some it would come forward some and when I stopped it would stop but 
then while we were stopped it started weaving and bobbing and flashing its lights coming down at us 
and as Artie says the object moved with us for a ways and then dropped in front of us although it was still quite high in the sky just made you shake all over it showed a 
goldish white light bright enough so you really couldn't tell the size and shape of the object 
it was weird because as they said they watched four other cars go by the UFO didn't seem to 
react to them at all as Artie says the object just seemed to focus on us but it really quite 
frightened them frightened them as Mike Daigle says its lights were terrifying it wasn't going 
to let us up that hill and I have no idea why we were shaking in our boots when that unbelievable 
beam of light focused in on us we left in a hurry because whatever it was it wasn't playing around 
so meanwhile two other Witnesses Deputy Harold bud hensby and his wife Helen had decided to go 
out to dinner and they were driving towards Starks along Route 43 they were on their way to eat out 
in Farmington and this is when they came upon kinos Henry and the others stopped in the road 
so Harold breaks his truck and comes to a stop next to this car kinosa's car meanwhile kinos 
is jumping out to get his dog Harold asks is everything all right and kinos was carrying his 
trembling dog over to Harold's truck and he says to Harold hey don't go up over that Hill there's 
a UFO up there honest to God if you do you are going to witness something you won't want to see 
so at that point they drove off and Harold could see that they were absolutely terrified 
but he wasn't about to go back to Madison where he lived with his wife Helen and they continued 
on up the hill and as they neared the hilltop they did see a strange light in the sky far ahead of 
him in the direction of where they were going Farmington was moving from side to side but it 
quickly disappeared so they didn't think much of it drove on to Farmington to eat and forgot all 
about the UFO meanwhile on the other side of town on top of a hill on Route 43 skip Mayhew 
answered a knock on his door and of course it was kinos and his friends Lisa Mike and Artie 
and Kino says hey Skip what do you think of this that thing just chased us down the road and was 
coming right down to us you want to go back with us and see what it is and Skip thought they were 
crazy he says you guys are nuts and Kino said hey it's right out there and they went out the door 
and he pointed out the light to skip it was pretty high in the sky at this point pretty far away and 
looked very much like a star so skip went into the house grabbed his high-powered rifle and peered 
through the scope and focusing on the light this he's just made out its shape when it disappeared 
so meanwhile Harold and Helen enjoyed their dinner at the fiddlehead restaurant at around 7 PM they 
left for home and they were just outside the town of starks when Helen grabs Harold's arm 
and said look there it is so he stopped the truck as this weird light Rose before them 
hovering right above the hilltop over the road casting a brilliant light on the whole hill 
so he drove up the hill shielding his eye against the light and suddenly this object moved towards 
him he stopped watched this object sink slowly down behind the trees to the left of the road 
and he started up the hill for this would be the third time and the lights sprang up and Shone 
right through the windshield totally blinding him and I'll just let Harold describe this as he says 
we started to go forward and it came towards us it lit up the whole hell all of the woods 
everything the light was so bright I couldn't make out the object itself we stopped and then it moved 
over to the left dropped out of sight behind some trees I started up the hill again and within the 
flash of an eye it was in front of us again now it was on top of the hill about 200 yards away 
so Helen turns to him and says whatever that is it's not going to let you over the hill 
Harold shifted the truck into reverse and started backing down this was a narrow road so he had to 
back down the entire Hill and as he maneuvered Helen told him what the light was doing and at 
first it stayed up there in the air then she began to shout it's coming towards us it's coming towards us and as Harold says I kept backing down the hill and it kept coming towards 
us dropping in altitude until it was about 60 feet off the ground and directly in front of us 
it came out of nowhere and would not let us over the hill I felt that I challenged this 
thing whatever it was for about 20 minutes I was determined to get up that hill because that's the 
way I had to go home and three times it drove me back and as Helen says whatever was up there was 
going to conquer that Hill I've never seen Bud scared of anything before before this 
and she told her husband Bud whatever it is it's not going to let you over the hill 
and Harold Bud hensby agrees as he says I've been a police officer for 23 years I've been 
shot at had bullets go through my vehicle I've been trapped in a well during a house fire but 
it's not the same you don't know what this is it's going to and fro up and down floating in the 
air you don't know if this thing's going to come through your windshield like a bolt of lightning 
the UFO hovered over the hill and lit up the whole area as Helen says and we just sat there 
and watched it I didn't see any object just a bright light it was probably about a utility 
pole high it was just stationary in space it Advanced towards us then stopped I then backed 
up about 30 to 40 yards and stopped again Harold tried three times to pass and he says the second 
I started to go ahead the object moved towards us again shining the light right in my windshield 
it was so bright I couldn't see in front of me the beam came through the windshield so bright we 
could hardly see three times we tried to go over that hill and every time it wouldn't let us buy 
as Helen says we have the feeling that it didn't want us to go up there 
so after 20 minutes of trying they just turned around and went home along the longer route 
148 at one point they did roll down their window to see if they could hear anything 
but it was totally silent they were quite frightened so they took the longer route home and 
as Harold says believe me we were happy to get out of there now they were initially very reluctant to 
tell anybody what happened but finally decide to call the local newspaper the Waterville Sentinel 
this Helen says we never said we saw a UFO we just saw a light a floating light they were expecting a 
tiny little paragraph of a story but instead it was a longer story this came out in the Monday 
mornings issue of the Sentinel and this quickly went viral calls began pouring into the hensby's 
home and to the Sheriff's Department friends were calling curious acquaintances reporters in fact 
a Boston radio talk show called them live after midnight researchers showed up from Florida saying 
that they wanted to hypnotize the couple on others throughout the town called and said that they had 
seen the UFO UFO grooves began to converge wanting to hold UFO stakeouts so it just became a total 
mad house and this is when they learned that many people throughout the town had seen this 
one of the witnesses was a 10 year old boy who actually drew a picture of the object as 
the boy's father says our son was telling us about the sighting Monday morning before anyone had seen 
the paper or listened to a radio we didn't really pay attention to him until we saw it in the paper 
so the hens bees had so many calls gave so many interviews that at one point they just refused to 
speak about it and as Harold says they can get the names and names and names of people in the area 
who've seen it they learned that so many people in the town had seen it so they didn't want to talk anymore for fear of being disbelieved or ridiculed most of the people refused to Grant interviews 
researchers did contact local Air Force spaces including Loring in Maine Plattsburgh and New York 
and peas in New Hampshire all of who denied doing anything in that area or having any information 
whatsoever about this sighting but it wasn't over yet in fact this story was about to take a tragic 
turn because as it turned out at about 11 30 pm on the night of these sightings 24 year old Kimberly 
Landry was killed in Mercer this is about five miles Southeast of starks she was driving along 
Route 2 which runs roughly parallel to Route 43 where all these other sightings were and 
very close to it she was driving alone West from Skowhegan to her home in New Sharon when according 
to the state police she failed to negotiate a curve in the road and her car went airborne and 
into the woods it wasn't found until the next morning when a driver spotted her wrecked car 
crossed up against a clump of trees now friends of Kimberly said that she was not a fast driver but 
State Police estimated her speed at about 91 miles per hour at the time of impact so that was strange 
also strange was she was not unfamiliar with this road she made this trip nearly every other day 
third and this is weird when she missed this curve and went off the road there were no 
skid marks it looked as if she either hadn't hit the brake pedal or hadn't seen the road bending 
so that made no sense but the really weird part is when investigators investigate the whole scene 
they learned that she was driving at night with dark sunglasses on the sunglasses were found 
beside the rack with blood and skin tissue on them they were broken at the left temple and that's 
how Kimberly apparently died she died of injuries to the left side of her head and it's one of the 
sheriffs who investigated the scene says there was just no reason for her to be wearing those glasses 
unless there was a bright light it doesn't make sense she knew the road and wasn't drunk there 
was no reason for her to be driving the way she was unless she was awfully afraid of something 
so Harold of course heard about this and that left him quite disconcerted and this 
sighting really affected him profoundly as he says it was the most incredible 
thing I've seen whatever the thing was it made damn sure we didn't get over that Hill 
it hovered there in the air and beamed the light at us and was so bright it lit up the whole hill 
every time we started up that hill it came right at us and drove us back it was something I hope I never run into again I am just glad we were not harmed I want to forget 
this now like it never happened some people would give their right arm to see one I hope I never see 
one again it was terrifying I'll tell you that absolutely terrifying I never got over it now he 
would travel that route again but his wife Helen absolutely refused to ever go on Route 43 again 
and it affected kinos Henry the first witness equally profoundly as he says I live alone with 
my dog in a house on the brands Mill Road but since Saturday I have been living here with 
my friends I go back to my place in the daytime but not at night the thing just doesn't want to 
leave me alone and has my dog scared to death one night it came right over my house so close that 
I felt like I could almost Reach Out And Touch It it was big and looked like two half spheres 
with bright lights that seemed to stretch up and down I know people are going to say I'm nuts but 
I'm not crazy and I wasn't drunk I know that thing was there so he eventually left the area he moved 
so this is how profoundly a sighting like this can affect people yeah what an amazing series 
of events well what a case so many witnesses absolutely indisputable national press coverage 
people coming from all over the country to investigate including very well you have known 
UFO researchers like Bob Gribble and Ray Fowler and others I can only imagine how the residents of 
that town must have felt and especially the ones who witnessed it which apparently was probably 
most of the people in that town because as we've seen most of them did not want to talk about it 
and now we get to the very last case which is quite brief but I thought really fascinating 
and I call it right in the eyes again this is a really brief case but it does involve humanoids it 
does involve some very strange effects from this UFO beam and I think is worth mentioning it was 
January 8 1984 again in Framingham Massachusetts this is a very strange UFO beam case the witness 
is anonymous and he was in his bedroom when a narrow shaft of green light came right through 
the bedroom window and it apparently was aimed into his right eye the witness said he could 
feel heat and pain in his eye at the time and he estimates that this went on for five minutes 
uh he was wasn't able to move but he said he could hear this whirring sound and he could also see 
the faint outline of a being standing outside his window then suddenly everything vanished 
now afterwards his wife examined his right eye and could see that it was all bloodshot while his left 
eye was absolutely normal yeah this is a briefcase I don't have any other information on it but very 
strange I thought it deserved a place in this collection there you go that's 10 cases involving 
people who have been struck by beams of light from a UFO and as you can see all kinds of strange 
things are occurring people are being rendered temporarily paralyzed they feel like they're being 
pulled up into the air or are being pulled up and all kinds of really interesting physiological and 
physical effects and again as I said in the beginning I think we have a lot to learn from 
these cases involving beams of light from UFOs we our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum 
is clearly incomplete if we don't understand how people are being levitated or pulled through 
solid objects or healed or burned or what have you paralyzed so these cases I think for that 
reason alone are hugely significant I have so much to teach us and they're also just darn interesting 
just fasting to meet at a UFO come down that close and just boom being you with their beams of light 
so yeah just super fascinating and a lot to learn from these cases well humanoids and landings and 
craft from all over the planet reaching so many decades back into the past all the way up to 
pretty much the current day and again this is just the tip of the iceberg this is one of the 
most common features in UFO reports there's got to be thousands upon thousands of cases like these so 
just the tip of the iceberg here but that's it for today I hope you've learned something I hope you 
found it interesting I really want to thank you for watching it's much appreciated until next time 
keep looking for answers keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun 
till next time signing off.
