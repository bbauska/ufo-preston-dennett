Dec 28, 2019

Summary:
Dec 28, 2019
There are more than 150 cases of UFOs & USOs (unidentified submersible objects) off the southern California coast. But there are only a few humanoid cases. This video presents a rare case in which multiple USOs were seen, as well as humanoids. The case also involves missing time.

You can learn more about this case, and many others, in my book, UNDERSEA UFO BASE, now available on amazon.

hello everyone my name is Preston Bennett today I thought I'd talk to you a little bit about a very 
interesting USL case unidentified submersible object I've been researching UFOs since about 
1986 started getting us OK TSA's right away and it wasn't until gosh 2006 so I really started 
buckling down and investigating specifically USL cases off the Southern California coast here I've 
written a book about it it was published in 2018 it covers more than 150 cases at least 
70 cases of UFOs over the water here right off the coast of the Santa Catalina channel and an 
equal number of usö cases objects coming in and out of the water that's a very active area I'm 
still getting cases it's been photographed on a number of times but I'd like to talk about one 
particular case which occurred in 1998 at Leo Carrillo Beach this is right along the coast of 
Malibu and right in the heart of all the activity really involves a man who I'll call Dan and he had 
a party going on at Leo Carrillo Beach with a bunch of friends about 50 friends really it was 
sort of a renegade beach party that they hadn't really planned and they were all having fun and 
Dan was down by the beach for the small group of other people looking at these weird lights 
in the water it was a very beautiful night the bioluminescent algae was in full bloom but there 
were these objects what looked like an oil rig out on the water there was huge it was covered with 
lights but they were in sort of weird patterns and they were sort of debating what it could be 
when a smaller craft broke off and took off like a a cigar boat real fast to the right to north 
and separated from the main object so they were wondering what the heck could be this big object 
not look like cruise ship practically and it was pretty close there turned around and walked 
up to the main party at which point something very bizarre happened a very bright light came 
up from the cliffside there now the beach is located right along the Pacific Coast Highway 
and this spot is highway is not visible there's no parking lot up there that could be causing 
these kinds of lights it was very strange was more strange is what happened next this light 
switched off and coming down the staircase was a group of about 10 to 15 humans or humanoids they 
were all wearing blue jumpsuits all looked sort of meso American South American about five feet 
tall short hair all pretty identical looking not identical but you know like brothers and 
it was very strange because they said nothing but started to walk among the group and Dan and the 
others were looking at them and the people are not communicating but they're holding something 
in their hands which Dan the first thought might be beer bottles or books or something but there 
were flashing lights on them and suddenly he looks up and he sees that one of these guys is 
actually standing on top of the lifeguard tower there so it started to get very strange this is 
a quote directly what Dan said I'm quoting here I looked over at the lifeguard tower on the beach 
and there was somebody one of the figures sitting on the outside on the top of the lifeguard tower 
beaming a light out toward the ocean it seemed like maybe a high-powered flashlight it was a 
bright light that went out toward the water and I remember thinking how strange that was because the 
lifeguard towers are built in such a way that you can't actually climb on the outside and they're 
locked in the inside so I wasn't really sure how anybody got on top of one of these things does 
Dan the folks in the jumpsuits are walking around us we're seeing these lights and the next thing I 
remember is the folks that joined us are gone and a good 20 of us or standing in two parallel lines 
equally spaced maybe three feet apart and at the base of our feet was an indentation in the sand 
of a circle like you put a cup in the sand and see the indentation maybe an inch deep and two inches 
wide as if you were to draw a stick in the sand around us each had these circles around our feet 
and we all sort of came back to consciousness noticing our feet and seeing these circles and 
commenting on it at this part the party broke up everyone went back home some years passed 
nobody talked about it finally Dan just started remembering these things and asks the people who 
were there and most did not remember anything they did not remember seeing any humanoids did 
not remember anything in the water a few did remember seeing the objects in the water none 
remembered the humanoids it's one other person so it's an interesting case and definitely still open 
to investigation but one of many cases involving humanoids it's definitely a very active area has 
been recognized by many major researchers and continues to reduce cases thank you
