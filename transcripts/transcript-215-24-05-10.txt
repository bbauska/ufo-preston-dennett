TRULY INCREDIBLE: TWELVE WEIRD HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
May 10, 2024

Summary:
May 10, 2024
So many cases of humanoids! The general public has no real idea just how many people are having these experiences. This video presents twelve incredible cases of humanoid encounters from across the planet, from the 1950s to the 2020s. Robotic entities, human-looking ETs, little green men, grays, and more. And of course, compelling evidence: multiple eyewitness testimonies, landing traces, medical effects, and more. Truth is coming out!

BACKYARD ALIENS. Around 9pm on December 15, 1956, Marie Carow stepped into her backyard in Conashaugh, PA. She was hoping to see deer, but instead observed two four-foot-tall helmeted figures staring at her. She called her husband, but he refused to come outside. Later, she found out her neighbors saw a UFO at the same time.

HUMANOIDS IN PONTEJOS. On the evening of January 9, 1969, four employees at a café-bar in Pontejos, Spain received an incredible shock when they saw a UFO with five humanoids hovering right across the street. Unknown to them, another witness also viewed the object. It remained for a short time then darted away. Could it have been interested in a nearby nuclear facility?

ROCK-COLLECTING ALIENS. Around 4am one evening in February 1969, a family of four was awakened by light streaming into their home along the beach near Nuble, Chile. Looking outside, they watched a strange craft land and tall humanoids emerge, poke the sand with weird tubes, and start collecting rocks. After the encounter, they all broke out in a strange rash.

ENCOUNTER WITH A UFO PILOT. On October 5, 1971, pilot Jose Americo Medeiros and three other student pilots were coming in for a landing at Santos Dumont Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when a UFO began pacing their plane. Suddenly it darted forward and crossed right in front of them. They were shocked to see a gray-skinned humanoid looking right at them.

THE ALIENS AT THE TRAIN STATION. Just before midnight on June 25, 1974, three employees of the Tandil Railway Station in Argentina were shocked to see a bright light outside, followed by the appearance of a short, bearded humanoid. It disappeared after a few moments. One of the men was so traumatized, he suffered a nervous breakdown. The next day, two other people also reported a humanoid in the same area.

THE ROBOT IN THE FOREST. On the night of August 15, 1974, a group of nine witnesses observed a boxy-looking, glowing white, robotic-figure in the La Pelouse Park of Bouxiere-Aux-Dames, France. Soon more witnesses also began reporting a strange glowing figure in the same area. Researchers later discovered a long history of encounters in the area dating back to the 1920s.

LANDING IN TASMANIA. Early one morning in February 1976, an anonymous gentleman from Kettering, Tasmania saw a strange craft come in for a crash landing. Rushing to the site, he was shocked instead to see a small disc-shaped object landed a short distance away. He could see strange forms inside the craft. When it departed, weird landing traces were left on the ground.

HUMANOIDS IN LITTLE HAVEN. In the middle of the night on April 19, 1977, Rosa Grenville, a hotelier at the Haven Fort Hotel in Little Haven, Wales was shocked to see a landed UFO and humanoids right outside her window. Viewing through binoculars she was amazed to see that they wore strange jumpsuits. She tried to wake her husband, but the craft took off before he could see it.

THREE HUMANOIDS IN A SATURN-SHAPED UFO. After seeing strange lights throughout early July 1979 over their home in Schiedam, the Netherlands, two teenagers were amazed to see a Saturn-shaped craft with humanoids inside it, hovering very near the balcony of their home. They also began reporting a wide variety of psychic events.

LITTLE GREEN MEN. While driving to her home in Niva, Denmark late on the evening of September 28, 1988, an anonymous woman was shocked to see two very short greenish humanoids with large heads and pointed chins walking along the road. She pulled a U-turn to get a closer look, but they were gone.

THE ALIEN IN THE WINDOW. On the night of June 27, 2014, a woman from St-Croix, Quebec, Canada was amazed to see a UFO over her home. When her son arrived home shortly later, he reported seeing a short, large-headed humanoid peering in through the backdoor window.

THE ALIENS BY THE CROSS. On May 3, 2022, 88-year-old Lyubov Danilova Smolskaya of Belarus, Russia woke to her home filling with light. Looking outside she saw a landed craft and two bizarre-looking humanoids. They shone a beam of light on her, then got into the craft which floated away. After it was gone, strange landing traces were found.

These twelve incredible humanoid encounter cases make it very clear that people all over the world are having these experiences. There are too many cases to ignore, explain away or cover-up. The truth can no longer be denied. UFOs are real, and we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode I call
truly incredible 12 weird humanoid
encounters you know I love talking about humanoid cases they're endlessly
fascinating I think they have the most to teach us about the UFO phenomenon and they're just darn
interesting and I've chosen 12 cases for you today which actually reach back back
all the way to the 1950s up through the 2020s so some quite
recent cases cases coming from all over the world really from Canada United
States South America including Chile Argentina and Brazil across Europe such
places as Spain France Wales Denmark and
the Netherlands also a case from Australia and one case from Russia
most of these are multiple witness cases which always brings a new level of
credibility to the case there are a few single witness cases but many of these
also involve physical evidence a lot of people don't realize this especially
Skeptics but many cases do have really compelling physical evidence including
Landing traces electromagnetic effects physiological effects as well so some
really compelling physical evidence but to me the most fascinating aspects of these humanoid cases are the wide
variety of humanoid reports so people are not only seeing just Grays but short
little beings robotic beings much taller beings human looking
extraterrestrials and just a wide variety of beings that are clearly not
from here or wherever they're from that's certainly open to debate
now I do have a lot of cases 12 that's a little bit more than normal so let's just get started and the first case I
want to talk about today I call backyard aliens a lot of people see UFOs right
outside their homes and that's absolutely true in this case which took place on December 17
1956 in keshaw Pennsylvania this one is a largely
single witness case so there are some corroborating Witnesses who apparently saw the same UFO did not see the
humanoids that the primary witness in this case did see quite close up for a
pretty good period of time and boy are they unusual this unusual case was
researched by Dr bertold Schwarz the main witness is Marie Koo she was 68
years old at the time of her encounter and Dr Schwarz says she seemed to be of
above average intelligence and was quick and crisp in her answers to questions
with an excellent reputation for truthfulness Miss Koo seemed to be a
completely truthful person so the main witness Marie loved
watching the deer and other animals that wandered through her backyard again in keshaw Pennsylvania her backyard was
bordered by Forest and it was on the evening of December 7 17
1956 which turned out to be the last day of hunting season that she had her encounter and she was concerned that all
the deer had been killed cuz she loved watching them she had a new powerful flashlight which her husband had
recently purchased for her to help with her nature watching so on the night in question around 900 p.m. she stepped
outside with her flashlight hoping to see some deer but instead was shocked to see two very Strang looking very short
men they stood next to each other arms at their sides facing her one was about
3 and 1/2 ft tall and the other was closer to 3 ft so she shown her flashlight on and
off of them and they made no reaction she could see that they were standing right next to the Garden Stakes by her
raspberry bushes which allowed her to accurately measure their height she could see that they both wore shiny
silver jumpsuits which reflected the beam from her flashlight and as she says
it looked like aluminum foil shiny they had gloves and shoes she said they also wore snuggly
fitting helmets which left the face visible though she didn't describe their faces she did say that they appeared to
have fair complexions and were well proportioned and muscular the taller one
was slightly more slender than the shorter one and she wased them for about 3 minutes again shining the flashlight
on them and off again but they never reacted nor did they as she hoped they
would move away so she became anxious and excited
and realizing that these were not normal people she hurried back into the house
closed and locked the door and ran to her husband in the living room and she told him there are two little men in
shiny suits on the back lawn she said that she didn't know who they were and
would he come out with her and look at them now her husband didn't want to stop
watching his TV show and he says he was also somewhat
skeptical so it took Marie herself about 15 minutes to calm down enough to look
back outside but by then they were gone so she wondered if she had just seen two
little Spacemen and speculated that their ship may have landed behind the
barn which was hidden the next day she did go there and find some crushed vegetation there but she
did admit that it could have been caused by cattle passing through the area now
two weeks later she did tell her neighbors and friends who lived a few miles away near dingman's Ferry and they
said that around the time and date of her encounter they had both seen a large
glowing object speeding in the sky heading west overall the entire event frightened
Marie so much that she refused to step outside alone at night for about 6
months following her encounter there are some very interesting aspects to this
case the fact that these humanoids were so short not sure that they were robotic
this could be the uniform they were wearing but really unusual she did apparently see some Landing traces as
well to me the most telling sign toward the authenticity of
this case is the fact that the witness didn't want to go outside alone at night
for 6 months following her encounter this to me argues for its
authenticity and other than that I mean the witness does have a reputation for
being quite intelligent and honest it's a super interesting case and now we move
to another interesting case which took place in Spain and I call this one
humanoids in pantos this is a really interesting multiple witness case I think it's
really interesting where it took place as well as we shall see but it did take place on January 9
1969 in pantos Spain and there are some
really interesting aspects uh the primary one to me being that this was
witnessed by at least five different people from researcher Manuel pedrao
this case definitely qualifies as incredible it was around 1 a.m on
January 9 1969 was an icy cold night and felicidad Fernando and her mother Marin
Marino were preparing food for a few late arriving customers at the
cafebar that they ran now suddenly the area outside the
cafe across the street lit up with a brief but brilliant light neither of
them thought much about it but now looking outside the kitchen window felic
dad saw a strange figure somewhat up in the air and she told her mother what is
that man doing out there so both of them looking more closely they saw that there
was actually a craft of some kind was hovering very low maybe about 10 ft
above the ground so felic Dad and Marin called over another employee
pakito and they opened the window to get a better look now about 90 ft away they saw a
rectangular object all lit up much like a glowing screen they said and hovering
in the sky as they watched white orange flashes came from it filling the area of
the cafe at regular intervals and suddenly inside the illuminated area a man appeared
they estimated he was about 6 feet tall with unusually long arms and an incredibly pale complexion he looked
like he was dressed in a dark gray jumpsuit and they cried out in shock
which drew the attention of their waiter Antonio and he joined them to watch so
now there's four Witnesses and as they watched about four other beings appeared
moving around in stiff likee mechanical motions within the confines of this
glowing rectangle of light and they all watched together for about 5 minutes
when Antonio the waiter announced that he was going to venture outside climb a
nearby wall and get a better look and know no sooner did he start to do this
when the object and the figures winked Out quote like a television set going
out so this really amazed the witnesses and they continued to watch the area and
suddenly saw a small glowing sphere fall downwards and then immediately following
this an immensely large dark object which they said was mushroom shaped or
kind of like an upside down Bowl sitting on a plate this appeared where the glow had been but slightly more distant it
also lit up the area Illuminating the landscape below it and instantly this
object rose up at very high speed disappearing from sight in an instant now researcher Manuel pedrao
learned that a fisherman just over a mile away from the area observed a gray
object shaped like he said a flying hat and he watched it stop for a moment
actually near the area where the other Witnesses were and saw it accelerate
away at high speed now connected or not to all this
there there is apparently a nuclear facility not far from this area which
could be significant what are these ETS doing presuming that's what they are
they do certainly appear to be ETS given that they're flying around in what look like metallic craft with Port holes or
certainly humanoid in form very much like us more like us than different
other Witnesses in this case didn't get a super good look at what these beings looked like but certainly appeared to be
large largely human looking what's interesting to me about this case is it's very close to a nuclear facility
that does seem to be a pattern in a lot of these cases and there's always another one I mean you can be skeptical
of one case or another but there's always another to take its place and to me that's perhaps the best evidence that
there is validity to this phenomena the fact that there are so many cases
occurring over such a long period of time all over the world here here's another case which I call rock
collecting aliens quite a few cases of ETS coming down and collecting soil samples and plant samples and for that
matter even samples of animals and genetic material from humans as
well this case took place sometime in February of 1969 in a very small town
called Nubble this is in Chile actually it's a great case because this does
involve multiple Witnesses a landed UFO humanoids of course and some very
interesting behavior on the part of the humanoids this case comes from Chilean researcher Elena Marino and it took
place along a beach just south of Val perzo Chile it's a little town called
nual it was around 4 a.m. when an anonymous couple who with their two sons
lived along the beach woke up when a bright light streamed in from outside
through the bedroom window and looking outside they saw something amazing a
strange craft was descending from the sky in this weird swinging motion they
said it was saucer-shaped with a dome on top and there were two little antenna
which emerged from the top of this Dome the craft itself was metallic blue it
glowed very brightly and had several Port holes around the circumference they as made it was about
18 ft wide equally tall and it slowly came in for a landing directly on the
beach less than 200 ft away resting on three Landing legs suddenly a bright beam of light
shot out of the craft and coming from the beam were three tall humanoids all
dressed in blue and as one of the witnesses the husband says unfortunately we could not
distinguish their facial features we think they were about 2 m tall 6 feet
they were dressed in a sort of combination that covered their entire body gloves and shoes formed a hole with
the Garment which had a vertical line reminiscent of a closure all along the
body and we saw a kind of metal badge on their chest so these figures began to walk
along the beach each of them placing about 10 of what looked like small tub
tubes into the sand there were many black stones on the beach small black stones and the figures
began to collect them all and after taking all the stones in that particular location they then proceeded to pick up
the tubes in the sand and they all returned back into their craft this whole experience lasted a
good 30 to 40 minutes and as the husband says the object Rose diagonally still
swinging then moved rapidly away towards the West on a horizontal plane they did hear it make a strange
swishing noise and the next day going to investigate they found that all the
little black stones that had been in that area were now gone they also saw
marks in the sand where the tubes had apparently been inserted into the sand and this showed that the tubes
themselves were about 4 to 9 in Long varying sizes and the husband also
discovered something interesting his watch had stopped during the whole time the craft was there and was now 38
minutes slow and there were some other very strange effects the couple noticed that
their skin became covered with a quote sort of scales which cleared up after 3
days so perhaps exposed to some type of radiation very hard to say but they said
that they were also emotionally profoundly affected and experienced a lot of fear and
feelings of insecurity and nervousness in the days following this encounter
it's very hard to deny cases like this when you have multiple Witnesses looking
at this when there are landing traces when there are physiological effects as
well all of which is are present in this case I also find it interesting that
there out there collecting stones of course people love collecting rocks here
and it appears that this could very well be a simple scientific expedition to
collect some geological samples from our planet hard to say for sure but it's certainly an interesting case of
humanoids and of course here is another this one is wow so incredible I call
this one encounter with a UFO pilot I love this case because it does have four
Witnesses it's right over an airport the UFO came very close to the witnesses and
these Witnesses are pilots themselves so they have some a little bit of higher
level credibility perhaps than the average witness given that they are familiar with aircraft and are trained
observers certainly this case took place on October 5
1971 in a little airport outside of Rio De Janeiro Brazil this case is
absolutely amazing this incredible and I think important multiple witness case
comes from researcher and scientist Richard Haynes PhD it was on October 5
1971 as pilot and flight instructor Jose Americo C MOS age 23 was in the pilot
seat of a cesna 172 model I with him
were three other men all student Pilots celso M Paulo Caesar G and Orlando R
they were pilots of varying levels of expertise and this was a nighttime
training exercise they had taken off from Santos Dumont airport in Rio and were on a
return path very near to the airport at about 1,000 feet altitude when selo who
was sitting in the right rear seat noticed a bright star-like object
descending and approaching the Cessna he was shocked and curious
especially when the object reached the same altitude as the plane and very quickly began to Pace it immediately all
four men noticed this object and were deeply impressed by its strangeness because now it was no longer just a
light they could see it was a structured craft moving along with them at a slightly pitched angle
they said it was white gray in color saucer shaped totally smooth on its
surface and it had about three small Port holes around the top section they
could see that the interior of the object was lit up and they estimate it was about 35 ft long but really not sure
about that maybe small as 10 ft or quite larger 70 ft long they did see it had a
bright light on the front bottom section so this UFO began to Pace the
plane at a distance of about 6,000 ft away and it did this for a few moments
then made an instantaneous turn moved directly in front of the plane at a
distance they estimate of 100 ft and as it moved in front of the plane Jose
again the pilot could hardly believe his eyes because in the center port hole he
could see the silhouette of an oval shaped head with dark eyes looking out
at them now there is an artistic representation of this which Jose
approved after several adjustments so this representation is pretty accurate
according to Jose and as Jose says the size of the head was about half the
height of the window my attention was caught by its head with inphic bones of
of large dimensions and its big oblique eyes it observed us with Tranquility
without curiosity but with attention I didn't have much time to look but the
head was larger than that of humans the being looked at us
attentively so at this point the move object moved to the left and below the
plane moved lower then abruptly made another sharp turn and accelerated off
towards nearby Sugarloaf Mountain and moved out of view so Jose had been about to land the
Cessna but seeing all this occur quickly radioed the Tower with a request to
abort his landing and carry about a full 360° left hand
turned this was granted by the tower and Jose had asked to abort the landing
because he and his other student Pilots were trying to track where this UFO had gone but they never did see it again
Jose did call the tower and asked if there was any other traffic in the area and said he had just seen a flying
saucer this excited the tower controller and he began asking where where but the
disc was now gone so Jose landed strangely none of the men talked about
the encounter though Jose did speak of it to the tower controller the men never really spoke
about it and for the most part went their own separate ways Jose later became a captain for vasp
Airlines and he never spoke publicly about his encounter for years decades
until he retired at which time he felt it was important to
share now at one point after he talked to researchers he consented to
hypnosis and under hypnosis recalled seeing what he believed to be a red
light flashing from the object and he saw what he thought might be a sort of infinity symbol on the craft though he
became quite uncertain about the accuracy of this recall but really didn't recall anything
else so this was pretty much a fully conscious experience researcher Richard
Haynes was unable to interview the other Pilots reportedly one of them celo
according to a few of his friends did see another UFO again later that same
evening of the first encounter though again this was not verified and none of
them as far as known experienced any unusual After Effects physically or
mentally so it's pretty much a standard encounter but a very close-up encounter
with Pilots seeing a UFO pacing their plane I like this case because it does
have multiple Witnesses all of who are trained observers Pilots also so
interesting because this is a clear-cut example of a UFO display it's clear that
this UFO wanted to be seen why else would it fly directly in front of a plane so close I mean we're talking 100
ft away or so I mean that is amazing can only imagine what this must have been
like for these Pilots to see something like that so close it's such an amazing
case and now we move on to the next case which I call the aliens at the train
station sometimes ETS appear in locations that seem very unlikely and
yet it does happen and that's what happened in this case which took place actually over a period of two days June
25 to June 26 1974 in tandel
Argentina this one is so interesting because again this is a multiple witness case it took place in a very Urban
location the emotional effects on the Witnesses were quite profound there were
apparent Landing traces and not only that the ETS were back the next day and
viewed by another group of witnesses so this is a pretty extraordinary series of
events this case involves two actual encounters over a period of two days the
first one occurring of course on June 25 1974 was 15 minutes before midnight as
three men Pedro Gomez broo torado and Oscar poy were at the tandal radio
station in tandal Argentina where they worked as dispatchers the Station closed at
midnight and they were just getting ready to go home and it was Oscar who first noticed the presence of a humanoid
figure in front of the window overlooking the back Oscar described him as quote a
being with a fixed gaze protected by a colored helmet they did also notice a
very bright light another one of the witnesses described this being as quote
a strange being with white skin a silvery helmet which seemed fastened onto his head and dark
goggles so they all said that this man was very unusual looking he had a very pale complexion a tapered mus mustache
and a small chin and he was staring into the station room as if to investigate what was going on in there and to the
men they said his face seemed to almost glow they also noticed another weird
detail he had a beard and it was quivering so Pedro Gomez noticed it
after the first witness of followed by bro
torado bro jumped up to turn off the light in the room so he could see
outside better without Reflections and this is when they all saw that the figure had a sort of silvery breast
plate that seemed to be emitting or flashing multicolored
lights for a brief second they thought this might be some kind of joke but it quickly became clear to them that it
wasn't and this man appeared to be floating in the air so they turned the
lights back on they saw that this man was now descending slowly to the ground
all three men quickly ran outside to investigate but by the time they reached outside the man had disappeared but
looking at the ground where he had been they did find strange circular imprints
which were about a/ in deep now one of the witnesses Pedro was so shaken up by
this sighting that he suffered a near nervous breakdown and that's where this
encounter ends but it's super interesting because the very next day two Anonymous men were motorcycling
through tandil near the tandil railway office when sudden suddenly their
motorcycles were turned and halted by an invisible force literally throwing them
both bodily to the ground one of them did receive a slight injury to his knee
but they were all right and getting up this is when they saw a strange figure about 15 ft away and described him
pretty much exactly the same way that the other Witnesses had the previous day
now these new Witnesses had not heard about the previous day's encounter the they looked at the figure for just a few
seconds when quote it seemed to explode without a sound and then vanished and
they told nobody about this for a full month and only came forward after hearing about the encounter which had
occurred the previous day and as it turns out about 2 months earlier and
about 7 miles outside of this same town two men were driving along the highway
when they saw a strange faceless humanoid standing alongside the road
thought it was quite strange and they fled in fear and shortly later the
interior of their car became illuminated by a mysterious strange light so yeah there does appear to be a
series of encounters going on in this one area very close in time I keep
saying it UFOs are appearing all over the planet it's apparent to me that this
is much more common than most people realize this case is interesting because it's your sort of average human looking
extraterrestrial not a lot of cases of ETS with beards but does appear to be an
ET given its uniform and the fact that other people saw it the next day as well describing
it in very much the same way it's floating around there is a UFO
connection to this directly so yeah another fascinating incredible
case and here's another this one I call the robot in the forest
and this one is so interesting because talk about a multiple witness case there's a lot of Witnesses in this case
there's a long history of Encounters in this one particular area but this particular incident took place on August
15 1974 in an area known as bushier oam
France this is a little Park area Li poo Park and yeah multiple Witnesses saw a
very Strang looking robotic figure this next case is quite complicated involving
a series of events over a period of time but wow there are a lot of
witnesses and it was around 9:30 p.m. on August 15
1974 as a group of teenagers and three children were sitting on the grass on the grounds of the LA pelo Park and
talking with each other when suddenly a large white robotic looking figure
stepped out from behind one of the oak trees they said it was about 5T tall and
boy did it look strange it had a large kind of cube shaped head no neck no
visible hands but a very thick body they said his body was very smooth there
didn't appear to be any facial features to it at all and it immediately began
walking towards the group of witnesses is they said with a strange mechanical
gate as a group all of the witnesses rose up in a panic and ran straight to
the Village to inform the adults meanwhile there was another young
couple walking in the area shortly after this and they also saw the strange
figure and they were heading to exit the park when all the children the original
Witnesses came running back in this time with adults so now there Wen nine
Witnesses and as if on Q This figure appeared again this time it was off at a
greater distance they saw for just a few moments when it disappeared apparently
for good into the forest now no UFO was seen But the case did eventually make
its way to researcher and author Jean Paul roner who wrote about it in his
book the guide to Lorraine of the strange
now apparently this park has a history of unusual activity because just three
years later on October 12 1978 three Witnesses claimed that they
saw a glowing white Apparition very much a human looking form but floating in the
air and zooming towards them at super high speed 3 Days Later two witnesses
returned to this area having heard about the previous sighting and said that they also saw two glowing white figures one
of the witnesses tried to chase them in his car the figures moved too quickly away and
disappeared so news about these two settings grew and two days later three
Witnesses went to the area hoping for a sighting and they were were rewarded with one they saw a glowing figure step
out from behind a tree and then flee into the forest at high speed so some of these sound almost
ghostly however further research into this area uncovered an account of an
apparent UFO landing with humanoids dating all the way back to get this
1909 a group of witnesses said that they had seen an unknown machine landed in
the area with human looking figures standing around it apparently the object
did leave Landing traces which were recorded in the local archives
unfortunately all of this was destroyed during World War II so we don't know
much more about it now when you have that many witnesses seeing something would be wholly unscientific to dismiss
this testimony as a hoax a hallucination or misperception or any of the other
go-tos that debunkers and Skeptics often try to use to explain away these
encounters there are too many of them it's very clear something is happening
I don't know how many cases it will take to bring this into the mainstream and convince all of humanity but the fact is
this is going on you can argue about where they're coming from or who they
are but there's definitely something to it and here is another case I call this
one Landing in Tasmania this one is super interesting
with a somewhat peripheral humanoid connection could very well be humanoids might not
be but it took place in February of 1976 in karing Tasmania part of
Australia and I like this case because although there is only a single witness
and the humanoid connection is somewhat iffy The Landing traces in this case are
very interesting this next case comes from researcher Keith Roberts and it
involves what appears to be a landing or near Landing with possible humanoids in
the small town of karing the witness is anonymous but he
says that around 1 a.m. one morning in February of
1976 he looked out the window of his home and saw a strange glowing aircraft
of some kind coming down at a 45° angle and he watched it for a few minutes with
interest as it went down behind a hill near little Oyster Cove now he assumed
this was an aircraft accident of some kind and it was very close to his house
so he went outside hiked over to the hill and looking down was amazed to see
a dome-shaped object sitting on or directly above the ground only about 75
ft away he said it had four Arch shaped Port holes Each of which was emitting a
bright yellow white light through one of these windows he saw a
cylindrical shaped object sort of like a pole through two of the other windows he
saw two motionless gray shapes which he thought might be seats or perhaps
humanoids uh certainly this is something the researchers brought up though the witness did not specifically say
it the craft was metallic aluminum in appearance and around the rim there was
this little flat ction and as it rested there 75 ft away the witness did hear it
emitting a sound like an electrical humming now he wasn't thinking UFO he's
thinking this is some sort of secret military government craft and he watched
it for about 6 or 7 minutes when suddenly the electrical humming noise increased and the object took off slowly
towards the east moving Upward at a 60° angle off into the distance until it was
just a tiny Dot and it was gone so yeah he was not interested in UFOs had no
knowledge of it and believed that this must be a government craft of some kind so the next day when it got light
he went down to where the craft had landed or hovered and was amazed to see that there was a circular area of what
looked like scorched grass he says over time the grass died and was replaced by
a quote tougher cutting grass now it was about a year after the
landing that investigators did interview the witness they went to the scene of the landing and took samples of the soil
and grass in this area they tested it for radiation but did not find any
evidence of that no evidence of high heat in the soil so that was a little
disappointing however it was clear that something about the UFO affected the area as the circle where this craft had
hovered was still plainly visible even one year after the sighting so there you
go another case that's just super hard to deny when someone sees something that
close for that long a period of time and it leaves Landing traces it's clear
something happened I find it interesting that the witness himself is still not convinced to this day that that was
necessarily extraterrestrial and leans towards this being possibly some secret
military craft which is entirely possible but it does beg the question
why would a military craft land right in front of a witness in full view perhaps
they needed to uh perhaps they were in trouble in some way very hard to say I
hate to speculate in cases like these uh there's really no need to because there's always another case to take its
place for example this next case which I call humanoids in little Haven this is a
really interesting case which does rest largely on a one person's testimony
though there are landing traces and electromagnetic effects and another peripheral witness this one took place
on April 19 1977 in at a hotel actually in little
Haven Wales it's really a remarkable case researcher Randall Jones Pew is the
main investigator in this case which involves a landed UFO and two strange
humanoids the primary witness is Rosa Grenville a hotelier employed at the
Haven Fort Hotel in Little Haven Wales and it was around 2 a.m. on April 19
1977 that Rosa went to bed and she was reading a book when this weird humming
noise continued to distract her for a while while she thought that perhaps she had left the heater on which can make a
humming noise strangely her radio had cut out for no reason that she could explain but she didn't think much of it
but after hearing this weird humming noise for about 10 minutes she finally decided to get out of bed to make sure
she had turned off the heater and she had she realized at this point it wasn't her heater so she wondered if it might
be a nearby ship in the bay which sometimes do make noise but looking out the window she saw something else
entirely there was an eerie glowing object landed in the field about 360 ft
away from her window now this light was a very bright blue it was pulsating on
and off and she immediately thought that there might be Intruders of some kind
trying to break into her Cottage or take her chickens which were very close to this area so she grabbed a pair of
binoculars and looking through them she realized she was seeing something she had never seen before this blue lighted
object was actually a large oval round object about 6 ft wide and standing next
to it were two strange figures she estimates that they were about 6 and 1/2 or 7 feet tall they had unusually long
arms and legs and she said the figures looked like they were dressed in plastic
looking white boiler suits which went from head to toe strange Str L she could
not see their faces and as she says in her own words they were turning around
and observing but they had no features at all just a blank face I couldn't even
see a spot they also had pointed heads so as she's watching one of these
humanoids climbed up a little grassy Hill next to the UFO at this point she tried calling out
to her husband who was asleep but found herself speechless
so finally she left the window rushed over to her husband and shook him awake
literally dragging him out of bed and over to the window however when they looked out
together the humanoids in the UFO were gone so was the odd humming noise Rosa
did notice that her clock also had stopped working now when it got light the next
morning she went out to the field where the UFO had rested on the ground and did see some crushed vegetation in the shape
of a sort of crescent and that was that but 8 days later on April 27 she observed a bright
light circling the same field she immediately switched off all the lights in the hotel got her camera and waited
for the light to reappear hoping to capture a photograph unfortunately that
was it after this she contacted researcher Randall Jones Pew and and
shared her encounter and she told him I don't know what it is but I was
petrified if I see it again I am definitely moving from here can't blame
the witness for saying that she'd move away if this happened again this has actually happened to some witnesses
where the UFO activities simply became too intense they moved away from their
home I can think of three cases right off the bat so yeah this just goes to
show that this this is a kind of an experience that really affects a person on multiple levels it can affect you
physically as we have seen but also mentally and spiritually and emotionally
it can it's a really profound superlative experience that can affect a
person for the rest of their lives and often does and we certainly see that in that
case and now we move on to another case which I call three humanoids in a Saturn
shaped UFO this is another multiple witness case quite hard to deny UFOs
flying over the area for some time before they had a very close up sighting with a UFO with apparent humanoids
inside it this took place on July 14 1979 in shaum which is located in the
Netherlands and a really remarkable case because the witnesses got a very close
up view of this craft and humanoids there are two witnesses in
this case they're both Anonymous they're known as Mr B age 20 and his girlfriend
Miss A age 18 and it was over the first few weeks of July
1979 that they both had noticed strange and unusual lights in the night sky but
didn't think too much of them now they definitely Recons Ed when on the evening
of July 14th they had an incredible encounter miss a did live in a large
apartment building which was surrounded by several other buildings in a very urban area of shyam again in the
Netherlands and it was late around 1 a.m. on July
14th uh her boyfriend Mr B had just left the building and was beginning to walk
home and it was at this point that Miss A who was on her third story
balcony preparing to wave goodbye to her boyfriend noticed two round lights which
were flashing on and off at 1 second intervals at a low elevation right in
between two buildings so she called out to her boyfriend to come back which he
did but by the time he reached the balcony these two lights which were orange in color had moved behind one of
the buildings so they waited to see if they would reappear when suddenly the sky lit up with quote a very great and
Broad Flash and this was followed seconds later by another smaller flash
of light moments later a single orange light appeared was solid and slightly
smaller and farther away and it too moved behind a
building so these were more strange lights that they had been seeing just like you know the other ones over the
past few weeks and they were talking about this when yet another appeared from behind a building and this time it
was a large sort of orange red ball and as it moved closer they could see that
this was actually not just Delight it was a solid object it looked like a sort
of Saturn shaped object and inside they could see three dark
Silhouettes now miss a said that they were standing in sort of a transparent top section and as she says they were
very slim built I couldn't see details like their clothing or facial features
but I seem to remember that the figure which was furthest to the right raised his hand the Silhouettes seemed to have
their backs turned and I don't think they saw us I didn't see any equipment in the sphere
itself now her boyfriend's testimony varies slightly he says that while he did see the Silhouettes he believed they
were visible through a large port hole situate situated around the top Dome and
he said the object was a little more oval-shaped than spherical so these are minor differences but as Mr B says there
were also a number of portoles or Windows visible through which I could see three or four Dark Shadows these
figures moved occasionally and it was as if they were looking around exploratively
only their heads and upper bodies were visible but all I could see was a black
silhouette now when speaking with researchers about this Miss B was very
reluctant to mention humanoids but finally did and when the researchers
asked why she hadn't mentioned them at first she said that she did not think
that they would believe her they did observe this object with the humanoids for less than a minute
until it went behind another building and did not emerge investigators did feel that the
Witnesses were totally sincere they were a little puzzled by the variation in their testimony though admittedly four
years had elapsed since the incident occurred and in corroboration of their
testimony they did learn that Miss be's mother had viewed some of these odd
lights that had been appearing the week before the humanoid sighting the researchers were also
little puzzled that they were unable to locate any other Witnesses in such a crowded area I mean there's four or five
very large buildings here with some nearly 2,000 people living
there so that was a little um puzzling to them but not too surprising when you
consider a lot of people don't report this either way the researchers wondered
if perhaps the witnesses had mistaken a helicopter for a UFO
finally and I think this might be important both Witnesses did report having psychic experiences such as
premonitions of deaths of loved ones or precognitive dreams that a UFO story
would appear in the newspaper the next day which they did ultimately the
researchers of this case labeled the encounter unexplained and wrote the shaam case is undoubtedly one of the
most interesting well-documented C3 incident
ever reported from Holland so interesting once again we see this weird
psychic connection with Witnesses reporting a wide variety of paranormal events sometimes seems more the rule
than the exception certainly it is with contact D's but we see it in these Close
Encounter of the Third Kind as well so a really interesting close-up encounter no
I don't think that they were looking at a helicopter most people see helic helicopters all the time they would not
make that mistake and besides helicopters are extremely noisy and the
sound that this craft was making they described as a low rumbling noise which is a description I've certainly heard
before and the investigators again ultimately concluded that it was a very
unusual encounter unusual enough that they did WR about it so here we go to
another case it's funny the term Little Green Men is somewhat cliche in the UFO
field and yet cases of this do turn up and that's what I call this case Little
Green Men this is a sighting which occurred in Neva Denmark on September 28
1988 and it's a super fascinating case of all the cases in this little
collection this one is probably the least authenticated in terms of their
being multiple Witnesses in evidence because no this is just a single witness who saw
a humanoid quite late at night under bad weather conditions but it was a pretty
close encounter and I like this case because it's such an interesting description of a humanoid this case
comes from researcher to houndo and was published in the
Sufi news there's only one witness who has requested total anonymity
which is understandable considering the nature of her sighting it was around 11:30 p.m. on
September 28 1988 as she was driving along gaml strand veg Road through the
town of Neva and it was a rainy night and I'll just let the witness describe in her own words what happened as she
says I did not drive very fast because of the rain and suddenly I saw on the
headlight from the car two small olive green beings about 50 to 55 cm in height
in the gutter's grading where the water ran into so that's about 21 in under 2
ft and as the witness says they both gestured with small arms towards each
other the head was almost egg-shaped but was very pointed towards the chin I
could not see any eyes nose or mouth they were in overalls which were grooved
similar to plastic and covered them completely I was very surprised stopped
the car drove a little up in station v a side road to be able to turn the car
around I had to see the phenomenon again but then I became unexplainably
frightened and I hurried to get on my way and drove quickly home so she observed them for no longer
than 2 or 3 minutes she says but during that time did get a good enough look at them to say that they had an overly
large head wide shoulders very slim hips and very skinny elbows and knees she
also saw that the feet appeared to be pointed and the hands looked like they had a single finger and a thumb or
perhaps mittens while the witness didn't see any UFO she does believe the tiny figures
might have been humanoid extraterrestrials and the only other explanation researchers could come up up
with was children in raincoats though this doesn't explain their strange clothes their oversized
heads what they were doing out so late at night on a very Rainy Night how they
disappeared or their really diminutive size which would be close to a child of
less than 4 years old very strange another incredible case of a humanoid
there's so many of them and this case is interesting because it did take place in
the heart of this little town no I don't think that was a child running around in
a green jumpsuit in the middle of the night while it's raining I mean that makes zero sense
whatsoever and it's kind of funny to me that that is an explanation which the
investigators seriously considered clearly the witness does not believe
that it's another interesting case it's just case after case after case of these humanoids
and now we get to another one which is super interesting this one is a multiple
witness case this one does have some apparent physical evidence as well it's
involves a series of events including a UFO sighting and a very closeup sighting
of a humanoid I call this one the alien in the window and this took place on
June 27 2014 in holy cross this is in lqu Quebec
Canada and I like this case because the witness got a pretty closeup view of
this humanoid staring right at him through the back door window this
incredible case of a UFO and humanoids comes from Maxim bue and it involves two
witnesses a mother and son who experienced a series really of weird events culminating in a Remar able
encounter with a humanoid the mother had just returned to her home in Holy Cross
late in the evening when she noticed quote strange lights in the sky over her
home she wondered briefly if they were ples but did think that they were
strange enough that she tried to look at them through the night vision on her camera but it didn't really work that
well and looking at the lights and seeing how strange they were she started to get frightened and she rushed inside
and as she did so something very strange happened there was a loud thumping noise which hit the wall right next to her but
there was nothing there that she could see so she thought that was strange and a little unnerved she decided to go to
sleep it was now 1230 a.m. and her son she knew would be coming home from work
at around 2:15 a.m. so she lay in bed and she says it
took her almost an hour to fall asleep because she kept hearing these strange sounds outside her window and she was
dozing in bed when she heard her son arriving home meanwhile her son arrived
at home at 2:25 he was creeping quietly into his room not turning on the lights so as not
to wake his mother and that's when it happened as the son says in his own words just Steps From the door of my
room I saw from the corner of my eye towards the door leading to the rear a form watching me I turned my head in
that direction for about 3 seconds I saw a little being about 3 ft tall with a
large head and long skinny arms its shoulders were wider than the rest of
the body his head pressed the glass door with hands on each side of the head as
if he cut the light coming from each side in fact as a thief who looks inside
he watched me when he saw that I saw I blinked to make sure I wasn't
hallucinating it disappeared quickly I was so surprised and at the same time I
panicked I did not dare go near the door to go outside my mother woke up about a half
hour later and I told her what I had seen now his mother confirms this and
says a little freaked he said you'll never guess what I saw earlier in the
rear door window his eyes were frightened and he did not want to go he got scared and my son is not shy usually
he said he saw a being about 1 M High which looked inside this confirmed my
feeling that there was something wrong that I strongly felt a few hours before
he saw the outline given the darkness and the light light that came from behind it so the sun continues his
testimony as he says she immediately turned on the outside light to see if
there was something but there was nothing I did not sleep all night we
were both scared because my mother told me what she had heard a few hours before
all surrounding noises became suspect I've never seen that
before both were really puzzled because their backyard had a locked gate nobody
should be able to enter or exit and the next day examining the area they did
find some weird evidence it turned out that a small light which they had stuck in the soil in the garden had been
mysteriously moved a few feet such a shame the young man in this case didn't
wake his mother up right away and call out to her so she could see this too though it's apparent that uh I mean when
something like this happens people often don't react the way they think they would it's so shocking
that people are often Paralyzed by their own fear and don't have the presence of
mind to get other Witnesses or take a picture or anything like that more often
than not they run away but certainly an interesting case given that the mother
herself had such a weird night with UFOs flying over the house weird noises
outside her home guessing the ET was there the whole time I mean that's pure
speculation but clearly something was going on the Sun comes home and he sees it so yeah a truly incredible
case and and now we move to the last one of this Bunch this case is so
interesting because it is really unusual in all of its aspects I call this one
the aliens by the cross it's very recent it took place on May 3rd
2022 in a very small village called Christo
bovich this is in bellarus R Russia and it's such an interesting case
because this w witness got a very closeup view of this landed UFO which
was very unusual in its appearance got a very closeup view view of these apparent
ETS that came out of it which also had a really unusual appearance their behavior
was quite unusual what happened to her as a result of this encounter was also
pretty strange and the location itself with this UFO landing right next to this
cross a memorial so all these aspects kind of add up to make this case really
incredible this next case comes from a researcher by the name of TV badina She
interviewed the main witness whose name is lub Dona small skaya uh this witness
lubov is 88 years old on the night in question May 3rd
2022 she had not been feeling well she wasn't sleeping well either it was
around 2:18 a.m. when she woke up because a bright light was shining in
through the window of her home located in this very small village now she
thought it might be lightning at first but there was no Thunder and she looked out the window and got an incredible
shock and I'll just quote lubov directly as she says I saw the outlines of some
kind of glowing box that stood on the road not far from the roadside cross and
looked like a TV someone came out of the TV a certain person who got something this person had
dark or gray skin resembling a strong tan an elongated rectangular head like a
post or hay stack suddenly a headlight came on at the back of the box burgundy
and mother of pearl or perhaps it was the creature that turned on something like a powerful Lantern
then it became clear that in the Box sat another creature also strange but
lighter in color with a head resembling a head of cabbage and pimples all over
the body like a toad the creature passed something to the other person standing next to it his
hand was very wide compared to a human's suddenly a spotlight began to
shine directly through the window now lubov fear that the ETS had
realized that she was watching them and she also began to wonder if perhaps that was the reason for their visit that they
were actually coming for her so she quickly moved away from the window and was amazed when this weird beam of light
seemed to follow her she quickly rushed over to another window and saw that the
beam of light was now gone and she watched as these two beings got back
into this small box-shaped object and one minute later this object began to float slowly down
the road sending down this weird beam of light she said that this light was
unlike anything she had ever seen before so this really quite scared her she ran
into bed and hid under the covers and didn't come out until morning but the next morning she did go
outside to investigate the area where she had seen all this again this was right in front of a cross by her house a
little Memorial and when she went there she found some odd things first she found a small circle of
old leaves and withered grass but she also found this small mound of Pebbles
none of this was here before she wondered if these ETS were responsible
for some weird health issues because following this she was diagnosed with covid but she also recovered abnormally
quickly so she sort of connects that to all of this she also found it curious
that the landing location was so close to the cross and wondered if that was a
factor investigators were not able to locate any other Witnesses which wasn't
surprising as it was very very late and there are very few houses in that area
but they did notice something else the apricot and willow trees in this area showed apparent damage and withered over
the next year all right there you go another really incredible case of a
humanoid can't say I've ever heard of one quite like that it's interesting
that this witness described the light being so unusual that she had difficulty describing it this is a detail many
witnesses talk about that the lights from these UFOs are different than normal lights in some way her
physiological reactions are also interesting given that she suddenly came
down with covid and felt like perhaps this was due to the visitors in some way
who she believes Also may have healed her all that is somewhat unclear in this case but as you may know there are many
cases of people who claim to have been healed as a result of a UFO encounter
particularly being struck by a beam of light so that does fit in with these
other cases another really interesting aspect of this case are the landing traces the Dead Leaves where this craft
had landed the fact that it caused the apricot and willow trees to wither but
most unusual for me is that there was this little pile of Pebbles or stones in
the area where this craft had landed a pile of stones that apparently wasn't there before this
encounter so yeah a really interesting case and there you go 12 cases from all
over the world reaching back to the 1950s all the way up to pretty much the
present day and many many different types of humanoids some really
compelling evidence lots of multiple witness cases I mean don't know what
again what it's going to take to get this subject accepted by mainstream
scientists the fact is Skeptics as a rule refuse to even examine the
evidence so that has got to change there clearly is something going on here it
makes perfect sense that these are extraterrestrials I I mean that's my
assessment just based on the totality of all the evidence given that these craft
do have Port holes and windows and humanoids are coming out and they're leaving Landing traces on the soil many
people report being implanted and some of these implants have been removed and studied some people report
pregnancies then they see the babies and they even see these babies grown up as
adults I mean given that these craft have reportedly crashed and been retrieved by our military and are being
reverse engineered I think all of this points towards the Extraterrestrial explanation pretty
strongly again given that these craft are very much interested in nuclear
materials none of the this sounds like something that say demons would do or
some spiritual intelligence that might be you know completely beyond our own
ability to even understand I suppose anything is possible and I'm sure there
there are a lot of different things going on here that's why I do this research so that we can figure out just
lay out the facts here are the cases we can make up our own minds and hopefully hopefully come to a
consensus so that's it for today 12 cases of humanoids I hope you've enjoyed
the show I really appreciate you watching uh thank you so much for coming
here each week and tuning in it's because of you I do these shows so thank you thank you thank you and until next
week keep searching for the truth it's out there keep asking those hard questions it's important we do and most
important of all keep having fun and I will see you next week bye now
