MISSING TIME WITH ALIENS: TWELVE ASTONISHING CASES
Jul 25, 2025

Summary:
Jul 25, 2025
One controversial aspect of extraterrestrial encounters is the phenomenon known as missing time. People who have a close encounter suddenly find that minutes or even hours have passed that they cannot account for. Research has shown that cases of missing time are likely unremembered onboard experiences. This feature is very common and very confusing and scary for the witness. This video presents twelve amazing cases of missing time in connection with a face-to-face encounter with humanoids.

A SENSE OF COMPLETE PEACE. One summer day in 1942, two children from Surrey, England, were taking a walk and became overcome with a feeling of utter peace. Two handsome men in strange clothes approached and proceeded to impart prophecies of future events. The children lost consciousness. They ran home to discover that they had been missing for 24 hours.

AN UNCONQUERABLE URGE. One night in November 1961, a man was in his beach-house in Pinhal, Brazil when a strong impulse drew him outside. He saw a glowing craft sitting on the beach. Two humanoids emerged and walked up to him. The next thing he knew, he was back in front of his house, missing two hours of time.

THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY. One day in July 1968, a group of friends hiked along the Mina Rivera near Monte Britton, Puerto Rico and came upon a tall, green-skinned humanoid standing in the river. The friends were entranced by the sight. The next thing they knew, it was dark, and four hours had passed.

I WANTED TO STAY WITH THEM. One day in October 1973, two brothers were walked in the woods at Fall Creek Falls, Tennessee. An odd silence settled around them, and one brother fled. The younger boy found himself face-to-face with three gray aliens. Running back to his family, he learned that he had been missing for a full hour.

I KNEW IT WAS A UFO. On July 15, 1977, a mother and son watched a saucer-shaped craft from the window of their home in Westchester, Pennsylvania. A window in the craft revealed the presence of six humanoids. The son ran to get his telescope but never made it. The next thing he knew, he and his mother were in the hallway. The craft was gone. Oddly, both went to bed and never discussed it.

A PART OF US. One night in November 1980, a lady woke up to see a glowing craft outside her farm near Todmorden, England. Suddenly, she found herself outside, sitting on the ground, staring at three short humanoids. The next thing she knew, she was back in bed and the UFO was leaving. The next morning, she found that many of their chickens had died mysteriously.

SOME KIND OF ALIENS. On the night of June 19, 1987, four people drove on a remote road outside Croton Falls, New York. Their car died. Three gray aliens approached. One of the witnesses shone a flashlight at them and the aliens ran off into the woods. Then a large craft rose up and disappeared. Driving home, they were missing two hours of time.

IT SENDS CHILLS DOWN MY SPINE. On the night of October 22, 1988, a father and son were asleep in their truck after a day of hunting in Joe Daviess County, Illinois. The son woke up to a sense of being watched. He opened his eyes and saw a gray alien looking at him. He found himself going outside, where he saw five gray aliens and a large craft. The ETs led him to the craft, and that’s all he could remember.

IT’S TIME TO TELL THE TRUTH. On the night of July 25, 1989, a father and son drove to their home in Catoosa, Oklahoma. A UFO appeared in front of their car. Through the portholes, they saw aliens looking down at them. A blue light struck their car. The son recalled seeing ETs outside the car. Both witnesses passed out and woke up to see the UFO darting away. They were missing 40 minutes of time.

A PRESENCE IN MY ROOM. On the night of August 17, 1994, a lady was woken by a bright light entering the bedroom of her home in Alabama. Four gray ETs entered and floated her out of bed, down the hall and to the front door. Elaine gripped the wall, but promptly passed out. When she woke up, it was morning.

IT GOT FRIGHTENING. On the night of October 5, 1995, a couple and their son were sleeping in their camper at Red Canyon Campgrounds in the Manzano Mountains of New Mexico. The wife was woken by a bright light. She woke her husband, and both saw three strange humanoids outside. Suddenly it was morning. They forget the entire event until several years later.

I FLOATED UP OUT OF BED. On the night of October 1, 2017, Chuck of Vienna, Virginia was awakened by a light in the hallway. The door opened and blue-skinned hooded beings came in, removed his CPAP mask and floated him out of bed and out of his room. He passed out. His next memory was being floated back into bed by the same creatures.

These cases come from all over the world, each showing this peculiar amnesia effect that is present in so many cases. The question remains, why? Are the ETs doing this, or does the human mind suppress these events?

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. Today I'm going to be talking about missing time. The title of
today's episode is Missing Time with Aliens, 12 astonishing cases. Missing
time is a big issue when it comes to UFO Encounters. It's very consistently
reported. Many people do not remember the entirety of their encounters. And
this can be with a simple UFO sighting, but more often when humanoids are involved. This is quite a controversial
issue. Some people do believe the ETSs are wiping or blocking people's
memories. Others feel that perhaps this is the human mind's reaction to trauma.
And there's certainly evidence for both of these scenarios. In many cases, ETSs
will tell people, "You won't remember this or you won't remember this for some time or you'll remember it as a dream,"
something along those lines. But we also know from psychology that trauma can be
easily blocked by the human mind. We see this with war veterans, victims of child
abuse, anyone who goes through a traumatic incident. This sometimes does get blocked from their minds. At any
rate, amnesia is very commonly reported. Often people do experience this. It's a
huge, huge red flag that they've very likely been taken on board and don't
recall it. I do think that's what's happening in the cases I'm going to cover today. But I think this particular
aspect of UFO encounters deserves a closer look, and that's why I wanted to do this episode today. I've got 12
amazing cases for you today coming from all over the world. Several from the
United States, including Alabama, Illinois, New Mexico, New York,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia. Also, one from Puerto Rico,
two from the United Kingdom, and one finally from Brazil. These cases also
cover a very long period of time as early as 1942
up to 2017. So this is how ubiquitous how often
missing time occurs and that's why it's so important. So let's just get started
with our first case which I call a sense of complete peace. This one occurred in
the summer of 1942 somewhere near Suri, England. And it's an important case for
a number of reasons. It's a very early case predating the modern age of
eupfology in 1947. A very very early case of missing time
which again shows that this has been happening for a very long time. It's also very interesting. This is in
wartime also involving what we would call humanlooking or Nordic ETS. There's
a lot of interesting elements to this particular case. This case comes from UK researcher Jenny Randles and was
published in her book Abduction. There are two witnesses, Bernard and Angela.
The information comes largely from Bernard, but as Jenny writes, there is no doubting his sincerity or his
intelligence. The encounter occurred in the summer of 1942. This is during World
War II. Bernard was 11 years old and his friend Angela was 12. They were very
good friends and had gone to a hill near Suri in the UK to look for empty bullet
casings. They then lay down in the grass and this is when suddenly Bernard says
he was overcome with a strange feeling. As Bernard says, "For the first and only
time in my life, I felt a sense of complete peace come over me." So they
both lay there utterly relaxed but definitely not asleep when they heard a man's voice say, "Here they are." Both
children sat up and were amazed to see two very handsome men wearing bright colored clothes or a suit of some kind.
And as Bernard says, they gave off an aura of pure peace and tranquility.
Above them there was a very bright light which they thought at first must be the sun, but it was radiating heat down on
them. So, this could have been a craft. They're not sure. At any rate, one of the men approached, kneelled down next
to Bernard and Angela, while the other stayed back, and held some kind of instrument in his hand. The two men
spoke to each other, but in a strange way, quoting numbers, talking about time
in ways that Bernard and Angela couldn't fully understand. But at one point, Bernard remembers one of them saying,
"They are beautiful children, aren't they?" The strangest part, at least so far, was that the men began to speak
about the children's future, seeming to know everything that would happen to them.
He said many things, most of which Bernard and Angela could not really remember. Bernard does remember that he
asked one of the men at one point, "Where do you come from?" The man gazed up into the sky and replied, "I come
from a long way away." There was a lot more said. Then finally, the man warned
them that no matter what happened, the children should not reveal that they had seen them. The men then told them to go
to sleep. The next thing Bernard and Angela remember is waking up to see that
the two men were gone. They headed down the hill and began to walk home. As they passed a farm, an adult saw them, asked
their names, and apparently knew something because he told them to go home quickly. It was at that point that
Bernard did notice a little blue kind of puncture mark on the artery of his inner arm. He showed it to his friend Angela,
and she looked at her own arm and saw an identical mark in the same place. So they arrived home thinking that they had
been gone for at most 2 or 3 hours, but instead their parents were frantic,
horrified, and of course relieved because it turned out the children were missing for a full 24 hours.
Angela unfortunately had to return to London and Bernard lost touch with her,
but he reports that from that day forward, his life was changed forever. He never was able to remember what
happened during the missing 24 hours, but nor could he forget the encounter with these strange men. In fact, he said
it caused him to question his own sanity to a degree and eventually led him to seek the help of doctors and
psychiatrists and finally UFO researcher Jenny Randles in the hopes that she
could at least help him confirm the reality of his experience. But all Jenny
could tell him was that many others have had similar encounters. And as Jenny Randles says, I have little reason to
doubt, at least to doubt that the witness believes it took place. He thinks that case is important for a
number of reasons. First, we have two witnesses. So that lends more credence
to this case. Also, a period of 24 hours it missing. That's quite a long period
of time. Again, it's a very early example of missing time that also makes
it important. The sense of peace the witnesses describe, that's also fairly
consistent and super interesting. And finally, I think it's important because it shows how profoundly an encounter
like this can affect a person for the rest of their lives. He never did, as far as I know, recall what happened
during that missing time. And that's true for a lot of people who have this kind of experience.
In fact, let's move to the next case. I call this one an unconquerable urge.
This occurred in November of 1961 in Pinhal, Brazil. This is a beach area
where the gentleman had a little beach house. He had an really incredible encounter that began with a very strong,
irresistible impulse to go out onto the beach. This is super interesting to me
because there are a number of cases that start exactly this way. This case comes from Coral and Jim Laorenzan of the
aerial phenomenon research organization APRO and was reported by APRO chief
South American investigator Olavo T. Fontes and was published in the book
Encounters with UFO Occupants by Jim and Coral Lorenzan. Apparently, Alavo
Tfantes is the primary researcher, but the sole witness in this case is a
travel agent and real estate agent, Cavahro Mendes. He is also a retired
member of the Porto Allegre Police Force in Brazil. He owned a beach house on
Pinhal Beach, not far from Porto Allegre in Brazil. And it was around 9:30 p.m.
one evening in November of 1961. He was alone in his small beach house. Was a
very hot November night. He was unable to sleep. And he found himself being driven by a powerful and inexplicable
unconquerable urge to go out onto the beach and take a walk. He really just
wanted to sleep. But unable to resist this urge, he finally just gave in, left
his house, and began to walk towards the beach. And almost immediately, he noticed a huge bright light in the sky.
He estimated it was about 900 ft away, very low in the sky. He thought for a
second it might be a light used by the fishermen who frequent the beach, but he felt this very strong desire to approach
it and found himself walking in its direction. Now, getting closer to this light, he was amazed to see that it was
actually some kind of object now resting on the beach itself. and he kept walking
closer and he could now see that it was in fact a glowing discshaped craft. And
the closer he got to it, he says the stronger he felt this urge to approach it. And finally, upon reaching it, he
saw two figures step out from behind this craft and move in front of it. He
said it was difficult for him to discern any details because the light behind them was so bright, but he could see
that they were wearing helmets very similar to those worn by football players. But at this point, Kel Valhero
felt he should retreat. It wasn't like he was afraid or panicky, but as he says, he was unnerved by the strangeness
of the situation. It was then that he got the impression that the beings were attempting to communicate with him
telepathically. And they told him, "Don't resist because you can't. It's
hopeless. If you doubt us, try to move your body." And hearing this, the
witness did try to move and found that he was completely unable. He was frozen to the spot like a statue. And these
beings approached him and he says they began to use some kind of instrument on his forehead. But at this point, he lost
consciousness or blacked out. And the next thing he knew, he was back very
close to his beach house. And this is when he looked at his watch and was surprised to see that it was already
11:30 p.m. His short walk to the beach and brief encounter with the landed UFO
and occupants had somehow taken a full 2 hours. Now, at first, the strangeness of
his encounter encouraged him to keep it a secret. But after a few weeks, he began to realize that this experience
had impacted him very profoundly. Formerly calm and cool, he now became
nervous, depressed, anxious, he just wanted to be alone. Several months like
this went by when he finally decided it was time to share his experience, and he contacted retired Brazilian Air Force
officer, Captain FV Cardoso, and Lieutenant Colonel WCB Schneider of the
Brazilian Army. Both of these men were experienced UFO investigators. So he
confided his experience to them and they interviewed him in detail. And after hearing everything and knowing that he
had missing time, they suggested that he go under hypnosis to remember what happened during this missing time. But
Caval Harrow refused. It was just 5 years later in 1966 that the Betty and
Barney Hill case was getting international attention. So researcher Olavo T Fontes contacted Cavalero,
informed him of the Hills case and tried once again to convince him to undergo hypnotic regression and see what
happened during this missing time. But once again, the witness steadfastly refused to cooperate. So what occurred
during this missing time remains a mystery. Definitely an important and compelling case for a number of reasons.
It's very interesting because this point missing time was only just beginning to be recognized. The Betty and Barney Hill
case was getting some publicity. So that's interesting. It's also, I think,
a good case because this witness is of pretty high credibility. A former police
officer. He's got no reason to make up stuff like this. And also interesting because he was just dead set against
going under hypnosis. So, he clearly did have missing time. We
see these markers in so many cases where someone is in the middle of an incident
and suddenly it's over and they find themselves in a different location.
Really important. So, let's move to the next case which I call this May sound
crazy. This one is another multiple witness case. Half of the cases in this collection are multiple witness cases.
Again, raises the level of credence for each of these cases. I think this one occurred in July of 1968
in Monty, Britann, Puerto Rico. This is a very popular tourist spot actually.
It's a beautiful area, but this case is interesting because the description of the humanoid is really almost unique. I
mean there are other similar descriptions of this type of humanoid. No UFO was seen but this was a crowd of
people or a fairly large group of people who had this encounter with this
humanoid and apparently all experienced missing time. This case comes from
prolific researcher Jorge Martin and was published in the publication Evidencia
issue number eight. The primary witness is Freddy Anderson Radcliffe, but he's
certainly not the only witness. It was one afternoon in July 1968 that he and a
group of friends had climbed Elon, that's a mountain, and they were on their way back from Mount Bratton in the
El Yankke area of Puerto Rico. They were following the bank of the Rio de Lamina
River, which approaches Highway 191. You can see it here. And this is when they
suddenly came upon a strange creature that was clearly not human. It stood in
the water no more than 12 feet away from them. And as Freddy, the main witness, says, "Suddenly, we bumped into that
thing standing there, about 6 feet tall, and he was pretty skinny. He had long arms, longer than ours, and his hands
reached his knees. Long hands with long fingers. It had no clothes on. It was
all green and it had a big head that was wider down to the chin. This may sound
crazy, but it had something like a fine hair covering its entire body. It had
big high round eyes, a deep green color, and two little cracks for a nose. His
mouth was like a thin line without lips. Its hands had only four fingers. And
another thing, that creature had no ears. Now, at this point, something very
strange happened. The witnesses all seemed to fall into some kind of trance. And the next thing they knew, it was
8:00 p.m. at night. They were missing about 4 hours of time. And as Freddy
says, something strange happened to us there. When we saw that thing out in the water of the river in front of us, it
was like 4:00 in the afternoon. It was daytime. I just can't explain it. We don't know what happened. But when we
reacted, it was already night. It was dark. That thing, the creature, was no
longer there. We could never explain what happened. We still can't. Confused and frightened, we left there at once.
We still don't know what happened there that day, but one thing is certain. That thing, that green creature was there,
and we all saw it. It was a very strange thing. Can you imagine having a
face-to-face encounter with this strange humanoid during the day, and the next thing you know, it's gone. Suddenly,
it's night. Four hours have passed. That's a long time. And it's really interesting because this was not just
one or two people. There was a good number of people who experienced this. Very bizarre. They didn't see any UFO.
That's also interesting. I suspect that they may have been taken on board, but it's absolutely pure speculation at this
point because we don't know. As far as I know, none of them went under hypnosis.
So maybe something else is going on here. This is why taking a closer look at these cases is so important. And
there's a lot. Here is another one which I call I wanted to stay with them. This
occurred in the fall of 1973 in Fall Creek Falls, Tennessee. This
witness is quite young. However, there is some good evidence in terms of
outside supporting witnesses. It's an important case because often contact
does start at a very early age. He also had a followup visitation and the
missing time aspect was confirmed by his parents. In October of 1973, there was a
huge wave of sightings and humanoid encounters sweeping across the United States. It was during this time that a
four-year-old boy, Gavin, that is a pseudonym, had his first experience with
a gray ET and missing time. He was with his parents and his older six-year-old
brother. They were all going horseback riding in the woods at Fall Creek Falls State Park. This is just north of
Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father and brother were riding their own separate horses while Gavin rode with his mother,
who was a very experienced rider. Now, the first odd thing to occur was that Gavin's older brother's horse became
spooked for some reason and nearly ran off with him. Thankfully, they did manage to control the horse, but after
this, neither Gavin or his brother really wanted to continue riding, so their parents allowed them to get off
the horses and run ahead on the trail while they followed. This is a pretty rural area. You can see it here. But as
Gavin says, "After a few moments, my brother and I were alone in the woods.
Then everything around us got very quiet, and there was an odd feeling of stillness in the air. My brother got
scared and ran back down the trail, leaving me all alone. I then have a
memory of a few humanoid looking grayish beings coming up next to me. My next
memory was being on the edge of the woods with the creatures looking out into a parking lot next to the horse
barn. They were saying I had to return to my family, but I recall not wanting
to go, but wanting to stay with them. Hesitantly, I walked out of the woods
towards the car. I looked over my shoulder one time at them, then walked up to the car. Now, as Gavin approached
the family car, his mother rushed up to him because unknown to him, he had been
missing for almost an hour, and they were just about to contact the park ranger to begin a search for him. And as
Gavin says, that was my first experience with the grays. But it was only a few
weeks later that he had his second experience also involving missing time with aliens. His parents had come home
after going to a country club for dinner and they gave him some crackers from the restaurant which he put on a shelf and
went into bed. Now they left the door open, his bedroom door, because Gavin was a little bit afraid to sleep with
the door closed. But in the middle of the night, he woke up, crawled out of bed, and sat on the floor next to the
shelf where he grabbed the crackers. And as he began to open the plastic wrapper,
something strange began to happen. As Gavin says, I felt something strange.
The first sensation was a feeling like heat on my back. Then I heard a pulsing
humming sound. I looked up and could see a shadow on my door from someone in the
hallway. The sensations intensified and I became afraid. I ran back to my bed
and curled up in a ball and closed my eyes. I thought, "Oh, I should have
covered myself with my blanket." So at this point, the pulsing humming sound became even louder and Gavin suddenly
felt the touch of fingers on his body. But just as suddenly the feeling
stopped, the sound stopped. Gavin opened his eyes and saw that his bedroom was empty and everything was back to normal.
But still frightened, he crept out of bed, peered out into the hallway. It was empty, so he cautiously went down the
hallway and into his parents' room. He approached his mother's side of the bed, shook her gently, and whispered, "Mom,
mom, wake up." Strangely, she would not awaken. And this is when he felt that
same strange sensation of heat, and again heard the pulsing humming sound.
So he became frightened. He fell to the floor, curled up, and as Gavin says,
"This time I kept my eyes open. I looked over at a dresser with the mirror on top
and observed a small figure come out of the wall. It looked grayish in the shadows, and I could see it had a large
head and big black eyes. I closed my eyes, but not before I saw some feet
move closer to me. Then I felt fingers touching me again. They reached around
my head. One of the fingers slipped into my mouth. I then bit down on it as hard
as I could. It was soft and not like my own fingers. It had a spongy, rubbery
texture to it. Then I blacked out. Now, when Gavin woke up, it was already
morning. He was still curled up on the floor in his parents' room. And he told them when they woke up, "There was a
gray tickle monster in my room." And he refused to go back into his room until his father conducted a thorough search.
He didn't of course find anything, but as Gavin says, "The whole experience was terrifying for me." Now, despite his
encounter that morning, his parents sent him off to school. Gavin carpulooled with three other kids, and he explained
to them in detail what had happened to him that night. Two of them did not believe him, but interestingly, the
third girl said that she knew what he was talking about, and it turned out she lived just across the street from him.
These were apparently Gavin's only encounters. He actually waited 38 years
to report them. A truly profound encounter and some very interesting details to it. I've heard a number of
contactes say that yes, they would have stayed with the ETs given the chance.
And while this was clearly somewhat traumatic for the witness, he still wanted to stay with him. How interesting
is that? Also interesting is they actually bit the ET. There are a few cases of this. I've investigated some
personally. That's also interesting. I would have loved to talk to the brother and see what he remembered. And the
parents as well because as we know contact is often generational. And if a
person is having contact very likely their parents or grandparents, aunts or uncles or their children, someone else
in their family group is likely having encounters. So, there are still a lot of
questions about what's going on here that are difficult to answer without having further interviews with the
witnesses. But what's amazing is you can disregard that case if you want because there's always another. Here's a very
interesting case. This one doesn't have a whole lot of details to it, but I think it's an important case. I call
this one I knew it was a UFO. This occurred on July 15, 1977 in
Westchester, Pennsylvania. Pretty active area there. I like this case because it
does involve two witnesses and their reaction to this very close-up UFO
sighting with humanoids is very interesting and somewhat
consistently reported. People do not react the way you think you would when you have a very close encounter like
this. Again, this case involves a mother and son. Her son was 18 years old, and
he is the primary witness. Was on the night of July 15, 1977 that his mother
came into his thirdf flooror bedroom in their home in Westchester, Pennsylvania, and woke him up. And she said, "I have
to show you something." So he followed her down to her bedroom on the second story. And together they looked out the
bedroom window at a saucer-shaped object hovering over a building across the
parking lot behind their house. And as the son says, I knew it was a UFO as
soon as I saw it. This object was big, about 60 to 75 ft wide. He said was
dome-shaped on top and a smaller dome on the bottom. But around the circumference was a row of large almost 4 foot by 8
foot colored lights. They were green, orange, red, and yellow. And they were
rotating around the circumference. Now, above the lights and on the dome itself
was a large window, kind of like a windshield, trapezoidal in shape. And as
the sun says, I could see several occupants through the windshield. Two
tall occupants and four shorter ones. So both he and his mom were shocked and he
told his mom that he was going to go to his bedroom to get his telescope so he could take a closer look, but he never
made it there. As the son says, I don't remember what happened after that. The
next thing I remembered was walking down the steps without my telescope. My mom was standing in the second floor hallway
and told me the UFO went straight up and was gone in 2 seconds. We then just said
good night and didn't mention the incident. I turned around and I was walking upstairs to my bedroom. My brain
was empty with no thoughts, almost zombie-like. So, neither of them talked about this
incident to anyone for several years, not to family or friends. Later, they
would have two other sightings somewhat distant. And in 2014, some 37 years
after the first encounter, the son finally did file a report. But what happened during this missing time
remains a mystery. Again, not a lot of details to that case, but certainly
important. I love that the witness provided a sketch that always helps to visualize what a person is seeing. does
appear to be a typical UFO, but to me the most interesting aspect is how these witnesses reacted as if, well, we saw a
UFO. Let's go to bed. So, clearly there's something going on here psychologically speaking. And I said it
before, but missing time is a huge red flag. I do think that they were probably
taken on board. I would love to talk to them, ask them if they had any scars on their body. Was anything else unusual
going on? Did they have any dreams about this encounter? So, there's still some
an unanswered questions here, but a very good example of what happens when a person has a closeup sighting of UFOs
and aliens resulting in missing time. Here's another case, also very
interesting. I call this one a part of us. This occurred in November of 1980 in
Todd Mortyn, UK. It's an important case because there is some physical evidence
supporting the reality of this event. It happened to a lady who lived on a farm
in a pretty rural area. Woke up in the middle of the night and had this amazing
encounter and very clear-cut case of missing time.
This case comes from UKbased researcher Nigel Mortimer. He's the author of
several books on this subject. And this case first appeared in the February 1990
issue of Northern UFO News in an article written by Nigel. The witness was given
the pseudonym Jane. She was 41 years old at the time of the incident and lived on
a rural farm just north of Todd Morton in the UK. After a hard day's work on
her farm, she was awakened suddenly from a deep sleep by a bright orange light
shining into her bedroom window. So, she woke up. She looked at the clock. She could see it was 1:00 a.m. She shook her
husband trying to wake him up, but he would not awaken. So, looking out her
window, she saw what the source of the light was coming from. a brilliant orange oval-shaped object rising up from
behind a nearby field. This object was surrounded by an aura of white light.
Suddenly, without any warning, Jane found herself walking outside on the
landing of her house without knowing how she got there. And then again, with no apparent transition, she found herself
sitting in the grass outside her farmhouse, looking straight at this UFO. And lo and behold, there were three
strange entities standing beside it. Jane said her body felt numb all over.
She tried to stand up but couldn't. A second attempt to stand up also failed.
Jane says she felt as if there was some kind of force holding her down. She saw that the figures were about 5t tall and
appeared to be wearing quote black colored diving suits. They were standing
in the shadow of an outbuilding and it made it difficult for her to see them in any real detail. But Jane says she later
had a very strong quote impression that their suits were actually green in color. All three of the figures remained
very still and she felt as if they were watching her. But the next thing Jane
knew, she was back in bed trying to wake up her husband. He woke up this time,
but of course the UFO was now gone. And looking at the clock, she saw that it was now 1:20. This puzzled her because
she thought the duration of the encounter was no more than a few moments.
So they got up the next morning at 6:00 a.m. and their son went outside to complete the morning tasks, which are
quite a few on a farm. He came into the house for breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and was
in shock. He reported that 20 of their chickens of their flock of 40 chickens
were now dead. All of the chickens in the coupe were fine, but all the ones in
the chicken run, which was very close to where Jane had seen this UFO hovering,
were dead and were emanating a foul odor, as if they had been dead for days.
Now, at this point, Jane hadn't even told her son about the UFO and the humanoids she had seen. Now, Jane
reported that she had never really shown any interest in UFOs, but she does consider herself an untrained psychic,
very proficient in the use of a pendulum, a dowsing rod, doing psychic healing, and this kind of thing. But she
does feel that the ETSs are somehow connected, she says, with other dimensions. And as she wrote to
investigators, and I quote, I think they were a part of us. One final note is
that their son has now become very interested in UFOs and often spends his time skywatching. How interesting is
that? There are definitely some patterns here we see in these missing time cases where a person is in one location and
suddenly they're in another. She felt herself unable to get up. So there was clearly some absolute influence going on
with her. And the chickens at the end of this story is clearly an effect from the
UFO because there was no reason for that many chickens to suddenly just perish.
It's also interesting that the witness reports having a lot of psychic abilities. That's a pattern we see in a
number of cases. Also interesting to me is that the son became very interested in this subject. So yeah, a lot to learn
from that case. And it's funny because you can dismiss one case or two, but there's always another to take it pl
take its place. And here is another really interesting case. I like this one
because this does have four witnesses of high credibility. I call this one some
kind of aliens. This took place on June 19, 1987 in Croin Falls, New York. This
was during the middle of a massive UFO wave in this area known as the Hudson
Valley UFO wave. And this case has some super interesting elements to it in
terms of not only having four witnesses,
but the fact that their car died uh when this encounter began. So this is what we
call electromagnetic disturbances happens in a number of these cases and
this is another one which is a very clearcut case of missing time. This remarkable multiple witness case comes
from UFO researcher Philip Imbrogno and appeared in the October November 1991
issue of UFO Universe. It occurred during the middle of the famous Hudson
Valley, New York UFO wave, as I said, which involved not only sightings, but
really the full range of UFO ET encounters. Was at 11:30 p.m. on June
19, 1987 that the four witnesses, who were two married couples with
professional careers, were on their way back to their homes in Croin Falls after
visiting New York City. They were driving south of Brewster and heading
towards Croin Falls and they decided to take a shortcut along a dirt road known
as Magnetic Mine Road. You can see it here. It travels along the edge of the
Croin Falls Reservoir. This is a dark forested road. So, they had the high
beams of their car on. They just passed over a small bridge. You can see it
here. and were heading down the road when for no reason that they could see their car engine started to fail and
then before long it quit completely. Also, the headlights went out. Now,
repeated attempts to restart the engine failed. So, the driver finally got out,
opened the hood, and inspected the engine. But finding nothing wrong, he returned again to the car, tried again
to start it, but of course, it still would not start. So, all four witnesses sat in the car and were trying to figure
out how to handle this situation. And this is when they heard the sound of footsteps off to the side of the car.
Now, one of the witnesses rolled down the car window and listened more closely and said, "It sounds like a number of
people walking." So, one of the men retrieved a flashlight from the glove compartment, and he shown it towards the
source of the noise, but didn't see anything. So he exited the car, walked to the edge of the road, and scanned the
bushes with his flashlight. And this is when everyone heard him yell fearfully,
"Good God!" And he ran back into the car. The others, of course, asked him what he saw, and he said very fearfully,
"Out there, some kind of creatures. They looked like some kind of aliens." Now,
at this point, these apparent extraterrestrials walked right up to the car and stood
about 10 ft away. All the witnesses could now see them. There were three of these figures standing in a row. They
described them as 4t tall with very large heads. This sounds like grays. The
man with the flashlight shown the beam of light on the creatures, which caused the being's eyes to reflect bright
orange. Now, as if frightened by this flashlight, the beings reacted by
running down the hill into what appeared to be a quote hole in the side of the hill. Now, it was at this point that all
four witnesses saw what they described as a large triangular shaped object, which had bright yellow lights around
the edge. said it was about the size of a house was hovering off to the side of the road about 500 feet up in the air
directly above where the witnesses had seen these short little creatures
disappear into the woods. Immediately the UFO sent down a beam of red light.
It moved in three wide sweeping circles over the area. Then the object just
disappeared. It seemed to wink out in vanishing into thin air rather than
moving off. After several minutes of gathering themselves, the driver tried to start the car and no surprise, it
worked. The engine purred to life. They drove home. They made a pact not to tell anyone about the UFO or the humanoids.
And they estimated that the encounter lasted about 15 minutes. Now, this encounter occurred about a 20inut drive
from their home. And as the encounter occurred at 11:30 and it took 15 minutes, they should have arrived home
about 5 minutes after midnight. But when they got home, they were shocked to see that it was 2:45 a.m., which meant that
they were missing considerable time, says researcher Philip Embro. This
incident is still under investigation. Those witnesses are absolutely prime
candidates to go under hypnosis to see if what happened during this missing time. Because when you have four
witnesses, they could corroborate each other's stories. And it would be very interesting to know what was uncovered
through the use of hypnotic regression. I do support the use of hypnosis, but
only as a last resort. I'd always first advise people if you have missing time
to write down everything you remember. go back to that and fill in all the details you can. Try doing meditation.
Try working with your dreams to recall because both of those are very effective methods to recall missing time. But
hypnosis works done correctly. It's been absolutely proven to be accurate, but
only if done correctly. Because done incorrectly, it's been proven to show false memories as well. This is why it's
so controversial. And these missing time cases are so numerous. Here's another. I call this
one, it sends chills down my spine. This one to me is really interesting. It is a
single witness case. This occurred on October 22nd, 1988 in a rural area, Joe
Davies County, Illinois. But this one is so interesting because this witness, I
mean, he describes in vivid detail seeing ETS a landed UFO and having a
very clear-cut case of missing time. The witness in this case is a 14 or
15year-old boy by the name of Oscar. That's a pseudonym. He and his father
had driven his 1973 Chevy pickup from their home in Scholesburg, Wisconsin,
and traveled a few miles south across the Illinois border to go deer hunting in the wilds of Joe Davies County,
Illinois. So, the teenager Oscar climbed up into a treeand and waited while his
father hunted in another treeand about a mile away. It was well after dark at
this point when a deer wandered close enough for Oscar to get a shot at it and he hit the deer, but it quickly bounded
off into the trees. His father came back shortly later. Oscar told him about the
deer. So together they followed the blood trail to locate this deer. Now his
father was paying very close attention to the ground and tracking the deer. And this is when Oscar observed a violet
light hovering over the tree line and traveling from left to right. He tried
to tell his father, who told him, "Quit messing around." Now, Oscar shone his flashlight at this glowing light, and it
darted off very fast into the trees. So, they tried tracking this deer for a
while longer, but lost sight of the trail. His father told Oscar it was probably a brisket shot, meaning low in
the chest, that they would resume tracking in the morning. So, they hiked back to the truck and went to sleep in
the back. It was at some point late in the night or very early in the morning that things began to get very strange.
And I'll just quote Oscar directly as he says, "I remember having a frightening
feeling that someone was watching me to the point I didn't want to open my eyes.
I did, and through the side window, I saw what I think was the big-eyed, big-headed gray looking at me. I closed
my eyes, and I heard what was like a mechanical voice telling me, "We are not going to hurt you." Then something made
me open the back window of the truck cab and get out. And when I did, I observed
three short aliens and two taller, big-headed, and big-eyed aliens. and a
discshaped craft landed in the field about 200 ft away. I remember the little
ones touching my fingers and leading me towards the craft and saying, "Do not be scared." in a mechanical voice that
seemed to be in my head. That is all I remember. I woke up in the back of the
truck thinking, "Boy, was that a vivid scary dream." But the more he thought about it and started seeing images of
Grays on TV, Oscar came to realize that it probably wasn't a dream at all, but more likely, as he says, quote, "an
abduction. It took him 27 years to file a report, and it affected him for the
rest of his life." As he says, "It has bothered me since it happened. To this
day, when I see an image on TV of a big-headed, big gray alien, it sends
chills down my spine. That is such an amazing case and really quite typical.
He clearly encountered Grays and I think it's a pretty good bet that he was taken
on board given that he recalls being actually led to this craft. Would love
to talk to him. I suspect there probably were some dreams about what happened on
that night. I suspect there's probably some other events cuz rarely is this a
one-off. But a very typical case of missing time. And there's so many of
these kinds of cases. Here's another one. This one is probably the most profound for me in this collection. This
one really touched me in a way that just made me feel for this the witnesses in
this case, a father and son. What a very close encounter. I call this one It's
time to tell the truth. This occurred on July 25, 1989, possibly early August.
They're a little confused about the date. It occurred in Katusa, Oklahoma
while they were driving at night. That's an interesting detail because so many of these missing time cases occur at night.
But this is a really important case. There's some physiological evidence. There are two witnesses. They describe
this in absolute vivid detail. They're very emotional about it, very clear in
their descriptions, and it's just an amazingly profound case. The two
witnesses in this case are a father and his 12-year-old son named Michael,
again, from Katusa, Oklahoma. And it was on or around July 25, 1989, that they
had gone to visit some extended family members, their cousins. It was around 7:30 p.m. They were returning home,
driving south on Katonville Road. You can see it here. The father who was
driving pulled off to the side to stop and light a cigarette. And this is when they noticed a small oddlooking cloud
hanging low in the sky ahead of him. It was weird because it was the only cloud in the sky. And they immediately noticed
some quote strange looking lights. Again, low in the sky, not far away.
They immediately saw two orbs, one blue and one red, skipping in and out of this
cloud, appearing and disappearing from view. But then events quickly escalated
to very high strangess. As the father says, we watched in shock and disbelief
as a discshaped craft emerged from the small cloud and silently and swiftly
descended to less than 50 yards from our car. It continued to slowly move to
about 30 yards from us. They were close enough for me to see them, the aliens,
looking at us through windows. They seemed to be somewhat small from that distance. We could see a ring of windows
around the craft. They were close enough to see and count the beings inside. Four
of them were small, childlike in size. One was taller and one was the tallest.
Sudden fear overcame me and I remember attempting to drive off as fast as I could. We were scared and started to
leave real fast when a strange bluish light hit us. Now, his son Michael saw
all of this as well and as he says, "I was very frightened, but I could not look away. We never lost sight of the
craft." After a few minutes, the craft approached our car. It was massive, roughly the size of a large house, maybe
bigger. It was a silver egg-shaped craft with windows. We could see entities
inside of it staring back at us. Two different kinds of entities were on board. Some were very tall, some were
very short. Then a beam of light came out of the craft and focused on our vehicle and filled the inside of the car
with light. When the light hit us, we were paralyzed and unable to move. And
then there were four to five beings standing around our car, two on each side of the car at the doors. So he
seems to remember a little bit more than his father does. But as his father says,
the next thing we remember is we are still in the car. The cigarette has burned up. The car is not running now,
and we are sitting slumped over in the seats. I looked up and watched the craft
leave the area. It seemed to float, unaffected by Earth's gravity. When it
left, it moved off slowly at first, then accelerated so fast that it seemed to vanish. I started the car and we drove
home as fast as we could. We both felt like we had been asleep or drugged or hypnotized.
And his son Michael verifies this as Michael says, "Next thing I know, we are
back in the car. The ship is still in front of us. A white misty fog is being produced by the ship and it then
disappeared into thin air. It simply vanished before my eyes. Please take this seriously. So it was now dark
outside and upon arriving home they estimated that they were missing 30 to 45 minutes of time. They called their
cousins who they had just visited and they confirmed the time. Was three days
after this encounter that the father found a triangular-shaped semi-transparent object in his finger.
He dug it out and removed it and said it looked kind of like silicon, but it was harder than a rock and smaller than a
BB. That really concerned them. This whole encounter was a huge wakeup call for them both. As the father says, this
is very real. It is the factual truth. It happened to us. We are still very
concerned about what they did to us and why they did it. We can only speculate what the implants are for and what
effect it will have in the future. I went from skeptical to an absolute
believer in the first 5 to 10 seconds of the close-up visual of the craft with
the little beings peering at us. You would too. It was a disc with a ring of
windows around the center and aliens looking at us as we looked back at them.
We didn't talk about it outside of each other for fear that people would not be able to believe the truth. I'm still
very concerned about my son. I wish I knew what their agenda was. We were in the wrong place at the wrong time. That
was something you never forget. I am getting older now and I think it's time to tell the truth. God be with us all.
So, the father first reported his case in 2008. But four years later, both he
and his son Michael filed a second report with more details. Michael filed a third report in 2015,
and he described the egg again is egg-shaped or saucer-shaped, emitting orbs in a beam of light. And like his
dad, it was obvious to him that this was not a conventional craft. Both now
believe that they were probably taken on board and implanted because Michael also found an implant on his arm near the
elbow. And as Michael says, this is not a hoax or an attempt to get 15 minutes
of fame. These were very real occurrences. I am plagued every day
about what happened to me and my father. I don't know that anyone can fully understand what it's like to have a
missing time encounter unless they've actually gone through it themselves. It's very disorienting. It can be very
confusing and frightening and raises all kinds of questions. And as you can see,
it affects a person profoundly. So I my heart goes out to these
witnesses. Uh this is one of the reasons I do this research because so many people have this kind of experience.
Yeah, I've had one myself, a missing time encounter. So I absolutely know what it's like. Let's move to the next
case, which I call a presence in my room. This occurred on August 17, 1994
in Alabama. This is an amazing case because you might not think of it, but
the most common place that people see an ET, a humanoid, is not outside, not
driving late at night, not in some rural area, but in their own bedroom, in their own home. And this is a very difficult
aspect of this because we look at I think our home and particularly our bedroom as our sacred space you know a
place that we won't be bothered. Uh and yet this is where ETSs often come to
initiate contact. That's absolutely what happened in this case. Main witness in this case is Elaine. That's a pseudonym.
And as she says, "I have been very apprehensive to tell my story, as I'm
sure most are. I've only told two people about this. I would like to know what happened to me that night." I think it
was around 11 p.m. on August 17, 1994. Elaine had gone to bed. Her husband was
at work, and her two children, aged 10 and 12, were asleep in the other room.
And I'll just let Elaine describe in her own words what happened. and she says, "I woke up abruptly to a brilliant light
coming through my bedroom window over my bed. I looked at my alarm clock. It was 2:20 a.m. I immediately became aware of
a presence in my room. I was disoriented and I thought it was a break-in. I
remember being horrified from my children and attempting to reach for my pistol that I kept in my bedside table.
I suddenly became paralyzed and unable to move anything but my eyes. I was
slowly turned from my side onto my back by an unseen force. When I was turned
over, I saw four beings, two at the end of my bed at each corner and two on each
side of me close to my head. I wasn't able to see the ones standing at my head as well. They were in my periphery, but
I had a clear view of the two at the end of the bed. They were grays wearing black hooded robes. They were short,
maybe 4 feet. I could see their faces and their hands. They were the typical grays reported by so many people. They
did not speak or attempt to communicate with me, I slowly began to levitate off the bed, still paralyzed. They never
touched me. But as soon as I was levitated about a foot off the bed, I
was slowly floated out of the bedroom and down the hall with two on each side.
They were small enough that they were able to stay at my side as I floated prone down the hall. While Elaine was
afraid, her main concern was for her children asleep in the other room. She
now noticed a fifth gray which was walking along with her near her head. And as Elaine says, as we turned the
corner at the end of the hallway, I saw that my front door was opened and the same brilliant light was shining through
the door. It was so bright it was blinding. At that moment, I was partially able to break my paralysis and
attempted to grab the corner of the wall as we went past it. That is the very
last thing I remember. Elaine's next memory is waking up in bed. She sat up
and stared at her alarm clock. It was now 500 a.m. She was missing approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes of
time. She remembered the previous night's events with perfect clarity up to the moment she was rendered
unconscious, which she suspects was done by the ETs to subdue her. She has no
memory of being on board a craft or anything else that may have happened to her on that night. And like many
witnesses, it took her a long time to report it, 28 years, in fact. Mainly because she had no idea who to contact.
But she is very curious to know if regressive hypnosis might bring back more memories of what happened to her on
that fateful evening. That is a somewhat harrowing case. I mean, can you imagine
waking up to see ETSs in your room and then you're being floated out of bed and out the front door and there's this very
bright light and you break free of the paralysis and grab onto the wall. I mean, it's crazy. Yet, there are so many
cases like this. This is the kind of thing that make people really question
what's going on with them. I'm sure that this witness probably has had other
encounters because, as I said earlier, it's rarely a one-off. Contact often
starts at very early childhood. So I have a whole checklist of questions I ask people when they report this kind of
experience because I do think again that they are being taken on board and this is
something that usually happens throughout a person's life. So many questions. So let's move to the next
case. This is another important case because it is a multiple witness case and it's s this missing time aspect in
this case is particularly interesting. I call this one it got frightening. This
occurred on October 5, 1995 at a campground, a very rural campground
called Red Canyon, New Mexico. This case has some very, very unusual elements to
it. Red Canyon Campgrounds is a beautiful and remote campground in the Manzano Mountains south of Albuquerque,
New Mexico. It is heavily forested, rich with wildlife. You can see it here. And
on October 5, 1995, a couple, Mark and Natalie, those are
pseudonyms, and their four-year-old son were enjoying the solitude and nature,
sitting by the campfire and watching an elk as it wandered through their campsite. But as it got late, they
climbed into the bed in their camper shell and went to bed. Their son slept between them. It was about 100 a.m. that
Natalie woke up to see a bright light shining through the trees some distance away. She looked out the window and saw
quote three silhouettes. And when these three figures moved closer, she became
concerned and woke up her husband. He took a brief glimpse out the window, but just kind of dismissed this as nothing
unusual. But Natalie disagreed and pointed out the bright lights and insisted he take a closer look. So he
did. And as Natalie says, as we stared, they kept getting closer. And this is
where it got frightening. At one point, we could see them outlined very clearly.
I shined a flashlight out at them to get a better look. They stopped advancing towards us. There were three of them.
Their heads were not shaped like human heads. The arms were very long. The
hands hung down by their knees and had three fingers each. Their faces were
indistinguishable. The striking features were the head shape, the long thin arms and three
fingers. The beings, she said, seemed to be holding a light of some kind, like a
flashlight. And this light now began to swing back and forth, and at the same time, the figures continued their
approach. The light became more brilliant and started to blink orange and white over and over. And as Natalie
says, then they were very close. The light was super bright. I remember being
so frightened. And suddenly I got very sleepy. I remember thinking, "I'm so
terrified, but at least I'm falling asleep and won't have to feel it anymore." It was blissful, like when you
are about to go into surgery and the anesthesia hits suddenly. The next thing
I remember was waking up in our truck camper at 11:00 a.m. Now, at this point, neither Natalie nor her husband, Mark,
had any memory whatsoever of the previous night's events. It was wiped
completely from their minds, but still, the weird events weren't quite over yet.
They got up and were cleaning up their campsite, packing up, and preparing to leave when two strange men rode up on
horseback. This was weird, as Natalie says. I noticed right away they looked
out of place. Having grown up in the rodeo, helping my dad break wild horses
and riding them for years, I knew the gear, the clothing, the mannerisms of
riders. These two guys were wearing what looked like brand new felt vests. The
hor's gear looked new, and the men sat very straight up in the saddles. They looked like actors portraying guys on
horseback. I smiled and in a typical friendly Texas way said, "Hi." They
looked at me sternly and one of them said, "Not many people come up here in this remote area. How was your evening?"
My husband answered, "It was fine. The sky is beautiful at night. We're just packing to get out of here." They never
smiled, acted very official, and just said, "Good." I thought the exchange was
very weird. So later that day, they drove into the town of Mountain Air, just a few miles to the southeast.
Weirdly, their truck promptly died, and they ended up staying in a motel in town for 3 days until their truck was fixed.
And it wasn't until 10 years later that Natalie was sitting at her computer in
her home in Texas when the memory of the strange incident at Red Canyon Campgrounds suddenly came back to her
spontaneously. And as Natalie says, we literally had no recollection all those
years of what we had seen. I thought that's weird. We never talked about
seeing them or even remembered seeing them. My husband preferred to forget the whole incident, but once it came back
into my memory, I could not. Natalie did try to share the story with others, but everyone seemed skeptical or
disinterested. She said a few years after the incident, her son did complain of someone outside
looking into his bedroom window. And a few times when he woke up, he would find that his body had been turned around.
His feet were on his pillow and his head was at the foot of his bed. Also following the incident, her husband had
a few strange nightmares and would thrash around in his sleep, screaming in terror, "Help! Somebody help me!" It was
only after reading about aliens and grays that Natalie was shocked to see that the drawings matched very closely
the figures that they had seen on that night. And as Natalie says, I just
wonder in the back of my mind if we didn't encounter real alien beings out
there. Another very clear-cut case of missing time. And what's amazing to me
about this particular case is not only did they have missing time, they completely forgot the entire encounter
for years. This does happen. Some people will just not recall anything whatsoever
until there's some sort of trigger. Suddenly they just remember. That's clearly what happened in this case.
Another very interesting aspect is these two cowboys that rode up following the
encounter, started acting peculiar. They looked peculiar. They were giving them
peculiar questions. So that makes me wonder about that. Could that have been a maybe not a
screen memory, but I don't know, ETS in disguise, that sort of thing does turn
up in a number of these cases. It's a very high strangeness detail that really raises more questions than it answers.
I don't know. It's why these why research is so important. Let's move on
to the next case. This is the last one in this collection. I call this one I
floated up out of bed. This is very much like an earlier case in this compilation
where a gentleman woke up to find ETS, apparent ETS in his bedroom. These are
not your typical grays. This is a type of being that I've heard reported many
times. I have a few cases myself and the way he describes them and the image he provides is absolutely matching up with
the other cases I've investigated and know about. This one occurred on October 1st, 2017 in Vienna, Virginia. And it's
another fascinating case. The witness in this case is Chuck. That's not his real name, but he's pretty sure that on the
evening of October 1st, 2017, he was taken on board a craft by aliens. But
his encounter is shrouded in the phenomenon we call missing time. On that
evening, he was asleep in bed with his wife in their home in Vienna, Virginia.
Now, Chuck suffers from sleep apneoa. He has to sleep partially sitting up. He
has to wear a CPEP machine complete with face mask and air hose. And it was
sometime in the middle of the night that he woke up. Due to his inclined position, he was able to see the bedroom
door very clearly and saw that a bright light under the door was coming into his
room. obviously originating from the hallway. But as Chuck says, the door
opened and in walked several squat figures. I am not sure of the exact
number. They were silhouetted by a bright light in the hall. They were dark
blue gray with large blocky heads and virtually no neck. Their faces were
heavily furrowed. They stood 3 to four feet tall and wore something that looked like a monk robe that was very dark
gray. When they entered the room, I became paralyzed. They stood around the
bed, even on the other side where my wife was asleep. I tried to call out to her, but I could not make a sound due to
the paralysis. Now unable to move, Chuck could only lay there as one of the figures moved closer and removed the
CPAP mask from his face while another pulled the covers off his bed. As Chuck
says, they raised their arms and I floated up out of the bed, lying flat now. I floated above their heads towards
the door. As I began to float out the doorway, I lost consciousness. Now,
presumably Chuck was taken somewhere, perhaps on board, though he does have no
actual memory of this. He didn't see a UFO, but as Chuck says, the next thing I
remember is floating above their heads back into the room towards the bed. I
was angry, very angry, and with great effort, I began to thrash about a little. For some reason, they had
difficulty controlling me through my anger. One of the figures on the far side of the bed next to my wife knocked
something over on the dresser, but immediately writed it and put it back where it belonged. They regained control
of me. They successfully floated me back into my bed and pulled the covers back
over me. They then retreated from the room. After they closed the door, the
light went out and all was quiet. I regained my senses and found myself lying in my bed without my CPAP. mask
on. I looked at the clock and it was 5:53 a.m. I got up out of bed feeling
both frightened and angry at the same time. Now, after his wife woke up, he
asked her if she had experienced anything unusual in the night, and she said yes, that she had actually gotten
up three times to go to the bathroom. Usually, she only gets up once, so that was slightly abnormal. Chuck immediately
began doing research, looking for any other images of the humanoids that he
had seen, and it took him quite a long time, but he did finally find a case in
upstate New York that matched what he saw. One week after his encounter, he
did report it to MUON, the Mutual UFO Network, writing that he believed he had
experienced, quote, an alien abduction. So, these beings sound very much like
the beings Whitley Strieber describes, these little blue skinned troll-like beings. My own sister-in-law had an
encounter with these beings. She drew an illustration of them. Uh, one gentleman
I interviewed saw that illustration and nearly got knocked out of his chair. That was exactly what he saw. And the
drawing that the witness provides in this case looks very very much like my
sister-in-law's drawing. And she's an artist, so she was able to get the details correctly. And I've shown this
to other contacties and they're like, "Yep, that's what they looked like." So that's interesting. Also interesting is
how this gentleman was wearing a CPAP machine and the ETSs removed it. Uh like the other case, he's
floated up out of bed, carried through the hallway, and he remembers actually being returned as well. So yeah, it's a
pretty sure bet that he was taken on board, probably physically examined,
talked to the ETSs. Very hard to say what happened to him cuz he doesn't
recall, but we can say from other cases, we can predict to a large degree what
happens to a person when they're taken on board. But an absolutely fascinate fascinating case. So that's it. 12 cases
coming from all over the world. This has been going on for a very long time.
Missing time is a again big part of the UFO experience
and we need to figure out exactly what's going on here. Why is this happening?
Who is responsible? This is why I'm putting these cases out there so we can
all take a closer look and try to answer these questions for ourselves.
So that's it for today. I hope you found this episode interesting and I thank you
very much for watching it. It's because of you guys I'm doing this research. So I truly appreciate all the support you
give me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for
the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun and I'll see you next Friday for another episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. Bye for now.
