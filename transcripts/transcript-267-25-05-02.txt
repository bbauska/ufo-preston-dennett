NOT HUMAN: TWELVE VERY WEIRD HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
May 2, 2025

Summary:
May 2, 2025
One of the interesting things about encounters with strange beings is that they are humanoid in form, bipedal beings that look much like us, but are clearly not human. The humanoid form seems to be the universal template. This is what the first-hand accounts are showing us. There are thousands of cases, going back more than 100 years, coming from all over the world. Midget-like ETs, tall beings, grays, robotic creatures, mantids, human-looking and more. This video presents 12 cases, each showing the variety and the unique high-strangeness aspects of face-to-face encounters with humanoids.

WE COME FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET. One evening in the summer of 1957, a woman awoke in the bedroom of her home in Jutland, Denmark to see three 2-foot-tall humanoids come through the closed window. Each looked identical, with beautiful human-looking faces and kind eyes. They said they came from a different planet and promptly left.

ETS LAND AT FARMHOUSE. One day in October 1957, a farmer and his workers saw a flying saucer land on his farm in Campinas, Brazil. Three human-looking figures exited and went to collect water from the river. They returned to their craft, which took off. Many odd effects were found, landing traces, EM disturbances, metal fragments, and more witnesses.

EXTRATERRESTRIAL TOURISTS? One night in October 1959, Mrs. Moulet and her three children stepped out of their home in Aubagne, France to hang the laundry. Suddenly an egg-shaped craft hovered overhead. Through a big porthole, they saw 20 blond men in white shirts looking down smiling at them. Soon, the craft zoomed off.

THE LITTLE GREEN MAN OF LUUMAKI. On August 19, 1965 and the Kuningas family went berry-picking in the fields out of Hermunen in Luumaki, Finland. A 3-foot-tall humanoid appeared. It had red skin, a human-looking face, and wore a tight green jumpsuit. The father and son were unable to move as the being approached, then ran off into the woods.

IF I HADN’T SEEN IT MYSELF, I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONVINCED. One night in February 1968, a couple looked out of their home in Greensburg, Pennsylvania to see a saucer-shaped craft over their backyard pond. To their shock, they saw a humanoid figure standing on a railing outside the craft looking down at them. They called their relatives who drove over and saw the craft.

SIX ALIENS ON BEENLEIGH ROAD. At 2am on July 19, 1972, a man drove to work along the Beenleigh Road, in Kuraby, Queensland, Australia. Suddenly he saw six humanoid figures in cream-colored jumpsuits and diamond-like faceplates standing next to the road. Nearby, a large craft hovered. He drove off in fear and vowed to never drive that road again.

THE MAN WAVED BACK. Driving along a remote road in Covington, Michigan, one night in September 1973, a man was shocked to see a UFO hover over the car ahead of him. The car stopped, and the lady knelt down to pray. The man saw a blond man looking at him through a porthole. He waved, and the man waved back, and the craft zipped away.

A PRESSURE INSIDE HIS HEAD. At 10pm on January 6, 1978, two men were walked along a street in Santo Antonio da Caparico, Portugal when a light zoomed overheard. They ran to get a closer look and saw by a 7-foot-tall being in a glowing white jumpsuit. They fled in panic. Later, landing traces were found and one of the men suffered weird effects.

THE CREATURES IN THE WOODS. On April 27, 1986, a karate teacher and his student went jogging in the woods by Gravina di Puglia, Italy. Seeing two 7-foot-tall figures in white uniforms, they ran and called the police. They soon learned that three hunters also saw the beings. The police found odd marks on the ground where the beings had stood.

“WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO HURT ME?” For days, “Lee” of Gary, Indiana had a feeling of being watched. Then on the night of June 15, 1986, he awoke to see a gray alien standing next to his bed. Afraid, he threw a pillow at it. The gray looked at him and asked, “Why are you trying to hurt me?” Lee felt great love coming from the being, who promptly vanished.

IT’S NOT HUMAN. One night in October 2010, two men were walking along the foothills of the mountains in Tandil, Argentina when they saw a strange light. Getting closer, they saw it was a glowing humanoid, wearing a clear helmet. When it started to levitate, they turned and ran. To their shock, it began to follow them.

THE ALIEN AND THE SQUIRRELS. One morning in December 2012, a couple looked outside their home in Villaviciosa de Odon, Spain and were shocked to see 200 squirrels on their porch. Then they saw a 9-foot-tall humanoid in a red jumpsuit floating in their backyard. After 15 minutes, it departed, and the squirrels dispersed.

Twelve cases, each showing the familiar humanoid form, yet each with  unique details. These cases make it clear that something profound is happening here, and that we still have much to understand about these visitors to our planet.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
I'm going to be talking about one of my very favorite topics, which is of course humanoids. I call this episode not
human. 12 very weird humanoid encounters. These are beings that look
very much like us, but are clearly not human. In these cases, coming from all
over the world over a long period of time, often and usually have details
that are practically identical, which I think argues strongly for their veracity. These are people who don't
know each other and yet they're reporting the same things. But many of
these cases, most I should say, have unique elements, elements of high stranges which have a lot to teach us
because there are things we don't fully understand. I've got 12 cases for you today coming from all over the world,
stretching over a long period of time from 1957 to 2012.
And these cases I have for you today, these 12 cases come from Denmark,
Finland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain,
Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and three cases from the United States, including
Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. It's really interesting
because these do involve a wide variety of humanoids of all types. short little
guys, real tall beings, robotic beings, grays, of course, so many different
kinds. And of course, supported by various forms of evidence, and multiple
eyewitnesses. We've got landing traces, animal reactions, physiological effects,
electromagnetic effects, and more. There are so many cases that cannot be ignored
or explained away. I think it behooves us all to take these accounts seriously
because there are so many of them and so many people report these coming from,
you know, all walks of life. So, let's just get started with these 12 very
weird cases of humanoid encounters. And the first case I'd like to talk about today, I call we come from a different
planet. This is a direct quote from the humanoids involved in this case which
occurred in the summer of 1957 in North Jutland, Denmark. This one is a single
witness case, but it's really quite poignant and has some very interesting
details to it. This case comes from the Danish magazine UFO Neat and involves a
single witness, an anonymous woman. It was around 1000 p.m. one evening in 1957
or perhaps 1958 as she lay in bed in her home in
North Jutland, Denmark. Her husband was away on a business trip at this time and
her children were asleep in another room. Now, her window blinds were closed in her bedroom, but there was enough dim
light to make the room clearly visible. She and her husband did sleep in
separate beds. His bed, of course, was empty. Her eyes had been closed, but for some reason, as she lay in bed, she
suddenly opened them and got an incredible shock. Three small beings
were standing beside her bed. It looked to her as though they had come through the window with the blinds, and each
being was standing one behind the other in single file. All three of the beings
looked completely identical, and each of them was just under 2 feet in height.
This is about 50 cm. And they had petite, slender bodies. She said they
were wearing dark blue shiny tight-fitting suits which seemed to glow slightly. Said they also wore helmets of
the same material which extended down around over their ears, really leaving
only their faces visible. She could not see any hair. She did notice that their
hands and faces were very refined, very delicate and beautiful. No blemishes. In
fact, she described them as being more beautiful than humans. She did see that they had dark eyebrows. And although the
expressions on their faces were very serious, she said that the humanoids eyes radiated quote a fantastic
kindness, openness, and honesty. And because of this, she felt no fear. Now,
still walking in single file and moving very lightly on the carpet, the beings
went to the closet, then turned around and walked back again to the side of her
bed. And it was at this point that she asked them where they came from. And
speaking audibly in chorus, they answered, "We come from a different
planet." She could hear that each one of them had a different voice and she saw
their lips moving. So, this was audible. They then continued walking up to the window and walked right through it
disappearing. And that was it. Really an amazing encounter, but this was a one-off. She reports no other UFO ET
encounters, but does say that as a child she had a really interesting
supernatural experience involving an apparition of a large fat man with curly
hair wearing a gray monk's cloak with a red stripe down the middle. It looked to
her to be from the 18th century. And although he looked directly at her and was smiling, for some reason she felt
like she did not like this man, he was there only for a few moments and then promptly disappeared, leaving behind
this kind of column of mist or smoke. Truly amazing case. I find it quite
poignant to me. The most interesting aspect of that case is her description
of these little guys who looked largely human but were very short, clearly not
human, had beautiful faces, she said. I also was struck by her description of
how they had very kind eyes. I also liked that case because she was able to engage in a short conversation with
these alleged ETs and they said that they were in fact people from another planet. This is the most common theory
among both researchers and those who have this kind of experience. So that
alone I think makes this case an important one and it's certainly a valuable addition to our huge growing
database of humanoid encounters. So many. Here's another one which I found
particularly fascinating and became quite well known in its country. I call
this one ET's land at farmhouse. This took place in October of 1957 in
Campenis, Brazil. And this case is truly remarkable because it has all different
types of evidence. It's got physiological effects on the witnesses,
landing traces, what appear to be metal fragments, animal reactions, and other
really weird effects. Some of these details I have never heard before. It's
a truly remarkable account of a UFO landing at a farmhouse, ETSs coming out,
collecting samples, and as you'll see, some truly amazing details and lots of
witnesses, too. This case was investigated by renowned researcher Dr.
Walter Beller and appeared in the number 14 issue of the
SBEV bulletin. This is published in Brazil, but it was also published in
several other magazines and newspapers. It was about 300 p.m. one
afternoon in October of 1957 that a farmer by the name of Helio
Pentiado. He lived on the outskirts of Campinis in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was
with his foreman, a Mr. Sabia Zika and another worker. They were on the
property trying to fix a wire fence which had been damaged by his neighbor's
ax. And suddenly three strange things happened at once. First, they heard a
sharp kind of irritating buzzing noise. Second, Zika's dog, Abilu, began to
growl, looking towards a nearby grove of eucalyptus trees. And at the same time,
the other farm worker, who was just a short distance away, suddenly threw himself to the ground, screaming. So
they rushed up to help him, and he pointed towards this grove of trees.
Looking there, the men could now see a large saucer-shaped object. It had an
upper and lower dome. It appeared to be hovering about six feet above the ground and about 150 to 300 ft away. Now in
perfect silence, this buzzing noise had ended and it was sitting in their field of mint. So they briefly considered the
possibility that they were looking at a large balloon, but pretty quickly dismissed this explanation because after
watching it for a short time, they saw an opening appear in the upper dome and
three humanoid figures exited. They were each about 5 and 1/2 ft tall. each wore
greenish, shimmering, tight-fitting jumpsuits from head to toe. They wore
thick gloves and silvery boots. At this point, they couldn't see their faces real well, but they did see that one of
them was holding a strange device in its hand. And these three figures proceeded
to glide smoothly. Kind of like an ice skater is how they described it, seeming to check around the craft and then
looked around the environment. They moved over to a cow nearby that was
feeding on the vegetation, and the one with the device in his hand appeared to call the attention of the other two to
something about this cow. They then returned to the craft, opened a door on
the underside of the dome, and retrieved this bulllike container, which according
to the witnesses was about 1 and 1/2 ft wide. Two of these figures then left the
craft, perhaps three. Some of the reports contradict this. At any rate, one was carrying it and the other was
holding a rod-like device and together they glided away from this craft off
towards the nearby river which is called the Tit River. Now at this point Helio
ordered one of his farm workers to go immediately to town and find a photographer. Now this man left but he
refused to come back as he was too afraid. So Helio at this point was carrying a rifle and considered shooting
at one of these figures but ultimately decided against it and they watched as these figures passed over a fence and
moved out of view. Now during this time both Helio and
Zabia experienced this weird unusual pain in their eyes. This was strange
because they were both wearing sunglasses. But something about the presence of these figures in this UFO
was hurting their eyes. So at this point, Helio and Sabia, seeing that this
craft had now been apparently left unattended, decided to approach it and
they walked right up to it. They walked around it to see if they could find any opening or a way of looking inside. They
could now see that it was not actually hovering, but resting on three legs, each of which ended in sort of a
spherical shape. And while they saw what looked like port holes, they were obscured by what appeared to them to be
a very fine mesh. These this craft did appear to me metallic, and it was
gleaming in the sunshine. So, Helio retrieved a rock or a stick, something from the ground, and banged it against
the craft. This caused a metallic hollow ringing sound. They could see that this
craft had three main parts. A middle disc, a small disc on top attached to a dome, and a smaller disc on the bottom
which was also attached to this dome-like structure. So at this point, Helio took his knife and tried to pry
open this machine and found that the material did not react like metal, but seemed to him almost like plastic or
synthetic resin. So, they were still inspecting this craft when the three or
two humanoids returned. Uh, they were carrying this bull-shaped container, which seemed to Helio to be heavier than
it initially was, leading him to believe that the humanoids had taken samples of some kind, perhaps water from the river,
and put it in this container. And one again still holding this device in his hand, kind of like a pipe. And as they
passed a jackaranda tree, this figure pointed this device at the tree,
releasing what looked like a jet of fire, creating a deep crack in the trunk of the tree and an apparent round hole
on the roots of a nearby eucalyptus. Now, according to a few reports, in this case, the tree actually burst into
flames, but as near as I can tell, that's an exaggeration in the reporting, and that really it just caused a crack
in the trunk. At any rate, these figures were now about 150 ft away, and they
could see their faces, which they said had a normal human appearance.
So at this point, the men stepped back, the witnesses, and the figures returned to the craft, went inside. This craft
made a loud buzzing noise, rose upward a short distance. The landing gear retracted into the craft, and it moved
off slowly at first, but gradually increased in speed, and suddenly darted away towards nearby
Companas. Now, the men returned to their car, an old Ford, and it would not
start. They connected this to the encounter and looking under the hood, they saw that in fact the battery cables
were fused together. Of course, they had not been fused before. So, this forced
Sabia to use a horse and buggy. And he went to the barn and he could hardly
believe his eyes. He says that all the metal tools in the barn had been pulled
together into a cone shaped stack as if drawn mysteriously together by a
powerful magnet. So that's weird. But if that's not weird enough, the birds in
the barn, which had been in cages, were now all dead and showed no visible signs
of trauma. They also had a pet monkey in a cage which was showing signs of being
quite severely agitated. So they reported this account to the police and
to the Campanas Agronomic Institute. They provided plaster casts of the
beings footprints left at the site per the request of the institute. Now Helio
later was invited back to the institute to view these plaster casts and was shown that they were emitting this weird
unexplained phosphoresence. And he learned also that several people
throughout the city had apparently seen this same discshaped craft on that
afternoon. Apparently, after it took off from the farm, it moved over the city at a very, very low elevation and in fact
moving right over the hospital on the Avanita Julio Mosquita Street, which you
can see here, sometimes releasing this quote liquid metal onto the street. In
fact, at one point it flew so low, witnesses said it struck a truck that was parked on a street corner. Now,
samples of this metallic liquid were collected by the Brazilian Air Force,
who reportedly under the command of Brigadier General Jeffrey Vidal
conducted an investigation into these events and did an analysis of the metal,
which allegedly showed that it had large magnesium content. A final detail of
this case is that Helio says that for six months following this encounter, he
suffered from severe weakness in his legs which forced him to actually use a
cane. That's the kind of case that is absolutely undeniable. I mean, it starts
with three adult witnesses, the dogs barking, there's landing traces, there's
metal fragments, there's people all over the city seeing UFOs. It's just amazing
how much evidence there is in just this one case and there's so so many more
very much like it. ETSs do seem to have a pension for landing at farms. I find
that very interesting. But yeah, overall a truly fascinating case.
And here's another one which I found particularly interesting because this is a theory as to why ETSs are visiting our
planet. I call this one extraterrestrial tourists. This one occurred in October
1959 in Oana, France. And this is a truly fascinating case. It does have
multiple witnesses, although the main witness is an adult. And she had three
young children who also saw this. It's a truly interesting case because she got a
very good look at this UFO hovering right overhead, seeing humanoids in the
port hole, and stayed there for quite a long time. It's a really interesting
case. This very interesting case was first published in the French magazine Lumiere Don Lanui Lights in the Night by
Msie Cohen. It's a really fascinating case. It occurred around twilight around
sunset one evening in late October 1959. Madmoiselle Mule, age 45, and her
three children. She had a daughter age nine and two twins, both age six. They
were all outside on the balcony hanging out the laundry. And this is when movement in the sky caught Madmoiselle
Mule's attention and looking up she saw this strange craft descending and
approaching coming closer and closer. At this point, she saw only the front of it
facing directly towards her. And she said it moved in a way that reminded her of a boat cutting through the waves.
As it got closer, she could see a large triangular window with a point at the
top reaching down to the midsection with a bright light at the apex. And in just
moments, this object was floating stationary in total silence at a very low elevation almost directly above
Madmoiselle Mule and her three children. They all saw it. The three kids huddled
against their mother. Immediately the temperature dropped sharply. Sharply
enough that Nadmoiselle said it felt as if her hands were frozen. But she could
now see a side view of this craft very clearly. She said this object was
eggshaped with a polished steel-like surface was sitting horizontal in the
sky. She estimates it was about 75 to 90 ft long, 18 to 20 feet high, quite
large. She could see that the window in front swept back in a curve comprising
almost onethird of the object's surface. And again, a very bright light shown
from the top of the window. But most amazing was that looking down at her through this very large window or port
hole, she could see about 20 people. She said these people had very beautiful
faces, a kind of face that she had never seen before. She said they had wavy
blonde hair, a very fair complexion. They looked quite tall. They were all
wearing white jumpsuits with short sleeves and office collars. She thought
at first that this might be a very advanced American or Russian craft, but
ultimately she decided that the people inside were so unusual, she had never seen anybody quite like them, that they
probably were not human. Now, this craft stayed in position for a full 15
minutes, which is a long time. And during this time, the people in the craft looked down at Mad Muzel Mule and
her children and were smiling. And in fact, she had the impression that some of them were actually laughing. Finally,
after about 15 minutes, she felt a slight vibration. In a matter of two or
3 seconds, this object darted off at such high speed that it left a tracer in
the sky. And as soon as it was gone, immediately the temperature returned back to normal. Just amazing. I mean, I
can only imagine what it must be like to have that long of an encounter with a UFO so close to you. These people
looking down at you. Uh yeah, and it by all appearances just seems to look like
these guys were basically just doing a little exploration, having a little tourist day
off and exploring Earth. It's also interesting that this witness was not
immediately jumping to the UFO ET explanation, but finally decided that
yes, these couldn't be humans because of the way they looked, which was just a little bit different from a normal human
being. It's also interesting how she describes the temperature dropping
during this encounter, which is unusual. Most people will describe heat coming
off of this craft. Not quite sure how to explain that, but it's certainly
interesting. Now, let's move to the next case. This one is really amazing. Some
incredibly unusual details. This might not even be extraterrestrial as we would
think of it, perhaps cryptoaterrestrial. At any rate, I call this one the little green man of Lumaki.
This occurred on August 19, 1965 in Lumaki, Finland. It involves two
witnesses and some really interesting effects. I mean, this is a strange
encounter which I think, you know, has a lot to teach us, provides some really
important insights into what it's like to have an experience like this. It was
a beautiful sunny day around noon on August 19, 1965 as Tapani Kuningis, age
20, his father Maddie, and his mother Maria and his older brother Tuvo decided
to go pickleberries. This is a type of blueberry. They were out in the forests and fields outside of the small village
of Hermunan in Lumaki, Finland. This was an area they had been to many times.
They knew it well. And this family of four decided to divide up to hunt for these berries. They were all still
within sight and shouting distance of each other. And the first weird thing
that happened was that the father, Maddie, heard a peculiar murmuring or
bubbling sound coming from a nearby hill. He looked over there, but didn't see anything unusual. But the second
strange thing that happened was that he noticed about 600 feet away from him a
very large mossy stone six feet high and 9 ft wide next to a rowan tree. This was
really odd because although he knew this area very well, he had never noticed this rock before. And it appeared that
this was where this strange murmuring sound had been coming from. Now, the
third odd thing was there was a sudden and unusually powerful gust of wind.
This really surprised Tuville as the day had been clear and calm. Now, it was
around this time that Maddie looked back towards this large mossy stone and got a real shock because he could now see a
small humanoid figure just under three feet tall standing on or next to this
stone. And for the next few minutes, Maddie stared in wonder at this little
man. And this little man stared right back at him. Suddenly, this little man
began to walk towards him. First tottering slightly on his feet and then walking with straight, firm steps and
actually started running towards him. And as it approached, Maddie could now see that this figure appeared to have a
very strong body, broad shoulders, an overly large head, was wearing a
skintight green coverall, and this is strange. It had a sort of carrot red
complexion on his skin. Now, as this figure got even closer, Maddie noticed
something very peculiar. He says he felt almost paralyzed. He felt he was unable to shout out or alert his family to the
presence of this creature. And in fact, his youngest son, Tapani, was only 30
feet away. And yet, Mattie felt utterly unable to draw his son's attention to
the presence of this little man. Now, unknown to Maddie, his eldest son, Tuvo,
had also noticed the appearance of this little figure. He described him in the same way. Three feet tall, reddish skin,
a green suit. But he also noticed another te detail that this man had a
little box on his chest which he said flashed a strange light at them. And at
this point, Tuvo, like his father, also found himself under the power of some unknown force that prevented him from
moving or even looking directly at the strange figure. He said he could also smell a terrible odor. Now, Maddie,
again, the father said he could hear this figure making a weird quote mourning sound. Now, Tuvo also heard
something coming from the man, but to him, it sounded more like it was talking in a strange language. And as this being
drew very close to Maddie, about 45 feet away, Maddie could now see that its face
was largely human. Although again reddish skin, it did appear to be elderly. And Maddie and this little man
stared at each other for about one minute, at which point the little man turned, changed direction, and walked to
the edge of a small bog, which was about 150 ft away, where it suddenly performed
a kind of weird somersault, and disappeared into thin air, or could no longer be seen. It was at this same
instant that Maddie heard another weird noise coming from the area of the strange mossy stone and this row entry,
but again saw nothing unusual. Now back to Tuvo. Tuvo was now
shocked to see that a full half an hour had passed, which was longer than it appeared that this whole incident
lasted. And afterwards, neither Maddie nor Tubo said anything about the
incident. They just finished picking berries as normal. Now, Tuvo says he did
walk over to the area of the mossy stone where this man had stood to try and look for footprints. He didn't see any, but
he did notice a strange silvery gray substance on the surface of this stone
or the tree. And he approached closer and tried to touch it with his berry basket, but strangely immediately felt
that same weird force that had previously held him immobile when this man had appeared. And it was this same
force, he said, seemed to take control of him, forcing him to turn around and actually walk away. He said he wanted to
try and throw a stick at the rock, but was prevented from doing that as well.
Now, when he got into the car, he intended to tell his family all about this, but weirdly did not talk about it.
Neither did Maddie. And in fact, Tuvo reports that he actually completely forgot about what had just happened. It
was erased from his memory. But over the next six months, his memory of the incident gradually returned and finally
having full recall, he told his younger brother, Tapani. And this is when he was
shocked to learn that his father Maddie had also seen this little man. It was this incident that sparked Tapani
Kuningus' curiosity about the subject. and he started researching similar incidents and before long began writing
books about UFOs and the paranormal and actually became one of Finland's leading eupfologists and authors. How unusual is
that? I'm really not sure that that again could be accurately categorized as
an extraterrestrial encounter because it looks like it might be your, you know,
an encounter with elves or little people. I don't know because one of the witnesses did say he saw this being did
have sort of a box on its chest which flashed a light at him which seemed to cause some unusual effects that
certainly matches up with extraterrestrial encounters but again they didn't actually see a craft. One of
the really interesting aspects of this is how it affected the witnesses not talking about it for some time
afterwards actually forgetting about it. not being able to talk about it. That
comes up in quite a few cases. And I'm not exactly sure if this is an effect
being done by the humanoids or by the people who have this experience or
perhaps a combination of both. So yeah, there's still a lot of questions about
that case in terms of how to categorize it, but it truly did affect one of the
family members. He didn't even have an encounter to Pani, but he became a very
prominent researcher in Finland. So, this just goes to show how these
encounters can affect people really profoundly. And that's absolutely true
of this next case, which also has some very poignant and unusual elements to
it. I call this one, if I hadn't seen it myself, I could not have been convinced.
I can only imagine what it must be like for a complete skeptic to have a sudden close-up encounter with a UFO and
humanoids. But that's exactly what happened in this case which occurred in February
1968 in a rural area of Greensburg, Pennsylvania. This is a multiple witness
case, very hard to deny because they saw this thing very close up for about a
half an hour. So there's really no chance of misperception here. When you
have bore witnesses seeing this thing, it's hard to explain away as a hoax or a
hallucination or a misperception or mental illness or any of the go-tos that
our own government perpetrates over people and tries to explain away
encounters. So yeah, this is an amazing case in a number of different ways. This
case comes from prolific researcher Stan Gordon and was published in the 1985
number 210 issue of the Muan UFO Journal. It was about 11 p.m. a snowy
evening in February of 1968 as a married couple, Bob and Sue,
those are pseudonyms. They were preparing to go to bed in their home in Greensburg. This is in rural West
Morland County, Pennsylvania. Bob. He's a former Navy officer, a hanger deck
aircraft director on one of the largest aircraft carriers. He was going to bed
before his wife as he had to get up early for work. And she was in the kitchen cleaning up. Now, pulling back
the drapes to check on the condition of the roads, Bob was amazed to see something he had never seen before. a
massive oval-shaped craft floating just 30 feet above a large fishing pond about
30 feet away from their house. He immediately called out to his wife and alerted her to the object. She looked
out the window and screamed, "Oh my god, what is it?" So they both watched in
absolute astonishment as this object remained over their pond. They estimate
it was about 50 to 60 feet in diameter, a dark battleship gray. It had a dome on
top. It was all the same color. To Bob, it looked like it was quote old or
ancient. He said the bottom section of the craft appeared to be hollow. And as Bob says, and I quote, "It was like
looking into an open shaft. In fact, inside this opening, which was about 20
ft in diameter, they saw lights that were spinning so fast they couldn't tell
which way they were even moving. A bright light was coming out from this opening, and this bright light
illuminated the craft so they could get a very good look at it. Now, most amazing, there was a kind of catwalk or
balcony around the front section of the craft, evenly centered. And standing on
this catwalk was a small figure. It had its hands up to its eyes and was looking
directly down at the witnesses. Now, right behind this figure were some port
holes and also a doorway or opening. And looking through this opening, Bob and
Sue could see colored lights, red, green, blue, orange, and white, which
were flashing at various intervals. They could also see what looked like an instrument panel of some kind. And at
various times, they saw shadows of figures moving by the doorway and
through the port holes, making it clear to them both that there were other people inside this craft. Now, at this
point, Sue became quite frightened, and her husband told her to go call his
brother and wife who lived about 10 minutes away in the same town.
Meanwhile, Bob continued to watch this object, and he saw a second similar
figure come out onto the catwalk, and it appeared to be communicating with the first figure. Bob decided at this point
that he had better get dressed. So, without turning on the lights, he searched for clothes in his dark room,
got dressed, and then went out onto the porch to get a closer look at this object. He saw that this object was now
beginning to move very slowly and was also ascending to a slightly higher
altitude. The two figures that had been out of the craft on the catwalk were now
gone. It was around this time that Bob's brother and wife arrived in the driveway
and all four witnesses piled into the car and began to follow this object which was now moving over a nearby hill
at an altitude of no more than 50 ft. above the ground. Bob's brother was
trying to drive and watch this object at the same time. And he got the car stuck
on the slick road. So, they all got out of the car to look at this object, which now moved and hovered directly above
them. And in fact, the brilliant light coming from the bottom shown down on them, making it very difficult for them
to discern the object itself. But they did notice at this point that the object was still completely silent. Then
without warning, this object suddenly accelerated vertically at very high speed, becoming a star-like light high
in the sky. It then changed to a brilliant red color and darted straight across the sky, disappearing into the
distance. Now, Bob says he found himself somewhat traumatized by this whole incident. It turned out that prior to
the sighting, years before this, he had been a vehement, diehard skeptic. In
fact, years earlier, Bob and his brother, who had just seen the UFO, had earlier had this heated discussion about
UFO reports that were appearing in the evening news. At the time, Bob had
suggested that only crazy people see UFOs. And this discussion ended up in an
argument and became an actual fist fight. So now Bob found himself unable
to reconcile his skepticism with what he, his wife, his brother and sister-in-law had just seen. And as he
says, "If I hadn't seen it for myself, I could not have been convinced. But Bob did bravely begin to
share his encounter with various relatives and friends, and received a lot of the ridicule he had previously
heaped upon others. But still, he will not be swayed. He doesn't worry about this as he is absolutely certain that
they saw a genuine UFO and that UFOs are real. There you go. I'm continually
amazed by how many cases there are like this. And as we know, most do not get
reported. I truly think that there might be a lot more witnesses to each of these
incidents, but they just don't come forward. So kudos to Bob and his wife
for coming forward and speaking about this. And kudos to Bob for not talking to his family and friends and letting
the chips fall where they may. This is very difficult I think for some people
to accept. Uh skeptics in particular have a tendency to not even examine the
evidence. They hold a number of false assumptions about this subject. And I
think it challenges a person's worldview to the point that they don't even want to look at cases like these. So yeah,
this is difficult for some people to accept. And yet case after case after
case, it becomes at some point absolutely undeniable. I mean, I think
we're at that point because it's not just 10 cases or 20 or 100 or even a
thousand. It's thousands upon thousands upon thousands. It just goes on and on.
Here's another one. This is a pretty short case, a bit sparse on details
because the witness was so shocked and somewhat traumatized by
his encounter that he really did not want to talk about it as we'll see. But
I call this one six aliens on Binley Road. This occurred on July 19, 1972 in
Kurabi, Australia. So, this is an interesting case on a number of different levels. This was a
witness who had a real hard time with his encounter. Although he really wasn't
physically affected in any way, the ETSs didn't do anything to him. It was just such an incredible shock to him. So,
yeah, there's a lot of really interesting details in this, I think, very important case. This case was very
nearly not reported. It did first appear in local newspapers, but was later investigated by researchers. The main
witness has requested total anonymity. It was around 2:00 a.m. on July 19th,
1972, and the anonymous gentleman witness was on his way to work. He drove
along Binlay Road at about 45 mph going towards the east and was at
Kurabi in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, where there were some new
high tension electric wires that had just been recently installed. Looking to the left side of
the road, he saw six unusual looking objects. Now, as he got close up to
these objects, he realized that they weren't objects at all, but actually humanoid figures, and each was dressed
in an identical soft cream colored uniform. And at the same moment, he saw
on the right, on the opposite side of the road, a large solid silver metallic object right next to these high tension
power lines. Perhaps close enough, he said, to be almost touching them. He could now hear a strange noise, which he
described as a sort of pedoing. pedoying pedoying and also the craft itself was making a hissing noise. He estimated it
was about 80 feet wide, twice the length of a nearby house. Now looking back at
these figures, he saw that five of the six figures had turned away from the
highway, but one of the figures stepped out directly onto the highway. and
according to some of the reports actually extended out his arm and hand. Though later this witness said that
that's not exactly what happened. It just stepped out onto the highway. But this man could now see that
this figure was wearing this yeah cream color jumpsuit. No helmet, but it was
wearing something over its face that he said was quote sort of a faceted
covering. He compared it to the face of a diamond. coming to a point it obscured
any facial features on this figure. At this point he re realized that these
figures were not human as he said aliens and he realized that this craft
on the other side of the road was probably a UFO. This frightened him badly. He drove quickly away. He could
still hear this poding pedonging noise as he drove by the nearby Kurabi railway
station a few miles down the road. Now later returning home, he told his wife,
and it was his wife who called the Brisbane Flying Saucer Research Bureau to see if anyone else had seen the
object. The witness himself was too frightened to call, did not want to give his name, did not want any ridicule. But
Roy Russell, the president of the Saucer Bureau, revealed that in fact there had been other witnesses. Two ladies driving
along Binlay Road earlier that same week reported that they had actually been chased by a glowing cigar-shaped object.
And also a housewife who lived only 17 miles away in Chermide said that on the
same exact night as the gentleman's encounter, she had seen strange lights in the sky. So there is a level of
confirmation here. Later, APRO's Australian representative, Mr. Lindseay
McKinnon was able to look into the case and he learned that the witness no longer wanted to discuss the sighting
and was absolutely refusing to cooperate with any of the investigators. For the
witness, he said that since he had this encounter, he's actually too frightened to even drive along the Binlay road.
Such a shame that this witness did not want to work more closely with an investigators, but we did get the
details of the case and I certainly cannot blame him. Again, this is an experience that affects people so
profoundly. I mean, it really challenges you on multiple levels emotionally,
mentally, spiritually. It absolutely challenges a person's world view. It can
be very difficult to process and assimilate. And that's clearly what happened in that case. But some people
don't have as hard of a time. I like this next case a lot. It's really profound. has some amusing elements to
it, some levels of mystery that have yet to be understood. I call this the man
waved back. This is a really friendly encounter, I think, at least for the
main witness. This occurred in September 1973 in Covington, Michigan. And this is
another real close-up encounter with a UFO and a humanoid. And the witness was
able to interact with this humanoid in a very interesting way. This case comes
from researcher Ted Bletcher and was taken from the witness's firsthand report submitted to Muon. The witness is
only known by his initials ah. It was around 5:00 p.m. dusk one evening in
midepptember 1973 as this witness was driving his truck from Lance, Michigan and was
passing by the very small town of Covington, Michigan. This town has a population of about 100 people. Now,
just ahead of him on the highway, there was another car driving along when suddenly, without warning, a large
silver gray object about 80 feet in diameter glided across the road and
hovered about 90 ft in the air directly above the car in front of the main witness. He could see multicolored
lights flashing down from the base of the object, and the car in front of him immediately stopped. This forced ah to
slam on his brakes to avoid a collision. And he immediately noticed that his own dash on his truck went out
and his voltmeter read zero, indicating that his car battery had gone dead. Now
he now saw that the woman in the vehicle in front of him exited her car and she knelt down in the grass beside the road
and started praying with her rosary. This concerned him, so he ran up to her
to make sure she was okay. Meanwhile, the object hovered above them for only a few moments longer, making this soft
worring noise, then moved off to the west, hovering about 300 ft away. As it
did so, the bottom lights turned a magenta purple color. Now, the woman
said she was okay. He looked back at this craft. He could now see it had a dome on the top section of the object
which had a sort of red quote stone-like light at the top of this large window or
port hole. And looking through this port hole, he saw a man with short blonde
hair, mostly in silhouette. He was absolutely amazed to see an occupant inside this craft looking directly at
him. So the witness ah waved at this man and to his amazement this man waved
right back at him. Immediately the object rose upward. The sound changed
from a soft worring to a quote high hum and the object immediately shot away towards the
northeast. Now talking to the woman she said that she had actually not seen the UFO or didn't remember it. It's not
known why she exited her vehicle and was praying on the ground. But returning
back to his vehicle, the witness said it started up fine. The battery was normal. Such an unusual case. I really wish I
could have talked to this other witness, the woman. Why was she on the ground kneeling and praying and then denying
that she had ever seen this UFO? Honestly, from an investigator's perspective, I think it's quite possible
that she did in fact see this UFO, but somehow forgot about it because we do know this often happens. People can have
a very close encounter, and they become somewhat entranced, absolutely overwhelmed, and
it can be completely erased for from your memory. I'd like to know, you know,
why did her car stop? Why did she get out on the ground and start praying? Uh,
did the UFO stop her car? I mean, these are questions that are unfortunately
unanswered. So, I don't really want to speculate too much without being able to talk to the witness, but certainly a
fascinating case, especially because the other witness, the gentleman, was able
to wave at these occupants inside the UFO. And what do you know? They waved
back. I mean, that's a really friendly kind of cool interaction. It's one of the reasons I really wanted to include
this case. It's just fascinating. Now, here's another one which is really quite unusual. I call
this one a pressure inside his head. This occurred on January 6, 1978 in
Santo Antonio de Caparika in Portugal. And this case was fairly widely
published. And it's an amazing case because of how it affected the witnesses
in a really unusual way. This case was first published in the Encyclopedia of
Close Encounters with UFOs by Vicente Juan Bester Almos and Juan A. Fernandez
Paris. It involves two witnesses. One is a 35-year-old civil construction
technician known only by his initials GSF and his friend who elected to remain
totally anonymous. They had been hanging out in a cafe on the beach in Santa
Antonio Daparika again in Portugal and had stayed there until it closed up for
the evening. They were then walking away from the beach and this is when they noticed a very intense bright blue
glowing object moving from the direction of the ocean across the sky towards
them. And their shock turned to fear when the object suddenly stopped,
hovered in the sky about 1,200 ft away, and then slowly descended to the ground
over a little forested area next to the orbiter campsite.
Now both men without being quite sure why they acted this way began running down rural Castro Frera as you can see
here to chase this light which at the time led to a wooded area. Now walking
among the bushes and low-lying acacia trees they saw that the area around them
was brightly illuminated by this object which now hung in the sky about 30 to 35
ft above the ground just a short distance away. So they reached a
clearing and looking across the street were terrified to see this figure that
was humanoid in appearance. It was about 25 ft away from them, but it was clearly
not human. This caused a lot of fear for them because they could see that this figure was 7 feet tall, dressed in a
sort of loose- fitting, very shiny white suit, quote, like the ones firefighters
wear when fighting fires. They said its head was covered by a helmet, white and
shiny as its suit, very similar to a motorcycle helmet, but had a narrow, dark glass-like visor. The figure was
facing the two men, who had the impression that they had surprised this strange visitor as much as it had
surprised them. They said its arms were hanging unmoving along its side. Mr. G A
SF says that during this time he felt a weird buzzing sensation or pressure
inside his head and this became stronger and stronger the closer they approached to this being and this
craft. Now this figure immediately began to turn in a very slow and heavy fashion
moving from left to right walking towards this object which was about 45 to 50 feet behind the being. Neither of
the men heard this being or the object making any noise. They said this object
had a flattened shape but had a hump in the center. They estimated it was about 75 to 90 ft wide, 15 to 20 ft high, but
it was so bright that they could not really discern its exact shape. But now
thoroughly frightened, they turned and fled the area. Now returning to the site
the next day, the two men did find an area about 25 ft in diameter near this
clearing where they had stood where all the grass had been crushed. This reached out under the nearby trees which did not
show any damage. Investigators did visit this site about 7 weeks later and were
not able to find any alleged landing traces. But the main witness, Mr. G A SF
says that at the time of this encounter his watch also stopped and he also reported some other strange
physiological effects beyond the odd feeling of pressure and buzzing in his head. He said that for several weeks
after the encounter he suffered from very severe insomnia, sleeping only two
hours a night despite taking sleeping pills. He also suffered from a nervous depression that was severe enough that
even his co-workers noticed a change in his normal behavior and personality.
Even a month after the incident, he still had not fully recovered. Another
amazing case that shows how shocking an encounter can be for a person. Glad that
there were two witnesses to this case so they had each other to give them support. really interesting that their
watches stopped. There was apparent landing traces. Also super interesting
is how this witness was affected for quite some time after the encounter, but
also during the encounter where he felt this kind of pressure in his head. I
don't know if this was perhaps the ET trying to communicate telepathically with him because other people have
described sort of feeling uh you know pressure in their head as these ETs try
to telepathically communicate with him or perhaps this was just an effect of some sort of energy field surrounding
this humanoid and the craft. really hard to say without a more full, you know,
investigation into this case, but certainly a fascinating encounter. And
again, so many of them. I mean, it just goes on and on. Here's another one which
is also super interesting. I call this one the creatures in the woods. This is
really unusual in a number of ways. This one occurred on April 27, 1986 in Graina
Deuglia, Italy. And I like this case because it's got multiple
witnesses. Uh the police became involved. There's apparent landing traces. It went on for quite some time.
Really unusual humanoid as well. So, uh there's a lot to unpack in this case
is what I'm trying to say. This case comes from the CISU Centro Italiano Study
Euphologici or the Italian UFO Study Center with 7:30 a.m. morning on April
27, 1986 as one of the witnesses, a Mr. GL,
he's a karate instructor, and his student, Mr. VS were jogging along in
the woods along a path not far from the town of Graina Deuglia in Puglia, Italy.
Suddenly they came upon two tall beings who were very clearly not normal humans.
They stood about 7t tall. Each were wearing full body white uniforms and
ovalshaped helmets with holes, round holes for the eyes and mouth. Now, these
two beings were looking directly at the witnesses from a nearby path in the forest. Both men immediately became
extremely frightened and went back to go find their friends who were also jogging. But their friends did not
believe him and just kept jogging. So, Mr. GL went to go get his camera and he
returned to the area hoping to see these creatures again. Did not see them. But
while looking for them, he came upon three hunters in the area who denied
seeing anything unusual. So Mr. GL and his student returned to the parking area and to
their surprise, they saw one of these creatures again, now looking at them from a nearby hill. He reportedly
snapped a photograph. I don't know what became of this photograph. At any rate, he started to run up the hill towards
this being. And as he did so, the the other man, the student, noticed that
this being was holding a sort of black stick like object in one hand. Now,
unfortunately, this being immediately left in the opposite direction, and Mr. GL could now see that it wasn't walking,
but appeared to be gliding or floating across the terrain with its arms outstretched and not touching the
ground. though he could see that the grass was moving beneath it. They ran back to their cars and now hearing a
strange rustling sound in the woods, they decided to drive back to town to tell the police. They informed the
police. So he and the police returned to this area. And at this point, they ran into the same hunters that Mr. G had
talked to earlier. But now these hunters said that yes, they had in fact just seen these beings.
So they looked around. The beings were gone. But inspecting the area, the police did locate four strange circles
in the ground, each about 50 cm in diameter, 20 in, all in a sort of square
area, 5 m or 15 ft in diameter. Very, very interesting. You know, a 7ft tall
creature wearing a white jumpsuit and helmet. This does not sound like a human
being. Certainly not a normal one. But there it is levitating or gliding across the field. So many people seeing it.
It's interesting that the three hunters first said, "No, we didn't see anything." But then later were
approached by the police and admitted that, "Well, actually, yes, we just saw it." So again, here's a multiple witness
case. When you have that many people seeing something, you cannot just dismiss a
case like that. So, you know, this is an important detail. People say, "Well, there's no
evidence." When you have five people, you could bring them up in a court of law and very likely, you know, this
would be declared a genuine event because when there's that many witnesses, uh, they're clearly not
making it up. I mean, you can decide for yourself, of course, but to me, it's the
fact that there are so many cases like these. I think that's the best evidence
we have for the veracity of these incidents. But of course, there's always
those landing traces and the physiological effects and electromagnetic effects. I mean, it just
goes on and on. It's not purely anecdotal testimony. But again,
observation is the foundation of science. We have to take these reports seriously because so many people are
reporting them. Now we move to the next case. This one to me is one of the most
interesting in this compilation and so poignant and just kind of touching in a
way because it shows a human aspect to these ETs. I call this one why are you
trying to hurt me? This is a quote directly from the ET. Uh this one
occurred in on June 15, 1986 in Gary, Indiana. It is a single witness case,
but he had a very profound interaction with what appears to be a gray alien, a
gray extraterrestrial. This case was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center, New Fork, in
2002, some 16 years after the encounter, by an anonymous witness. I'll just call
him Lee. As far as I know, his case has never been officially investigated. Lee
was 26 years old at the time of his encounter. Not too long before it, he
had separated from his wife. He had a girlfriend. He moved into the basement floor apartment with his buddy who lived
on the ground floor above him. Now, this basement living space was one large
room. He had a king-sized water bed with a large headboard that had shelves on
it. And on one of these shelves, he had a little 1-ft high gold colored coin
bank with three cylindrical tubes. One for quarters, one for dimes, one for
nickels. Basically a fancy piggy bank, but this figures in the story. Now, he
had only been there a few weeks when Lee began to feel a strange sensation of being watched. And in addition to this,
every few days he thought he'd catch a glimpse of something in his peripheral vision, something moving. But whenever
he looked directly at it, nothing would be there. So he kind of just shrugged it off and figured it was nothing. But then
one night in June of 1986, this date is approximate. He was sleeping on his side
when for no reason that he could explain, he suddenly woke up. And as Lee says, "When I woke suddenly, standing in
my view was a three-foot tall creature. Its appearance was smooth. Its color was
white, true white. There was no hair anywhere. It had big black bug eyes, no
mouth, no slit, nothing. A hump where a nose would be, and no ears. was just
standing there at the side of my bed looking at that darn bank, the coin bank, as if it had never seen anything
like it. I guess it hadn't. So terrified by the appearance of this strange creature that was clearly nonhuman, Lee
shouted out loud, "What the?" And he grabbed the only weapon within reach,
his pillow, and tried to hit this creature over the head. Now, to his
shock, it appeared that the pillow and his own hand went right through this entity, and as a result, Lee kind of
struck his hand on the side of his bed, banging his wrist. But it was at this
point that the entity stopped looking at the coin bank, turned its head very slowly down to the left, and looked
directly at Lee. And as Lee says, this next part took about 10
seconds to occur. It was now looking at me. It slowly tilted its head to the
left as if in curiosity, and I heard it say in my mind, "Why are you trying to
hurt me?" Now, mind you, when I first saw it, I was terrified. But when it
looked at me and talked to me in my mind, I had a very strong feeling of peace and love. And then, with the head
still tilted, it very slowly faded away and was gone. Then once it was gone, I was scared
again. So following this incident, other strange things began to happen. Lee
didn't see it anymore. But as he says, I could feel when it was in the room with me. I could sense it in my mind. He had
a girlfriend at this time, and when she came over and slept in the bed, she started to wake up fighting something.
This was something that had never happened before. Now he asked his friend who lived upstairs about all this. His
friend had no explanation other than to say that his infant brother had died in
the house. But as Lee says, what I saw was no darn baby. Not a human one,
anyway. So, still feeling the presence of this strange entity after this
experience, Lee ended up moving out of the basement apartment just one month later. As he says, I was 26 then. I am
now 42. I've never seen it again, but I still feel it around to this day. What
the hell is that about? So Lee wonders if perhaps he was taken that night in June 1986 and is still being tracked. He
wonders what would have happened if he had not panicked and tried to hurt this ET. Would it have communicated further
with him? Whatever the case, this incident still affects him profoundly to this day. As he says, "This freaks me
out just talking about it. It gives me the creeps. And for the full skeptics and non-believers, I swear this happened
to me on my very soul, mind, body, and spirit. If it didn't, may I die today. A
lot of very interesting details in that case. The conversation brief, although
that this witness had with this apparent ET is super interesting. One of the more
interesting details to me is that following this encounter, he still continued to feel the presence of this
ET and felt like he was being watched. This is a huge red flag, I think,
pointing towards the possibility that this was a more extensive encounter, perhaps an onboard experience, as the
witness speculated. Impossible to say for sure, but you can see how it so
profoundly affected him even decades later. And you can see that he's
incredibly sincere uh in his statements of that this really happened to him.
Amazing. All right. Now, we move to another case. This one's also really
interesting. a multiple witness case with some very interesting elements to
it. I call this one they're not human. This occurred one evening in October of
2010 in Olivaria, Argentina. A super interesting case with a very unusual
humanoid. This case comes directly from one of the firstand witnesses. His name is Marcelo Araman. It was past midnight
one weekend in October 2010 as Marcelo and his friend Ezekiel B were walking
along a road in Olivaria. This is in Tandiel, Argentina. Now, this road
boarded the foothills of the Tandelia mountain range. Suddenly, Ezekiel
shouted out that he had just seen a very unusual looking bright light up along a
nearby mountain ridge. They both looked up, but this light was now gone. So they
continued walking when they noticed an eerie silence settling over the
environment. As Marcelo says, "It seemed that everything had gone quiet in our
surroundings as nothing could be heard. No nature sounds or the sounds typical
of an evening in the mountains such as the crackling of leaves, birds in the treetops, nothing. The wind had died
down. No cars went by. It could be said that a very special atmosphere
surrounded us. Now, this is when suddenly, without warning, they saw another light about 450 ft away. At
first, they assumed this was a normal campfire along the foothills of the Tandelia Mountains. But it was strange
because this light was not normal. It wasn't casting any light around it. As
Marcelo says, it was an initial odd observation, an opaque light with its
luminosity both concentrated and controlled within the same source of light.
So curious, they continued walking closer and closer until suddenly they realized, "No, this was definitely not a
campfire." As Marcelo says, it was humanoid in shape. At that point, we got
to see the legs, arms, torso, and head of a tall stylized silhouette wearing a
luminous suit that blinked intermittently all the time, turning on and off constantly.
Coming even closer, we notice that the strange figure's entire posture and behavior showed that it was intent on
finding something on the ground. With its head tilted forward and its body
completely rigid, arms outstretched downward along the sides of its torso,
it walked in a systematic robotic fashion, taking three or four steps before spinning on its own axis. It
would take three or four steps towards where it had commenced its search. Without a doubt, it was looking for
something with a great deal of interest and concentration. Now, the witnesses were impressed by this, but they were
also most impressed by its quote luminous outfit, which they said was exceedingly strange. As Marcelo says, it
looked like a coverall, but form-fitting rather than bulky. It appeared to have a belt with a light in the middle and
something akin to a transparent helmet, a fishbowl type covering its head. There
was a small light in the middle of its face. So, they were able to use a nearby tree for reference, which they later
measured, and they could see that this figure was at least 6 ft tall. Now, at
this point, Ezekiel decided to make a clicking noise to draw the attention of the being. And it worked. It worked
immediately because this being stopped what it was doing and turned and looked straight at the two men. Ezekiel now
began shouting out over and over again, "It's not human. It's not human. It's not human." So now, terrified, Ezekiel
turned and ran. Now, Marcelo remained observing this humanoid for just a few
seconds longer, staring at this being as the being stared back at him. Now, at
this point, the being began to float or levitate upwards up the slope of the mountain. And that was enough for
Marcelo. He was now convinced that this figure was not human. And he also turned and ran, following just seconds behind
Ezekiel. Now, at one point, as they were running, Ezekiel turned around and shouted out that this creature was
actually following them. Marcelo did not turn around to confirm this. He just kept running. Now, Ezekiel was a member
of the Mormon religion and was profoundly skeptical of ETSs, UFOs, and
the paranormal. So, this whole experience affected him really profoundly. But Marcelo was perhaps even
more profoundly affected. In fact, he started to research this subject in depth. He interviewed firsthand
witnesses all over the area of Tande, and he found many cases of humanoids. He
found a case in 1958 where a child saw a cylindrical UFO and a small occupant
next to it that seemed to be unaware or uncaring that it was being observed. He
found a case in 1974 where two men were driving along Route 226 and saw a
humanoid in a glowing metallic suit bending down and inspecting the grass.
They drove off and five miles ahead of them on the highway they saw a glowing object in the sky.
Also another case in 1974, he found a group of people in a popular campground who saw two strange beings come down the
mountain and move through the campground. He found many other cases. As he says, it should be noticed that
there was a constant presence of UFOs and nocturnal lights in these close encounters in the mountains surrounding
Tandiel. Sightings that continue to this very day. How amazing is that? And here
we have another example of a complete skeptic, a devout religious man being suddenly confronted with something
that's completely out of his worldview. I think that makes it very difficult for
a witness to again process and assimilate an experience like this. And
of course, it affected the other witness as profoundly in that he started
investigating this subject and became a fairly prominent researcher in his own right.
So I wonder if there is a deliberate aspect to these encounters and that
people are sort of chosen or the ETS show themselves to them knowing that
this is going to affect them profoundly or if it's just a one-off, you know, a chance encounter, purely
opportunistic. Really hard to say for sure, but certainly a fascinating
case. Now, let's move to the last one. This one I don't even know about the
high strangeness of this one. There are other cases like this though. I call this one the alien and the squirrels.
This occurred in December of 2012 very early in the morning in Villa Visiosa de
Odon in Madrid, Spain. This is a multiple witness case and talk about
animal effects. Wow. I mean, this one is off the charts. Wild. This final and
very unusual case comes from researcher Joseé Antonio Keravaka, and he was told
the account by the son of the witnesses. This has to be one of the strangest accounts on record. The witnesses are a
married couple who were staying at their private villa in a gated community in Villa Visiosa de Odon in Madrid, Spain.
It was around 6:30 or 700 a.m. one December morning when the couple was woken up in their bedroom by a strange
noise coming from their yard. It sounded to them like squeals and yelps of many
small animals. So they looked out the window. It was too dark to really see anything. The sun had not quite risen.
So they turned on the patio lights to get a better look. And this is when they got a huge shock because they saw
literally quote hundreds of squirrels. All these squirrels had gathered
together inside the patio of their garden. Now, it wasn't unusual for them
to see two or three squirrels, but they had never seen this many before, hundreds of them. It appeared to them as
if all the squirrels in the area had come together on their porch, and all of
them were screaming at the same time. So, they were absolutely stunned by this
very strange sight and had no logical explanation to account for it. But
turning off the outside lights, they saw something even more strange. This is
when they noticed something floating above the garden. Now, at first glance, they said it looked like a long, thin,
doll-like figure floating a sort of horizontal position face down towards the ground. They could see that it had
long arms and legs, no apparent muscle structure. Said it looked almost flexible and rubbery in texture. It
looked to them like it was floating along, being carried by the wind. But the problem was there was no wind. The
air was perfectly still. And they could now see that this was in fact a figure of some kind, a humanoid figure, was
very pale. It had two large round black eyes staring down at the ground. They
couldn't see any mouth or nose or ears, but they could see it was quite tall. They estimate about 9 ft. and was
wearing a full body red jumpsuit that covered its body from head to toe, including hands and feet. The only place
not covered was its face. Now, this strange being never turned. It just
stared downward at them. They were looking at it from a side profile, but it remained above their garden, floating
around for about five minutes. And during this whole time, the hundreds of
squirrels chattered constantly. Finally, and suddenly, this
floating humanoid vanished from view right in front of their eyes, as they put it, as if switching off a light.
They didn't see it move off. It just disappeared. Immediately, the squirrels
stopped chattering and slowly dispersed, and the witnesses felt absolutely
certain that the floating being had somehow attracted the squirrels onto
their patio. Can you imagine waking up and seeing like a hundred squirrels on
your patio? If that's not strange enough, then suddenly you've got this weird figure floating around your
backyard. It's just crazy. This is one of the more extreme animal effect cases
I've heard of. But I do know of other cases involving encounters that suddenly drew
crowds of animals. I mean, there was one involving a bunch of bunnies, another
involving a bunch of, if I remember, bees or insects of some kind. Uh,
animals can absolutely sense these UFOs. These ETs, perhaps even better in some
cases than humans can. Human or the animals do have
incredible sensory abilities that in many ways exceed our own. So, that could
be what's going on here. But certainly a fascinating case. So there you go. 12
more cases coming from all over the world making it undeniable that
something truly profound is happening here. I mean I do understand skeptics. I
came into this field as a profound skeptic. One who was so skeptical that I
was not even willing to examine the evidence. But series of events occurred,
mainly my brother seeing a UFO that forced me to take a closer look. And
boy, was it a shock. I mean, it knocked me over. I was struggling for a full
year or two just trying to figure out what was going on here. And at that point, I hadn't even had an encounter.
So, I can only imagine what it's like for someone to suddenly be confronted with this and still be a skeptic. But
yeah, I called this one not human because that is sort of the real
shocking realization that a lot of these witnesses have when they see these beings. But what's also kind of ironic
is that they are almost without exception humanoid, very much like us,
more alike us than different. And again, this is my assessment. I do think we're
dealing with people, biological beings, who are coming from other planets. I
truly think this is the explanation which best fits the evidence. I know there are other theories out there
interdimensional. Well, who isn't interdimensional? We're all interdimensional. So, I'm not sure how
useful that explanation is, but that's this is why research is so important.
You know, we still have a lot of questions surrounding this subject, but each case adds to our knowledge and
we're getting closer and closer to understanding who these beings are, where they come from, why they are here,
and their agenda on this planet. So, thank you very much you guys. I truly
appreciate you guys watching. It's always fun to do the research for these videos. Although, as I know you're aware
of, it takes an enormous amount of work and research and it's very time
consuming and in some ways tedious. But I can't call it work cuz I'm having fun
and it's super interesting. So, thank you again. I hope you enjoyed this.
Perhaps learned something. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions, keep searching for the truth.
Most important of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next Friday.
Have a great week. Bye for now.
