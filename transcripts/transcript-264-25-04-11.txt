EXAMINED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS: SEVEN SHOCKING ONBOARD/UFO UNCOUNTERS
Apr 11, 2025

Summary:
Apr 11, 2025
An onboard encounter is probably the most controversial type of all UFO encounters. And yet it also is the most extensive and has the greatest potential to answer the many questions surrounding the extraterrestrial presence, who the ETs are, where they come from, and their agenda on our planet. These used to be thought of very rare events, but there are now many thousands of cases on record, and some researchers believe they may number in the millions. This video presents seven extraordinary onboard UFO encounters from all over the world. These cases take you on a journey to the very heart of the UFO phenomenon.
 
TURNED TRANSPARENT: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF PEDRO DIMA. Late one night on July 21, 1968, Pedro Dima (a civil servant) walked along a street in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Suddenly he heard a humming noise, and a brilliant light shone down on him from above. Suddenly a strange craft landed next to him. A door opened in the craft and a group of short humanoids exited, ran up to Pedro and pulled him onboard. They questioned him extensively about life on Earth and then conducted a bizarre physical examination. They then escorted him out of the craft, which zoomed off.

THE ALIEN WAND: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF LASZLO BAKO. In 1953, 5-year-old Laszlo Bako had a face-to-face encounter with a gray alien outside his home in Tiszacsege, Hungary. But 21 years later, in August 1974, he was taken from his home in Debrecen, Hungary into a UFO. Laszlo was met by a humanoid who showed him a metallic wand. Laszlo passed out and awoke sitting up in bed, and next to him was the weird metallic wand. After another encounter, Laszlo decided to hand the wand over to researchers. Multiple analyses showed that the wand was composed of ultra-pure magnesium.
 
INTIMATE RELATIONS WITH AN ET: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF LIBERATO ANIBAL QUINTERO. One evening in 1976, Liberato Anibal Quintero, a rancher from El Banco, Colombia, felt compelled to go outside. Suddenly a glowing object dropped from the sky. Liberato fell to the ground paralyzed in fear. The object landed and small humanoids rushed out and grabbed him. Liberato fought them but was pulled into the craft. He passed out and when he awoke, his clothes were gone, and three female humanoids seduced him, then let him go. The craft took off, leaving behind traces on the ground.

THEY MEAN US NO HARM: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF WAYNE FARQUHAR. In 1978, Wayne Farquhar (a security guard) woke up when a foggy light came into the room of his home in New South Wales, Australia. room. A beam of light came through the ceiling, and he passed out. A few months later, he woke up to find himself in lying on a metal exam table being examined by a strange man. He passed out. Later, a second similar encounter occurred, only this time, Wayne recalled being inside a four-seater UFO zooming through space. Soon more encounters would occur.

INVITED: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ANTONIO CONTE. One night in January 1978, woodcutter Antonio Conte was driving outside of Lusiana, Italy when a strange craft blocked the road. Short ETs exited and invited Antonio onboard. Antonio boarded willingly, and inside, they tried to undress and examine him. Antonio resisted. He begged them to let him go. They gave him a small black box and opened the door. Antonio crawled out and the craft took off. Antonio still had the alien artifact. Returning home, those who knew him believed him, but others ridiculed him mercilessly.

THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROGER R. On April 29, 1989, ten-year-old Roger R woke in the bedroom of his home in Orlando, Florida to see four gray-type ETs. He was taken from his room into a small craft. After being examined, Roger held long conversations with the ETs, was given predictions, and shown many things including an alien zoo, and other things which he had no way of knowing. He was told our government has ETs in their possession, that humans originally came from Mars and much more.

CURED OF DEPRESSION: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JADE. On the night of November 27, 1990, while walking to his home in Plymouth, Minnesota, 16-year-old Jade became disoriented when a bright light flashed down on him from above. In the months that followed he began having flashbacks and dreams of being taken onboard. Soon he remembered an extensive encounter where he was examined by gray ETs who examined him and communicated telepathically before returning him. It was an experience that would affect him for the rest of his life.

These seven onboard UFO encounters are just the tip of the iceberg. So many other cases exist. The fact that none of these witnesses needed hypnosis to recall their encounter shows that these experiences cannot be explained away as false memories induced by hypnotic regression. Each of these cases adds to our knowledge of the ET presence on planet Earth and provides further confirmation that we are not alone.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal.
Today I'm going to be talking about my absolute favorite aspect of UFO research
and that is onboard UFO encounters. I call this
episode examined by aliens. Seven shocking onboard UFO encounters.
This is perhaps the most controversial aspect of UFO research. There's quite a
lot of debate about it, but the fact is many people are reporting these
experiences. It used to be thought of as quite rare. A lot of researchers are now reversing their opinions about that. I
know J. Allen Heinik is quoted as saying as many as one in 40 people have been on
board a UFO. And in 1991, the Roper organization did a poll which found that
it could be as many as 1 in 50, very close to what J. Allen Heinek says. At
any rate, it's certainly a lot more common than most people think. Now, I've
chosen seven cases today, most I think of which are not well-known, and some
are really wellverified with some astounding evidence. These cases come
from all over the world. 1968 to 1990, but the locations are
Italy, Hungary, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, and two from the
United States, including Minnesota and Florida. What's also really interesting
about these cases is that not one of them has used hypnosis. These are fully
conscious encounters. So we can lay aside any explanations that onboard
encounters are the result of hypnosis or even sleep paralysis because these cases
show that that explanation certainly does not fit. So yeah, these cases I
think really have a lot to teach us. They have the most information, far more information than a sighting or even a
landing or a face-toface encounter with a humanoid. People are literally surrounded by the phenomena. They are
inside these craft. So that alone makes these cases very important and certainly
very interesting. So let's just get started. And the first case I'd like to
talk about today I call turned transparent. The onboard UFO encounter
of Pedro Dimma. This occurred in July of
1968 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. And this is a really interesting case because
this gentleman was taken on board, physically examined by ETSs, had a long
conversation with them. In many ways, it is a typical onboard UFO encounter, but
some very strange things happened that I don't know that I've ever heard before. This extraordinary case first appeared
in the July 21st, 1968 issue of the Brazilian publication Gazetta de
Noticius. The witness is Pedro Dimma, who at the time of his encounter lived at Rio
Concaso, 12, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He worked as a civil servant. But it was
around 11 p.m. on July 21st, 1968, when Pedro was walking along the
Sao Paulo Highway, the Estrada Dos Banderantes near a Catholic seminary
known as Educandario Domasco, when suddenly coming from above
his head, he heard a loud humming noise. It very quickly began to increase in
intensity when suddenly he was blinded by a powerful beam of light. At that
moment, two green lights appeared next to him, apparently attached to a craft of some kind, and he saw that it had
actually landed right next to him on the street. A door quickly opened, and four
humanoids stepped out. They were very short, just under two feet tall. He said
they had strangely shaped heads and appeared to have greenish skin or perhaps clothes and were wearing what
looked like headphone-like devices on their heads. They immediately ran
towards Pedro who now terrified found himself unable to move. He was held as
he said quote as though by hypnotic force. He said at this point his arms
and legs felt cold, his muscles felt strange. His head was spinning and he
was unable to speak, though he still remained fully conscious of what was happening around him. Now, although he
saw no mouths on the being's faces, they began to speak to him in his native
language of Portuguese, and he realized that they were communicating telepathically. They immediately grabbed
him by his arms and dragged him to the craft, which was now silent, and pulled
him in through the doorway. He very quickly found himself in a room which looked to him quote like a complicated
laboratory. Now still speaking telepathically in Portuguese, the beings began to question him at length and in
great detail about every aspect of his life, about human habits, about cultures
and customs, about the physiological functions of his body, about how humans
reproduce and more. They then had him undressed and he allowed them to conduct
a detailed physical examination of his body. Two of the beings worked on him
while the other two seemed to be making notes on what looked to Pedro like a sheet of aluminum as he perceived
recording the results of his exam. Now, this examination at one point included
the placement of what looked to Pedro like a strange glowing fine wire, which
they inserted into his mouth. And this caused his entire body to turn completely transparent, like an X-ray.
It was shortly later that lights began to flash silently across the walls of the craft, and it seemed to Pedro that
this was an order of some kind coming from somewhere, because immediately the examination ended. The ETSs quickly
dressed Pedro and took him outside through the doorway, telling him that after their departure, the whole
experience would remain in his mind, quote, "Like a dream." Still terrified
and dumbfounded, Pedro stood on the road as the beings returned into the craft, the door closed, and the craft took off
and flew off so quickly, it left a bright trail of light behind it. There
you go. Yeah, in many ways your typical onboard UFO encounter, the one single
thing that most people report when taken on board a craft is being physically examined, and that's certainly true in
his case. But seeing his body turned completely transparent, ooh, that is
strange. A really interesting case all around. But let's move to this next one,
which is probably my favorite in this compilation. This one is not that
well-known, which is surprising considering how wellverified it is. I
call this the alien wand, the onboard UFO encounter of Lazlo Bako. This took
place primarily in mid August of 1974 near Debson, Hungary. It's actually
a series of events, but the onboard encounter took place at that point. But
what's so interesting about this encounter is that this gentleman was given an ET
artifact. Uh what appears to be a wand that we so often hear about in so many
cases with ETS holding this little rod-like device, little wand which ends
up paralyzing a person or levitating them or doing all kinds of things, healing.
uh and he has this actual artifact. So that makes this case profoundly
important. This fascinating, important and profound case was researched by the
Hungarian UFO Research Network, Huon, primarily by Gabbor Tarcali and Llo
Kiss. The primary witness is a man by the name of Llo Bako. He was born in
1948 in the small village of Tisaz, Hungary. It was a sunny morning in early
summer of 1953 when 5-year-old Lazlo was in the fields with his grandparents.
They were cutting sugar beats while he played along the nearby railroad tracks. Suddenly, he felt an odd sensation and
looking around saw a strange little quote person who was walking towards him. This person was humanoid in form,
but per lazlo had an oversized head and was the same height as 5-year-old
Llo. His entire body was very smooth, gray in color, and he appeared to have
no clothes on, or perhaps was wearing a skintight jumpsuit. At any rate, the figure approached slowly and stopped
about 3 ft away from Llo. This little man then smiled at him. Lazlo felt a
warm, friendly feeling coming from this being. And per lazlo, this little man
began to communicate with him mentally, telepathically, for about one minute,
and then just walked off to the right about 15 ft away and promptly disappeared. This puzzled and upset Llo,
who knew very good and well that people normally don't just disappear. He
searched for the little man, but he was gone. That was the beginning of his experiences, but it certainly wasn't the
end. Because 21 years later, Lazlo, now 26, was lying in bed on a terrace of a
small cottage on the outskirts of Debson, Hungary. It was 11 p.m. one
evening in mid August of 1974. He was listening to the radio and
fell asleep. But just moments after he fell asleep, he woke up to find that he
was no longer on his terrace. He was someplace else inside a strange bright
room. He was sitting in a type of armchair, he said, and in front of him was a desk with what looked like white,
gray, and black stripes. To his right there was a humanoid of some kind. He
didn't get a good look at this person, but he saw that this figure was holding a 14 1/2 inch long metallic rod or wand
and was moving it along the desk as if to display it to Lazlo, placing its
fingers along small bumps that were situated along the side of this rod. And
he communicated to Lazlo, saying all kinds of things. Unfortunately, Lazlo
could only remember little bits and pieces of this. He remembered that the man told him, quote, "We have left the
earth and something about distance." That's all he could remember. But
Lazlo's next memory was waking up in bed in a sitting position with his feet on
the floor. He certainly hadn't been in that position when he went to bed. He was upset by the encounter, but at the
same time felt, quote, full of very wonderful feelings. And this is when he
noticed a paper box near his bed which was all lit up with a strange green light. And looking inside, he found this
weird metallic rod that he had seen in this strange room being held by this
being. And it was now emitting green light from one end. It was clear to him
that the strange being on board the presuming UFO had given him this quote
present. So he brought it inside, stored it in his apartment. But following this
incident, Llo did become quite ill. He recovered and he realized that this
alien rod, whatever it was, this artifact had to be of incalculable
worth. So he hid it. He wrapped it in a cloth, put it into an iron pipe, closed
both ends, and buried it in his garden where it would remain for the next several years.
Now you can see this object here. It is a silvery white metallic color 14 12 in
long about 1 in in diameter. The ends are rounded. It has a rough surface with
nine raised kind of gold brown hemispherical nodules or bulges along
the side. Also an isosles triangle shape with an oval indentation or hole at one
end which is apparently made of a different material and continually emitted flashes of colored lights
including red, blue, green and violet. There's another sort of weird protrusion
on the other end of this wand or rod. The end with the triangle and in line
with the nodules has a small circle which emits a green light. This is at
the very end. So meanwhile, events were still in progress. In May of
1976, Llo was working as a truck driver. He was one of the drivers of a convoy of
Zil trucks, a cargo truck, and was driving along Highway 4 near Debrisen
transporting slag sand. Llo was the last in line on the highway of this convoy.
It was just after 2:00 a.m. when suddenly he felt his truck begin swerving of its own accord. He wasn't
doing it. It moved first to the left and then to the right for a duration of about 12 to 20 seconds when suddenly,
for no reason that he could fathom, his truck rose up into the air and then dropped down on its side on the highway.
As the truck hit the road, the slag sand he was carrying spread out in this shape
of a symmetrical pyramid, which was quite odd for slag sand, which should
have been spewed everywhere. Now, the truck was not damaged, but Llo, of
course, was unable to open the driver's side door, which was against the ground. So he hopped out through the other
window and it turned out that the drivers in front of him actually saw his truck rise up in the air through their
mirrors. Police were called, tow trucks were called. The truck was towed back to
the company office. Nobody saw any UFO or anything like this, but neither did
anybody have any explanation as to how the truck had risen into the air. There
was a police report on this case, but it has apparently remained sealed. It was about 15 years after this event that
Lazlo decided to take action with this ET artifact, this alleged ET artifact.
In 1991, he dug up the rod in his backyard and decided to contact the
Hungarian UFO Network. They wanted him to hand over the rod, but Lazlo was
understandably reluctant to part with it. What he ended up doing, and this is so unfortunate, he cut it up into three
equal portions and sent the middle portion, which had no real markings except for these little bumps along one
edge, to them. This was the simplest portion of this ET artifact. But later
in 1994, he did present the entire object, still in three pieces, at the
International UFO Congress in 1994 in Hungary. After much persuasion, he did
permit these pieces to be subjected to three separate scientific laboratory
analyses. Now, the first analysis was done secretly in Debson, Hungary, and it
showed something interesting. It showed that this object, the central section,
was made up of 100% ultra pure magnesium of a purity that really stunned the
scientists doing the analysis. as normally the highest possible rate of
purity naturally achieved or through a laboratory is about
99.5%. No, this was closer to 100. Two additional analyses in separate labs
also produced the same results. These two other separate analyses were done in
1995. one in France and one in Slovakia and yeah got the same darn results as
researcher Gabbor Tarcali says on the basis of the facts detailed above we
consider Llob Bako to be the owner of an object whose origin is probably
extraterrestrial. Now researchers did note some other strange effects and properties of this rod. When a light was
shown on the end with this green luminescence, it would increase in brilliance. The rod was of course
X-rayed which showed that the hole in the triangle section was emitting
colored lights and showed the presence of what appeared to be an 8 to 9 mm long
4 to 5 mm wide rod pointing towards the center of this oval eye within the
triangle. And unlike the other sections, X-rays could not fully penetrate this
particular section. A researchers suspected that this rod did have a function which became
disabled when llo cut it into three pieces. Researchers did determine that
these fluorescent colors coming from the eye section were not normal light, but
were probably more accurately described or produced as coming from subatomic
radiation or particle radiation of some kind, creating more of a holographic
type effect. They speculated that these nodules alongside of this rod may have been the
controls and that the device could have had a number of purposes such as healing
or creating weightlessness, emitting a paralyzing beam, the other effects so
often described by contactees. But of course, this was pure speculation. And from here, the story
ends with only rumors. Reportedly, sections were sent to Japan and were
never returned, nor was the analysis. Others say that Lazlo was
first open to more research, but then became somewhat paranoid and shunned all inquiries and cut off all contact with
everyone. Some say the pieces of this object were stolen. Whatever the case,
recent efforts by researchers to locate llo or the rod have proven fruitless.
It's such a shame that that case just kind of disappeared off the radar. Nobody really knows what happened to
Lzlo, but is absolutely an important addition to the whole catalog of onboard
UFO encounters. So unusual. It's not the only case involving an ET artifact, but
it's certainly one of the best verified out there. What a shame he chopped this
thing up into three pieces because that had so much potential to really change
the way everyone feels about this subject. And let's face it, they still
weren't able to even explain what this artifact was. So again, a very very
important case I think. Now let's move to the next one which I call intimate
relations with an ET. The onboard UFO encounter of Liberato Annabel Quantero.
This took place in 1976 in Elbanco, Colombia. Of all the cases in this
compilation, this one is probably the best known. It is one of a number of
cases in which the witness reports having intimate relations with ETSs. So
that is a very interesting aspect to this case because we know ETSs are very
interested in human reproduction. There's a whole hybrid baby phenomena and this case certainly speaks towards
that. But it's pretty well verified too with some witnesses, outside witnesses
who saw the craft as well as landing traces and an all-around really
interesting and unusual case. This case was originally published in the Colombian newspaper Vea and quickly
spread to other newspapers, various UFO publications and books. It became quite
well publicized. The sole witness is a rancher by the name of Liberato Annabel
Quantero. It was just after midnight one evening in 1976 when Liberato was
awakened by a thunderstorm. And upon awakening, he felt an unusual
premonition. as he says, as though something odd was going to happen to me.
He felt nervous. He was sweating and felt strangely compelled to walk out of the house, almost as if he was quote
controlled by some inexplicable external force. Now, his wife, Bruna, also
noticed his strange behavior. Said he was snoring, which he never does. He went to bed much earlier than he
normally would. So she noticed something strange also was going on, but did not
follow him out of the house. Moments later, after leaving the house and going
outside, a brilliant light appeared overhead, frightening him enough that he threw himself down to the ground to
protect himself. This light quickly approached. Liberato tried to get up and
run away, but could only manage to crawl into a bush and try to hide. And as he
says, everything seemed strange. At first, I thought I must be dreaming, but
soon I realized that none of it was a hallucination, but all real enough. A
big luminous craft shaped like a hen's egg was slowly descending from the sky,
vividly lighting up the whole area all around. Now, although it was quite a cool evening, he now felt quote absolute
unbearable heat. It says that this craft landed in silence a short distance away
was blazing with a blinding light too bright to even look at at first, but
then he heard a metallic scraping noise and looking at this object saw that an opening had appeared in the craft and a
ladder type device was extending to the ground. As Liberato says, I was by now
more scared than ever. I wanted to run for it, but that was impossible. I was
simply nailed to the spot. However much I wanted to run, I simply couldn't do it. At one point, I felt I was about to
swoon, but then I felt a new excess of strength and just sat there where I was.
But I nearly let out a yell when I saw a number of people coming down out of the machine. Now, he could see that each of
these figures was holding a kind of flashlight. They were all about 4 feet tall, he said. Pale skinned with
flattish faces, high cheekbones. They had round protruding eyes tipped with
thick eyebrows. There were both men and women. The woman had long hair. They
came out after the men. All the figures looked around the environment with apparent great interest. One of the men
then walked over to Liberato and began to pull him up. Very quickly the others came and surrounded him, at which point
he started fighting them. And as Liberato says, I knocked at least four
or five of them down, but they were too many for me, and my strength was soon exhausted. So these little figures
grabbed a hold of Liberato and began to pull him towards the craft. He lost consciousness and found himself inside
the craft in a welllit room. This is interesting because he has no memory of
actually entering the craft. This is something researchers call doorway amnesia and is quite commonly
reported. Inside the craft, he immediately noticed a strange mark on his arm. He said his body was cramping
with pain. Three of the women were massaging his back and he was amazed to
see that they had no clothes on and neither did he. Now, it was at this point that these women became very
seductive. And before he knew it, Liberato found himself having intimate
relations with them. He somewhat initiated this, but they were very aggressive about it. He did notice a few
strange things about their bodies. They appeared to have no naval, no belly button. Their bodies were hairier than
normal. And as he had relations with them, he says that they would make kind of barking noises like a dog. This went
on for a pretty long time. and his attempts to stop this were thwarted as he says they were quote insatiable and
wanted to continue. Eventually, after what he estimated was about 3 hours of
intimacy, they stopped Liberato found himself utterly exhausted. At this
point, the beings gave him a drink, which as he says, quote, restored me physically as though nothing had
happened. This really astonished him and the next thing he knew he lost consciousness as Liberato says. I awoke
again finally to find myself lying on the grass. Dawn was just breaking. I
managed to get to my feet and make a dash for home to tell my wife about what happened. Soon everyone on the ranch
gathered around to hear Liberado's account, and afterwards they rushed to the spot where he said it occurred.
There they found marks on the ground where the craft had rested. Liberato says that following this experience, for
quite a long time afterwards, he suffered from terrible headaches. Now, Liberato's wife, again, she had noticed
Liberato's strange behavior prior to this encounter, but it turns out that she had seen what is apparently the same
UFO hanging around their ranch in the days before. as she says, and I quote,
"I never used to put faith in all that talk about men and women from other planets, but now I've got to believe it
in view of what has happened to my husband." And there's another thing, too. I myself have seen a strange
machine just like my husband described it flying about around here these last
few days. Now, Liberato's employer and owner of the farm, a lawyer by the name
of Miguel Antonio Pina Vega, says, and I quote, "Liberat Annabelle Quantero is a
man whom I consider to be totally trustworthy. He is a serious, hard-working fellow who drinks very
little. He has no vices like narcotics or that sort of thing. He doesn't even
smoke cigarettes. One of the best men I've ever had." I was able to see that Liberato was clearly telling the truth.
I think you'll agree that's an amazing case and sounds very much like the very
first reported abduction of Antonio
Vietas. The details are extraordinarily similar all the way from how the ETSs
are described to their behavior to the series of events that occurred. That alone I think provides a level of
corroboration here. So I don't know. These kinds of events again are very
controversial. But given that there are so many reports of this, it's hard to just deny or ignore or explain away as
hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness, which is really where
the debunkers go. Those explanations just don't hold water anymore. There are far too many cases, far too many
witnesses, far too much evidence, far too many profound similarities between
these cases. So clearly something very profound is going on here and it
behooves us all to take these reports seriously because so many people are having these
experiences. Let's move to the next one. I call this one They Mean Us No Harm,
the onboard UFO encounter of Wayne Farquire. This one occurred over a
series of years actually 1976,78 and 82 primarily in New South
Wales, Australia. I have to give kudos to Wayne for coming forward. He was
initially anonymous but ultimately decided that he doesn't care that it's
time he just speaks publicly about this that it's important that people know these things do happen and yeah his case
is profoundly interesting and really unusual. This case comes from the firsthand testimony of the witness
himself a gentleman by the name of Wayne Farquire again employed as a security guard but also a certified lay minister.
He was initially anonymous but decided to go public because, as he says, I
don't care anymore. I only kept my identity secret because of the work I do. Now, his experiences first began one
evening in 1978. He woke up in his bed to find that the room was all lit up. And coming
through the open bedroom doorway was what he describes as quote a thick
stream of dense smoke. But it was clear to him that this wasn't smoke. There was
no smell. It was kind of reddish in color and it seemed to move as if alive.
He immediately tried to wake up his wife who was asleep in bed next to him. And although she did wake briefly, she
immediately went back to sleep. He could not wake her up. This concerned him
because this smoke was kind of roing towards the cot where his infant daughter was sleeping. At this point, a
bright beam of light came through the ceiling and hit the cot where his daughter was sleeping, and Wayne found
himself losing consciousness. He woke up the next morning, but his wife had no memory of
anything strange, and his daughter was fine. It's just a few months later, Wayne again woke up in the middle of the
night to find that he was no longer in his bedroom. Instead, he lay on a hard
steel bed which appeared to be attached to a wall in a strange room. He saw an
old man standing over him. This man looked human. He was bald except for
some curly gray hair along the side of his head. He had a large nose and yeah,
looked like a normal person, but as Wayne says, I knew he was not. So, this
man proceeded to place a small elongated steel bowl with instruments inside of it
on top of Wayne's chest and then put a piece of cloth over Wayne's eyes and told him, "Stay put and don't move until
I come back." This man proceeded to walk out through a weird sliding door. Wayne
felt no fear at this point, but really couldn't move his body very much. He finally did manage to lift his head and
this caused the bowl to crash to the floor making a very loud sound and this
old man who Wayne perceived to be a doctor of some kind came rushing in and
chided him said I told you not to move. At this point Wayne passed out. He woke
up and he was fine. And his experiences continued because it was just a couple
of years later when he again found himself waking up lying on what appeared to be this same steel bed with that same
old man standing over him. But this time the man told him to sit up and Wayne got
a good look of where he was at. As Wayne says, "I sat up and noticed that the
room was circular and immensely clean. Nothing on the floor, nothing on the
walls. The whole room and everything in it was as though it was stainless steel.
It resembled that type of metal. If I had to guess the size of the room, I would say it was around 60 m diameter.
Now, at this point, he blacked out. And the next thing he knew, and this is so strange, he found himself waking up in a
small weird craft with three men flying through what appeared to be outer space.
As Wayne says in his own words, "It seemed to the three men that I woke up
unexpectedly and it startled them. The vehicle I was in was very similar to a
small car. I was sitting up in the back seat on the left side with a man on my
right and two men in the front. One driving and the other a passenger. As
soon as I opened my eyes, I looked at the guy seated next to me. Then with a raised voice, he said, "He's awake."
The driver said, "Impossible." The two in the front both turned their heads to look at me and
with surprised looks, one said, "He is supposed to be asleep." The front
passenger said, "You're awake and you should be asleep. How do you feel?" "I'm
okay," I said. "Well, while you are awake, you might as well have a look around." Definitely, I was in outer
space and flying at great speed. The vehicle was just like a little car and
it moved incredibly and was silent. We spoke for I don't know how long about
what's taking place, why I'm here and who they were. I remembered everything
they told me. Then I woke up in my bed with all the information gone except for
the memory of being with them. So this experience was very positive for him. It
provided confirmation of his prior experiences. It let him know that we are not alone in this universe. But still,
he kept most of it secret from everyone, telling only his wife parts of what
happened. But his experiences continued. In 1982, at age 27, employed as a
security guard for Warald security Wangong in New South Wales, he was up at
the top of Mount Kembla. This is a lookout not far from the coal mine in
the area when, as he says, I noticed something strange in the sky. It looked
to him like a bright star, but it was ascending upward slowly and then it remained stationary in the sky for
hours. He thought it could be a star, but the other stars were moving and this one stayed in place. So clearly not a
star. And this was not the only time he saw this. This happened, he says, for several nights in a row. Finally, one
night, he flashed his flashlight at it, trying to get its attention. There was no response. So, he did it again on the
next night, and he didn't think much of it, and was just sitting in the front seat of his car drinking coffee when the
next thing he knew, he was no longer in the front seat. He had apparently passed
out, but he was now lying in the back of his car. Was very obvious to him that something had just happened. He had to
struggle to get up. And I'll just let Wayne describe in his own words what happened. As he says, "I forced hard in
raising my head, turned it slightly and saw a large UFO with an open doorway and
seeing clearly two alien entities standing on the ground in front of the open door. I was looking straight at
them and they were both looking at me from roughly 10 to 12 m away. I again
forced myself to raise my arm and I gave a little wave. I smiled at them and I
noticed one of the beings turn his head towards the older one. Now remember clearly I saw this in crystal clarity.
Never did I see him move his lips, but I saw the older one nod his head in disagreement as if to say no. Their
appearance was humanoid but nothing like us. They had two eyes, nose, mouth, but
nothing humanlike. Their color was totally gray. Their skin was absolutely gray in color. Who they were and where
they come from, I have no idea, only that they were not from Earth. The only
thing I do know is they are not from Earth. They meant me no harm, and I truly felt no fear with them. I guess
they saw my flashing light, so they came to investigate. But then again with their technology I'm very sure that they
would have seen who it was from where they were. After I waved to them I remembered no more. So his experiences
were beginning to add up. His last strange experience that he can consciously recall occurred in 2010. He
had gone to bed early and woke up to find his entire room filled with this blazing blue light and not a normal
light. Again, as Wayne says in his own words, "I turned on my back and just lay
there in complete amazement, trying to comprehend what was happening. I was
immersed in absolute confusion, to say it mildly, as you can imagine. I was in total shock, and I didn't know what to
do because this has never happened before, ever." It was like something out of a movie, and I was completely lost in
it. After my eyes began to adjust to this incredible brightness, a beautiful
blue light with great intensity, every corner of the room was filled with this beautiful light. Its
intensity was so strong, I believe it would have even penetrated the inside of the wardrobes. It was not only bright,
but it was powerful beyond words of description. There was nowhere this light was not. Truly, it lasted a few
long minutes before it suddenly went out, leaving me once again in complete darkness. So Wayne jumped up, told his
wife. They returned to the room and inspected it. They could find nothing out of order. So after talking about it
for a little while, Wayne lay back down in bed and asked mentally, "Who are you?
Who caused this light?" And he got a response. And the response was amazing.
He saw this figure of a being on his ceiling. As Wayne says, his image was on
my ceiling and I was blown away by it. Please do not think I am making this up
because I am not. This is the total truth. I swear before God. He was
dressed in shiny black tight- fitting overalls which looked to be plastic but
was not plastic. who was very much human in appearance with pale skin and had
long straight white hair. He said nothing but continued smiling and blinking, blinking probably for my
benefit to show that this was not a picture but a real life image of him.
Not a word was said to help me understand why he came and why the light. But he is what we term alien, a
Nordic. So that was his last experience. Though Wayne does report quite a few
psychic experiences and he believes this is one of the reasons he was contacted by ETSs and eventually he decided to go
public. As Wayne says, I have had numerous encounters and experiences from
other beings. This is absolutely truthful. No exaggeration but as it
occurred. He did at one point try to go under hypnosis but it was not successful. So he just has the
encounters that he remembers. And as he says, I have so often kept things to
myself out of fear of what others may think. I am sharing these stories because I believe it is near time that
things must come out and be discussed openly. I only want to share what I have learned and experienced and through this
bring a little better understanding of those we class as alien. I do know for
sure they the aliens as we call them mean us no harm but are here to help us
in becoming a much better people a much better humanity. An amazing series of
experiences by any measure. I like that case because he's a good witness, a
security guard. So many security guards have encounters but also a minister, very wellrespected, a family man. Uh and
I think his case is important because he's very lucid about it. Never went
under hypnosis. Tried but recalled his experiences primarily fully consciously.
This is true with every case in this compilation. So again, you can try to explain these cases away as false
memories produced by hypnosis, but it would not be accurate because none of these people used hypnosis and had fully
conscious encounters. So there you go. Try to explain that away. Let's move to
the next case. This one is also super interesting. didn't get a whole lot of
attention uh here in the United States, but certainly was fairly widely publicized
when it occurred. I call this one invited, the onboard UFO encounter of
Antonio Kant. This occurred on January 18, 1978 in Luciana. This is in Visenza,
Italy. And this is another extraordinary case involving a gentleman who received
an ET artifact. And it's just a really interesting encounter in some other ways
considering what actually happened to him when he was on board this craft.
This case comes from Italian researcher Paulo Fiorino and was published both in
UFO Universe the October November 1991 issue and the Italian publication UFO
Revisista de Infoion Euphologica number 38 and in the July August 1989 issue of
the international UFO reporter and actually in many other publications.
was 11:30 p.m. on January 18, 1979 as the primary witness, Antonio Kant, a
42year-old man who worked as a woodcutter, was driving his Renault automobile through the Luciana area of
Visenza, Italy, when, without warning and by no actions of his own, his car
came to a sudden stop. The lights went out and the car doors opened by themselves. Needless to say, this
astonished him. But even more astonishing, ahead of him on the road, he saw a large quote orange ball with a
flattened base. Immediately a door slid open on the side of this sphere, and a humanoid
about three feet tall, very slender, wearing a copper colored, scaly looking
metallic uniform, leaped out. Immediately behind it, a second
identical looking figure followed. The witness at this point got out of his car
and stared in absolute amazement, leaning against his car, as he says,
quote, "In order not to faint from fright, it was at this point the beings
began to approach him. He wanted to run away, but found that he was absolutely paralyzed by fear or otherwise, he is
not sure." Now, when these little figures got closer, Antonio could see that they had long hands, looked like
they ended with pointed nails. Where their ears would be, he saw what looked like twisted wires which appeared to be
vibrating and humming. And he says these beings began to gesture at him, inviting
him in a very friendly way to go on board the craft. And he was convinced by
this that they meant no harm. And he saw what he described as a quote friendly
sparkle in their eyes. So of his own valition, he walked up to the door of this craft and entered.
These little beings followed him inside and Antonio now found himself inside a very small room about 6 ft wide and he
says it was filled with electronic looking gadgets that he really couldn't describe. They were on all four sides at
about waist level upwards. There was also what looked like a computer-like screen with quote luminous balls on it
that were following a horizontal path. In front of him was another glowing glass screen behind which he saw
additional figures. He really didn't have time to observe anything else because at this point one of the two
beings approached him and began to undress him. First taking off his jacket
and then starting to unbutton his shirt. This frightened Antonio. He began to
resist them, trying to make them understand using gestures that it was cold outside. He didn't want to undress,
that he wanted them to leave him alone. Now, it was at this point the other being gestured or signaled in some way
at the one attempting to undress Antonio. And the being undressing Antonio touched the wall. And this is so
strange. A metallic suit just like the ones the beings were wearing appeared.
And Antonio had the distinct impression that the beings wanted him to put this suit on. This frightened him even more.
In fact, it frightened him so badly his legs gave away and he fell to the floor and began imploring the beings to just
let him go. This point, one of the beings opened a kind of drawer and lifted out a very small metallic box
which seemed to have writing on it or he was writing something on it. This was Antonio's impression. then signaled the
witness to put it around his neck, actually handed it to him. It was at that moment a door opened on the side of
the craft, and the witness, very relieved and still holding this small box-shaped object that the ETSs had
given him, crawled out of the UFO on his hands and knees. He said his legs were
shaking so badly that he was unable to stand up. Once he got out of the craft,
he laid down on the ground, completely overcome. Immediately, the environment
around him was plunged into darkness, and he realized that this glowing spherical craft had disappeared. His car
headlights immediately came back on. It took him quite a few minutes to calm down, but then Antonio went back to his
car and drove home. Arriving home, Antonio's mother immediately noticed his frightened expression and asked him what
was wrong. But Antonio found that he was still in such a state of shock that he
was unable to even talk about what had happened to him. He did take this object given to him by the ETSs and hid it in a
little crack in the wall. The next morning he met with a friend who found
him still distraught and his friend encouraged him to explain what happened and this is when Antonio revealed his
story. Now living in this small village, news spread very quickly about his
ordeal and Antonio found himself the object of ridicule and scorn with some
people calling him crazy or a drunk or a liar or mentally ill. Those who knew him
best though did testify for his honesty, sincerity, and mental stability. The
police were called. They interviewed the witness. They became convinced he was telling the truth. And this is where the
case ends. What happened to the alleged ET artifact remains unknown. Apparently,
the witness, because of the way he was treated, refused any further interviews or
examinations. I really feel for Antonio. That was clearly a traumatic experience
for him. But even more traumatic was the reaction afterwards. All the ridicule
and scorn that was heaped upon him. So unfair. So many people having these
encounters, I think we should, you know, treat witnesses with respect and take a
serious interest in their case and study it without bias, without preconceptions.
I think if that had been done, this case would have held a lot more potential to
answer a lot of these questions surrounding this subject and we would have found out what happened to this
apparent ET artifact, which as you can see, we don't know what happened to it.
Such a shame cuz there was such potential in that case. This happens over and over again.
This subject is still not treated with the seriousness it deserves. It's one of the reasons I do this research and put
out these episodes. So, let's move to another really extraordinary case. I
call this one the messages from the ETSs. The onboard UFO encounter of Roger
R. This involves a very young witness, 10 years old, who had a fully
unconscious encounter that was incredibly complex.
uh interactive with a whole lot of information. And while the witness is
quite young, he was given information that his father, who is also a
contactee, was able to corroborate, which really in effect proved the
validity of his case. And it was also professionally researched by an experienced investigator, which raises
the level of credibility. You can make up your own minds about it. Pretty sure
you haven't heard of this case before. I know I hadn't. So, that alone makes it pretty darn interesting. But, as you'll
see, yes, incredibly extensive. This one occurred on April 29, 1989 in Orlando,
Florida. And wow, is it a strange one. This case was thoroughly researched by a
Florida based muon field investigator, Jim Greenan, who you can see here. He's
also the state section director at that time. And the primary witness is a
10-year-old boy by the name of Roger R. He is anonymous. At the time, he lived
with his mother, stepfather, also an experiencer, and his younger brother. He
is a fan of Star Trek. And on the night of April 19, 1989, at 11 p.m., he had
just finished watching the show, it ended, and he was sent to bed. And per
Roger, sometime in the middle of the night, a weird sound that sounded like voices woke him up. Sitting up in bed,
he could hardly believe his eyes. He saw four entities. He said they were each about five and 1/2 ft tall. They had
bald kind of heart-shaped heads, giant dark eyes, no real nose, just two holes,
and a slit for a mouth, and a kind of goldish brown skin complexion. They
pulled him out of bed and placed him on this weird floating platform that was in
his room. They clearly had brought it in there. It was opaque, white, kind of glass-like and per Roger about 2 ft wide
and 6 ft long. So after these beings placed him on this platform, they began
to move it towards the closed windows and they started to actually open the window at which point Roger told them
that there was a security alarm and if they opened the windows, this alarm would go off. The beings assured him
telepathically that it would not go off and they proceeded to open the windows, take off the screen, and guided Roger,
still on the platform, out the window. Of course, the alarm did not go off. Roger found himself being carried along
the side of the apartment and out to a small field next to the apartment. He
could now see that there was a smalish craft sitting in the field. He described it as looking like two plates placed end
to end. A door swung open on the side. He said it was flat and lined with
lights and kind of formed a ramp up into the interior. And at this point, Roger's memory lapsed
briefly, and he doesn't remember going inside the craft. Again, another example of what researchers called doorway
amnesia. His next memory is finding himself inside the craft in a small room, which had a black glass table with
what looked like buttons on it. He said, "On one side of the room, there was what looked like a control panel with a large
screen above it. One of the beings pressed a button on the table which caused the floor of this craft to light
up. Then another one of the beings pressed a button on the control panel along the wall. And this really
surprised Roger because the screen showed the outside of the craft and Roger saw that the craft was now moving
straight upwards. He was surprised because he could feel no sensation whatsoever of any movement. And this is
when the beings began to speak telepathically to Roger, asking him what he was. Roger said he was a human boy.
They asked his name and he told them. They told him that they knew his parents. They took him to another room
showing a moving image of his friend Nancy in what looked to Roger like a hospital. They said they couldn't show
him the whole film because equipment was causing some interference. He asked them
where Nancy was and they told him that she was on another ship and that this
was her last lifetime and she would not be reborn because she had already been born too many times. They said that
people are reborn a thousand times and that some of them meaning the ETSs also
incarnate on Earth. They then gave him some predictions. Told him his mother was going to get a highpaying job.
Actually showed him the building. They showed him many things. A boy he did not know. Another young girl going into a
ship. They told her him that they were studying her. They took him to another
room. This point, Roger noticed a small red orb following him. He said another
device floated over to him and appeared to take a skin sample from his finger.
Roger at this time had a few sores on his body. He is a 10-year-old rambunctious kid, but he found that all
his sores were healed. They then had him push a button on a device. He asked them why, and they
said that this was to take a blood sample. They showed him another man sitting on a table who was also
apparently being examined. They then took him to yet another room. He felt a
kind of weird vibration and a door opened and he now saw that this smaller
craft had apparently been placed inside a much larger craft which he described
as being four times the size of his own apartment building. Said it was mostly white inside. They removed his clothes.
They gave him a red suit to wear, which he said clung to his skin and had weird hieroglyphic like symbols on it. said a
new reddish orb started floating over him, sending down occasional beams of light onto him, which the ETSs explained
was scanning him. The ETSs then told him that they are able to present any appearance they want to people, but that
the form that he was looking at was their true form. They told him that they are not only contacting him, but his
three-year-old brother. They showed him a weird map. They said that they contacted a man in Alaska but had to
leave him alone when the man tried to shoot at them and called them the devil. They explained that they are peaceful
people. Now Roger's father, again a contactee, had recently bought books by
Shirley Mlane and the book Communion by Whitley Strieber a few weeks before this
experience that Roger is now describing. Roger's father had found the books moved and rearranged and hidden. And Roger's
father thought that Roger was responsible for this. But now the ETSs
told Roger that it was actually them who had purposefully hidden the book by Shirley Mlane as the contents were not
accurate. They told him that she had written this for money. They then said
that they had actually rearranged the book Communion, opening it specifically to page 112 and leaving it open on the
bookshelf because they wanted his father to read this page. They said that they
had to leave quickly because they didn't want their father to see them at that point. They now showed him something
else which was astonishing. They showed an image of his father going into Roger's room and checking on him
sleeping in bed. And they told Roger that this was happening now at the present moment. That Roger was both on
the ship and at home at the same time, that they had this ability. This is
interesting because so many contactees talk about having an hour's long experience like Roger did and being
returned only minutes later. So that's apparently what's going on here. At one point, Roger said he was taken to a
closetized room where a red laser-like light scanned over his body.
uh some of these events aren't perhaps in the correct order because a lot happened. At one point they asked him
what he would like to do with his life and he said he wanted to go skiing and they showed him a very lifelike image of
him skiing at age 13. He said it was so real he could actually feel the cold from the snow. They showed him something
else, an incident at Daytona Beach, which had occurred much earlier where
his father had almost gotten into a car accident. And they said that they had actually swerved the vehicle themselves
to prevent this accident. And they said that the plane that Roger's father saw
was actually their craft. Now, Roger's father later verified these events as
being 100% true. This is a very complicated experience. Many other
events happened. Roger described seeing other ETs. At one point, they took him to a room with alien looking animals and
what appeared to be glass cages. They also told him, this is interesting, that the history teachers were teaching him
at school was not true, and that at one time people actually lived on Mars, that
another planet in the solar system had been destroyed in a terrible catastrophe, and that it it is now part
of the asteroid belt. And they said that they were responsible for bringing people to live on Earth. They also
showed him images of a room in what he perceived to be NASA because he saw the words NASA where aliens were being
examined and autopsied by scientists. This was the most upsetting segment of
his experience. Said it was the worst part. Uh they also told Roger that his father was a contact dean was being
taken and that this was the reason he often woke up tired and that at this point he did not remember these events
but that in time he would. Finally after a few more events Roger was returned to
the smaller craft. It landed on the same spot in this field or hovered just above
it. Roger was placed on the same weird platform which floated him this time to
the front door of the apartment. They brought him inside and put him back in bed. Now, Roger woke up the next morning
with full memory of this. He also noticed that there was a black government car parked outside. Now, per
Roger's father, he noticed that following this experience, many government helicopters were flying
around the house. He also said that two weeks before this incident, he saw a man wearing a dark suit looking into his
window. He rushed outside, saw the man actually jump the fence of the property,
jump into a car which was waiting for him, and drove off. So researcher Jim
Greenan of course interviewed all the witnesses, got character references for
both Roger and his father, interviewed his mother, friends, co-workers, and
became absolutely convinced of the veracity of this case. He writes, "This
case is considered an unknown of great significance because the 10-year-old boy apparently had no memory block while on
board two UFOs, and his father seems convinced he could not have made it up."
The father said they showed him many things about the past that the boy could not have known normally. A truly amazing
case. And I know skeptics will say, "Listen, he's just a young kid. He's a fan of Star Trek. watched Star Trek that
night before he had his experience. This must have been a dream. Not so sure that holds water because of the information
this child received certainly matches up with many other cases is well beyond I
think the ability of a 10-year-old to make up and most importantly his father is a contactee as
well and says that some of the information given to this child is
absolutely true and could not have been known by him. So that brings a whole new
aspect to this that is very very hard to explain away as simply a child's
imagination or a dream or sleep paralysis or anything like this. So
there's a lot to learn I think from this particular case. Wish I could talk to this witness. It's been some years since
he's had this encounter. It would be interesting to know if the predictions given to him by the ETSs came true.
Don't know. But again, another important addition to this really massively
growing database of people who claim to have been taken on board
ETcraft. All right, let's move to our last and final case in this bunch. This one is another one of my favorites. All
of these to me are so interesting, but this one is particularly profound. I call this one cured of
depression. The onboard UFO encounter of Jade. This involves a young teenager who
was suffering from severe depression prior to his experience. And as you'll
see, this encounter really affected him majorly, transformed him, and cured his
depression. This one occurred on November 27, 1990 in Plymouth,
Minnesota. It was investigated very thoroughly and I think you'll find this
case of particular interest because he remembers this fully consciously and in
in incredible detail. This very poignant case comes from muon field investigator
Craig R. Lang. You can see him here. It involves a man by the name of Jade. He
is anonymous. He was 16 years old at the time of his encounter. later employed as
a freelance graphic artist and draftsman. Immediately prior to his encounter, he was suffering from some
pretty severe depression. And in fact, he had been hospitalized, released, and
given a prescription of Prozac. Some weeks later, around 8:00 p.m. on November 27,
1990, Jade had a huge fight with his parents. This caused him to become depressed. He left the house and walked
over to a girlfriend's house and to the house of another friend, but neither of them were home, so he was still
depressed and was walking back to his home, feeling quite upset. He was heading west on 45th Street at the
intersection of Larch, which you can see here. He was keeping his eyes on the ground when he s felt a sudden sense of
disorientation. Looking up, he was shocked to see that his surroundings did not look familiar. He quickly reoriented
himself and he realized that he was now facing eastbound, going away from his house. Also, it was a very cold night.
He now felt strangely warm, as if he had just stepped out of a warm room. But
most significantly, he noticed a strange sense of positivity. His previous depression had
vanished. He felt in a real good mood. He ran home. His parents were still
angry with him, but weirdly he didn't care as he felt something very profound had happened to him that lifted his
depression. But as of yet, he had no memory of what. Following this, he did
begin suffering from insomnia. And it was some months later, he started having vivid flashbacks of seeing the
silhouette of a dark circular object hovering over his head and shining down a very bright light. You can see the
drawing of that he produced. And it was one day shortly later he was attending a youth group at his church when the
coordinator asked everyone to discuss when they first quote felt God. Jade
instantly thought of that night when he was severely depressed from the fight with his parents and this light shone
down on him lifting his depression and he talked about that and this seemed to
open a doorway to his memories really break down the walls of amnesia of what had happened and he began having dreams
about this event which he realized was much more than dreams and that this was much more than just a sighting. And over
the next few years, dreams and flashbacks filled out fully what had
happened on that momentous November night. So what here is what Jade says
happened to him. Feeling depressed, quite cold, he was walking slowly home, trying to avoid dragging his feet
through the freshly fallen snow, when suddenly a circle of light shone down on him at an angle. Looking up, he saw it
was coming from a dark oval object hovering a short distance away, apparently over nearby Schmidt Lake. He
said it was no more than 100 ft high, but it quickly moved straight over him,
lowering to about treetop level and becoming blindingly bright. In fact, it
was so bright he had trouble looking at it. He covered his eyes and looked down, but peered back up. He could see it was
about 20 to 30 feet long, maybe six feet wide, and he could see that the light
was actually coming from the center of this object. Now, the next thing he recalls
is he's inside this object. He's fully alert, but unable to move, and he felt
someone pulling him backwards into a dark room, very large, black or dark
blue in color with rounded walls and a domed ceiling. He felt as if someone was
dragging him from behind by his chest. He was pulled about 4 feet onto a table
or a platform in the center of the room which rose from the floor. It was cold
and hard with a sort of smooth slippery texture that he found difficult to describe. Kind of like plastic, he said,
covered with chrome, smooth and rounded and squarish in shape. Quote, almost
like a large pan. He said it seemed to contour to his body, rising up for the
back and legs as if to prevent sliding. He said a cone of light shone down on
him from above, narrowing as it came down towards his body. He saw a weird
quote mobile like object within the light sort of hanging down. He said it
was solid black and structured with several different branching posts which ended in black spheres. but yeah
reminded him of kind of a child's mobile. Jade now found himself lying on his right side facing a strange being.
He could see it only from the chest upwards. And the first thing he noticed was the being's eyes, which he said were
shaped mostly like a normal person's eyes, but slightly Asian-looking and much larger and very penetrating. He
said that there were whites in the eyes, but the pupils were much larger than a normal person's. And he also saw or
sensed another identical looking creature on the other side of the table. He said that they had large bald heads
that flared out backwards from the temples, prominent cheekbones, and a very small chin, and that they had a
slightly yellowish cast to their complexion. He said their faces looked strangely hollow, and he wondered
briefly if it could have been a mask. He didn't notice that their hands had fewer fingers than a normal person's. said
both were wearing gray jumpsuits, one with a V-neck. Said the texture of these jumpsuits looked kind of like thinly
brushed leather with a metallic appearance. Looking around the room, he noticed a cylindrical post to his right,
which contained a kind of mechanical arm, rectangular with a beveled edge, two to three feet long, 6 in wide, and
was extending towards him. On the underside of it, it had two dull prongs
of unequal lengths, quite short. He also noticed what seemed to be like pillars
around the outer edge of the room. He thinks there may have been a third entity standing there holding a
cylindrical type object into a hole in one of the pillars. He also saw a port
hole or window he could see outside and he did also see what appeared to be a
control panel of some sort. It had no buttons or lights, but jutted out like a table, so he assumed this was a panel of
some kind. He didn't notice a few open doorways or openings between the pillars
leading to apparently other rooms. And on the floor, he saw what looked like a dark hole or an opening of some kind.
So, at this point, the beings were holding him still with their hands. One grabbed the bill of his baseball cap,
which he wore backwards, pulled it off. The other one behind Jade braced his
head and neck while the one in front of him had his hand on Jade's shoulder.
They then proceeded to speak to him telepathically. The one facing him looked deep into his eyes and mentally
asked him, "Who are you and why are you so depressed?" Now although Jade did not
recognize this being he says he felt a very strong sense of relationship with him and he felt that they were very much
sympathetic to his feelings of depression. The beings then seemed to turn to each other and he thought were
communicating with each other. He sensed that there might be a disagreement or
some sort of discussion concerning him and that's really all he can remember.
The next thing he recalls is being back on the street, finding himself facing the wrong direction, feeling warm
despite the cold outside and his depression completely gone. When he started having dreams and flashbacks of
being taken on board a craft and being examined by the bigeyed short figures and having insomnia, he decided to
contact Muon. He did admit to a prior interest in UFOs and had read material
on the subject. And while the investigator Craig Rang was convinced of
the authenticity of his case, he did raise the possibility that Jade's prior
reading on this subject may have contaminated his recall of what happened
to some extent. There was one detail that was difficult to reconcile because Jade had recall of being at another
location near Schmidt Lake just west of I494. At this location, which does
exist, there is a large metallic spherical building which is used as a
test lab by a local aerospace engineering company. It's a very
technological location, which is interesting because ETSs do show an interest in human technology, but
whether this somehow fits in with his November 27 experience or is perhaps another separate encounter remains
unclear. Now, as of the time of the investigation into this case in which was in
1997, Jade reports that his health is fine and that since his encounter, he no
longer suffers from depression and feels that this encounter cured him of his
depression. How amazing is that? I always love it when an artist is having
experiences because they're able to make drawings that really accurately describe
what they experience. It's often been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. I think that's especially true
when it comes to UFO encounters because it's so hard for people to use words to describe what they've experienced when
having a UFO encounter. So, this is an important case in that regard alone. but
also I think is a real accurate representation of what it's like to go on board a ET craft. While it can be
quite scary, ultimately he feels this was a fully benevolent and positive
experience. And I think these seven cases that I presented today really give
an accurate crosssection, a representation of what it's like to be taken on board a UFO.
So this I think is a phenomenon hate that word an experience that should be
taken much more seriously. It's not as Jaylen Heinik said it's really not part
of the scientific method to ridicule people and treat them so
heinously. Uh and I think that's so true. Uh these are important
experiences. They have a lot to teach us. A lot of people are having these experiences and again as you can see
they're happening all over the world. It's been going on for a very long time and to me they're just incredibly
fascinating. I said it at the beginning of this episode but I think it bears repeating. These cases while they may be
controversial still represent the cutting edge of UFO research. Pretty
much everything we know about extraterrestrials, who they are, where they come from, and why they're here,
comes from one single source, and that is the people who have had these experiences. It's not from, you know,
government scientists who have never had an experience or really haven't even done research. You know, these pundits
on TV talking heads who are speculating wildly about what's going on here.
Certainly not coming from our intelligence agencies who have a very long and heinous history of lying about
the subject. It's coming from the contactees. So we should take them seriously. I think there are a lot of
them. Most remain completely silent and private about their experiences because
of this really hostile climate of fear and ridicule and skepticism. Thankfully
that's changing. This subject is going mainstream. people are taking this subject seriously and I think we're at a
turning point where, you know, this could actually result in disclosure at
some point. I don't know. I'm kind of of two minds about that. Not sure our governments will ever fully disclose,
certainly not voluntarily. But on the other hand, I think it's inevitable that the truth will come out. And maybe one
day we'll have open official contact. Who knows? Either way, the future should be pretty interesting. Thanks very much
you guys for tuning in. Truly appreciate it. It's because of you I do these
episodes. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions, keep
searching for the truth, and most important of all, keep having fun. I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
