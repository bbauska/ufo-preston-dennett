Jul 29, 2022
While UFO sightings are undeniably interesting, even more fascinating are accounts of actual contact. Missing time, face-to-face contact with ETs, onboard encounters -- these kinds of cases provide deep insights into what it's like to have an extraterrestrial experience. 

This video presents five extraordinary cases of UFO contact. Each case is different and shows just how truly strange, bizarre and enlightening it can be to have a close-up encounter with beings from other worlds.

CASE ONE: I DID NOT EXIST FOR A DAY
In the summer of 1973, a wall street executive flew by 747 from Hawaii to his home in New York City. During the flight, he was shocked to see a metallic saucer outside the window, pacing the jet. At first, he thought it was just a simple sighting. It wasn't until he got home and received a huge shock that he realized his encounter was far more than just a sighting.

CASE TWO: THE ABDUCTION OF TOM MURILLO
One evening in 1976, New Mexico resident Tom Murillo took a drive to cool off after a family quarrel. Parking alongside a remote country road, he was approached by a strange tall figure. Moments later, he found himself being levitated inside a tube of light into a UFO craft. Inside, he was undressed, placed on a table and examined by gray ETs. But it's what they did next that left him stunned. And after being placed back in his car, Tom realized that he had just undergone the most profound and unusual experience of his life.

CASE THREE: MISSING TIME IN MOUNDHOUSE
One night in April of 1996, Paul (pseudonym), was driving to his home in Dayton, Nevada. Just after passing through the small desert town of Moundhouse, he saw a brilliant light ahead of him. Very quickly the light grew in size and landed alongside the highway, revealing itself to be an enormous saucer-shaped craft. Two tiers of windows lined the circumference. Looking through the windows, Paul saw more than a dozen strange figures looking down at him. Some were grays, but some were much stranger beings. And then they began to communicate with him, initiating an encounter that would alter the path of his life forever.

CASE FOUR: CONTACT IN TONOPAH
On the evening of July 21, 2009, four friends (James, Henry, Heather and Jamie) decided to go UFO hunting in the deserts outside of Tonopah, Arizona. They had heard of recent sightings in the area and were hoping to have one themselves. Little did they realize that they were about to have a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials. Without warning, a gigantic triangular-shaped craft hovered overhead and then landed in front of them. A panel opened, and out stepped two strange humanoids, a short gray alien and an eight-foot-tall being. The two ETs began to communicate telepathically with the witnesses, giving them a dire warning to share with all humanity. James was able to videotape the entire encounter. After the craft departed however, the military showed up and surrounded their vehicle. Their lives, they knew, would never be the same.

CASE FIVE: IS GRANDPA AN ALIEN?
In 1955, five-year-old Marty Minetto was spending time with his grandparents in their home outside of Ault, Colorado. On April 9, Marty's grandfather approached him and asked him if he'd like to go for a walk and have a great adventure. Marty agreed. The next morning, Marty and his grandfather left the farmhouse and walked out into the remote fields by their home. To Marty's amazement, a large glowing egg-shaped craft dropped from the sky and landed in front of them. Moments later, a human-looking man stepped out and invited them both onboard. Marty's grandfather explained that it was time for Marty to learn about who his grandfather really was. So began an incredible onboard encounter during which Marty was given a tour of the craft and learned many secrets about the people inside it. It was the first of several other encounters that finally answered some of the strange mysteries surrounding his unusual grandfather.

These five true cases of UFO contact are just a few of the many accounts that are occurring all across our planet. We are not alone in this universe. We have never been alone.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today's episode is called is grandpa an alien and four other true cases of ufo 
i've had a couple of you request that i do readings from some of my books so i thought about that's what i would do today i've picked out five cases from various books that i think are 
a little bit different more extensive unusual and have something to contribute 
to our understanding of the ufo phenomenon and these five cases are among my favorite 
so i will be basically doing a little reading of an excerpt from various books 
so let's just get started and the first case i'd like to talk about i call i did not exist for a 
day and this is from my book ufos over new york it's a very unusual case involving missing time
in the summer of 1973 street executive frank hoffman pseudonym 
was returning home to new york from a business convention in hawaii via a 747. 
when he looked out the window he was shocked to see a glowing red ufo pacing the jet 
nobody else saw it and after five seconds it disappeared frank was amazed but he remained 
silent about his sighting and continued to flirt with the lady who sat next to him 
he returned home and the next date he had a date with the lady he met on the plane 
she was also from new york and they agreed to go out for dinner that night frank arrived 
at her east end avenue apartment that evening however his date it turned out was very upset 
she asked him why had he broken the date he told her that she was wrong he hadn't broken the date 
he was exactly on time she disagreed and showed him a newspaper and pointed to the date frank 
was shocked it was fully 24 hours later than it should have been he was missing for one entire day 
when frank returned to work his co-workers also demanded to know where he had been the previous 
day they had made several calls to his residence but nobody answered frank had no explanation 
nor any memory of what happened during the missing 24 hours his only theory 
was that it had something to do with the ufo he had seen the day before while flying on the 747 
as he says and i quote it was as though i did not exist for a day
so as you can see that is a very very strange case now we move on to the next case and this second 
case i call the abduction of tom murillo this comes from my book ufos over new mexico and this 
case was originally investigated by researcher kenneth ring and it's a pretty interesting case
one evening in 1976 tom murillo then a 39 year old heavy equipment operator got into a family 
quarrel and decided to drive out onto the prairie southwest of the small new mexico town where he 
lived he parked his truck and left the radio on as he walked around the truck to cool down 
at some point he heard a rustling sound in the surrounding sagebrush says tom i looked 
up to see a tall figure i called out and got no answer to which i started calling him bad words 
the figure backed out of view and tom sensed that something was wrong and started to get back 
into his truck unfortunately he was too late as he says and i quote i heard this whirling 
noise above me to which i couldn't move at all as an elevator formed a tube engulfed me 
and i was raised up into the spacecraft where i was inserted into some kind of tube-like space i 
floated through some kind of passage which took me to a big room where i landed on a glass-like table 
tom lay on this table unable to move any part of his body except his eyes shortly later 
four seven foot tall gray-skinned aliens walked in they had hands with three fingers and were 
wearing a quote flexible armor type suit with quote strange helmets that covered their faces 
these four ets first observed tom they then undressed him and began a physical examination 
using a scanning device that formed a ring around the table and his entire body as tom 
says all the data picked up by the scanning device was fed into a strange shaped 
gray screen where i was fortunate to see my insides my heart my stomach and other parts 
i just lay there as they examined me i felt scared but sensed that they were not out to harm me 
i could pick up somehow some thought waves of a friendly nature they were friendly
so the et's expressed real interest in the fact that tom had 10 fingers and toes 
and during this examination they repeatedly returned to re-examine his fingers although 
the et's seemed friendly tom sensed that his frightened state allowed very little communication 
after this lengthy physical examination the et's conversed among themselves 
they then lifted tom from the table quickly dressed him in his clothes and inserted him 
back into the same tube-like elevator that they had used to draw him into the craft 
moments later tom found himself quote set free on solid earth to find myself with no sense of 
direction whatsoever so having no idea where he was tom looked around and saw that he was 
in the same prairie where he had parked his truck he then saw moonlight glinting off the windshield 
of his truck and as he says i then broke to pieces as my whole body shook uncontrollably 
i cried oh god why me i couldn't calm myself as i cried like a baby i was still shaking a lot 
but finally started my truck it died on me several times until i started crying again i finally half 
controlled myself and started the truck and made it home i don't know but i did get home 
now moving on to the third case that i'd like to talk about i call this case missing time 
in mound house this is from my book ufos over nevada and it's a very very unusual case 
involving a gentleman who had an incredible encounter one that i've never quite heard 
like this before so let's just get started the witness to this testimony this case is anonymous 
i call him paul and as paul says this is a real true encounter and i do not wish to be known it 
has actually been a hard thing for me to deal with in my life paul is a resident of dayton in nevada 
it was around 11 pm on an april night in 1996 when paul who was 25 years old 
was returning home to retrieve his guitar and then spend the night jamming with his friend chris a 
hopi native native american back in town so paul was driving on highway 50 east near mound house 
nevada and was listening to the radio he had just passed the virginia city exit when he noticed four 
extremely bright white blue lights flying about 50 feet over the mouth of a small canyon he thought 
at first it was a jet flying much too low until he realized that the lights were actually hovering 
they lit up the sagebrush on the hill bright as day he said reminding him of stadium lights 
he was confused to see something moving around underneath the object and as he got closer he 
realized that the object was neither a plane nor a helicopter and in fact it appeared to be 
a ufo and jokingly he said out loud haha you know i can see you and at that exact moment 
the lights began to move towards the highway as if to head him off at the mountain pass 
paul noticed at this time that there were no other cars on the highway his heart was racing fast but 
he was both frightened and curious his radio which was playing loudly now became filled with static 
as he approached the pass a small embankment blocked out his view of the object but as he 
crested the pass he was amazed to see that the lights had landed on the side of the highway this 
object was about 20 feet away and he could now clearly see that it was a solid craft as paul says 
i was gazing into the middle of a set of windows i was staring straight into a spacecraft from 
another world it was indeed a saucer there were long windows draping all the way across and around 
i saw the tears or stories the floors i saw the walls everything inside was white 
paul was shocked and as he says this was real i was mesmerized this was incredibly astounding 
i had no clue what to think or anything all i could do was stare and observe 
and paul was even more shocked when he noticed that there were humanoid figures looking back 
at him through the windows the first ones he saw were behind the left bottom window and as 
paul says they were all wearing white robes there was a female she had a bracelet and a necklace on 
gold or silver and makeup like blush on her cheeks her arm was on the shoulder of a younger one 
a boy and they were looking right at me right into my eyes she nudged to him and spoke to the other 
younger children along the window maybe ten or so more they were all smaller like a five-year-old 
she was talking to the older boy and them without speaking and to me 
i felt a joyful feeling inside as they gazed into my eyes she then smiled and pointed at me 
as to show them that i understood her and them so paul described this female 
and the children as looking like the stereotypical gray e.t with grayish skin 
hands with three fingers and a thumb he said the eyes were large in almond shape 
though instead of pure black they appeared to have whites with irises of different colors 
including blue and green so while he was enjoying the telepathic rapport with the female e.t his 
attention was drawn to the second story windows and as paul says i looked up to the second story 
there were two beings there in the middle of the room one of them had a long enlarged skull 
and dark brown skin he wore a white robe and was holding what appeared to be a clipboard 
paul says that they briefly made eye contact at which point paul noticed that the being 
had blue irises this being appeared to be upset that they were being observed 
and he turned to another being which was different from the others according to paul 
this different being had a human-shaped skull which was hairless and covered with wrinkles 
as paul says and again i quote he was not in white he was wearing a black suit from what i could see 
he turned his face towards me right after the one with the clipboard looked at him after seeing me 
he turned his face to me oh my god was i scared he was so old looking that it sent shivers all over 
me his face was all wrinkled and old and his eyes were all beady they were pure black as he and i 
stared at each other in the eye i realized he was a man he was a human i was petrified i was scared 
he gave me this snarling look yet at the same time i could see his smarts there was some 
kind of big screen in front of him blinking at the outer rim of the windows edge on his floor 
he then looked directly at me raised up his hand with very long fingers and smiled or smirked as 
he hit a button on some kind of panel in front of him instantly says paul the windows covered them 
up with a fan-like shell that was like ripples of a chinese fan descending from the top so as these 
windows sealed up the object lit up with light surrounded circumference and began spinning paul 
heard a loud humming noise and watched as the object tilted at a 45 degree angle and spinning 
faster and faster slowly became almost transparent until suddenly darting straight up in the sky 
paul drove the rest of the distance down the hill which was about two minutes and then he 
pulled over and looking around him at this point he was shocked to see that it was already the next 
morning and the road was now busy with cars so he was now thoroughly confused and utterly exhausted 
and he continued his drive home and went to bed uh he has no memory of what happened between 11 
pm when he last saw the object and the next morning and when he found himself 
at the bottom of the hill he estimates that a period of at least nine hours had elapsed 
as paul says i cannot remember for the life of me there was nine hours that i cannot remember 
how could i be driving a car and be abducted that doesn't make sense i just drove down the hill and it was daytime what the hell happened to me i want to know 
kind of i'm kind of scared to find out i've only told a handful of people this story there's more 
to it as well in the days and the months that followed i will tell more if i get a chance 
so paul did report his case to both mufon and new fork the national ufo reporting center now for 
the fourth case the fourth case i call contact in tonipah this comes from my book ufos over arizona 
this case involves four witnesses one of whom reported his case to the mutual ufo network mufon 
it's quite an unusual case and i think you'll find it very interesting on the evening of july 
21st 2009 henry his friend james and each of their girlfriends heather and jamie drove to an 
area outside of tonopah not far from the palo verde nuclear power plant in arizona in hopes 
of seeing a ufo they had gone ufo hunting in this area before and had seen strange things in the sky 
they knew that some of the local residents had seen ufos there on a regular basis and some 
said that they were chased by ufos while driving their cars and as henry says this is a hot spot 
so this was about 10 miles away from luke air force base out in the desert 
and they were driving out in a dirt road in the middle of nowhere says henry 
when they saw a flashing light they drove closer and were able to approach within 250 yards of this 
light which now appeared to be a craft of some kind at this point their emotions were running 
high and as henry says all of us were scared but at the same time curious my friend's girlfriend 
was crying and telling us to turn around henry and james however were transfixed by the sight 
as henry says it was about the size of three football fields 
it was triangular in shape with windows around it was about three stories tall and thirty feet 
off the ground we flashed our lights and it flashed back in the same sequence of flashes 
my friend james and i got out and walked closer the closer we got the better we could make out 
what was standing in the windows and to their shock they saw two different types of alien 
figures including short figures with large heads and other figures around eight feet tall 
as they watched some of the windows which had been darkened lit up to reveal more alien figures 
now james was videotaping this entire event and as henry says i was terrified but excited 
at the same time we walked closer but had to stop because the heat coming from the craft was so 
intense the craft hovered and then landed a large panel at the bottom of the craft opened 
up and the two aliens proceeded to walk out this absolutely terrified us more but we couldn't move 
or talk i remember trying to scream and say run but we couldn't move or talk heather and 
jamie were in the car honking the horn screaming to come back but we couldn't respond or move the 
aliens walked up to within 20 feet of us one of them was very thin and tall about eight to nine 
feet and the other was about three to four feet we stood there in amazement and shock
so still unable to move henry and james had no choice but to wait for what would happen next and as henry says then a calmness came over us
they were speaking to us telepathically they were saying not to be scared they weren't going to harm us and this conversation went on between the four of us for 15 minutes 
they said they were there to help us so that we would not destroy our planet and that there was 
a horrible event coming soon that it had to be stopped james asked if it was something like 9 11 
and they said no bigger and it would be coming from the middle east so as he stood there henry 
suddenly recalled having been visited by these same et's earlier in his life as a young child 
one of these et's then confirmed this and told henry that they contacted him when he was just 
six years old and this conversation continued the et's said that they had been expecting them 
that they wanted henry and james to warn people about what would happen if humans didn't start taking care of their planet and as henry says visions of disasters 
entered our head as if to show us what was to come if we didn't warn people 
the taller alien walked closer and held my hand and i was no longer scared neither was james 
he said he would see him again soon and to warn people about saving our planet to both james and i 
at this point the conversation ended the et's turned around and entered the craft which departed 
in a split second henry and james who had recorded the entire event both fell to the ground in shock 
they immediately got to their feet and went back to the car the girlfriends were no longer crying 
but just hugged them they tried to start the car but at first the engine wouldn't turn over 
they sat there for about a minute when finally the car worked and they started to drive away when 
suddenly there was a bright spotlight on their car and three military helicopters appeared overhead 
seconds later there were five military jeeps following them the girls started crying while henry told james to hide the camera henry continued to drive away 
until somebody in one of the jeeps began to speak over a loudspeaker ordering them to pull over 
or they would be forced to shoot and as henry says we pulled over and military 
soldiers surrounded the car two men dressed in black opened the door and asked us to get out 
while the other men searched the car one man began to question the witnesses asking why they were in that area what they had seen how long they had been there if they had 
any contact with the alien craft they wanted to know the size of the craft the shape of the craft 
and if they had communicated with the ets henry and the others played dumb we answered 
no to everything says henry the men searching the car from the camera and after reviewing it 
confiscated the camera and told the witnesses that they were not to speak of the incident 
then one of these officials separated henry from the others and questioned him in the back of one 
of their vehicles and the man wanted to know if henry had any prior experiences with the ets henry 
denied this and the military officials dropped him off at a restaurant in tonopah near interstate 10 
and henry called james from there it was one month after the incident that henry reported his 
encounter to the national ufo reporting center writing and i quote it was a crazy night but i 
had to report this our evidence is gone but this really happened we questioned people who lived 
in the area and they all saw the craft and the military soon after so we aren't crazy and there 
are four of us who witness this along with the people who live in the area who saw the craft 
we talked to 15 people who lived in the area and all but one saw the craft and now for the final 
case the one that i really wanted to present to you today which i call is grandpa an alien 
this is excerpted from my book ufos over colorado and involves a witness by the name of marty mineto 
was a very poignant and interesting ufo encounter that he shared with mufon and i'd like to present 
this case to you because it is so unusual it doesn't matter whether you believe me or not 
says marty minetto the main witness to this case and then he adds it did happen 
on april 9 1955 marty who was then five years old was approached by his grandfather samuel during 
bedtime and his grandfather asked do you scare easily no marty replied his grandfather said 
are you a strong young man and not afraid of new things if i am with you and take care of you 
yes marty said his grandfather said i want you to go with me on a walk saturday and you will see 
great things but you are to tell no one you can never tell your mom or dad or brothers or sisters 
because it could hurt grandpa and grandma and they might have to move far away marty told his 
grandfather i would never tell his grandfather samuel hugged him and asked do you promise 
yes said marty so marty's grandfather samuel often shared special stories with marty 
that were for him and nobody else and many of these stories marty says he didn't understand 
other than that they were about great wonders and people from far off places and although marty had 
many siblings he shared a special bond with his grandfather and would never reveal his secrets
so samuel called for marty's grandmother and he turned to her and told her 
i am going to show the boy tomorrow so he understands what i've been telling him tell 
his mom we will be okay but we might be late getting home at this point marty's grandmother 
began crying and marty felt bad for her and asked what's wrong grandma and she said nothing and he 
said don't cry mama it's okay and she said i am crying because tomorrow you will know who you are 
this is a good thing tomorrow is going to be a wonderful day for you stay close to grandpa 
listen to him and just do what he says do not be afraid of some things you might see it's okay to 
always trust grandpa at this point she hugged marty and told him to go to bed and she warned 
samuel that only marty was to go and that none of his other siblings could go or know anything 
about this and of course marty's grandfather samuel agreed according to marty and i quote 
that night was hard to sleep as what lay ahead for me the next day kept me awake most of the night
so the next morning arrived and after breakfast marty's grandfather approached him and said 
are you ready to go for that walk marty was excited as he and his grandfather left their rural 
colorado farmhouse and walked down a dirt road eventually they left the farmhouse behind them 
and were surrounded by fields and suddenly marty was shocked to see a quote very large oval shaped 
object dropped down from the sky it glowed orange then turned bright white as it began to get low 
a tripod landing gear descended and the object landed on the road in front of them and it was close enough that he could feel the heat emanating from the craft 
and as this craft settled on the dirt road the wind blew fiercely kicking up a cloud of dust 
marty's grandfather samuel picked him up and said they're here son please don't be afraid they're 
my friends and yours trust grandpa as marty says i wasn't scared at all i don't know why but i wasn't 
so this craft according to marty was humming loudly his grandfather set marty down and 
said be kind and respectful stand where you are and don't move until i tell you 
at this point a door opened on the side of the object and two people walked out and moved toward 
them now at this point marty began to feel some fear his grandfather approached these men and 
began to speak a strange language unknown to marty they touched hands and shoulders and after a few 
minutes the two men and his grandfather approached marty and marty said what were you saying 
his grandfather said it is the old talk from where grandma and i came from 
and he pointed to one of the figures a man with a blue shirt and white pants and said this person 
is a friend of grandma's i want you to touch his hand and say hello to austino go with him and i'll 
meet you inside in a few minutes you will be okay no matter what don't speak until they tell you do 
you understand marty marty said yes and austino this man held out his hand which marty took 
and together they walked to the right side of the object where martic could see a large doorway 
and they went inside and inside marty was surprised to see that this object was huge 
much bigger on the inside than the outside and it was filled with numerous people engaged in all 
kinds of activity ostino led him up a ramp into a room that reminded marty of a doctor's office 
there were tables and lights and metallic walls another person picked marty up and put him on one 
of the tables he then placed this quote crown looking thing with two bent prongs on the top 
and then he put this thing on marty's head and marty felt a brief flash of pain and then 
was surprised to hear the man speaking do you understand what i am saying to you the man said 
yes marty replied the man asked would you like to see a great wonder your friends would like you to 
see your grandpa's home at this point marty felt a soft movement and asked austin if they were moving 
and austino said that yes in fact they had been moving for some time and would marty 
like to take a look around the ship with him marty said yes and as they walked around marty 
asked where his grandfather was ostino replied he is with friends and will be with us soon 
it was a short time later that marty's grandfather appeared his grandfather told ostino to go ahead 
and show marty the craft but only the safe areas so astino began to give marty a tour of this craft 
and marty was absolutely surprised by the sheer size of this craft which he 
estimates was as big as a football field on the inside and was filled with human 
looking people the craft he estimated was 40 feet high 120 feet long with two whitish pink decks 
so austino asked marty are you hungry or thirsty and marty replied could i have something to drink 
and as marty says he ostino went over to this wall put his hand on this thing and water filled 
this container i drank it and let me tell you it was great i could not believe how good it tasted 
he showed me if i pinched the glass in this spot watch what would happen i did and the 
glass turned cold marty says this liquid appeared to be water but tasted better 
and marty asked ostino holding this glass can i keep it austino replied no it has to stay here 
and next ostino showed him the engine room which made a low humming noise and he told marty that their engines ran on water and with the aid of earth's magnetic field and he 
said that one day the people on earth would learn how to use water and the magnetic fields of earth 
to power their vehicles and he explained that their own engines allowed them to go as fast or 
slow as they wanted and that they could slip into and out of time at will so even at that age marty 
was very impressed and he told ostino he wanted to become a pilot when he grow when he grew up 
and then he asked austino where do you come from austino replied we come from between 
my time and yours we come from a place here on earth but beneath your time in a different phase 
we are with you all the time you will learn more as you get older you are the first in a long time 
to come and know these things we are a good people and one day you will understand 
but not now let's go to your grandfather at this point they walked through the crowded 
hallways until they found marty's grandfather samuel who scooped marty up into his arms
at this point his grandfather pulled this helmet from his head and returned it to ostino marty 
speculates that this was a translator helmet that allowed him to communicate with these et's 
at that point there was a soft thump and suddenly marty found himself being carried outside the 
craft by his grandfather this ship was not still parked on the dirt road next to them at this point 
marty tried to talk with his grandfather about the flying object and the strange men but at this point the ship took off and his grandfather said be quiet say nothing and one day 
i will talk about it but if you say anything now the sheriff will take you away and you will not 
see your family again i will go to jail and your mom and dad too you can only talk to me about it 
if you need to talk you are to say papa will you read me a book
so it wasn't long before there was a second incident marty recalls only being released from the craft and greeted by his grandfather as marty 
says the next thing i remember i was standing in the road with my cowboy boots in my hand 
his grandfather was there and asked him do you know where you have been 
marty said i was right here and this plane landed and his grandfather said well the 
whole town is looking for you and he told marty that it was now 1 30 in the morning 
so they started to walk home when a car drove up followed by several others someone jumped out and ran to marty's grandfather and asked him are you samuel they asked 
and marty's grandfather said yes and i found him and soon there were cars and people everywhere 
marty kept his promise to his grandfather and told nobody where he and his grandfather had been but following these incidents marty did have several dreams about being inside 
he asked his grandfather about these experiences but his grandfather wouldn't answer 
only saying don't worry you are going to see something so wonderful it will change your life
so marty grew up and as an adult he had further onboard encounters 
which marty has not yet revealed other than to say what i've got to tell you would knock your socks 
off was many years later that marty's grandfather spoke more with marty about the second childhood 
incident as marty says just before my grandfather passed away we talked about that night and he 
said how he had found me he was walking to the shed and saw this very bright light on the road 
and went to see if one of the searchers had found me and he saw this thing lift into the air and in 
the light on the road he saw me standing there with my my cowboy boots in my hand 
marty's grandfather asked him why did you take your cowboy boots off marty replied they said 
i had to go and that i didn't have time to put them on as my feet needed to be dry first 
so marty still remembers watching this craft light up change colors and dart away in a flash 
and since this initial incidence these two incidents marty says he has seen 
the same craft at least five times not up close he says but always from a distance 
so despite his grandfather's admonishments to remain silent marty did later share his 
encounters with his family and the results were not good they accused him of lying or 
being crazy and 50 years later marty finally reported his sighting to mufon 
writing and i quote until now i have honored his wish but i am getting older and i felt i needed 
to tell someone i have so much more to tell but i just don't know if anyone believe would believe me 
before i pass away i felt i should tell someone thank you at least for reading this 
so that's it for today those five cases again are excerpted from various books 
ufos over new mexico ufos over new york ufos over colorado ufos over nevada and ufos over arizona 
i think each of these cases has similarities but each case is also unique and i hope you've 
enjoyed this episode today i truly appreciate you watching and until next time keep having fun.
