ETS TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO BUILD ENERGY-FREE MOTORS
May 23, 2020

Summary:
May 23, 2020
When people are taken onboard a UFO, they are often taken to the control room and told how the 
craft works, or are even put in the control seat and allowed to fly the craft themselves. In 
even rarer cases, the ETs provide specific instructions about how to build a UFO engine. This 
video presents almost a dozen cases in which ETs teach people how to build an electromagnetic 
motor. Some of the people have made remarkable progress. The results may surprise you.
If you'd like to know more, the dozen cases featured in this video are all presented in Chapter 
Ten of my book, NOT FROM HERE: VOLUME THREE. The chapter is called "If You Build It," and 
covers all the cases in detail.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and  today I'd like to talk to you about an area of  
UFO research that I think is not getting enough  attention and these are cases in which people  
are taken onboard a UFO and into the control  room and told how the UFO flies in some cases  
they actually put in the control seat and fly  the craft themselves they are told what type  
of energy powers these craft and in a few cases  are actually given instructions on how to build a  
UFO engine that's right they are actually given  the instructions on how to build a free energy  
motor so this is really nothing new reverse  engineering has been going on for a very long  
time we've got a number of whistleblower cases  coming from places like wright-patterson Air  
Force Base in Ohio area 51 in Nevada Edwards Air  Force Base in California but the problem is this  
information this technology is not being released  so it's my theory that ETS are doing what amounts  
to a grassroots movement and releasing this  information trying to to the general public  
because there are just so many cases and that's  what I want to talk about right now there's a  
really great case from researcher Jacque Malay  which took place in the summer of 1968 woman by  
the name of Helen was driving between Lompoc  and Los Angeles in California with her three  
friends an area of lots of UFO activity when they  experienced an abduction off of the highway they  
were pulled inside of a UFO she described seeing  a figure dressed in a white suit who took her to  
the control room and basically explained how the  craft works Helen came away from this experience  
obsessed with the idea of building a motor  and as Jacque fillet says it has become the  
central point for her and the goal of her entire  life and I have to tell you she's not alone and  
consider what happened to Whitley Strieber in  his book communion he describes an experience  
at age 13 in 1958 when he told his friend that  the spaceman had given him instructions on how  
to build an antigravity motor he doesn't remember  that conversation his friend told him that but  
he does remember trying to build their machine  he says he had collected harvested a number of  
electromagnetic electromagnets from old motors and  put together this little device where they would  
rotate plugged it in and suddenly it started  whirring and buzzing and all the electricity  
in the house began to drain all the lightbulbs  faded down to just a tiny little filament and the  
device suddenly exploded in a shower of sparks  and destroyed itself several of the lightbulbs  
in the house exploded at that time and that was  it except for the very next day that wing of the  
house mysteriously burned down now that may not  be a coincidence because Schreiber talks about  
another case that's somewhat similar but even  more dramatic involving a farmer who was also an  
abductor who found himself with these instructions  on how to build an anti-gravity motor so he did  
again involved counter-rotating magnets he put  them together with very precise instructions  
regarding distance and size of magnets and this  sort of thing and put in his barn turned it on  
at that point all the metal objects in his barn  came flying up towards the device and destroyed it  
he was actually hit in the head by an automobile  engine and knocked out and the next day the entire  
barn burned down so yeah a lot of cases like this  I did a research looking for them and I found a  
lot there was a case in 1974 involving a man who  was hiking in the Australian outback came upon  
a landed UFO and occupants who care explained to  him how their UFO engine worked he said that most  
of it really went to over his head it was some  type of engine he had never recognized before  
it had no propellants and no moving parts at all  another case occurred in summer of 1974 to a man  
who was boating at the mouth of Black Creek  on the st. Johns River in Florida he saw an  
orb he followed it and to the end of a channel  there and came upon this very low UFO a flying  
saucer metallic I was just a couple of feet over  the water and perfectly silent he called out to  
it asked to go on board ask for something to help  all humanity if they were truly from space he got  
no response and this thing moved off but following  this incident in the days and weeks and years that  
followed he kept having repetitive dreams about  building free energy motor and in fact went back  
to college and studied physics and put together  these plans which he submitted to some people who  
are knowledgeable in science and found it very  impressive he's still working at it as far as I  
know on my own book inside UFOs I present the case  of Jim cubile back who at age 21 in 1960 joined  
the Navy he was a navy electronics technician and  was stationed aboard the USS Valley Forge when he  
had a very dramatic encounter with UFOs he was on  deck smoking a cigarette when these bright light  
objects showed up he called out his crewmates  who also saw them about a group of 10 people  
at least he called the bridge and asked about  these strange lights the bridge denied seeing  
them so they were apparently covering it up the  next day none of the men who saw these UFOs even  
remembered it they apparently had missing time  he's finally asked every one and found a couple  
of the guys who were there who did remember  seeing the UFOs but what was really interesting  
is Jim remembered well is apparently an onboard  experience he recalled being inside these objects  
he thinks surrounded by human looking figures  and had a long conversation with them involving  
power sources on our planet they talked about how  power had evolved from the horse-drawn cart up  
through the automobiles and propellants and using  electricity solar power water power magnetism and  
they explained that our only limitations are  the ones that we place on ourselves they took  
him into that engine room showed him their engine  and told him he could build it himself and years  
later following this incident as a much older  man he had retired and decided he was going to  
try and build one of these things and ended up  taking a bicycle tire some magnets some pieces  
from a pinball machine and various odds and ends  in creating what amounts to a perpetual motion  
device it didn't turn forever this wheel but he  said it would turn for a number of days and just  
one push and was sort of along these veins again  of people being given instructions on how to find  
alternative sources of energy another great case  occurred in 1956 to a gentleman by the name of  
Virgil E a concern who was stationed at Port  Hueneme in Southern California he was driving  
along the coast highway with his girlfriend when  he picked up two young sailors he was shocked how  
youthful they looked they look so much alike they  look like brothers they told him that they were  
from the coos head Navy facility up in Oregon  Virgil didn't know about that but he gave the  
guys a ride dropped them off and it was only a few  seconds later moments later he had a very dramatic  
close up UFO sighting along with his girlfriend  he feels these sailors were somehow connected to  
it and that they were probably not sailors at all  but et's by coincidence he was about a year later  
stationed up at Coos Bay Naval facility where  he had a very strange experience of involving an  
apparent abduction he found himself on a gurney on  a table his head was put down in this weird device  
which actually projected his thoughts on a screen  all these four blue suited figures standing around  
into him questioned to him on energy sources such  as the gyroscope and things like this he came away  
from that experience absolutely obsessed with  building an energy free motor and ended up doing  
it to a certain extent he certainly got a patent  for it its patent number five zero eight eight  
nine four nine for an oscillation driven vehicle  that basically uses sound waves to propel itself  
may sound unusual but I'm telling you they're  her other cases another case comes from Yvonne  
Smith a great UFO researcher based in Southern  California her excellent book chosen features  
the case of John and Jesse Leung two brothers who  have had repeated abduction experiences John long  
has a high school education he didn't really  like school but came away from his experiences  
very interested in mechanics and building in  electromagnetic motor he actually self-taught  
himself on physics and mechanics and started  filing patents he panted and a motor using  
magnets counter-rotating magnets its patent  number six seven eight one two seven zero he  
invented something called an ellipsoid generator  which what she says is a dynamic a dynamo electric  
device that is highly adaptable to a broad range  of applications while providing robust to output  
an energy conversion in other words a magnetic  motor that's patent number six eight seven nine  
zero seven six he's patented other stuff he  once tried to patent a magnetic eccentric drive  
and was denied by the Patent Office and told he  might actually receive in order of secrecy from  
the government and that his invention might  actually be declared secret and shut down so  
what he did is he divided the invention into two  pieces and patents and patent them separately so  
yeah there's a lot of cases I could go on and  on there's the case of Stanton Romanek which  
are controversy aside he has received some very  complex equations that appear to be connected  
to interstellar travel Charles Hall another  controversial case he's become a physicist  
himself and has invented what he believes is a  new photon theory that challenges Maxwell's four  
equations describing electromagnetic fields I know  another case in July 1991 melinda leslie a very  
well-known speaker in this field someone who's  had abductions and is now a prominent researcher  
she had an abduction in july 1991 with two friends  while driving along to Los Angeles Crest Highway  
through the LA National Forest and what happened  is one of them while they were on board was given  
instructions on how to build a device and  it turned out to be a UFO detector using  
guess what magnets so yeah they're currently all  about magnetics there's of course we don't want  
to forget about George Van Tassel's integratron  which never got finished but it's the same type  
of thing someone who's been given instructions on  how to build something that will help humanity of  
course let's not forget about Nikola Tesla that's  the ultimate case this is a guy who's transformed  
the world with his inventions and transformed our  understanding and use of electric electricity and  
he himself said he was in contact with the geez  so this is a common thing in my most recent book  
onboard UFO encounters I present 15 cases people  were taken on board and six of the witnesses were  
taken to the control room and either instructed  on how the craft flies or how or actually flew  
the craft themselves Pat was given a demonstration  flying from LA to New York and back again and was  
told that they're not actually flying they're  expanding and contracting space they told Pat  
or Anne how to read their control panel Ramon  Joe and Dali actually sat in the control seat  
and operated the craft they explained to Tim how  they operate their craft and he came away from  
his experiences with a very strong interest and  understanding of physics so yeah there's nearly  
a dozen cases for you I did a really in-depth  study into them and wrote about it in my book  
not from here volume 3 I resent these cases  in chapter 10 it's called if you build it and  
yeah people I think are building these things all  across the country in the world for that matter I  
do know of other cases as far as I know no one's  built a successful alien engine but I think it's  
only a matter of time and hopefully soon so once  again thank you for listening and keep having fun
