"I PUNCHED A GRAY IN THE FACE!"
Feb 10, 2023

Summary:
Feb 10, 2023
As a general rule, when someone is visited by gray ETs, they find themselves paralyzed, unable to their body. “Don’t worry, we won’t hurt you,” the grays say. “Come with us.” It is perhaps the most common phrase the ETs say. In cases where people have no fear, they are often given freedom of movement. Others do have fear and have a fight or flight response. In some cases, witnesses break free from their paralysis and react by attacking the extraterrestrials and punching them in the face, choking them around the neck, or getting into some sort of physical altercation. It happens more often than you might think. This video presents more than a dozen cases in which people actually assaulted gray aliens by pushing, kicking, choking or punching.

NOV 3, 1975: Woodcutter Travis Walton and six others encounter a UFO at treetop level in the Sitgreaves National Forest, AZ. Travis runs under the UFO and is taken onboard. Confronted by grays, he physically fights with them.

APR 5, 2017: A young man from Del Valle, TX is woken up by his dogs barking. Searching the house, he sees two grays in his mother’s bedroom. He jumps forward and punches one of the grays in the head. When the second one grabs him, the witness punches him too. And then a third gray comes in.

WINTER 1985: Patsy Wingate of Knoxville, TN wakes up to see three grays approaching her. Reacting in self-defense, she jumps up and chokes the middle gray, snapping its neck. Astonished, the other two grays scoop up the gray and flee!

1985: Tim, a sports-instructor from New Iberia, LA wakes up to find himself lying on a table onboard a UFO. He breaks free from his paralysis and begins to explore. Grays rush in and Tim begins punching the grays, one after another. Suddenly a crowd of them surround him and Tim realizes he is out-numbered.

2016: “Gary” from Cumbria, England wakes up one morning and encounters a gray in his living room. Angry at the repeated intrusions into his home, he grabs the gray around the neck. The gray starts screaming telepathically, “Let go, let go!” A few days later, the grays come again, and Gary is ready. This time he punches one in the face.

1982: Former Marine officer, “Ramon,” is taken onboard a UFO in San Fernando, CA. He becomes angry when the grays try to collect genetic material from him. Summoning his combat training, he breaks free of the paralysis, jumps up and pushes one of the grays down to the floor.

Aug 13, 1975: Sgt Charles Moody of Alamogordo, NM is not happy when a UFO lands in front of his car, grays come out and try to pull him from his car. He opens his car door, knocking one of the grays down. Then he bunches up his fist, and pounds one of the grays in the face.

Oct 27, 1975: David Stephens and his friend are driving near Oxford, ME when a UFO takes control of their car. Next, grays appear and pull David onboard. When they try to undress David for an exam, he resists. He jumps off the table and hits one of the grays.

Oct 2010: Kevin is woken in his home in Bangor, ME and pulled into a craft by gray aliens. When they insert a rod inside his nose, Kevin becomes hostile. He swings out his leg and kicks one of the grays, slamming it hard into the wall, where it collapses in a heap.

UNDATED: An anonymous teenager in high school (location not given) has a very unusual dream where grays enter his room and begin to do a weird procedure on his back. Having scoliosis, he thinks they might be healing him. However, scared and angry that the ETs were not communicating with him, he quickly throws a left hook as hard as he can at the gray’s cheek. The gray lets out a high-pitched scream.

There are more cases like these. John Mack has a case in which a man, angry at being examined, jumps up and chokes a gray. Contactee Dolly Safran (from Georgia) recalls several instances where she was onboard and people reacted violently by punching the grays, pushing them down, or even breaking their arms. These cases show that, when confronted with the unknown, humans often become very fearful and react with violence. Even more importantly, they show that people can overpower the grays, who appear to be physically more fragile than humans. These cases have a lot to teach us both about humans and the grays, and our relationships to each other.

Introduction
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and  welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal  
I've got a pretty interesting and unusual episode  for you today I call it I punched a gray in the  
face Yes you heard me right these are cases in  which people have physically assaulted Grays  
punching them choking them pushing them down  I was surprised to find so many cases I first  
became interested in this when I had a few of my  own cases and I wondered if this was a thing and  
after doing some research I found many other  cases I found about 10 and I suspect there are  
quite a bit more that I'm presenting here today  that's one of the reasons I want to do this video  
as any psychologist knows when confronted  with the unknown or dangerous or scary  
situation people do often react with a fight  or flight response so that's exactly what's  
going on here people react with a fight response  what's very interesting about UFO encounters and  
particularly humanoid encounters when a gray  or other ET enters a person's bedroom they  
will often say something to the effect of do not  be afraid have no fear no harm will come to you  
we are not here to hurt you something along  those lines and yet people do react with fear  
I think this is why often people are rendered  unable to move because the Grays are protecting  
themselves from what they have learned is that we  often have a violent response to their appearance  
so these cases I think do have quite a bit to say  not only about us but about the Grays themselves  
that's another reason why I wanted to do this  video today again some of these are from my  
own research others are from cases I found in  the UFO literature and from other researchers  
and I think they're really interesting and  unusual cases that haven't got a lot of  
attention and that's another reason why I wanted  to do this video today so let's just get started  
Travis Walton
perhaps the most famous example of this kind  comes from very well known contacty Travis Walton  
you probably all know this story very  well so I won't go into too much detail   other than to say that on November 3rd 1975  Travis and six other men encountered a UFO  
hovering at Tree Top level in the sick Grieves  National Forest outside of Snowflake Arizona  
while the others stayed in the pickup truck Travis  was very interested in UFOs and jumped out of the  
truck and ran directly underneath this object  the other men were freaked out when a beam of  
light or an electrical discharge came out of the  bottom of the craft and struck Travis in the chest  
so they drove off and when  they returned Travis was gone   Travis was actually missing for five days and when  he reappeared he had an incredible story to relate  
he described how he was taken on board  on board he met Grays and human-like  
ETS again this story is pretty well known but one  of the most unusual aspects of his case is that  
he physically fought with the ETS after being  struck by this beam of light or this electrical  
discharge Travis woke up lying down on a table and  initially he thought he was actually in a hospital  
only after seeing that he was surrounded  by Grace did he try to fight back  
and I'll just let Travis describe in  his own words how he reacted as he says  
there were three of them hysteria overcame me  instantly I struck out at the two on my right  
hitting one with the back of my arms knocking it  into the other one my swing was more of a push  
than a blow I was so weakened the one I touched  felt soft through the cloth of its garment  
the muscles of its puny physique yielded with  the sponginess that was more like fat than sinew  
the creature was light and had fallen back  easily at this point the Grays reacted by  
quickly filing outside of the room and Travis  sort of followed them out into a corridor  
and again his story is pretty well known so I  won't go into it but important here is he did  
fight back and he was able to basically punch one  of these grays it's very interesting that they  
quickly fled the room at this point so could it  be that the Grays are physically weak and fragile  
Mutual UFO Network
consider this next case which comes  from the files of the mutual UFO Network  
it was around 4 am on April 5th 2017 when a young  man from Del Valle Texas was woken up by the sound  
of his family's dogs barking and overcome with a  quote weird feeling he began to search the house  
and checking the room where his mom and her  boyfriend slept he was shocked to see two grays  
each of them were about six feet tall and  were standing by the beds and at the same  
time another gray this one was just under seven  feet tall came floating in through the window  
and as the witness says and I quote my first  reaction was to grab the nearest one I flipped  
him and punched him in the head the other figure  grabbed me I turned and swung at it and punched  
it in the head and as soon as I looked back to the  third figure it was floating back out the window  
both my mom and her friend started to float up  and I blacked out I woke up back in bed sweating  
panting heavily and my fists were red and in pain  the dogs were barking really violently outside  
so this is an interesting  case for a number of reasons   one is that yes he was able to physically  punch these guys but he ended up blacking  
out and apparently wasn't able to stop  this onboard experience from taking place  
and waking up with his fists red and in pain  this is a physiological reaction so that's good  
physical evidence there and also the fact that the  dogs were barking this is an animal reaction case  
so there's some very interesting evidence to  this case but important here is that he was  
and also and druffle a southern california-based  UFO researcher the main witness is Patsy Wingate  
and she well she's either from Riverview Kentucky  or Knoxville Tennessee there's some discrepancy  
here in the various reports at any rate Patsy  reports many encounters with Grays throughout  
her life but it was one winter evening in  1985 that Patsy woke up in the middle of the  
night to see three Grays entering her bedroom  through the wall as you can see pictured here  
Patsys Encounter
Patsy who was pregnant at the time  mentally shouted out leave me alone  
but the three Grays continued to advance and at  this point point Patsy became enraged and and  
ruffle who interviewed Patsy writes what happened  next so I'm quoting Ann Ruppel here as Anne says  
she jumped out of the bed and ran towards  them attacking the one in the center who was  
slightly taller than the other two and without  thinking she seized its neck and squeezed firmly  
to her astonishment the thin neck snapped and  the entities oversized head fell onto its back  
she heard the sound of its neck snapping now  this was not exactly what Patsy had meant to  
do she says she was actually horrified she  had only meant to stop the E.T not kill it  
and as Patsy says in her own words his neck just  broke like a twig just like that and its head fell  
straight backward now the other two got this look  on their faces like huh you could see their eyes  
lift slightly in Surprise it was like how did  she do that like how come we couldn't stop her  
the other two Grays then scooped up their phone  companion and exited the same way they had arrived  
through the wall so Anne ruffle quotes this  case in her book how to prevent alien abduction  
and one of the methods she  says is physical resistance  
Charles Moody Encounter
there are so many cases like this here is another  case which occurred in Alamogordo New Mexico to  
Sergeant Charles L moody this is quite a famous  case I did cover this in my other YouTube episode  
the top 20 cases in New Mexico so I'm not going to  go into great detail about this but I do want to  
cover it because it's a very interesting case  of this kind and what happened was Sergeant  
Charles Moody had gone off base to view a meteor  shower suddenly he sees an object dropped down out  
of the sky and land in front of his car this was  initially shrouded in missing time but he recalled  
it naturally in the days and weeks following and  what he recalled was very interesting gray type  
ETS came out of the craft and walked up to  his car and tried to pull him out and this is  
when he sort of fought back at them and I'll  just quote Charles Moody directly as he says  
two beings came toward me from the craft they  didn't walk they glided they put their hands  
on the car door as if trying to open it I was  scared stiff but I was ready to fight my way out  
I shoved open the car door putting my 235 pounds  behind it and it knocked one of the aliens back  
I scrambled out of the car and threw a  fist right in the face of the other one  
the face felt soft I saw him fall  back and then the Lights Went Out  
now when Charles came to he was lying  on a table inside a craft one of these  
et's was studying him he tried to get up but  couldn't and basically they healed him as he  
says I was taken to a room and the elder or leader  touched my back and legs with a rod looking device  
when I asked what he was doing he said there  had been a scuffle when they first made   contact with me and he only wanted to correct any  misplacement any injury that might have happened  
I do not remember any type of scuffle or fight  but I do know my back hurt the next day and the  
knuckles on my right hand were sore also  so yeah he later did recall the entire  
experience and this is a good example of another  person who fought physically with the grades
John Mack Encounter
and here's another case which I believe  is from John Mack I was told about this  
from another person I couldn't find the  direct source but I'm including it here   because it does fit right in and here is the case  apparently the witness was drunk at the time the  
ETS came to take him and he managed to break free  of his paralysis and choke one of the small grays  
and as he was choking this small gray he said  that the gray felt confusion and possibly fear and  
we're really surprised that the he had actually  broken three of the paralysis and attacked them  
Tripp Pond Encounter
and immediately tall Grays came in and took over  and he found himself back under their control  
again and was returned to a field near his home  not back to the original site where he was taken  
so that's a briefcase but again fits right in  and here's another this one is quite interesting  
this occurred on October 27 1975 near  Tripp Pond this is outside of Oxford Maine  
David Stevens and his friend were driving along  when suddenly a UFO appeared it appeared to take  
control over their car and the next thing they  knew they were driving down West Poland Road  
this craft is hovering in front of him suddenly  there are several et's Grays in the road in front  
of them and they are pulled on board now all  of this was recalled under hypnosis but what  
David recalled is pretty interesting and I will  just quote him directly Z says I was standing  
in a room a metal room and I was looking out a  window at the car it was still skinning sideways  
and Glenn his friend was in the car still sitting  in the driver's seat a moment or so later one of  
the creatures came into the room he told me not to  be afraid that he wasn't going to hurt me he took  
me into another room it looked like an operating  room and there were four other creatures in there  
he told me to get up on the table and took two  needles of blood out of me then they wanted me  
to take off my clothes and lie down on the table  I didn't want to and I got up and hit one of them  
they didn't do anything he just backed away from  me and told me again they weren't going to hurt me  
I don't think I was frightened but when I  was listening to the hypnosis tapes I could   hear myself breathing real heavy and I finally  did get on the table and let them undress me  
so this is another case where person actually  fought with the Grays and he's later said that  
their skin texture was different from ours he  said It felt a little bit harder he said there  
was no discoloration where he hit this gray no  Mark uh was made where he hit the gray and he  
says that the gray seemed quite surprised when  he hit him so yeah very interesting case here is  
another case which occurred in October of 2010 to  a gentleman by the name of Kevin from Bangor Maine  
he did report his case to mufon it's quite a  lengthy report so I am just going to give a  
small portion of it the part where he did have a  physical alteration with the Grays I'm going to  
quote him directly as Kevin says then one of them  put their hand on my nose and another one put this  
small black tube up my nose it made this noise  the alien Grays had long fingers very tall had a  
little mouth that moved up and down an emotion  like a fish mouth but nothing was coming out  
I remember screaming after they did that the next  thing I remember was the thing I was standing up  
against slammed down making this loud noise and  slammed down like a table so I was now lying down  
they then brought me towards the left side of the  room I began to get hostile and remember cocking  
my left leg back and kicking the alien to my  lower left he went against the wall and fell down  
I clearly remember doing it and watching the  gray fly against the wall and sliding down  
the other gray is quickly backed off the next  thing I remember was being on the road again  
what's interesting about this report a little  endnote is he later adds that and I quote I used  
to have a crooked nose but since the alien stuck  that small black tube up my nose it is straight  
again so that's an interesting detail and here  is yet another case in which a person wrote his  
report on Reddit he says this is a true story I  punched an alien but maybe I am still a skeptic  
because he's not sure if this was a dream or  not but this is his report and I'll just quote  
him directly as he says this happened to me a few  years back when I was about 15 or 16 years old I  
don't remember the day exactly but I was still in  high school overall it was a very brief encounter  
I still believe I might have been dreaming  however I usually don't remember my dreams in  
detail so this was odd I also have mild scoliosis  and because of the fact that my back was involved  
in this makes me think it could have been  a stress dream anyway here's the story I'm  
laying on my back up towards the ceiling which  is unusual because I usually sleep on my side  
I'm looking towards my door and there on the  edge of my bed is what would be described as   a classic gray alien about four feet tall  is pulling some type of liquid on my back  
and I can feel the skin being healed so he  goes on to say that uh he jumps out of bed  
and as he says as fast as I can and I throw  a left hook as hard as I can into its cheek  
the funny thing about it though I can tell I  scared him because his eyes got noticeably wider  
and he let out some type of metallic sounding  screen when my fist made contact with him to my  
surprise his skin was very soft and warm people  talk about these things like they are lizards at  
least with this guy that was not the case he had  a very weak frame I remember feeling some bone and  
the gray skin was covered in little fine hairs but  after my first Contact everything went black again  
this I don't remember seeing visually  however I do have a memory of two larger   Grays and silver suits coming in to  control me and put me back in bed  
and he also said that they communicated with him  telepathically so there are many details here  
which we do see in standard contact accounts now  in my own UFO research cases of people punching  
Punching Aliens
aliens are rare but it does happen and one  example comes from a gentleman by the name  
of Tim he does not want his last name used he's  a sports instructor from New Iberia Louisiana  
I did cover his case in detail in my episode  how to fly a UFO so I won't quote it all  
here but as a young boy Tim did have a series of  close-up UFO sightings and missing time incidents  
he began having dreams at night that he  was on board a UFO though at first he   wasn't sure if these were just dreams or actual  encounters this continued into his teenage years  
he was actually around 20 when he had another  alien dream only on this occasion he had proof  
that it wasn't a dream at all it was real and as  he says this was his one truly fearful experience  
and I'm just going to quote Tim directly  and fairly extensively here as Tim says  
I had what I thought was a dream where the aliens  had taken me up into the spaceship and they had  
restrained me on a table and they left the room I  got loose somehow they hadn't restrained me fully  
and I got loose and I got up and I started  walking around and when they noticed I was  
walking around well one of them came at me and I  punched him in the head his head was soft like a  
bean bag almost when I punched him in the head  he went down I think it killed him suddenly I  
was fighting several of them I was fighting them  and I was beating them physically hitting them  
I remember one of them jumping towards me he had  like three or four fingers on each hand I remember  
him jumping towards me and then I remember  seeing like seven or eight other ones right  
behind him all coming at me at the same time  I remember seeing his eyes his big black eyes  
right in front of my face and I remember going  backwards and that's the last thing I remember  
now when Tim woke up he instantly recalled  this dream and but looking down at his arm  
he saw that he was actually hurt Z says I had  a cut on my arm like a scratch or a scrape  
took a long time to heal but it finally did heal  up he wanted to believe that he had hurt himself  
while sleeping but he knew this couldn't be true  he couldn't have cut himself that badly and it  
was one of what would become many encounters I did  cover that case in my book on board UFO encounters  
The Grays
and here's another case from the same book this  comes from a gentleman I call Gary that is a  
pseudonym he's from Cumbria England and when Gary  was a young boy he and his parents took a vacation  
from their home in Cumbria and on their return  trip they were followed by a UFO I did cover this  
in my UFO YouTube episode Gary versus the Grays  so again I'm not going to go into great detail  
but Gary and his family began having more UFO  sightings meanwhile Gary reported seeing short  
dark figures coming into his bedroom at night  and this began a lifelong series of encounters  
with the grays numerous times throughout  his life Gary found himself paralyzed and  
floating from his bed and out the window he had  many conscious memories of being on board a UFO  
in fact most of these memories he is paralyzed  or strangely obedient he did not remember  
this through hypnosis it's fully conscious  encounters however sometimes Gary has fought back  
on several occasions Gary woke up to find Grays  in his bedroom or walking around inside his house  
and while most of his encounters occurred in the  middle of the night Gary does recall one incident  
from 2016 that occurred in the morning hours he  had walked downstairs and to his shock there was a  
gray standing in the living room next to the base  of the stairs now this had happened before here we  
instantly remembered an earlier incident like this  when he he had come upon a gray in the living room  
standing he said like a scolded Schoolboy with  its head bent down and on that occasion Gary had  
passed out before before he had a chance to react  this time however events unfolded very differently  
Gary lunged forward wrapped his hands  around the Gray's neck and began choking it  
and as Gary says in his own words this time it  wasn't as quick but I was I grabbed it by the  
throat in a single moment a thousand thoughts  went through my head I remember thinking how  
surreal I've got some Creature From Another  World by the throat what the hell do I do now  
its skin felt cold firm and leathery  it was a split second because then it  
spindly little arms were spinning around like  windmills desperately trying to get rid of me  
and it was screaming in my head get off me get  off me now at this point without warning something  
rushed at Gary from behind and he instantly lost  Consciousness and as he says that's all I remember  
I have no idea what happened after that where I  went or for how long I have no idea but looking  
back it's nice to make those bastards Panic for a  change so Gary does not like these encounters and  
more soon followed it was during late December  in 2018 Gary was lying in bed when he suddenly  
began to sense the Gray's coming he sometimes  had a feeling as he says sometimes there's an  
energy that precedes them just before they  enter the room I don't know if it's to make  
it easier for them to move or to subdue me  it's kind of a heaviness it's hard to explain  
I've certainly heard this from other people before  but as Gary says the heaviness was particularly  
strong this time but if it was meant to paralyze  him it wasn't working but it did let him know that  
the Grays were actually in the room and this time  he was ready for them and as Gary says and I quote  
I waited until it had pulled the covers  right back and I punched it in the face  
and I can tell you now they may look small  and cute to some people sometimes but this  
thing suddenly changed it was Furious it  hissed loudly and lunged for me its face  
changed suddenly it looked nothing like a gray  it looked like something completely different  
it's small narrow mouth went from a tiny  slit to a wide gaping thing with spiky teeth  
it was something that an all intent and purposes  seems to try to come across as innocent frail  
and harmless but in fact has the teeth of a  predator for gripping shredding and ripping  
and when I punched it it was like its mask  slipped for a moment revealing its true identity  
I shot up in bed I thought I was going to die I  threw my fist right back I was going to punch it  
through the wall I thought I was fighting for  my life at this point the experience abruptly  
ended and upon Awakening Gary did remember the  confrontation the leathery feel of the Gray's skin  
the way it had opened its mouth to reveal small  pointed teeth he was about to punch it again when  
he passed out but he was amazed at how he had  been able to fight back against the grays they  
were no longer able to paralyze him with their  energy and next time he vowed to fight back again  
it was only a few months later when he had this  chance he was lying in bed when he felt their  
energy filling the room they were there he thought  to himself this time he wouldn't punch them he  
would kick them with more power but as Gary  says as soon as I thought that I was out cold  
I think I'm now in their bad books so Gary still  continues to have encounters he called me fairly  
recently to report another gray standing in the  doorway of his room he's still not happy about  
his encounters he wishes they would just end uh  even though he has had positive encounters as well  
and has had some good effects from all of  his encounters ultimately he doesn't like it  
Ramon
and here's another case also  from my book on board UFO conors  
this involves a gentleman by the name well I call  him Ramone that is a pseudonym he's a now retired  
United States Marine officer from Palmdale  California and starting at age six Ramon had  
a series of on-board experiences with gray ETS and  more would continue throughout his teenage years  
but it was in his mid-30s in December of 1982 that  Ramon had his most extensive on-board experience  
it was during this experience that he was  physically examined he saw hybrid E.T babies  
and more it's quite a complicated case I did  cover this in a very early YouTube episode on this  
channel but it was during this incident that Ramon  got in a physical fight with one of the grays  
he had just been shown the hybrid babies  and the Grays were now taking him to be   physically examined at this point Ramon  was unable to resist and he sat down  
and as he says out of the air a tabletop floats  up right to me over my knees and just stays there  
and looking on the table he could see a little  petri dish type container and at that moment a  
taller gray walked in and as Ramon says he  comes over and tries to put a cup over my  
genitals they started to take off my shirt and  unbuckle my pants and at this point Ramon Broke  
Free from the semi-paralysis and tried to fight  them now the Dr Gray is how Ramone described him  
said calm down calm down everything will be okay  and he tried to push Ramon back into the chair  
and this is when Ramon felt a surge of anger and  summoning his Marine combat training he lifted  
his arms up and pushed the gray forcefully  down onto the ground and he was able to do  
this fairly easily though the gray quickly  stood back up and now Ramon suddenly found  
himself surrounded by a half dozen more grays  and the Dr Gray told the others hold him down  
and as Ramon says they started to push me down  into that bentle chair and I was fighting back  
at this point the Dr Gray then tried to  place a mask-like device over Ramon's  
face presumably to sedate him so they could get  their sperm sample this is what Ramon thought  
this is when he noticed that the doctor's  fingers were twice as long as a human's   and appeared almost claw-like this is  quite a complicated case but Ramon lost  
Consciousness his onboard experience continued but  important here is that he was able to fight back  
now in my book symmetry all about the experiences  of Dolly saffron she has been on board a craft  
Dolly
many times when other people were being  taken onto the craft for medical examinations  
and she reports that people are often very afraid  and occasionally some people do react violently  
in fact dolly was present when a large  muscular man was awakened following his  
examination this man reacted with intense  fear and before anyone could stop him the  
man leapt forward and attacked one of the Grays  yanking its arm and pulling it from its socket  
the gray fell to the ground and the man  of course was quickly rendered unconscious   and placed in a room where he remained until  they were able to return him back to his home  
and Dolly does remember another similar incident  during which a woman reacted with anger and Terror  
before anyone could stop her she assaulted one  of the Grays a female gray breaking its arm  
so yeah people do sometimes react violently I  did Cover these cases in some of my interviews  
with Dolly but you can again read about it  in my book symmetry A true UFO Adventure  
and there are other examples one lady I  interviewed I call her Wendy she woke up  
one day this was in the early 1990s I believe she  woke up to find the Grays surrounding her bed she  
jumped up and kicked one of them in the neck it's  neck snapped and the creature fell to the ground  
instantly the other Grays scooped up their  companion and they disappeared through the wall  
Wendy later regretted her actions she believed  at the time that she may have actually killed  
the being but she acted instinctively and in  self-defense at that time she did have a lot  
of fear of her encounters but later on she came  to realize that the ETS were not trying to hurt  
her or scare her and were in fact interested  in her well-being she was not only healed by  
the ETS of a cyst in her Fallopian tubes but they  taught her all kinds of things how to do psychic  
abilities Hands-On healing and more she now looks  at the ETS as brothers as sisters as family so she  
overall feels her case is very much benevolent but  you can see how it's understandable that she would  
react in a way that uh was self-defense how she  felt and yeah that's perfectly understandable I  
certainly don't judge her for that but I think her  case is important for a couple of reasons again  
it shows that people can fight back and in some  cases actually prevent an encounter from occurring  
it also shows that this probably says  more about us than it does about the grays  
because she ultimately came to the conclusion  that they weren't trying to hurt her  
and here is yet another case this is a little  treat for you I went on to Dave Scott's radio show  
spaced out radio and was talking about these  types of cases to my amazement Dave who has  
had many UFO experiences said that this  actually happened to him he fought a gray  
here's a little one minute audio clip in which  he describes his own experience with this  
I remember one time when I was taken and I woke  up and I was standing and there were five of them  
around they were about five and a half six  feet tall and I remember hearing the one say  
oh crap he's awake he's awake he's awake and  there was one standing right in front of me  
and they were holding down my  wrists but they're not strong  
and I I'm left-handed and I got my left  hand free and I punched the one right in  
the chest in front of me and it went flying  back and it felt like uh how would you put it  
almost rubbery like a soft rubber uh  of I I don't know how to explain it  
the next thing I know I was out I was right  back out again and I woke up the next day  
and that's the only snippet I have from that is  hitting that one right in the chest so these kinds  
of accounts I think are quite rare but they do  show that it is possible to physically resist the  
grays and in fact researcher Ann gruffal maintains  that there are several methods that people can  
use to defend themselves against alien abduction  with quote physical resistance being one of them  
again she wrote about this in her book  as Ann druffle says what is all important  
here is the ability of an ordinary size  human to attack and disable a UFO entity  
it shows that physical struggle is sometimes  possible even in the worst of abduction  
scenarios and indicates the so-called Grays are  not physically Superior to humans there you go  
there are 10 true cases of people who punched a  gray in the face or assaulted them in some way  
I did Cover these cases in my book not from here  volume 4 which again is all about the more unusual  
cases the outline cases cases with weird patterns  to them and certainly I think these cases qualify  
again I think there are far more than the 10 I've  presented here I suspect after I post this episode  
some people will come forth and say that yes this  happened to me and they do I think have something  
to say about us and about the ETS themselves  when it comes to us I think this shows how  
truly fearful as a species we are how very much  fear-based we are in our thinking even though the  
ETS do come and say flat out Don't Be Afraid we  often are afraid and I think this goes to show why  
ETS will often render a person paralyzed another  really interesting aspect to these cases I think  
is the fact that people are able to do this  in some cases push down a gray or punch them  
and the Grays go right down and I think  this shows that perhaps they are delicate  
perhaps we are as humans physically stronger than  them certainly they're technologically advanced  
morally ethically Advanced certainly psychically  and spiritually advanced but as far as physical  
well we may be actually stronger than them so that  alone I think makes these cases very important you  
know helping some other people do come forward  because these cases don't get a lot of attention   and I think it's important that people know  about them and again that's why I wanted to  
do this episode just trying to let everyone  know all the different aspects of UFO contact  
so I hope you've enjoyed this very unusual episode  I really appreciate you watching and once again  
keep looking for the truth keep asking  questions and most important keep having fun.
