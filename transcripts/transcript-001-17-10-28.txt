Oct 28, 2017
Are UFOs mining the precious metals of our planet? The answer is: yes! They have been seen over iron 
mines, copper mines, gold mines, titanium mines, uranium mines and more. In many of these cases, the 
UFOs land and entities are seen. In some cases, the mines are physically effected.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett. And tonight I wanted to talk to you a little 
about my book 'Not From Here, Volume One'. It's about the more unusual and lesser-known aspects 
of the UFO phenomena. I wanted to talk about chapter 10, which is called Mining Devta. On UFOs 
it's about you ethel mine cases. In which UFOs have hovered over mines or they've landed. 
In some cases there are humanoids. And in some cases they've actually affected the mines. I 
think it's an important aspect of the UFO phenomena. Speaks to their agenda why 
they're here. We haven't heard a lot about it and I think this is one of the largest 
collections put together. I want to talk about a dozen cases and let's just dive in. 

The first case I want to talk about and I want to get this all done in like less than five minutes 
so I'm going to go fast. The 1953 Brush Creek encounter in California in which two titanium miners 
saw a UFO hovering over the mine. This was on April 20th, 1953. One month later on May 20th they 
saw it again only this time it had landed and they saw footprints. After this thing took off, 
exactly one month later, on June 20th, this thing came again. This time it also landed and they 
saw an actual humanoid. A dwarf-like creature carrying a bucket. Since this thing had landed, Irv's 
was seen on the same day three months in a row. July 20th rolls around and there was more than 300 
people waiting to see this thing. Unfortunately it does not show up. That was the last time a UFO 
apparently hovered over the brush Creek Titanium Mine. But it's by no means the only mining culture. 

I mean there it is a lot of them. I can't talk about all of them in this video of this size but let's go through some 
of the more interesting ones. I mean, there was one in 1952 in the Belgian Congo which mines uranium. 
This was revealed through a CIA document. There was another really interesting case in 2006 in Australia. 
Over the Para Berdoo Iron Mine. A bunch of people saw this object hovering right over the mine, but it's 
Arizona that really kind of cements the UFO mine connection. These guys are taking our precious 
metals. Arizona turns out is the United States leading producer of copper and boy the ET's seemed 
to find this pretty interesting. The Lavender Pit Copper Mines in Bisbee, Arizona. They've had a lot of 
activity starting way back in 1947, literally days before the Roswell UFO crash. A bunch of people saw 
UFO's not only hovering over this mine but actually landing in an area called Tin Town. A 
bunch of employees of the mine. Years later, in 1980, there was another encounter over the same 
mine. Two workers saw a 100-foot metallic disc hovering right over the slag heaps there, the 
open pit. And they watched it for quite a while. There were other witnesses. Until a jet fighter 
chased this thing away. 

And only a few hundred miles away from there, a few months later. Still in 
1980, there was one of the most amazing UFO mining sighings of all times over Morenci, Arizona. 
There is a copper smelting pit in Morenci and a bunch of workers were there when this UFO shows 
up. Comes right over the mine, hovers, and sends down a beam of light into each of the smokestacks. 
Not only that, it sent on this little probe object. A little ball of fire down into it. So it was 
clearly interested in this copper smelting plant. And there are so many other cases like this all 
across the world. Pine Bush in upstate New York is well-known for having high levels of UFO activity. 
Alum Crystal and Vote Phillip Dannebrog no they both found out that there was a bunch of what appeared 
to be UFO activity over the various mines in the area. That area which is known to have a number of 
precious metals. 

Actually, in 1965 in Twin Falls, Idaho two hunters had an amazing encounter over a design mine which 
they saw a UFO high up and another one. This lower UFO went down into the mine actually hovered over 
it and started mining from the slag heap. From the ore already been extracted very strange but a very 
interesting. Conner which was originally investigated by Jim & Coral Lorenzen. So many other mining 
encounters to talk about. One of the most amazing was investigated by Jacques Vallee. This occurred 
in French Gulch, California. It occur to the couple by the name of Chapin's. They owned a gold mine 
up in French Gulch. They were being repeatedly harassed by these UFO's. This kind of gray type II 
team which they actually saw. They had a period of missing time at one point. They saw this UFO 
on numerous occasions and not only did they see it, neighbors did as well. This thing left samples which I 
talked about more in the book. 

Probably one of the most impressive cases I guess would be that which occurred in Carne City, Texas in 1971.
A really interesting case where this UFO hovered over this uranium mine. It's a pretty complex case. 
There was a lot of witnesses. Some were brought to tears by the sight of this thing. Hovering over 
the mine and the next day they went to remove the uranium ore. This thing at Hubbard, but the uranium had somehow 
already been extracted or spent. This ufo basically took it. A really interesting case. There's two other 
cases like this. 

I mean, there was one case in 1989 in Donetsk, Ukraine. I hope I said that right. A case
in which is like the trickle or current electrician saw a - unusual figures about 300 feet below the 
ground in a mine and he went up to them because he knew no one else was supposed to be there. He saw that 
they were not human. There were kind of these short dwarf creatures with really pale skin and he's like 
hey what's going on. These things actually turned looked at him and floated away. So this is not enough 
evidence to prove that aliens/extraterrestrials are taking our precious metals I don't know what is. I mean, 
these cases come across from around the world stretching from the modern age of UFOs in 1947 all the way to 
the present day. So, I think there is no doubt this speaks to one of the agendas which is to mine the 
precious metals of our planet. And now you can read more about this in my book, 'Not From Here, Volume One'. 
I hope you can check it out. Either way, you are well aware that these guys are real. They're here they're 
not going away. Bye for now.
