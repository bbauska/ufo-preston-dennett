So many UFO encounters! Each case adds to our knowledge of UFO activity and the ET presence on our 
planet. This video presents ten unique UFO stories from all over the world. Sightings, landings, 
face-to-face encounters with humanoids, and even one account of a little-known UFO crash. These 
cases provide compelling evidence for the reality of the phenomenon. How many documented cases will 
it take before humanity accepts the fact that we are not alone?

BRITAIN’S EARLIEST HUMANOID? In the summer of 1901, Frank (age 10) was walking near his home in 
Bournbrook in West Midlands, England when he saw what looked like a metal hut sitting in a field. 
Out stepped two short humanoids wearing gray jumpsuits and helmets with antennae. One of the figures 
gestured for Frank to keep back. With no idea of UFOs or ETs, it would be years before Frank understood 
what happened.

DEATH VALLEY UFO CRASH. On Aug 19, 1949 two prospectors, Buck Fitzgerald (age 73) and his friend Mase 
Garney were in Death Valley when a silver flying saucer zoomed overhead and crashed into the desert 
floor. Two short humanoids jumped out, saw the prospectors, and took off running. Buck and Mase chased 
them, but soon lost sight of them. Returning to the crash-site, the saucer was gone!

CAUGHT IN THE SPOTLIGHT. Around 7:00 pm on August 19, 1949, Sgt. Donald Berger shone an 8-million 
candlepower searchlight into the night skies of Norwood, Ohio for a publicity stunt for a festival. To 
his and everyone’s amazement, a glowing disc appeared in the searchlight beam. One month later, it 
happened again. And over the next year, eight similar incidents followed. Something truly strange was 
happening over Ohio.

A FOILED ABDUCTION. Early one evening in June 1960, the children of Mr. and Mrs. LeMarquands were 
playing outside their home in Thompson in Manitoba, Canada when a whirlwind began to swirl around 
them. Looking up, they saw a strange craft. Then one of the children rose from the ground toward the 
UFO. One of the neighborhood boys quickly grabbed the girl, preventing her from being pulled into the 
craft.

CHASED BY A UFO. It was 5:00 pm, Aug 24, 1967 as Ron Hydes drove his motorcycle south of Wodongo, 
Australia. Suddenly, a blinding light shone from above. Stopping, Ron was amazed to see a metallic 
saucer landed along the road, along with two silver-suited humanoids. One of them beckoned for him 
to approach. Terrified, Ron hopped on his motorcycle and fled. To his dismay, the UFO began to chase 
him.

THE ALIENS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. On a Sunday afternoon in Oct 1974, Alain and Patrick were driving 
out of their hometown in Aisne, France and noticed five very strange-looking short figures. They were 
 four-feet-tall, wore robes, and had yellow skin, long black hair and enormous round black eyes. One 
 of the figures waved for the two witnesses to come closer. Frightened, the witnesses drove off.

“DON’T LET IT GET ME!” Around 10:30 pm on Oct 28, 1976, Richard Britt and his son Richie returned to 
their home in Lake View, SC and saw a strange light whizzing over the trees. Richard went inside, but 
Richie remained outside. Then the light reappeared and suddenly zoomed forward, stopping only feet 
away from him. It was a saucer and looking at him through a large porthole was a strange creature.

THE ITALIAN ROBOT. Around midnight on Aug 31, 1977 and two students were walking outside of Sturno, 
Italy and noticed some strange lights alongside the road. Then they saw a giant silver robotic figure. 
They ran back to town and got more witnesses. Frightened, all the witnesses fled and got even more 
witnesses, beginning an encounter with a landed UFO and a silver humanoid that would leave the citizens 
of the town in shock.

THE ETS IN THE VILLAGE. When night arrived on Sep 1, 1978 in the small village of Llanerchymedd, Wales, 
many residents of the town noticed a strange object in the sky. Without warning, the object landed in 
a nearby field. Shortly later, three humanoids exited and began to walk around. As more and more people 
in the town witnessed the spectacle, panic swept through the town. Police were called. But the encounter 
wasn’t over yet!

THE SAUCER ON THE BACK PORCH. Around 4:00 am on February 7, 1981, Cindy Gaffney was woken up in her 
home in San Francisco, California by a loud buzzing noise. To her shock, she saw that a UFO had 
landed on her neighbor’s back porch. She woke up her husband who also saw the craft. She called the 
police, but they didn’t believe her or didn’t care.

These ten truly strange UFO encounters are just a tiny sample of the huge number of cases from all 
over the world. They show how complex the UFO phenomenon is, and the many strange things that happen 
when ETs make contact with humans. The truth can no longer be denied. The evidence speaks for itself. 
We are not the only intelligent beings living in this universe, and many of them are regularly visiting 
our planet.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
I call this episode, "10 Truly Strange UFO Encounters". I think UFO encounters are by their 
very nature quite strange and unusual. But these 10 cases that I've chosen for you today are a 
little bit stranger than most. These are cases that come from all over the world, all across the United 
States. Across Europe, Australia, I mean pretty much across the entire planet. Which, of course, 
shows that this is in fact a global phenomenon. Also, really interesting about these cases is that 
they span eight decades. I've got a case reaching all the way back to the 1900s. All the way up to 
The 1980s. So quite a long period of time there which shows that this is an ongoing phenomenon 
and also a wide variety of cases tonight. 

I do have one involving what would be categorized as a close encounter of the first kind. A simple 
sighting but as we'll see there's nothing simple about it. It's a really important and not that well-
known case which deserves much more attention than it's gotten, I think. But cases of all kinds. So, we have face-to-face encounters with humanoids, landings and, in fact, even one apparent UFO crash which again is not super well known. So, some really important cases here. I think you'll agree that each case does add to our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon, extraterrestrial contact. Our knowledge of the ET agenda on our planet. So, in that regard each case is important and holds a piece of the puzzle to solving this mystery. I actually think this mystery is pretty much already solved. I do think we know what it is. I think that we are being visited by 
extra terrestrials and I think these cases will show that these cases also contain a huge variety 
of evidence. Really, of all kinds. Everything from medical effects to electromagnetic effects, animal 
reactions, landing traces. The whole gamut. So that also makes all of these cases important and let's 
face it they're just darn interesting. 

so, yeah, 10 cases that's a lot so let's get started. And, the first case I want to talk about today, I call "Britain's Earliest Humanoid?" I'm leaving a question mark on that because this is not for sure but it's  certainly a very early case which occurred  in 1901. Actually in the the summer of 1901 in Bournbrook. This is in West Midlands, England. And it's a pretty interesting case involving a landed UFO and a humanoid. and while it's just one main 
witness there are some supporting corroborating witnesses as we shall see this case is from Jenny 
randles and occurred again in the summer of 1901 and as Jenny Randall says the report remains a 
most intriguing one and it is a strong Contender for Britain's oldest humanoid encounter the main 
witness in this case is a 10-year-old boy she calls Frank I believe that is a pseudonym but 
he was walking home when he came upon what he first thought was a small Hut about 6 feet long 
3 and 1/2 ft wide and 4 feet high it had a central turret on top and a small door and appeared to be 
metallic and was green blue in color so this is in a field near his home and it hadn't been there 
before so he was quite curious about it and was looking at it when suddenly a door opened outwards 
and two entities stepped out they were quite short he estimates about 4 feet in height one remained 
by the door while the other actually waved at Frank with a gesture that he interpreted as saying 
not to approach and to keep back now he said that these two figures looked human appeared to 
be about 30 to 40 years old and again very short clean shaven both were dressed in gray green tight 
fitting kind of military looking uniforms uniforms had no insignias but they did have dark helmets on 
their heads with what looked like two wires or antennas quite prominent about 9 in Long rising 
out from either side of their helmets so Frank was somewhat alarmed and he stepped back at which time 
this entity returned to the craft both little men went back inside the craft then lit up with 
an electric Arc which formed a complete circle around the craft it then glowed brightly made a 
loud who ing sound and Rose quickly into the air now Frank could now see a pulsating red light on 
one end of this craft and later according to Frank he found out that other people in the neighborhood 
also heard this whoosing sound and a few said they actually saw this craft in the sky as it flew off 
now at the time Frank had never heard of UFOs he had no conception of extraterrestrials whatsoever 
he did think that he saw a quote funny vehicle but it wasn't until many years later when he 
heard about UFOs and he remains certain that his sighting while very unusual and that whatever it 
was it was real because as he says how could I dream about something that I had no interest in 
or had read nothing about but which is coming true many many years later obviously the most 
interesting thing about that case is the fact that it occurred in 1901 well before the idea 
of UFOs was in the public Consciousness so yeah that alone makes this a truly important case it's 
also interesting in that it was a UFO landing and a humanoid with some corroborating Witnesses but 
it's fascinating that the witness himself didn't even think of the idea that this was extr terrest 
Ral it wasn't until years later that he realized his experience matched up perfectly with what 
other people were were reporting so definitely an important case and here's another one I think 
that deserves more attention and I call this one Death Valley UFO crash this occurred way back in 
1949 on August 19 to be exact of course in Death Valley California there were two witnesses this 
case has not apparently been investigated but it is certainly an important contribution to 
our understanding of the UFO crash phenomenon as I'm sure you all know there are many reports of 
UFO crashes it's not just Roswell and according to numerous newspaper articles in the summer of 1949 
two men witnessed a UFO crash and apparently two surviving humanoids in the inhospitable deserts 
of Southern California the Witnesses were both Prospectors Buck Fitzgerald then age 73 and his 
friend Mae gney now this incident occurred about 15 miles south of Death Valley and I will just 
quote bug Buck directly as he says the flying disc which was about 24 ft in diameter whizzed 
past us going about 300 mph it crashed landed and two little men jumped out and started running when 
they saw us the men looked human but they were very small like dwarfs we chased them over a 
sand dune but lost them I don't know where they went now Buck was questioned about this but he 
says he's lived long enough to know what a flying saucer is and he says that his partner Maize also 
saw the whole thing he says they both watched this craft quote spin into the desert after 
coming out of nowhere so the men wanted to pursue these little dwarves which they did for a short 
distance but it was much too hot to chase after them and they quickly lost sight of them and when 
they returned to where the disc had crashed it also was gone so yeah that's a very brief case 
and not well investigated if investigated at all but it certainly was widely reported and 
is one of the earliest UFO crashes on record not the earliest by any means but definitely one of 
them and if true is an important contribution to the list of UFO crashes and there's a lot of 
them so I think that does make it important and it's also a very early case involving humanoids 
as well so there's definitely I think something to learn from that case and here's another one I call 
this case caught in the spotlight this occurred actually over a period of 2 years 1949 to 1950 in 
Ohio primarily in Norwood Ohio and this should be a much better known case because it does involve 
photographs it involves hundreds of witnesses many of who are very high caliber trained observers 
including police officers military Witnesses reverends and scientists Air Force officers 
this series of sightings actually created quite a bit of interest at high levels of government and 
is strangely absent from files of project Grudge the precursor to Project Blue Book because it does 
have a lot of evidence and with so many witnesses there's no doubt that this series of sightings did 
take place as described it's very well verified it's a truly important case and I think shows 
a very interesting aspect of ET behavior that we need to really start talking about more this case 
is certainly one of the most important of the years 1949 to 1950 and in fact UFO researcher 
Lauren gross called it quote after many years I remain convinced that the Norwood incident 
based on Sergeant Burger's log father Miller's entrusted testimony the photos and movies Etc 
is one of the best early reports on record UFO researcher Leonard Stringfield agrees and as he 
says this one case is exemplary in more ways in photography to me it is one of the best civilian 
cases on records due to testimonial evidence that is if we accept as evidence certain scientific 
statements and evaluations plus thousands of witnesses including members of the Catholic 
clergy the press and the military so again this case involves about 10 separate incidents over 
a period of about a year in mostly Norwood Ohio where this UFO was repeatedly caught in the beam 
of a search light coming from the ground now the first known incident occurred on August 19 
1949 during a carnival at the St Peter and Paul Church in Norwood it was around 700 p.m. Reverend 
Gregory Miller had purchased an 8 million candle power search light this was to attract public 
attention and operating the search light with Sergeant Donald R Burger now during the height of 
festivities Sergeant Burger was shining the search light into the sky and caught a strange object 
hovering overhead as he later wrote and I quote the object was stationary appearing as a glowing 
disc when I moved the search light away the disc continued to Glow so he estimated that this object 
was quite high up he couldn't really tell how high or how large it was but there were other 
Witnesses in fact the Post newspaper reported that many other people saw the object and in an article 
wrote quote Balls of Fire hung over Cincinnati during the night a weather bureau official said 
one of our men who was working last night saw them he said they looked like two weather sealing 
balloons but they weren't moving there was a wind of 25 to 32 mph so if they had been balloons they 
would have moved they seem to grow dim and then get bright again that's the first incident but 
it was about 1 month later on September 11 again 1949 the object was back the same witness sergant 
Burger was operating the search light now at St Gertrude Church in Madera Ohio it was early in 
the evening and shining the search light upwards he saw apparently the same object he estimates 
it around 15,000 to 20,000 ft and as he says in his own words the object disappeared within 
a few seconds traveling straight up I picked it up again at much greater altitude as soon as it 
reappeared I phoned right Patterson field the sky was clear with no visible clouds or Haze several 
thousand people also saw the object so this was a very widely viewed incident and it was only one 
week later on September 17 around 700 p.m. when the same witness Sergeant Sergeant Burger tested 
the search light at Milford this is nearby in Ohio and apparently the same object reappeared and as 
he says I could see an object which looked like a white glow when I turned the light off I could 
see nothing I did this several times as soon as it became dark I turned on the light at the same 
elevation and caught the object in the beam so he was recording all these events in a log because it 
kept occurring and one month later on October 23rd probably the most dramatic sighting of 
these series of sightings occurred and once again the sergeant kept a detailed record as he says I 
turned on the light and picked up the object among those present were William Winkler father Gregory 
Miller Robert Lynn the managing editor of the Cincinnati Post and Leo hurtle a reporter for the 
Post now Reverend Miller and Robert Lynn actually called right Patterson Air Force Base and reported 
this in incident to an intelligence officer and it was later around 1 p.m. that two distinct groups 
of triangular-shaped objects seemed to come out of the main dis each group had about five objects 
they came down the beam then turned out of the beam the same performance was repeated about a 
half hour later the dis was still visible when I turned out the light for the night again this 
is Sergeant Verger saying this now more than 50 people observed this object on that occasion and 
in fact Reverend Miller took moving films Sergeant Leo Davidson of the Norwood Police Department took 
numerous photos and he said that he and all the others watched this larger object emitting smaller 
objects as he says we watched each group Fade Out of view now Sergeant Leo's photos were sent 
to Time Life Magazine who promised to print them along with an article but never did and 
in fact refused to ref return the photographs despite numerous requests so this is starting 
to stink of a cover up the next night on October 24th from 7 to 900 p.m. again at the original 
location St Peter and Paul Church in Norwood Ohio Sergeant Burger trained the same search light on 
the object and his as he says quote the object appeared immediately in the beam AIC agent and 
Lou Gart were with me at the time they held the object in the beam for about a half an hour until 
covered by clouds now atic is the air technical intelligence command this is these are the people 
who are very interested in all foreign aircraft so it's clear our own military is fully aware that 
there's unusual activity going on in the sky and they were very interested they saw it and it was 
less than one month later on November 19 that this object was back in Norwood around the same time 
7:15 p.m. Sergeant Burger shown the search light upwards and as he says and I quote the beam of 
the light flashed on the object guiding the light back on the object it then disappeared immediately 
about a minute later I picked it up again much higher many witnesses including William Winkler 
sky was covered with low broken clouds at times the object appeared much brighter so month after 
month the sightings continued somewhere between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. on December 20th again in 
Norwood Sergeant Burger turned on the search light and immediately picked up the object as 
he says at first it was faint and small as Haze cleared object brightened at 21:30 which is about 
9:30 it got much brighter and spread out almost as large as the beam then disappeared president were 
da Wells University of Cincinnati physicist Dr Paul hergett University of Cincinnati astronomer 
two OSI members office of special investigations from the Air Force as well as father Miller and 
the mayor of Norwood Ed tape and Reginald Meyers so there was some secret scientific calculations 
going on of this objects and they estimated the size as being about 10,000 ft in diameter uh but 
this was real Hush Hush they obviously couldn't be sure because they don't know the size of this 
object they don't know its altitude so it's very difficult to determine but the mayor of Norwood Mr 
Ed tape said quote it had ridges or RI ribbing which were very discernible and it was just 3 
weeks later January 11th now 1950 again around 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. in Norwood there there was 
another sighting with this same search light and as the sergeant says turned on light but didn't 
find object until about 1945 hours 7:45 when Haze blew away observed it for about 15 minutes 
very clearly then it dimmed it was called to my attention that some smaller objects were passing 
through the beam I saw at least two objects several times also present were with William 
Winkler and master sergeant k eckleberry Master Sergeant John Savage and Sergeant W fluger of the 
Air National Guard so these are a lot of military Witnesses trained observers who clearly could not 
identify this object and there were more sightings two months later there was another sighting again 
at Norwood was 8:00 pm March 9th and a sergeant Burger says I picked up the object with the light 
about 2045 hours 8:45 two small objects came out of the disc and it looked as if the disc 
was pushed out of the beam in about 10 minutes the dis moved back into the beam the sky was 
clear 11 people were present now the final that's a question mark appearance was the next evening 
I suspect this was going on they just looking for it but it was around 7 to 11:00 p.m. March 11 1950 
and again I will just quote Sergeant Burger who says the object moved up and across the beam and 
disappeared half an hour later object reappeared in beam in same position object stayed in beam 
until I turned off the light for the night present were father Miller captain wils K Myers William 
Winkler and others and in fact according to Burger Captain wils phoned right Patterson field Captain 
wils watched the object with glasses while I moved the light meaning with binoculars so this 
is an amazing series of events and this is just what we're hearing about it there could very well 
be a lot more going on behind the scenes here and not only were photos taken but so are moving films 
and according to Leonard Stringfield his inside sources told him that Air Force interceptors were 
secretly sent up to investigate officially the Air Force denies any knowledge of this incident the 
sighting is conspicuously absent from their files also interesting is how some witnesses described 
the search light being bent towards the object and this object emitting much smaller craft so this 
could be a mother ship and I believe during one of these incidents an Air Force officer actually 
ordered Burger to turn off the search light or he would shoot it disabling it breaking it so 
yeah clear evidence of a coverup here this is an incident that should be far more well 
known so that series of sightings has come to be known as the Norwood search light UFO encounters 
and I think you'll agree it's quite remarkable I think the most important takeaway of this series 
of sightings is that it was in fact a display where UFOs were certainly showing themselves 
on purpose of course that is speculation but judging on the fact that this was seen over 
10 times by so many people and that it remained in the spotlight for over an hour at times it's 
undeniable that it was certainly okay with being seen if not wanting to be seen a really important 
sighting that I think provides excellent evidence of the reality of UFOs way back in 1949 and 1950 
which really shows that our government's denial of the existence of UFOs certainly at that time 
doesn't hold water it's not it's ingenuous they knew exactly what was going on very early on as 
the Norwood search light UFO sightings show so that makes it a very important case and here's 
another case I call this one a foiled abduction and this one occurred in June 1960 in Thompson 
this is in Manitoba Canada this is a unique case I can't say I've heard of one quite like it there 
are some similar I've certainly investigated a few but this one is different for sure it's very 
widely viewed it's got some interesting physical evidence as well and just a strange strange case 
this is such a weird case it was around 6: p.m. again in June 1960 as the three children of Mr 
and Mrs LaRon were playing outside their home in Thompson this is again in Manitoba Canada 
two other people were playing with them this is in front of the house when sudden suddenly 
a large object appeared overhead it appeared to be rectangular they're not entirely sure but it 
was rotating slowly in a clockwise motion it was fairly low was shiny aluminum in color and totally 
silent and as the children watched this object one of them an 8-year-old girl the daughter of 
the Marans the larons began to rise upwards to to the object at the same time this Whirlwind 
was swirling around the children carrying up dust and any loose debris and seeing this little girl 
Rising upwards a 13-year-old boy who lived across the street rushed up to her and managed to grab 
her when she was about 3 feet in the air grabbed her by her feet and pulled her down uh he said the 
girl was in a complete Daz apparently not aware of what was happening to her but that her clothes her 
skirt and her blouse and her hair were all Rising straight up along with her entire body and the boy 
with some effort was able to pull her down to the ground but this strange invisible force was still 
tugging on her body so he had to lay down across her body and pin her to the ground to keep her 
on the ground and it was at this moment that Mr Lumar Kant was driving into the driveway and his 
wife Mrs larand the parents of these children she was in the house and looking outside she became 
curious about this dirt and debris that was Rising upward around the house in a circular pattern so 
she ran outside and looked upward to see what the cause was and it was then that she and her 
husband who had just stepped out of his car both saw this object they could see that it was solid 
was flashing black and silver as it rotated and they saw this debris being drawn up towards it it 
was very strange because all of this seemed to be isolated to a very small area right around their 
house more specifically right in their yard and hearing a strange scuffling sound Mrs Lum marant 
looked down and saw her 8-year-old daughter being pinned To The Ground by The Neighborhood boy now 
it was at this point the object moved quickly upwards at a 45° angle leveled off hovered and 
then moved off in a horizontal trajectory to the southeast at that moment the Whirlwind stopped all 
the dust and debris dropped into the neighbor's yard right across the street Mrs larand ran up 
to the children all of whom were visibly shaken and quite frightened and they explained to her 
that the this object had tried to lift up her 8-year-old daughter but that the 13-year-old 
boy had managed to grab her before she was taken now the girl herself was strangely calm and when 
asked what she saw or remembered she replied that she had no memory of the event whatsoever all she 
could recall was this wind starting up and the next thing she knows she's finding herself getting 
up off the ground she never saw the object Mrs lamarand again said the Whirlwind was centered 
only around the children and as she says it was almost as though a huge glass container had been 
placed over them the area involved was so exact they estimate that the entire incident lasted 
about four or five minutes and it was witnessed not only by Mr and Mrs Lumar their three children 
and two other children but also by four neighbors so pretty widely viewed the main witness in that 
case the little girl who found herself rising up into the air is certainly lucky that that 
13-year-old boy was there and managed to grab her and pull her down before she got pulled up into 
this object or perhaps unlucky on the way depends on how you look at it who knows what would have 
happened if she had been taken on board and very likely may have been a wonderful experience for her but I guess we'll never know because it did not take place it was prevented and that itself 
is really unusual and the fact that so many people saw her rising up into the air underneath this UFO 
is really really strange it's an excellent case and let's move along I call this next case chased 
by a UFO this took place on August 24 1967 in wodonga Australia and it's a pretty interesting 
case involving a landed UFO humanoids and of course a gentleman who was chased by a UFO on his 
motorcycle it was a quite traumatic experience for him as we shall see it was about 5:00 p.m. again 
on August 24 1967 when Ron hdes was driving his motorcycle along the highway about 10 Mi south of 
wongo in Australia when suddenly without warning he was blinded by a brilliant blue white light 
shining down on him from above it was so bright he had to stop his motorcycle or risk an accident and 
as Ron says in his own words I took my sunglasses off and wiped my eyes and when I opened them there 
was a disc-shaped object about 100 ft away to my left off the road the object was silver on top 
quite a high polished silver and either a very dark gray or black underneath it was like two 
inverted saucers so basically your classic Flying Saucer in looking at it he first thought it had 
landed on the ground but realized it was actually hovering very low maybe three or four feet off 
the ground very much intrigued he decided to get closer but at that exact moment a car drove by and 
he took his eyes off the object for just a second the car went by Ron looked back at the object 
and was shocked to see that there were now two figures standing next to it each of these figures 
was about 5T tall and dressed in seamless metallic overalls as Ron says in his own words they appear 
to be dressed in the same aluminum type sheet as the craft itself had and they had helmets on 
just like a fishbowl popped on somebody's head at this stage starting to get a little frightened I 
took a step forward to see what would happen and they did the same then one of the figures the one 
on the left took another couple steps forward and lifted his hand up and beckoned me over 
now instead of approaching Ron reacted with fear as he says and I quote I then panicked and just 
dived on the bike whose motor was still running and took off down the road my idea was to put 
as much distance between myself and the object as possible suddenly however I heard a humming noise 
and straight away knew what it was looking up I saw the UFO following me at about 100 ft altitude 
and about 50 ft away I then tried to flag down a couple of cars and point the object out to them 
but none responded so he's quite alarmed at this point and he became even more apprehensive when 
the saer stopped chasing him but actually zoomed ahead of him and hovered above the highway as if 
laying in weight so Ron reduced his speed to about 3 to four miles per hour very slow and 
waited to see what the UFO would do next and to his relief it tilted away from him then zoomed up 
into the sky at a 45 degree angle and was gone in a few seconds and he noted something very 
interesting as Ron says in his own words When the UFO leapt in front of me it was a pinkish sort of 
color just as if it was reflecting the sun's rays which was not the case since the coloring was all 
over the object not just on the side facing the Sun but just before it tilted and shot off it 
became a brighter and brighter red and became so bright it hurt your eyes to look at it it was like 
looking into the sun when it took off there was no acceleration one moment it was stopped and the 
next it was just up and gone so Ron hides was interviewed by researchers who were unable to 
locate any other Witnesses but did say that there was a wave of UFO activity going on at the time 
throughout the country definitely a strange case and yes it is a single witness so we are pretty 
much stuck with taking this gentleman's word for what he saw but again there was some corroboration 
in the fact that there was a wave of sightings going on in the area at that time time and his 
account certainly matches up with what so many other people are experiencing across the world 
it's a fascinating case in a lot of different ways I can only imagine what it must be like to be 
driving along and see a landed UFO and humanoids right alongside the road well here's another case 
I called this next case the aliens in front of the house this one took place sometime around October 
or November of 1974 in a little town called a France and it's a really interesting case I think 
the description of the alleged ETS that is the most interesting thing about this case but it's 
also interesting in the fact that they were seen during midday in an area where you'd never think 
they would be right in front of someone's house and two witnesses as well it was around 2 p.m. 
on a beautiful Sunday afternoon when two young men known only as elain G and Patrick V decided 
to take a drive out of the town of a France and they were about to leave the town when they saw 
five strange figures in the courtyard in front of a house now three of these figures were a short 
distance away one was right in front of the house touching the house in a weird way but one was very 
close to them in the middle of the courtyard and was actually facing them and looking at them he 
was no more than 10 ft away and these figures were strange they were all about 4T tall dressed in 
Long robes or dresses decorated with multicolored spots their skin was not normal it was a strange 
quote earthy yellow in color and all had long hair down to their waists their noses were weirdly 
compressed they had flat mouths which they never opened but it was their eyes that most impressed 
the witnesses they were very strange these were big round eyes completely black very large about 
the size of billiard balls definitely not normal and Alaine who was in the passenger seat opened 
his window to get a better look at this being who again was right next to the car at this point the 
being next to the car gestured with his arm and hands seeming to indicate come that was Elaine's 
impression certainly which caused him and of course Patrick who was driving to completely 
Panic Elaine screamed out move it move it not at this time the car engine was turning very slowly 
but Patrick managed to put the car in Reverse turn turned around and raced back into town 
a few minutes later they returned with others to the spot but the strange Figures were gone 
there they never saw UFO so it's hard to say who these figures were however later UFO researchers 
did find another witness who apparently saw the same figures standing on the road in front of the 
same house and thought they were quote children dressed in yellow oil cloth which struck the 
witnesses being very strange uh he didn't see a UFO either it wasn't determined exactly if this 
was the same time but probably it was given that the description of the beings is very much the 
same I think you'll agree that is a very strange case with 4ot tall humanoids wearing these long 
robes that reach all the way down to the ground their appearance is really quite un usual the way 
they behaved uh I can't blame the two witnesses for taking off in fear uh they were very close 
to these strange Figures it's certainly an interesting case and it's also interesting because 
there was unknown to them another witness which brings a level of credibility to their account 
for sure and here's another case and this one is probably for me the most poignant of all the cases 
in this little collection I call this case don't let it get me and this does involve two witnesses 
though the primary witness is a 12-year-old boy it's occurred on October 28th 1976 in the small 
town of Lake View in South Carolina and boy what a case this is the reaction of the witness is truly 
incredible and as we'll see it does involve some apparent Landing traces as well Richard Leon Brit 
and his 12-year-old son Richie had just returned to their home in Lake View South Carolina after 
attending a baseball game it was around 10:30 p.m. again on October 28 1976 and they were standing on 
the front porch when they saw a bright light moving parallel just above the Treetops in in 
the woods right behind their house now it was a cold night so Richard the father stepped inside 
little 12-year-old Richie however remained outside and was shocked to see this object return and it 
was now close enough that he saw more than just a light he could see red green and light blue lights 
coming from what looked like an object he said it was spinning counterclockwise and then It reversed 
direction and spun clockwise and he was wondering what the heck this thing was when suddenly without 
any warning it flew down and directly towards him stopping right in front of him right in front of 
their porch at this point it was only a few feet away from him the colored lights went out instead 
the entire object glowed white was totally silent no engine noise at all and of course it was more 
than just a light it now revealed itself to be a saucer shaped craft it has smooth silvery aluminum 
surface and it was about the size of a large car the perimeter of the lower part of the craft was 
lined with what looked like triangular Port holes but in the middle upper portion there 
was one very large triangular-shaped window and looking at uh Richie through this window was a 
figure and this figure had pale white smooth skin two very dark eyes long arms which ended 
he said in what looked like claw-like hands and he said this figure had no visible neck its head 
was just stuck right on this shoulders and as Richie says in his own words whatever it was 
was in the middle looking at me so Richie took a few steps back and realizing that he was seeing 
something completely alien to anything he's ever experienced before he became utterly overwhelmed 
with fear and began screaming now his father came running out and found Richie on the porch 
still screaming absolutely hysterical uh he looked around but there was no evidence of anything there 
he did not see the UFO and the alien they were already gone but as he says the Father Richard 
quote he was real hysterical almost out of his mind he kept saying it was horrible don't let it 
get me now Richie at this point was too upset to even talk he could not explain what happened his 
entire body was shaking violently and he almost appeared to be in a trance and unable to figure 
out what was wrong with him his parents called the police and and their Doctor James twamley police 
officer Kermit pagee arrived first and said and I quote the boy was hysterical but what he saw I 
don't know officer Paige searched the area around the house but found nothing unusual at this point 
the doctor arrived Dr James twamley he examined richy and decided to take him to his office and 
give him a sedative because as the doctor says he was hysterical I don't think he was faking 
the hysteria his emotions were uncontrollable and as Richie's father Richard says it was the next 
morning before he could tell the story so he went to sleep woke up the next morning and only then 
was he calm enough to explain what had happened and he explained how this UFO had come right up to 
him and that it wasn't the UFO that really scared him as he says it was the creature itself and 
Richie said that he had never been that scared in all his life cuz he had the feeling it was coming 
to get him now Richie was also questioned by his Pastor Reverend John Wilkinson who said I heard 
him out and the Reverend came away absolutely convinced that something extraordinary had 
happened to the the boy Richie and that Richie was being truthful uh he did appear to be other 
than very frightened by what had happened but yeah believed him and as Richie's mother said a lot of 
people said if it hadn't H happened to Richie I wouldn't have believed it so he had a great 
reputation he was not someone who told Tall Tales but there was actually physical evidence in fact 
that night their dog howled very loudly something he had never done before also the next morning 
they found a 15x 20t area directly below where the saucer had hovered that was completely free of 
frost while everywhere else the frost was as white as snow now asked later how this sighting affected 
him Richie said and I quote it doesn't bother me that much but I do look up at night when I go out 
a really remark a case unfortunately the main witness has passed away so we can no longer ask 
him about what happened and how it affected him or if he's had other encounters but wow what a case 
I mean I can only imagine how scary it must have been for him but thankfully he did appear to be 
just fine now let's move on to this next case and this one is a doozy I call this one the Italian 
robot because it does appear that these Witnesses and there were a lot of them saw a robotic type 
being this occurred on August 31st 1977 outside of the town of avalino Italy and it's a truly amazing 
case uh particularly because it does involve so many witnesses but also because it was observed 
for such a long period of time talking hours and because there are landing traces as well 
which bring a whole new level of credibility to this case this case which was investigated by 
well-known Italian ethologist Umberto Tarico and others involves more than seven adult Witnesses 
including a teacher a photographer a singer a machinist and three students it was about 12:30 
a.m. when Roco cerulo and Michelle giovanello both 24 24 year-old students were walking along 
the road between Sterno and frento and noticed a bright red light on a hill which overlooked the 
road looking up they saw more lights a green light and two white lights above the red one 
which were apparently attached to some kind of craft that wasn't perfectly clear at the 
at this time but at the same time they saw this they heard a strange warbling or beeping noise 
and moving closer to get a better look they were shocked to see a figure wearing silvery metallic 
overalls which reflected brightly in the Moonlight it was standing still between two trees and then 
without warning took two sudden steps towards Rocco and Michelle frightened the two students 
fled back to town and went to get more Witnesses so Rocco and Michelle decided to return to the 
site by car and brought with them machinist uro dambrosio student Antonio Puchi and their teacher 
and friend amalo Capo biano they reached the spot around 1 a.m. they estimate got out of the 
car and immediately heard that strange noise and spotted the strange figure which again appeared 
to reflect the moonlight on its silvery suit they freaked out while five of them ran back to the car 
then Gathering their courage they marched back up the hill towards this figure this time the figure 
again began to walk towards them all five of the men ran away piled into the car and took off they 
decided that they would return to town to get some powerful flashlights which they did they got some 
flashlights one returned to the site this time with two more people a 38-year-old singer by the 
name of Mario CYO and a photographer by the name of Michelle rollei they arrived at the spot around 
1:30 a.m. exited the car but this time left the engine running and to their amazement this figure 
was still there walking around yet it was in a different spot now and they approached to within 
75 ft and shown the flashlight on this figure at which point the figure stopped walking apparently 
startled by the flashlight beam and turned towards them the seven Witnesses could now see two kind of 
red orange lights blinking on the figure's head which was where its eyes would be and this scared 
them enough to encourage them all to run back to the car this time with the intention of calling 
the police but as they began to leave one of them asked what would happen if they called 
the police and the police arrived only to find nothing there they would be in trouble so they 
decided they would go back now for the fourth time this time as they approach the site they clearly 
saw a bright light landed on the hill and getting closer they could see it was actually a craft of 
some kind on the ground cylindrical in shape with dark vertical bands with light bands in between 
and a dome shape on top the same silver suited figure was still nearby and for the next hour 
the seven men watched this figure which shown its red orange eyes if that's what they were at them 
and occasionally turned towards them and gestured at them especially when they shown the flashlight 
on it at one time they gestured um they shown the flashlight on it and it gestured at them and then 
sent a bright beam of light back at them and this beam of light came from its head shown directly 
on the witnesses one of the men panicked shouting it's a laser it's a laser and this caused everyone 
to panic and again all of them ran towards the car in fear they reached the car realized they were 
fine it was just the light that had dazzled them it didn't hurt them in any way so they 
decided to return again to look more closely at this figure one witness describes this event he 
said we pointed the light of our torch towards the Martian and from the helmet came a great blinding 
light and we fled again so they got a really good look at it this time and together they judged its 
height to be about 7 to8 feet tall it did not have any neck that they could see but it was wearing a 
silver suit with what looked like a dark belt a few of them saw what they thought looked like a 
black sort of boxlike object attached to its upper right arm another weird detail the figure seemed 
to walk without bending its knees but was quite mobile and able to get around easily they also 
noticed something else this figure never turned its back on them always kept them in view and 
during this entire sighting they still heard that strange sort of modulated beeping sound and at one 
point also heard what sounded like Boulders being rolled around and all of them wondered if there 
were other entities there that they couldn't see who are making this noise so after an hour 
of this they decided to flee the scene and get more witnesses but when they reached Town it was 
about 3:15 a.m. everyone was asleep so the seven Witnesses returned for the fifth time and by then 
the object and the figure were gone now the next morning some of the witnesses began talking and 
news spread through this small town quite quickly eventually reaching mayor Alberto foroni and it 
was he who called the police the police were sent to the site with the witnesses all of whom were 
separated and questioned and afterwards the police told told the witnesses better that you forget all 
about it for the well-being of all some of them asked why and the police said that they were 
acting on quote Superior orders not long after this incident on September 3rd 1977 there was a 
press conference at the Town Hall UFO researcher Umberto Tarico and others began investigating and 
found out that other Witnesses had in fact seen strange UFO activity in the same area in the days 
before the encounter and going to the location where the craft had landed they found three 
Landing traces in the shape of a perfect isoceles triangle and judging from the hardness of the soil 
which was quite hard they estimated that whatever had landed there must have weighed about 40 tons 
and in fact some of the stones in these Landing traces these three spots were splintered and 
crushed into the soil now samples of this soil was collected in analyzed and shown to contain calcium 
carbonate magnesium iron and quartz but there was no solid conclusions as to whether this was 
natural or not now two of the witnesses Mario CYO and Michelle Rio Foley agreed to go under hypnosis 
which they did and relived the incident though no new new details were uncovered uh there was 
one city official who claimed it was all a hoax and that it was him actually dressed up in a suit 
which was easily dismissed by the witnesses who found that a laughable explanation and clearly an 
effort at debunking the witnesses speculated about the possibility of this figure being robotic due 
to its appearance and the way its legs never bent but this became quite a famous incident 
and in fact the landing site attracted so many onlookers at one point it had to be fenced off 
so what an amazing case that is with so many witnesses it's kind of funny how it started 
out with two witnesses they ran away brought more witnesses they got scared again ran away brought 
more witnesses I mean that happened four or five times it definitely has its humorous aspects 
though I imagine for the witnesses it would it's a different story U when you're that close to a 
landed UFO and an occupant I don't think the accusations of a hoax by the city official hold 
any water whatsoever was clearly an attempt to just hush this whole incident up as the police 
absolutely admitted that they were told to do so there's some very interesting aspects to that case 
uh indicating that there is a worldwide cover up of these types of events and that this sort 
of event probably happens a lot more often than we hear about but yeah what a case with 
so many witnesses and Landing traces it's just so strange and now we move on to the next case 
which is equally bizarre and quite fascinating in that a whole village became involved in this 
incredible sighting I call this one the ETS in the village and this occurred on September 1st 
1978 in a small village in Wales called angle SE and this is an incredible series of events which 
started out with several people in the area seeing a UFO hovering in the sky more witnesses watching 
this UFO come in for a landing more witnesses watching ETS traing through the fields and even 
more than that and this case like many of the others does involve some really interesting 
evidence in terms of animal reactions as well as apparent medical effects and Landing traces as 
well it was so widely viewed that it's very clear something extraordinary happened in this little 
Welsh village it was in in the small village of laned in angsley Wales that a series of U 
events left the local residents in an absolute uproar this is a case that was investigated by 
researchers Derek James and Martin kman it was around 5:30 p.m. on September 1st 1978 that Helen 
Roberts and Glenn Hughes were walking their dogs outside of the village when they noticed that the 
sky had an unusual red tint to it and they both remarked upon this weird circular Cloud white 
on top and sort of black on the bottom that was drifting all by itself across the sky they both 
thought it was very unusual but didn't think much of it until later because it was around 
8:00 p.m. that events escalated uh one of the witnesses was Betty Owen who was in her home at 
20 maze Athen Street when her neighbor knocked on the door frantically and told her come out 
quick there's something shiny in the sky so Betty ran outside and saw this silvery starlike object 
hovering fairly low in the sky she said the cows in her neighbor's yard were very agitated and 
although this light looked unusual she stared at it for just a few minutes figured it must 
be a star and went back inside meanwhile there were other Witnesses was just starting to get 
dark a group of boys William Jones Ellen Williams alen Smith and others were playing football along 
the same street in a field when they saw what was apparently the same light zip across the sky stop 
and descend vertically downwards it's around 8 8:15 at this point and there were three other 
boys nearby David Mark hesketh William Lewis Smith and Paul Jukes all age 11 who saw again apparently 
the same object close up as it descended into a Grove of trees they could now see that it was 
more than just a light it was in fact an object solid object bullet-shaped glowing red with a 
band of red lights around part of the craft and a white light on top and it had two what looked 
like Landing legs on either side and they were freaked out they wondered what to do and were 
talking among themselves when this object seemed to explode in light and now took on a circular 
appearance though it was still glowing red with a white light in the center was now at ground level 
and appeared to be vibrating now afraid two of the boys William and Paul fled the scene leaving David 
all alone and he know noticed at this point that the cows in the field next to them were going mad 
just going absolutely crazy and it was at this point that David saw two strange figures about 
6 feet tall each dressed in one piece suits and they were pretty close about 350 ft away and as 
David says in his own words they walked one behind the other the second figure being 10 
to 15 ft behind behind the first they seemed to be very tall although I could not make out the 
lower half of their legs hands or head this was due to the fact that Darkness was closing in but 
David could see that their jumpsuits were gray in color had a black vertical band around the Torso 
a red band above the waist again he couldn't see their heads or hands just the Torso but the figure 
in front he did see it held it its arms over its head and was shaking them side to side in a very 
peculiar manner David responded by shouting and waving back but the figures did not respond they 
had no reaction and just walked into the field by now this glowing object was no longer visible 
and freaked out he fled the area got a friend and decided that they were going to tell people 
and perhaps call the police meanwhile there was another witness Patricia Owen was outside her 
home at 27 ma Athens Street when the boy next door came up to her and said there was a flying 
saucer landed in the field so Patricia decided to go into her house up to the Second Story to look 
out into the field that the boy was talking about and looking out at a hedge about 300 ft away she 
was Aston to see three 6 tall humanoid figures slim wearing gray one piece Jump suits walking 
across the field she could only see their backs the suits covered them from head to toe but she 
knew these were not normal people uh she went outside told the boys to call the police uh it 
really upset her in fact she said the sighting upset her so much she wasn't able to sleep for 
a full week afterwards and I'll just let her describe this incident as she says I happened to 
look out of the window and saw three men walking across the field the cows were terrified of them 
and stampeded away they were wearing silver gray suits with a sort of cap on their heads which was 
attached to the suits they were all well over 6 ft tall but I only saw their backs and I was 
very frightened I ran to the Village to find my husband band other people were seeing all kinds of 
activity further corroboration came from Mrs Perry who around the same time as all of this heard 
three local boys shouting out about a UFO and she thought at first they were joking but seeing that 
they were serious she followed them and she saw this silver white object hovering over the field 
for about a full minute as it descended towards the trees and she started to walk back home when 
one of the original Witnesses David hesketh who had seen the beings came running out of 
the field saying that this object had landed at this point Mrs Perry heard the neighborhood dog 
barking furiously and she also noticed something else she says that following this sighting she 
had the worst migraine attack she had ever experienced she did suffer from migraines but 
nothing like this so that's apparently a medical effect and there were other Witnesses another 
witness John Roberts was out rabbit hunting on the other side of town and he very clearly saw 
this lit object descend and come downwards now of course by now the entire Village was buzzing with 
excitement and people were talking about all of these events uh the police had been called 
and arrived around 910 p.m. inspected the area but didn't find any evidence however events were 
still in progress cuz it was around 1 p.m. when Vivien Roberts and her boyfriend were sitting 
in their car near the church chatting when they saw a glowing object in the sky it disappeared 
and then another reappeared the second light disappeared and shortly later they saw a very 
distinct solid looking large triangular purplish object with two yellow lights on it and it was 
moving slowly overhead but was low enough to illuminate the churchyard with an eerie 
purple glow and according to Vivien the horses in the area were acting up she was quite upset 
as this object darted off she went to her house and found that her horses were also upset upset 
to the degree that they wouldn't even approach her which was very unusual and they were all sweating 
heavily now Vivian's boyfriend of course also saw this object and he said it performed a figure 
eight before zooming away at high speed and the Final End note to this is that around 1:00 a.m. 
viven who had been really upset and crying by the sighting woke up uh to hear strange foreign voices 
coming from the churchyard she said they were making weird ooing noises in what sounded like 
a foreign language she said it sounded like there was a dozen of them so that quite frightened her 
now later investigators did interview many of these Witnesses and they did find a flattened 
circle of barley in the field where this craft had apparently landed and they said it looked like it 
had been pressed down from above so some pretty impressive Landing traces as well so there you 
go at least 20 Witnesses saw this object fewer saw the beings themselves but certainly enough 
witnesses to provide excellent confirmation of a truly extraordinary UFO and ET visitation so 
an amazing case in a lot of different ways and let's move to the next case and this one is also 
equally extraordinary really quite strange in that it took place in a very crowded urban area I call 
this one the saucer on the back porch this does involve two witnesses Landing traces as well and 
it's an extraordinary case where a UFO landed in a place you would never think this occurred 
on February 7 1981 in the Richmond District of San Francisco California and wow it's such an 
interesting case this is our last case of this collection and the main witness is Cindy Gaffney 
who was 8 months pregnant and it was around 4 a.m. on the morning of February 7 1981 again in 
the Richmond District of San Francisco California when a loud humming noise woke her up and looking 
out the two-story window of her home on 27th Street she was shocked to see that a flying 
saucer had landed on the cemented back porch of her neighbor's house and as Cindy says in her own 
words it was 4T High approximately 8 or 10 ft long it looked like coffee saucers two of them upside 
down and next to each other the classic Flying Saucer shape was white and had a very slight 
fluorescent glow no windows no wheels gizmos no nothing just a plain white glowing saucer 
now the sound she said was a quote very deep loud humming noise and then when it was actually on the 
ground it went H H so was sort of this pulsating humming noise so she quickly woke up her husband 
Carl who unfortunately was badly nearsighted and couldn't find his glasses so all he saw was the 
outline of this object and looked for his glasses still couldn't find them but did verify that this 
object was there and was also making this loud buzzing noise so Cindy's in a complete Panic at 
this point she called the police told him that a flying saucer had landed in their neighbor's 
backyard and she was looking at it the police didn't believe her or weren't interested and the 
saucer was still there um after about 10 minutes she she decided to go downstairs and wake up her 
brother who slept in the converted garage but when she turned the lights on the craft apparently took 
off because the humming noise was gone and when she looked outside so is the craft but looking at 
where it had landed she saw a round white mark on the cement of her neighbor's backyard the 
next morning they knocked on the door of their neighbor who is a Mr Ross macarov and he didn't 
come out at first he was sleeping in but when he finally did she told told him what happened 
and he was skeptical he didn't believe it Cindy however SI insisted that she saw the craft in fact 
she called the California Academy of Sciences who also like the police showed no interest 
and told her to call the newspaper which she did which is how we heard about this case at all now 
reporters did interview her and the neighbor Ross maerov and again he said he hadn't heard or seen 
anything but Cindy said she did and she stuck to her story as Cindy says in her own words I'm 100% 
sure I saw this I don't smoke dope I don't drink I don't hallucinate and I damn it saw that thing 
land there and I'm scared to death of it I saw it there you go that witness is not backing down she 
insists that she saw this UFO land on someone's back porch her neighbor's back porch and her 
husband saw it too so it's hard to dismiss given that there is apparent Landing traces there as 
well although the person whose porch it landed on doesn't believe it well he didn't see it so 
I can't blame him but certainly an interesting case and it shows that UFO encounters can happen 
anywhere that's the last case I got for you tonight but certainly these 10 cases do have 
some important takeaways they show once again that this is a global phenomenon they show that 
this is something that has been happening for a very long time they show the wide variety of ETS 
people are seeing the many interesting ways UFOs and ETS behave that often sometimes they do want 
to be noticed and just plain f fascinating in so many different ways so I hope you've enjoyed the 
show for tonight I hope you've learned something perhaps and found it entertaining at the very 
least but I would like to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep 
searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye now.
