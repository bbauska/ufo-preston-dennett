UFOS AT THE DRIVE-IN
Mar 14, 2021

Summary:
Mar 14, 2021
Just imagine: you’re watching your favorite movie at the local drive-in theater when suddenly you see a strange flying object swoop down from above and hover right over the movie screen. The object is metallic, saucer-shaped, with portholes and colored lights, and is totally silent. It’s a UFO! Cars start honking and flashing their lights. People exit their cars, pointing and screaming. Some drive away in terror. Then the UFO starts to move around over the theater putting on a show that’s far more interesting than the movie itself! 

It may sound like science fiction, except it’s true! This video presents dozens of firsthand cases in which UFOs have targeted drive-in theaters. In these cases, UFOs hover at very low levels for long periods of time, and are observed by hundreds of witnesses. Often there are strange electro-magnetic effects. Sometimes humanoids are seen. 

• ARIZONA, APRIL 1952: A metallic structured object hovers over the Yuma Drive-In Theater in Arizona, not once, but multiple times. 
• CALIFORNIA, AUGUST 1952: Visitors at the Terrace Drive-In undergo an incredible encounter, causing an investigation that reaches the highest levels of government.
• MISSOURI, JULY 17, 1954: Peter Davenport and hundreds of others sight a glowing object at the Skyline Drive-In. Davenport later becomes the director of NUFORC.
• MASSACHUSETTS, MAY 1963: A fleet of eight UFOs appears over the Wellington Circle Twins Drive-In, and puts on a display lasting an incredible 45 minutes long.
• GEORGIA, JUNE 29, 1964: A large metallic saucer swoops repeatedly over the crowded Atlanta Drive-In, causing the audience to flee in panic.
• OHIO, MID-1960s: UFOs swoop so low over the Mentor Drive-In that the movie is shut off so that the audience can enjoy the unexpected bonus show in the sky above.
• KANSAS, 1966: Hundreds of people see a UFO hover directly next to the Southutch Drive-In, causing the entire audience to chase the object down the highway.
• CALIFORNIA, 1972: The audience at the Paramount Drive-In flees in panic as a metallic saucer swoops down and hovers right next to the movie screen.
• FLORIDA, 1973: When a metallic UFO hovers over the Fort Lauderdale Drive-In, the audience is amazed to see strange occupants peering from the portholes.
• NEW YORK, 1974: Viewers at the East Park Drive-In are stunned to see a UFO hover over the parking lot and start sending beams of light onto the movie screen itself!
• OHIO, 1974: A UFO targets the Ascot Park Drive-In, blacking out the movie and causing the entire audience to become hypnotically entranced.
• MAINE, JUNE 15, 1975: A UFO buzzes the audience of the Portland Twin Drive-In Theater, causing the audiences for two separate movies to race away in fear.
• CHINA, JULY 7, 1977: Three hundred people are injured and two are killed when a low-flying UFO targets an open-air showing of a movie to a crowd of 3000 people.
• CALIFORNIA, 1983: The entire audience panics and drives away when a UFO swoops down and hovers right next to the movie screen of the Edgewood Drive-In.
• OHIO, SEPTEMBER 2004: The entire audience observes a UFO which hovers above the Wilmington Drive-In and stays there for the entire length of the movie.

There are too many cases to deny. This area of UFO research has been ignored for too long. Something profound is happening here. This video reveals a bizarre type of UFO behavior that only a lucky few have ever seen. So, come along on a fascinating journey that is sure to change the way you feel about UFOs.

hello everyone and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal today's episode is called 
ufos at the drive-in imagine you're at a drive-in theater enjoying the movie with 
hundreds of other people when suddenly an unidentified flying object drops down out 
of the sky and hovers right above the screen itself and then it starts flashing its lights or 
releasing smaller craft or darting around at amazing angles this is the kind of encounter 
i'm talking about this is not a random flyby of an object at night in these cases these objects 
are at very low levels 50 feet perhaps right above the movie screen or on either side of it 
often these are very long lasting encounters uh 5 minutes 15 minutes 
half an hour an hour or even the entire duration of the movie itself thirdly and most importantly 
these objects don't just hover there they put on some type of display or show 
it's clear they want to be seen I think that's exactly what their agenda is it appears that 
ufos are using drive-in theaters as a method to announce their presence to humanity at large 
i've documented more than a hundred cases of this kind surprisingly I did not find these in ufo books only a couple of them did I find there 
most of these come from local newspaper accounts or the archives of various ufo organizations 
i think most people do not know about these cases or this phenomenon it certainly shocked me even 
though I have investigated several of these cases myself I did not realize it was a thing 
but it definitely is ufos are absolutely targeting theaters on purpose and showing themselves off 
to audiences of hundreds of people and that's what i'd like to talk about today 
before I get into the actual cases let me just give a little bit about a little bit of background about driving theaters themselves for those who haven't been to one 
driving theaters were invented in 1930s but became very popular in the 50s 60s and 70s in fact they 
were america's number one past time theater owners offered all kinds of extras to attract 
audiences they had prize giveaways petting zoos balloon rides pre-shows of all kinds 
many of them offered playgrounds or bleachers most of them had elaborate snack stands 
in fact uf drive-ins not only attracted families they were also very attractive to 
young lovers young couples uh and many theater owners were actually would hire police officers 
who would walk between the aisles with flashlights to make sure no one in the cars were behaving 
quite inappropriately at any rate by the 1980s driving theaters declined dramatically before 
there had been thousands of them today there are only a few hundred due to the invention of 
vcr and digital entertainment but they're still hanging on and in fact they're making a comeback 
and a hundred cases that I was able to document some have occurred in recent times so this is a 
very interesting phenomena that I don't think most people know about and what i'd like to do is take 
you on a little chronological journey through some of the more interesting cases and show you 
how ufos are using drive-in theaters as a method to announce their presence to humanity at large 
and sort of sliding under the radar and not causing huge waves in society 
so many many cases and the earliest one I could find occurred on july 22 1950 
at the starlight theater in spartanburg north carolina the main witness was a journalist by 
the name of vernon gwynne who with his wife witnessed a dirigible-shaped object 
glide by the theater and then it returned a second time and when it came back a third time it was clear that it was targeting the theater itself 
and it came back a fourth time at which time it was very low and he got a good view at it 
he and his wife jumped out of the car they alerted other people at the theater who also saw it 
and all agreed that it was an unexplained object cigar shaped had a silvery white appearance with a 
rounded bottom and was totally silent what's very interesting is uh vernon gwynne reported his case 
to the air force it was routed to project blue book and it went from blue book get this 
straight to the very head of wright-patterson air force base and in fact it was sent by blue book 
to colonel john meads who was the commanding officer at wright-patterson air force base 
which by the way is sort of ufo central where our government studies foreign technology 
and wright-patterson has been deeply implicated in the ufo phenomenon I have many cases I want to 
share with you so i'm going to go through some of them kind of quickly and spend more attention on some of the more interesting cases the 1950s was extremely active for cases of this kind 
the next case I could find also occurred in 1950 at the fair park drive-in this is in montgomery 
county alabama the main witness was sheriff aubry yates who was with his wife at the theater when 
they saw this object drop down out of the sky and hover quote right above the screen 
where it stayed for the next 15 minutes before suddenly darting off straight upward 
the witness later found out that a number of people had reported this sighting and that the air local airport had also received calls uh and uh it appears that these ufos are sort of using driving 
theaters and touring the country much like a musician perhaps or an author doing a book 
tour and are just showing themselves off at one theater after another the next case I could find 
was october 24th 1950 in knoxville tennessee at the skyway drive-in when a security chief by the 
name of william b fry and his family observed a glowing object it had beautiful colored lights red 
green blue and orange and it moved back and forth above the theater for 37 minutes 
before finally moving away so again we see this display type behavior 
another case from montgomery alabama was on july 8 1951 at the fairview drive-in 
a military officer from maxwell air force base which was nearby saw a shaped object 
which he estimates was about 50 maybe 75 feet wide glowing bright blue and it was a thousand 
feet high it approached the theater and was kind of wobbling and floating and suddenly darted away 
that case uh it was one of the more brief types of cases I would call really the 1950s the pre-show 
because the cases were interesting but they soon became far more dramatic in the 60s and 70s
next case i'd like to talk about occurred on april 16th 1952 at the yuma drive-in in yuma 
arizona the main witness was sally ann diggs and her boyfriend who was a lieutenant gerald williams 
and they were at the theater on a date when this classic flying saucer showed up 
it had yellow and red lights and uh was clearly metallic totally silent and it just 
came right up to the theater and went right by it very slowly and obviously in full view 
they ended up calling the local air force base who sent over a public information officer to 
sort of debunk the case and tried to make it look like the witnesses had hallucinated 
the event unfortunately he couldn't go too far because it turned out that sally ann diggs father 
was colonel edward diggs who was just about to assume command of yuma air force base 
but at any rate they tried to debunk it as much as they could with sally ann diggs father 
uh being present during the questioning what's very interesting about this case is only if uh 
14 days later or 11 days later actually there was another sighting over the drive-in theater 
and it involved a number of glowing red discs that were spinning and rotating and darting by 
the theater uh they ended up seeing a total of seven or eight of these things which were dart 
down and then dart back upwards again we had that weird kind of display type behavior another case 
from the 1950s july 17 1952 the starlight drive-in in rapid city south dakota the main witnesses were 
sergeant gordon anderson and his girlfriend lee gerber they both observed two v-shaped objects or 
two v-shaped formations I should say of orange discs move over the theater there were 24 objects 
in total and uh they reported uh the sighting to their superiors at the near by air force base who 
should have been able to see these objects because it was not far away but the officials 
at the air force base said that they had no knowledge of these objects researcher lauren 
gross who researched this case was collecting ufo reports and he writes and quote one would think 
that air base officials would be well aware of two formations of aircraft flying over the field 
at 10 in the evening apparently no such thing took place so that explanation was not suggested
so many cases from the 1950s here's another one on july 22nd 1952 at the fresh pond drive-in theater 
in newton massachusetts a gentleman was at the theater his name was nicholas jacobson and he 
saw four or five bright objects approaching and as they always do this was in perfect view of the 
his eye line right above the screen itself and as these objects approached the theater they suddenly 
slowed down turned sharply and zoomed straight upwards as the witness nicholas jacobson says 
it's a peculiar thing to see you can hardly believe it when it's happening but that once again 
there we have that weird sort of acrobatic type behavior when these objects approach the theaters 
uh july 30th 1952 the sedalia drive-in in sedalia missouri numerous people called the local 
newspaper to report this red glowing disc-like object which was hovering in a vertical position 
and passing over the theater that remained in view for about seven minutes that case actually did get 
into the newspapers and newspaper reporters wrote future attraction at the drive-in is not a movie
uh again these are early cases may seem dramatic but they're truly not uh soon activity would ramp 
up in a amazing fashion uh but in the 1950s again it's just the pre-show here's a really excellent 
case though which occurred at the terrace drive-in in bakersfield california on august 12 1952 
lieutenant jenkins was at the terrace drive-in and uh he and about 600 other people 
uh the theater had space for 650 cars saw this cigar-shaped object dropped down out of the sky 
without any warning and it hovered right above the screen itself this point it flashed its lights 
at the audience or perhaps they were portholes as some people thought at any rate everyone agreed 
that this was a metallic object right above the screen uh it was highly visible and uh 
totally silent and hovered there for just a few moments before darting off like a bullet in the 
other direction what's interesting about this case is lieutenant jenkins called the local 
sheriff's office sheriff leroy hatfield answered the call and took down a description hung up the 
phone and the phone rang again it was another person uh who had seen a ufo at the theater 
and after receiving two more calls and the phone kept ringing uh sheriff leroy hatfield 
went down to the theater itself and interviewed more than 30 people who had seen this object 
there was more than 100 people still there talking about it and after interviewing like 30 people he 
said that's enough i've got a clear description of what happened and he wrote up a report and sent 
it to the local air force base it was routed to project blue book at edwards air force base here's 
where it gets really interesting this report which was marked action was sent the very next day to 
the air technical intelligence command at wright-patterson air force base 
these the atic took cases that bypassed blue book because of matters of national security 
what's also interesting is this report was also sent to enter air force base in colorado 
where we track all air traffic and also to the very highest level of government 
the director of intelligence at washington dc so once again we see that these cases are being reported to very high levels of government
next case i'd like to talk about took place also 1952 on august 13 1952 at the rodeo drive-in 
theater in tucson arizona the main witness is captain stanley thompson who is an 
engineer at edwards air force base actually and was visiting with his family when a group 
of lights passed over the theater in this case they were quite high up about a thousand feet 
and he couldn't tell whether these were you know a thousand feet high and smaller objects or maybe even higher and much larger but this is a case that might qualify 
as a random flyby because it wasn't super low level and it didn't put on any type of display 
type behavior so some of these cases it does seem that luck is playing a factor but in most 
cases no theaters are being directly targeted and some sort of a show is put on as we'll see 
when we get to some of the more dramatic cases in just a sec just a just a bit so next case took 
place on august 15 1952 at the family drive-in theater in urbana illinois there was an air force 
lieutenant his wife and two children saw this reddish glowing uh light and it was much larger 
than a star when suddenly it drops down over the theater makes a sharp 90 degree turn and zips away
so I started to wonder what is going on here in these cases why are they doing this perhaps they're just curious about the movie could they be watching the movie 
are they interested in these huge bright screens and these very powerful beams of light 
or maybe they're drawn towards these huge parking lots filled with cars with people sitting in them 
at this point I still wasn't wasn't quite sure what was going on here but as I collected more 
cases it became pretty apparent that there was an agenda on the et's part to announce their presence 
here's another case which took place at the corral drive-in in lubbock texas in august 1952 when 
frank hoenig and his wife and others at the theater saw spots of light moving at high speed 
above the theater this does seem to be sort of a random flyby but what's really interesting is 
while this was hovering over the outdoor theater people in the indoor theater in lubbock texas were 
watching the movie quote a thing from another world so while people who are watching a movie 
about a thing from another world in the indoor theater people in the outdoor theater were actually watching a thing from another world uh so every couple of months it seems ufos 
would find another theater to drop down and put a display over the next case I could find occurred 
on september 9th 1952 at the yucca driving in gallup new mexico uh eddie bowman was with a 
bunch of other people when they all saw this bright bright light zoom by and as it reached the 
theater suddenly it dropped down to but instead of actually landing it darted upwards and away 
as uh the main witness eddie bowman says I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it but 
i saw it and the management admitted it was not on the regular program so as we go on the cases 
do become much more dramatic uh the next case i'd like to talk about occurred on july 17th 1954. 
uh the main witness was just a kid at the time a little boy by the name of peter and he was at a 
driving theater the skyline driving theater outside of st louis missouri with his mom 
and his brother uh they were watching the movie when suddenly this bright bright object showed up 
it was bright red oval shaped and was hovering not above the screen in this case but next to the 
parking lot it was so bright it cast an eerie red light over the entire audience everybody stopped 
watching the movie and jumped out of their cars and were staring at this thing in awe 
there was no real panic everyone was just completely awestruck and amazed and peter and 
the others watched this thing for about uh five minutes or so at some point people started to walk 
towards this thing at which point it started to move away slowly and then darted off like a bullet 
it turns out that peter's father also saw this object he worked in the local airport tower 
and was viewing the object along with other people using binoculars well peter came from 
a military family he had several air force pilots in his family and he had already had a 
strong interest in aircraft of all kinds and this incident instilled within him a deep interest in 
ufos and he wasn't a ufo investigator but kept in touch with the ufo phenomena and did know 
several prominent investigators and in fact he was friends with the guy who started the organization 
the national ufo reporting center new fork uh the gentleman's name was bob gribble robert gribble 
and uh robert gribble one day approached peter and said you know what i'm gonna have to give up 
new fork it's just too much work for me I can't run it anymore and peter who you know 
as an adult at this time offered to take it over and he did and that's how peter davenport became 
the director of new fork it was because of this sighting he had as a little boy at the theater in 
st louis missouri at the skyline theater in st louis missouri so it's an interesting 
case and shows how these kinds of displays can profoundly influence people even years afterwards 
real interesting case occurred on august 21st 1954 at the lake shore drive in in denver colorado when 
an air force pilot who was at the theater saw more than a dozen red lights this does appear that they 
were just flying by the theater but what's interesting is this officer reported to the 
air force and he got a response back from a gentleman by the name of chester a cummings 
from the osi the office of special investigations who showed a strong interest in his report 
because these objects were clocked at moving several thousands of miles per hour
there are so many cases another case I want to talk about occurred in 1956 
at the florence drive-in this was on september 9 1956 and as the newspaper article said 
the best show was not on the screen but in the dark sky 
and what happened was uh a plane was flying over the theater and right behind the plane all the 
audience members could see a ufo following it and as it's following this plane it suddenly darts 
away and then when another plane started to fly over the theater it came zooming back and followed 
it again as one of the witnesses jack julie says it was the most unusual thing i've ever seen 
so again it appears that they want to be seen I mean for example here's another amazing case 
which occurred at the piedmont theater in atlanta georgia this was on september 26 1957 when dozens 
of people at the theater saw this quick moving object one of the witnesses walter marks says that 
this object suddenly stopped over the theater and sent down a beam of light and then it darted away 
so again it clearly wants to be seen what's interesting about this case is only hours earlier 
a ufo perhaps the same one had been seen twice over the saint agnes 
college where it also put on a low level display so it went from a schoolyard 
right over to a movie theater so this is again why I think they're trying to announce their presence
another interesting case occurred in 1957 and this was at the three-way 
drive-in at the junctions of highway 878 and 191. this is in clifton arizona november 3rd 1957 
the witnesses were larry parsons and mary chapman and they described this disc shaped silver object 
which caught everyone's attention as it moved very quickly overhead now this is 
not far from the town of morenzi which has a copper smelting plant which has attracted 
a number of sightings and I thought perhaps that's what's going on in this case 
because that's something I did look for perhaps you those air force bases or is there anything around these driving theaters that is attracting these ufos and in a few cases perhaps yes but no 
in most cases driving theaters are in relatively rural locations outside of major city centers 
and that is where the ufos show up and for that matter there are a few cases 
of drive-ins in heavily densely populated areas and the ufo still stops over the theater itself 
so here is another good example november 6th 1957 the king's center twin driving theater grace 
lester and many others saw an extremely bright light and it appeared to be zigzagging across 
the sky they reported it to the local newspaper and it turned out that many other people saw it 
including at least six police officers and this could you know this was a brief sighting so but 
uh fairly low level and once again widely viewed i'm not sure if it was specifically targeting the 
theater in this case because so many other people saw it but it's clear that it did want to be seen 
but things were about to ramp up I mean once again this was the pre-show 
but now things were really starting to get very interesting for example the next case august 18th 
1959 at the waterford drive-in in waterford michigan wanda burl and her husband kenneth 
were watching the movie alias jesse james and all mine to give a double feature when suddenly 
two objects dropped down out of the sky and hovered at a very low level over the theater 
they remain for at least 10 minutes long enough for people to get out of their cars 
and watch these objects as they put on a display darting around streaking away coming back towards 
them making u-turns as uh the witness says is wanda says we were agog it was unbelievable there 
was a human intelligence about the whole thing or superhuman they reported it to the local newspaper 
the pontiac press who wrote the headline flying discs seen in the area give bonus show at drive-in 
so that is a good clear example of sort of your standard ufo drive-in theater encounter
next case i'd like to talk about took place at the tilley com theater in victoria canada 
this is one of very few cases that took place outside of the united states this occurred in 1961 
when two objects appeared overhead and started to get brighter and brighter and brighter and soon 
they were so bright that the street lights went out and people were not able to watch the movie 
so instead they just watched these objects they got out of their cars as and just watched this 
thing for the next 30 minutes as it hovered there in the sky and after 30 minutes these objects 
started to put on a show this is when the show began the next 10 or 15 minutes one of the objects 
darted back and forth at very high speeds uh in an obvious display no one was watching the movie 
as one witness said there was no show to watch but that one so it's clear that I think ufos know that 
we're there to be entertained and they're like oh you want to see a show watch this in fact there 
was one theater the brackley drive-in theater in charlottetown on prince edward island in canada 
where ufo came so often throughout the late 1960s that the owners actually advertised put 
in their advertisement for the theater want to see a ufo come to the local brackley driving theater
so this is when I started to realize what's going on here and here was the case that actually 
made me decide that this was an intentional display put on by the ets in an attempt to 
announce their presence to a large group of people this next case occurred on in may of 1963 
the main researcher is george fawcett he's a very well-known pioneering ufo researcher highly 
respected and this took place at the wellington circle twin theater in medford massachusetts 
and according to the witnesses uh suddenly two disc-like objects showed up and hovered side by 
side next to the parking lot and a few minutes later two more disks showed up and slipped down 
beneath the original two which moved upwards and they hovered there for a few minutes when 
suddenly two more objects came followed by two more after that so now we have eight discs total 
a fleet really of uh these ufos these glowing discs and each are in two columns of four each 
and this is when the show kind of began the objects had finally all arrived and they 
hovered there for just a few moments when for the next 45 minutes these objects started to 
move in sort of a rotating musical chairs fashion dancing around the sky in these rotating patterns 
for 45 minutes so this was when I realized okay they clearly want to be seen they are putting on 
a show for the audience it's hard to escape this conclusion when there are so many cases like this 
and that's a very long lasting case 45 minutes so I don't think they're watching the movie i'm 
not sure that they're just curious about what the movie is or why the audience is there because why 
then would they move in this weird fashion behave in a way that makes it clear they want to be seen 
another amazing case occurred at the south side driving theater this was in fort worth texas in 
1963. the movie was tom jones and suddenly the witnesses were watching the movie when 
without warning this object rises up from directly behind the screen itself and it hovers for a few 
moments and then a second object rises up and then instantly both objects dart way dart away and uh 
it was very obvious to the witness uh and what they their comment was that the movie 
actually was not very good and the sighting itself was a lot more interesting than the movie
so here's another amazing case that i'd really like to share so far all these 
cases have been mostly what I would call close encounters of the first kind a simple sighting 
close encounters of the second kind affect the physical environment close encounters of 
the third kind are when people see entities are taken on board and some of these cases are not 
simple sightings they would qualify as close encounters of the second or third kind for example 
what happened at the richland drive-in theater in johnstown pennsylvania in 1963. 
the movie pre-show had just begun when everybody heard this very loud crackling sound 
and the speakers went dead shortly after the speakers went dead the screen itself went dead 
and then all the cars that were still entering the theater died and no electricity worked and 
this is when this huge object showed up as the witness reports and i'm quoting 
people got out of their cars and as we looked up there was an object the size of a football 
field coming across the sky it was shaped like a sphere almost like a stealth but five times as big 
there was a dome on its bottom that was illuminated and seemed to rotate there were greenish blue flames coming off the edges and it went right down the skyline 
uh this case was actually reported to new fork run by peter davenport and 
uh one of many cases that I did actually find at the national ufo reporting center
here's another incredible case which really shows how dramatic these cases can get this occurred on june 29th 1964 to an anonymous 
witness at a drive in theater in atlanta georgia I don't know the name of the theater 
but in this case uh the witness was a young kid he was there with his family and his cousins 
and they were sitting on the bleachers which were filled with a bunch of kids watching the movie when one of the kids shouts out hey look there's a ufo and the main witness I call trent 
looks up and sees this metallic saucer moving over the tree line several hundred yards away 
alongside the theater and then it disappears off into the distance behind some trees 
and suddenly everyone just seemed to forget about it and continued to watch the movie 
and which that in itself is kind of strange but we'll see that turns up amnesia does turn 
up in some of these cases uh but suddenly this ufo returned the kid shouts out hey look there 
it is again and this time the ufo was not off in the distance it was coming directly towards them 
at a very low altitude 50 100 feet high was a metallic saucer with colored lights on it 
and it was making a bee line for the theater and in a matter of less than a minute 
it was right over the theater and actually went right over the bleachers uh where all the kids 
were and trent the main witness and every child on the bleachers scattered in panic and went running 
for their cars uh trent had lost track of where his mom was parked and so he and his cousin ran 
to the snack stand and hid there for a few minutes and watch this panic ensue over the the theater 
and uh after a few moments he finally located his mom who was waving frantically at him 
and it crept out from the snack stand and looked up and was shocked to see that this object 
was hovering directly overhead it was very low level and about 30 feet in diameter he estimates 
and at this time people were screeching out of the theater just driving away and he ran got to his 
parents and got in the car and they screeched off it's a very dramatic 
encounter which shows that in some cases these low-level sightings will actually cause a panic
now here's another very interesting case which comes from researcher brian vike 
this occurred at the studio driving in culver city california in 1965 
and the intermission for the movie had just begun when a huge disc with lights around 
the edge suddenly appeared to hover above the screen and as the witness says it was fairly low 
but high enough that we had to bend our heads down to see it through the front windshield my husband 
and I were pointing and wondering when I looked around and saw others in cars nearby also looking 
and pointing it stayed for about two minutes and then banked off for about two or three seconds 
before just disappearing what's interesting about this case is the witness who reported this was six 
months pregnant at the time and didn't notice any strange effects until after her pregnancy 
when she said her she would uh hope be holding her child and she could feel a strange sort of 
electric buzzing sensation coming from her child's skin and when she felt that her first thought was 
that perhaps the ufo had quote beamed something into my stomach which may sound strange but there 
is in fact a very strong interest in ufos on the ufo's part in reproduction and many many 
cases do involve pregnant women so perhaps there is a connection there in this particular case
here's another example of how ufos will put on a show at a drive-in theater this was at the conway 
driving theater in conway arkansas in 1965 the witnesses were watching the movie cat blue when three lights appeared above and to the right 
of the screen and one of these objects uh started to fly figure eights around the other two 
then the other two flew off and the last object stayed for about an hour and finally 
the another object returned and parked right next to the first one and the objects remained 
for the entire duration of the movie so perhaps that in that case they were watching the movie 
hard to say one of my favorite cases occurred in the mid-1960s in mentor ohio 
this is a very interesting case it occurred it involves this cigar-shaped object which hovered 
over the theater for about a half an hour and it was there for so long that uh the owners 
turned off the movie some people in the audience were getting nervous about this ufo and afraid 
that it might see them and so they turned off the movie which nobody was watching anyway everyone's 
attention was on this huge cigar-shaped object that was hovering at a very low level over the 
theater parking lot so after watching it for about a half an hour this is when the show 
began this cigar-shaped object which was hovering in a horizontal position turned vertical assumed 
a vertical position and one by one started to release objects first two then four then six and 
finally it released a total of ten glowing disc shaped objects which started to dance around for 
a period of minutes uh 15 minutes or so darting at right angles hovering zooming back and forth 
putting on an obvious display and then suddenly they lined up like obedient school children and 
one by one zipped back inside the cigar-shaped mother ship the cigar-shaped ship then 
assumed a horizontal position and moved off so that was the case that for me really cemented 
the theory that these objects are intentionally showing off and putting on a display of some kind 
in an apparent attempt to announce their presence to a large group of people
here's another very interesting case which comes from researcher leonard springfield this occurred 
at a drive-in in dallas texas on september 25th 1966 when mrs farah saw a blue light darting back 
and forth over the theater after watching it dart back and forth several times this object suddenly 
divided into four separate lights which started vanishing and reappearing at different locations 
after uh this all occurred the witness actually called the local airport who denied 
any knowledge of this incident and she was insistent on reporting it and finally 
was able to locate researcher leonard stringfield who agreed to take a report
and now we move to perhaps one of my top three cases in this book I was able to interview this 
witness hand his name is pat mitchell and this occurred in south hutchinson kansas at the south 
hutch theater this was probably the summer of 1966 approximately he's not entirely sure of the date 
he was around 1819 maybe 20 years old when he and his friend decided that they were going to 
go to the south hutch theater to see the latest james bond movie and they got there early they 
got their popcorn they parked in the center of the parking lot got a really good seat up close 
and they attached their little detachable speaker onto their windshield and waited for the show to 
begin and the movie was great it was james bond it was very exciting when suddenly pat's friend 
shouts out hey pat look do you see that do you see that light and pat did see it because it 
appeared right above the screen right in eye view and was off in the distance and it was 
some distance away at this point just a little dot of light in the sky but quickly approaching and it 
approached directly for the theater and as it got closer and closer they could see that this was a disc shaped object and finally it was right next to the theater itself 
right next to the screen and it parked there below the level of the screen 
which was a large screen by the way this is a screen that was 50 feet high 120 feet across 
and pat estimates that this metallic saucer was probably about 40 feet nearly half the length of 
the screen it was very big and it was below the level of the screen itself it was in full view 
of the entire audience of hundreds of people and there was no panic everyone just stared in awe 
some people got out of their cars and looked at this thing pat says that this object had 
colored lights on it it was beautiful there were red lights yellow lights blue green 
which were sort of blinking around the circumference the perimeter and this object was 
parked there for about five minutes while everyone just stared at it when suddenly it began to move 
and this darn thing moved behind the screen itself uh pat estimates maybe 10 feet behind it once it 
was behind it it disappeared of course from view for just a moment and then came out the other side 
the left side it rose up a little bit maybe 100 feet or so and hovered there for 
another five minutes or so everyone stared at it and watched it totally silent and 
this thing then starts to move again it makes one full revolution around the entire theater 
almost as if to make sure everyone can see it or rounding everyone up and then it starts to head down the highway right above the highway at about 20 miles per hour 
nobody was watching the movie at this point and instead everyone started screeching out of the 
theater to follow this object pat and his friend joined a convey a convoy of some 20 to 40 cars 
traveling down the highway following this object for about six miles until it finally stopped 
and moved off the highway a little bit and moved up a little bit and hovered again for another five 
minutes next five minutes everyone got out of their car blocking the highway and just stared 
up at this thing by this point everyone was absolutely convinced that they were seeing a 
genuine flying saucer a ufo and after five minutes or so this object darts straight upwards it's 
a little dot of light in the sky and it's gone this sighting was the talk of the town for weeks 
several people said that they were going to report it to the newspaper which they apparently did pat had actually done some photography work for the local newspaper and 
he was excited to read the story in the newspaper but it we checked the next day there was no story 
and no story appeared the next day after that so he went with his friend into the newspaper office 
and asked them about it and reported his sighting and the the journalists that he talked to 
played dumb he says they acted like they didn't know about the signing and they said that they 
were not interested in doing a story on it and pat knew that other people had already gone there and 
reported the sightings so that seemed to be a lie and this is when rumors started flying around that 
perhaps the military showed up and stopped the story from being published hard to say but as 
uh we'll see it's not the only case where the military has apparently showed up it's a truly 
incredible case and I think it's very obvious that it's putting on a display of some kind 
here's another very bizarre case which wasn't widely viewed but I included it because 
it does seem to have a connection to a drive-in theater this occurred in 1966 at in 
bogalusa louisiana the main witness is a college student who had returned home 
her family actually owned this drive-in theater they owned and operated it and one evening the 
student returns home and the movie is already in progress so she decided that she was going 
to go behind the theater itself which was a very rural area and do a little night hunting 
and she went out there with her rifle and her headlamp and was hiking behind the theater she 
could see the movie playing she could see the cars she could see the projection booth she knew her parents were there she was just maybe a quarter mile away from it when she comes over a small rise 
and sees this ufo it's a classic flying saucer it's got huge two foot wide windows in front 
uh it's illuminated with bright orange light it's totally silent and hovering maybe 50 feet up 
and 100 feet away from her she does not have her headlamp turned on at this point so she's hidden 
who's ever inside this object apparently doesn't see her but she can see figures human looking 
figures as far as she can tell moving around inside they were wearing uniforms of some kind 
and she assumed that these guys must be air force because they looked human as far as she 
could tell the problem was they were inside a classic flying saucer which was totally silent 
some of them were operating the control panels and others were at the front near the windows and 
appeared to be watching the movie so the student the witness watched this for about 15 minutes 
and deciding that these were probably air force personnel she decided she was going to play a joke on them and she stood up and shined her lamp her headlight 
into this ufo and the reaction was instantaneous the yellow light inside the craft turned to red 
and the craft instantly made a loud humming noise very much like the electric transformer they used 
to power their theater and it took off it put on a red light and a green light on one side and 
moved off into the distance the student was a long distance runner she was taking running in track in 
college so she immediately took off running to the projection booth where her parents were working 
she found her father there and she quickly pointed out the object which was still visible in the sky 
and asked him what he thought it was and he looked at it and said it looks like a plane and she said 
no it couldn't be a plane it was totally silent it was saucer-shaped it was hovering about 50 feet up 
the ground right behind the theater and he kind of looked at her like she was crazy and she 
didn't talk about it to anyone after that for years but did finally report the case to mufon 
it's her conclusion that she probably saw air force personnel in some sort of test craft 
but i'm wondering if perhaps this was just human-looking ets which we do hear reports of 
because why would the air force be testing their ufo right next to a drive-in theater 
and would they really be watching a driving movie I don't know it's of course impossible 
to say for sure but it's certainly a very interesting case involving humanoids
okay here's another case from 1967. this occurred at the highland driving theater in 
salt lake city utah a silver metallic disc shaped craft appeared and was moving back 
and forth in front of the mountains and the witness who reported it said that everyone could 
clearly seeing this everyone was looking at it but no one talked about it no one said anything 
no one even seemed to really react and after it finally left everyone just returned to the movie 
as if it had never been there she thought could they have been in shock what's going on here 
but as we'll see in some of these cases people will actually forget that they saw the ufo or do not react in the way you think they would
uh here's another very interesting case which was reported to project blue book this occurred at an unnamed drive-in in duluth minnesota probably the skyline 
theater but the theater was not actually named so I can't be sure the main witness is lieutenant 
robert t rogers who is the director of air defense artillery for the 29th air division 
so a good witness a trained observer and he saw a disc shaped object appear 
and start darting around above the theater at an elevation of a few thousand feet he estimates 
he reported his sighting to superiors and his report was routed to project blue bug
an officer from project blue book lieutenant william b stocker prepared a report and sent it to 
his superiors at wright-patterson air force base and he wrote and i'm quoting the observer is known 
by this officer and is reliable the light did not resemble aircraft balloons do not go against 
the wind satellites do not fly under clouds and meteors do not stay in the sky for minutes or 
change course ball lightning is unlikely according to the weather officer citing is unexplained
his blue book superiors however disagreed they refused to mark this sighting unidentified and 
ordered him to look more deeply into the possibility that this could have been 
a balloon which it clearly wasn't but this just shows how project blue book was not 
a true objective investigative body but was in fact a operation a device 
used by the air force to debunk this phenomena using our own tax dollars several of these cases 
at drive-in theaters were reported to project blue book and not one of them was labeled 
unidentified next case that i'd like to cover occurred on august 12 1969 at the 
foothill drive-in in azusa california the movie was how the west was won and war wagon and this 
object appeared right above the movie screen and then suddenly darted off in this case it was so 
fast that no one else the theater seemed to notice it except for the people in at least one car and 
the mother refused to talk about it and uh the daughter was the one who reported this sighting 
another interesting case occurred in 1970 at the south side drive-in in youngstown 
ohio when an object appeared over the theater and started darting upwards and downwards left 
to right moving back and forth going in all kinds of different directions everyone exited their cars 
this object put on a dramatic show for about five minutes or so and then finally darted away there 
was an estimated 200 witnesses and after it finally left everyone just broke out into this 
incredibly loud conversation discussing what they saw and everyone agreed that it was a genuine ufo
another case i'd really love to discuss is one that I investigated personally the main witness is claudia blasios she worked at my office where I worked as a bookkeeper and doing 
data entry and this case occurred years earlier in 1972 when she was just a little girl she was 
at the paramount drive-in theater in paramount california with her parents and her little sister 
and suddenly claudia noticed that people were running by her car dropping the popcorn dropping their drinks jumping into their cars and screeching off she looked at 
her parents her parents were both entranced like hypnotized their mouths were hanging open and 
they were staring to the right of the screen and claudia who had not been paying attention looked 
outside and got a huge shock there was a giant flying saucer hovering right next to the right of 
the screen below the screen level and it was just sitting there so it was as if it was watching us 
watch the movie it was bright silver like a silver spoon she said it had colored lights on it 
it wasn't completely silent it was very quiet but it was making sort of a whooshing 
noise and everyone was just in a complete panic jumping into their cars and screeching off claudia 
and her family however were just stayed in their car and stared at this thing and here's where 
it gets weird she doesn't remember what happened next she doesn't remember this object leaving they 
don't remember going home that evening they don't remember really anything else about it and in fact 
didn't talk about it at all they completely forgot and it wasn't until some years later when she was 
a young adult when she was listening to the radio with her mom they were in the kitchen when someone 
came on the radio and started to describe his ufo sighting at the paramount driving theater 
and as he's describing it claudia realized that he was describing exactly what they saw 
so this is one of just a few cases from which there is independent corroboration from multiple 
uh witnesses and what's really interesting is claudia and her mom and uh the other family 
members completely forgot about this they had no memory of it and in fact 
claudia said mom we were there weren't we and her mom's like yeah that was strange I do remember 
that and claudia said well why didn't we talk about it and her mom said you know I have no idea 
so they didn't even talk about it I think in some of these cases there is amnesia that is 
imposed upon the witnesses and perhaps this is more than just a simple sighting well i'm 
certainly it is if there's amnesia problems but as far as anyone being abducted I don't have direct 
evidence of any missing time or anything like that but it's certainly a possibility
next case i'd like to talk about took place at the winnipeg airliner driving theater was also 
called the airport drive-in theater this was on july 7 1973 when a young dating couple observed a 
object that they described as having a brassy appearance a metallic sort of brass 
like appearance and it appeared directly above the theater maybe 100 feet above it and it 
arrived just as the movie began they jumped out of the car and looked at this thing and it 
quickly disappeared blending off into the darkness they ended up reporting this and 
were told by police officers that what they saw was probably the champs 
chicken advertising balloon which they totally disagreed with it was clear to them that this 
was a metallic object and they believe it was a ufo another very interesting case took place
in fort lauderdale the witness doesn't actually name the theater itself 
but it took place in fort lauderdale in florida in 1973 and he was at the theater with his girlfriend 
when this object appeared and it was a classic flying saucer how he noticed it was suddenly the 
person in the projection booth made an announcement he said hey everybody look there's a ufo hovering over the theater this is not a hoax it's a ufo look and the 
witness looked up and sure enough there was this metallic saucer it had lights on it had portholes 
and through the portholes you could see humanoid figures he wasn't able to tell whether these were 
regular people or uh unusual in any way because all he could see was a silhouette but it was clear 
that there were people inside this thing looking down at them and this object started circling 
the theater several times at a very low level everybody saw it he tried to get his girlfriend to 
see it but she was too frightened and she hid down underneath the car seat and refused to look at it 
and finally this object did move off but at some point the witness says military vehicles showed 
up shut down the movie and made everyone leave and told them not to talk about it I wasn't able 
to verify this uh this was a case that I found third hand however it does fit the pattern we've 
seen in many of these other cases where these objects hover at very low levels another very 
interesting case occurred in hinesville georgia to an army ranger by the name of derek smith 
he and his wife often enjoyed going to the drive-in theater in hinesville georgia and 
they were at the theater one evening when they saw a strange light behind the theater 
uh his wife pointed it out to him and they both watched this weird saucer-shaped object send down 
a beam of light and as they watched inside this beam of light they could see a humanoid figure 
being pulled up into it and after this humanoid figure was pulled up into this object 
the object darted off well they decided to leave the theater and see if they could find this object 
or see any more evidence of it and that's what they did unfortunately they didn't see anything 
but it's one of I think the only case really that I could find involving what appears to be 
an abduction of some kind and what's very strange is no one else at the theater seemed to notice it 
in this case which is definitely unusual in most cases everyone in the theater notices it
so now i'd like to talk about probably the ultimate case of this kind I talked to the witness first hand his name is scott santa and he was visiting the ascot park 
drive-in in cuyahoga falls ohio in august of 1974 he was with his friend he was just a young man at 
the time and they were watching the movie he doesn't really remember what the movie was 
but we're watching this movie when suddenly this object appears it was came from behind the screen 
right above it uh barely cleared the screen itself it was that low and it was huge it was a huge 
boomerang shaped object flat black there was no lights on it and it came and it moved directly 
over the screen and over the parking lot itself at which point all electricity in the entire 
movie theater driving movie theater went out the movie went black 
the snack stand lights went black all lights around the theater went completely black 
and there was this low thrumming noise but otherwise silent they got out of their car 
they looked at this thing scott says his ears actually popped as this thing moved overhead 
it was just total silence kind of fell over the theater what we now know as the 
oz effect everyone seemed almost zombified is how scott put it totally entranced and just stared at 
this thing which didn't appear to stop it just moved at a very slow pace 5-10 miles per hour 
low enough where he probably could have taken a rock and hit it is how he described it was very low and just moves over the theater and finally moves off away over the parking lot and 
starts to move out of view and once it finally leaves the premises suddenly all the electricity came by back on at once as if a switch was flipped the movie started 
the snack stand lights came back on everything just powered on at which point everyone strangely 
just got back into their cars and continued to watch the movie including scott himself 
and like everyone else he apparently just forgot about the sighting which sounds strange it sounds 
counterintuitive but this is what we see in these cases sometimes is this weird amnesia effect 
scott remembers visiting the restroom the snack stand after this but there was no talk of this 
incredible ufo sighting it had completely left his mind and nobody was talking about it and uh 
it was a couple of years later was when he was in a bookstore and saw this book unidentified 
flying object by edward j rupelt who headed project blue book and suddenly as if on cue 
his memory came flooding back in of this very peculiar incident at the ascot park drive-in 
and he remembered it all at once and just flooded right back into his mind and this is a really good 
example of how there can be weird amnesia effects unfortunately he was no longer in touch with his 
friend and he had no one else to ask because he didn't know anyone else who was at the theater 
so he's sort of been alone with this uh he did report his case to ryan sprague who included 
it in his book somewhere in the skies so this is one case that was published in a ufo book 
but it's an amazing case and it shows how there can be very peculiar effects 
this could be a close encounter not I mean at least of the second kind but possibly the third
scott has considered the possibility that there was missing time or perhaps a mass abduction he has no direct evidence of this and as of this point has not 
gone under hypnosis or anything like this but it's definitely one case of several that seem to have levels of mystery that have yet to be answered
so these cases can be very highly dramatic such as what happened on june 15 1975 at the portland twin theater in scarborough maine 
this object approached the theater it started from a distance moved over the local shopping center 
uh which is where the witness first saw it it was at a very low level at this point 50 feet maybe 75 
feet overhead and it moved behind the movie screen turned and hovered 15 feet directly above it 
at this point panic rained the theater which had been filled with cars quickly emptied people did 
not even bother to detach the little attachable speakers they just drove off in a complete panic 
until there was about 10 cars remaining including the witness and once this object had cleared 
out the parking lot remember this was a twin theater it rose up went over to the other screen 
parked above it and cleared out that parking lot so you can't tell me that it's not doing this on 
purpose that it's not showing itself off when it so clearly is and just judging by its behavior it 
wants to be seen in some cases people do react in panic which is what happened in this case
here's a case which shows government interference this occurred in belleville illinois in october 
1975 the movie was last tango in paris and suddenly everyone stopped watching the movie 
because two objects appeared and started darting around and putting on a display and in fact the 
display was so dramatic and long lasting that the theater owners finally turned off the movie 
because it was obstructing people's view and they no one was watching it they wanted to see these ufos darting around more than 100 people got out of their cars and watched these objects 
dart around until finally military jets appeared and chased the objects off
this next case is one of the cases that really got me wondering okay are theaters being targeted and 
it was one of the cases that made me decide to investigate this subject more deeply 
this occurred in july of 1976 over denver colorado at the mile high theater the movie was dr zhivago 
suddenly this metallic craft shows up it's got colored lights on it and this object comes right 
next to the screen stops and hovers there and suddenly it extends this weird sort of 
device out of the bottom of the craft which starts flashing super bright lights they were so bright 
that the witness said you couldn't actually look at them as the witness says and I quote 
everyone there saw a huge flying saucer rising up behind and somewhat to the left of the screen 
everyone got out of their cars and watched as this thing slowly rose and came to a complete 
standstill hovering finally it tilted at a 45 degree angle and darted away 
so yeah the 1970s is when these sightings really got dramatic another case i'd like to talk about 
occurred at the riverside drive-in this is in van der grift pennsylvania 
this occurred sometime during the 1970s date is unknown but the main witness joseph 
says and I quote I spotted something moving across the sky it would move left then right then up and 
down then all of a sudden it's shot straight up and out of sight it wasn't a plane that's for sure 
so again there's that weird behavior where it's putting on a show for the witnesses 
uh here's another case from colorado this occurred in boulder colorado in july of 
1976 when this object uh was visible off in the distance and was moving in this sort of weird 
winding meandering course back and forth but making pretty much a direct line towards the 
theater and as soon as it got close to the theater it made a beeline for the theater as if it was 
attracted to it which it clearly was because it stops and it hovered 200 feet over the theater 
this was quote a classic domed saucer it flashed lights that were too bright to look at 
it was almost painful the witness said to look at these lights and people in the audience reacted by honking their horns and flashing their headlights back 
at the object which does happen in a few cases and at this point the object darts off and moves away
here's another interesting case which occurred at the yuma drive-in this was in september of 1976. 
remember the yuma drive-in had been visited twice before already so this is probably one of the more 
most visited drive-in theaters uh usually these driving theaters are targeted once as 
near as I can tell but that's not always the case the yuma drive-in has had at least three 
encounters this one was investigated by roger marsh of mufon and it was seen by an entire family 
and this object was off in the distance at first but kept getting closer and closer 
and was in view for about 30 minutes when suddenly it came directly over the theater 
and right over the audience itself it was a classic saucer metallic sort of gold colored with lights or perhaps portholes and as it moved over the theater 
it began wobbling and doing flip-flops and finally it just moved off but again there you go i'm 
telling you it's putting on a show for witnesses if you want to see a ufo go to the local drive-in 
here's another great case this occurred at the twin drive-in and this is in downtown 
stockton a very urban area june 10 1977 the movie was king kong and the movie had just began this is 
how this often happens in cases the ufo will show up when the movie begins or during an intermission 
or during a really exciting part so the movie had just begun when uh people at the theater saw 
this object approaching and it came right over the theater the witness's estimate was about 
200 feet high was totally silent was saucer shaped it had rotating white lights around the perimeter 
one of the witnesses exited the car and watched this thing and he was an army national guard 
officer so a trained witness and he just watched it hover over the theater and then move off 
he is absolutely convinced as is his family that this was a genuine ufo
so almost all of these have occurred in the united states a few occurred in canada but there is one 
very interesting case which occurred in china this was not a drive-in theater per se this was 
an outdoor theater which had a capacity to hold an audience of 3 000 people this on july 7th 1977 
more than 3 000 people were watching the movie beyond the blue danube when two glowing objects 
showed up they were very bright cigar shaped almost fiery in appearance and came swooping down 
over this crowd of three 000 people in a clear display to announce their presence in fact they 
came so low some people thought they would crash and people could feel the heat from these objects 
so in this case the consequences were tragic it caused a complete panic 
and everyone scattered and as a result more than 300 people were injured some very severely and 
two children were trampled to death so if the ufos are trying to put on a little friendly display in 
some cases they clearly misjudged how people would react as in this case which caused quite a furor 
officials tried to call it an illusion or an optical effect but after they replayed the movie 
several times there was no repeat appearance so the witnesses uh to them it was very clear that 
these objects were real they came down very low and again they could actually feel the 
heat so this is something that's affecting the environment and would be classified as a close 
encounter of the second kind so i've just got a few more cases i'd like to show share with you 
this next case occurred around 1978 or so the name of the theater is unknown but it occurred 
in federal way washington when suddenly everyone noticed the screen started to go fuzzy 
everyone was surprised to see this huge object hovering over the theater itself 
right over the screen which was uh become all wavy and fuzzy at which point everyone started 
honking their horns this was a large object the witnesses was encircled with lights it hovered 
very briefly for just about 30 seconds and then darted away but again it's an important 
case because it's one of just a few in which there were actual electromagnetic effects
here's another interesting case which occurred at the century four drive-in in grand prairie texas 
on may 7 1978. the movie was beyond in back which is a paranormal movie about near-death experiences 
this was a very large theater four screens with capacity for 2000 cars when suddenly cars started 
flashing their headlights and honking and people were jumping out and this is when the witness 
noticed this huge object hovering overhead it was very large it was triangular shaped 
the witness estimate it was about three football fields wide and it hovered at a very low level 
directly over this uh huge driving movie theater for just a few moments and then it darted straight 
upwards and took on a star-like appearance where it remained for the entire duration of the movie 
so again perhaps in some cases they are watching the movie but I think no in most cases they're 
just trying to show off here's another case that affected the movie itself this was in july of 1978 
at the blue ridge drive-in theater in sailorsburg pennsylvania suddenly the speaker is filled with 
static and this object passes right low over the theater it's making a low humming noise 
the picture on the street the screen became badly distorted and this object finally just moves off 
and everything goes back to normal except for half of the people who have been watching the movie 
decided that they were no longer interested in watching the movie or staying there and they took off and vacated the premises
another amazing case 1978 this occurred at the albion drive-in in albion michigan the 
main witness uh nick is his name saw this ufo hovering over a tree in a field next to the 
drive-in theater he was at the theater with his brother and he pointed it out and said hey look 
what's that and his brother said oh that's just a helicopter but just immediately did a double take because it was clearly not a helicopter this thing was silent it was a disc sort of this glowing disc 
everyone at this point could see it they stopped watching the movie and watched this ufo including the employees 
of the theater and it hovered there for just a few moments and finally moved quickly upward 
higher and higher until it was just a white tiny little dot and it disappeared into outer space 
but and then not another amazing case so at this point you can see that these theaters are 
being targeted and if you don't think so well I can always march out another case april 14th 1979 
the southwest twin drive-in theater in memphis tennessee the witness uh noticed people getting 
out of their cars and exiting and looking up so he did the same and could see four red 
objects in a diamond formation hovering over the theater they hovered there for I mean 
he only got to watch it for just a few minutes uh perhaps they were there longer than he knew 
at any rate uh he after a few minutes all four objects each moved off each in a completely 
opposite different direction so many many cases just a few more if you'll indulge me 
uh april uh or the next case i'd like to talk about occurred at the fountain 
valley drive-in in 1980 this is in fountain valley california two objects appeared right 
above the screen like they always do then they started darting and stopping and shooting upwards 
at this point the power in the theater and the surrounding area went out and 
peop everyone still remained hoping the power would come back on which after 10 minutes it did 
come back on and they restarted the movie at which point the lights dropped down again and started 
darting around and shooting off and the power went out again and this time it did not come back on 
whether the ufos caused this we can't say for sure but given that there are so many 
accounts involving ufo related power outages it looks like that's what happened in this case 
at any rate the audience had to leave and were sent home
okay the next case I want to talk about uh also occurred in the 1980s this was at the edgewood 
theater in baldwin park when a craft hovered for about two minutes right at the upper right corner 
of the screen the theater was completely full but uh many people left following this and the witness 
uh later reported his sighting uh on the internet in hopes of finding other witnesses 
and he told his story and a couple of years later he did find another witness who said
gave a description exactly what the first witness said said that this object hovered 
right out the corner of the screen and about 70 to 80 percent of the people left everyone 
was freaking out there was no way it was a helicopter because this object was totally silent
so yeah many many cases uh here's another one which occurred at the wilmington 
drive-in theater in ohio this was in the summer of 2004 a fairly recent case and a brilliant light 
appeared right above the theater and uh they thought it might be a plane at first 
because it was just moving in a straight line when suddenly it shot straight upwards and 
remained in place as a star-like object for the rest of the night so again perhaps 
in some cases they are watching the movie another modern case uh occurred uh in two thousand 
and uh eight or so this was at the autorama theater in north ridgefield ohio and as the 
movie began five to six objects appeared right above the movie screen then they moved behind 
the screen and then to the left of it everyone started talking a few people did have cell phones 
and tried to take pictures but apparently they did not come out because the lights faded quickly away 
another recent case occurred in 2014 at the mansfield drive-in theater in mansfield 
connecticut this was on august 10 2014 the movie was guardians of the galaxy again the witnesses 
tried to film the object but as soon as they pulled their camera out this object swooped off a 
very recent case occurred in 2015 at the tuscosa drive-in in amarillo texas the main witness is dee 
she was there with her family when this red glowing object appeared 
overhead and started darting up and dropping down right above the theater and after did this several times they realized how unusual this was they couldn't see watch the movie 
anymore they were too entranced by this thing and she quickly whipped out her cell phone and uh 
tried to take film of this but it did not appear on the film unfortunately so there is a quick uh 
well not quite there's a wrap up of all these cases uh pretty incredible I think 
it's clear by now that these objects are targeting theaters uh they're clearly putting on a display
and there's just case after case of this and uh i've there are even more recent ones I mean the 
most recent case I think was 2019 i've got one from 2017. it's clear to me that these 
are purposefully and intentionally showing themselves off to a captive audience 
and I think you know I did uh look into the possibility that they're watching these movies 
i don't think that's what's going on here uh perhaps we're studying the our emotions 
as we're watching the movie that perhaps that's possible but just judging from their very dramatic 
uh behavior where they put on shows and release smaller objects and flash their lights 
and send beams of light on the screen and this sort of thing I think they're 
showing themselves off on purpose i've got no direct evidence of people being abducted but 
entirely possible that in a few of these cases there were mass abductions most of these cases you could probably categorize as close encounters of the first kind 
as we have seen several are sick close encounters of the second or third kind but in reality I think 
you could accurately classify one hundred percent of these cases as close encounters of the fifth 
kind and by that I mean human initiated encounters because it's clear to me that these objects 
are being attracted by the driving theater these are initiated as a result of human action 
so yeah perhaps these are actually all close encounters of the fifth kind 
at any rate this is definitely a thing this is a very peculiar type of behavior that a lot of 
people don't know about and I think it's important that they do and if you want to see a ufo if you 
want to call down a ufo a really good place to start might be at a drive-in theater just saying 
because i've documented more than 100 cases of this kind which i've written about in my book 
ufos at the drive-in since then i've gotten a number of other cases just last week I was 
contacted by a gentleman who had a very dramatic sighting with his family where a ufo showed up 
right next to the theater and actually caused the screen to melt the film in the projection booth 
melted away and it caused a panic and everyone left the theater so yeah this is a very dramatic 
uh type of event that I think takes place a lot more often than the hundred cases i've 
presented in this book and it's a very effective method for ufos to announce their presence 
because if you do the math I mean if they're let's say the average audience is about 500 people and 
if you have 100 cases involving 500 people well what's that I mean 50 000 people 
and that's just the cases we have in this book alone the truth is most people don't report 
their cases so i'm guessing there's 10 times more than that if not 100 times so we could be 
looking at as many as 5 million people perhaps or more who have seen ufos at driving theaters 
and I know that it sounds like a lot but uh this is definitely a thing this is definitely 
what's happening and given the fact that this has been occurring for more than 70 years 
i'm fairly confident saying that there will be more cases that will continue to occur 
over driving theaters so that's this episode for uh today I hope you've enjoyed it 
once again thank for thank you for watching and keep having fun
