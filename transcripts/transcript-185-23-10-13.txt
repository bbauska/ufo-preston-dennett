MORE STRANGE HUMANOIDS: 15 TRUE CASES
Oct 13, 2023

Summary:
Oct 13, 2023
We are not alone in the universe! In fact, the evidence shows that Earth is being visited by a wide variety of humanoids. There are too many cases to ignore. Here are fifteen accounts where people have had face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrial humanoids. From the 1930s to the 2010s, these cases come from all over the world. They involve multiple eyewitnesses and are supported by compelling evidence such as photographs, landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and physiological effects. These cases have volumes to teach us about the UFO phenomenon and the ET agenda on our planet.
 
THE ALASKA ALIEN PHOTOGRAPH. In the early 1930s, an anonymous man was hiking through the forest in Alaska and saw a strange humanoid figure. As the figure fled into the woods, the man chased it and managed to snap a very intriguing photograph.

WARTIME UFO & HUMANOID. One night in Nov 1943, Lavenia Sledge stepped outside her home in Escondido, CA and saw a UFO with portholes hovering 15 feet above her home. Inside she could see two humanoid figures. She called her husband and son, who saw the object and figures.

“THEY LOOKED HIDEOUS.” It was 3:00 am on Jul 3, 1955 as Margaret Symmonds drove along Route 129 near Stockton, GA and saw four strange figures standing in the road. As she drove by, she saw that they were not human. One of them looked right at her.

THE ET IN THE TREE. When Hector Davis woke up in the middle of the night on Aug 25, 1968 while camping in Townsville, Australia, the last thing he expected to see was a four-foot-tall humanoid wearing a one-piece gray uniform standing in a tree looking down at him.

“THEY ARE MARTIANS!” When three teenagers became stranded in their car at a reservoir near Trois Rivieres, Canada in late Jul 1969, they saw a glowing saucer. To their intense fear, eight glowing humanoid figures exited and surrounded their car, trying to get inside.

“IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.” On the evening of Nov 22, 1973, Mrs. JP of Joliette, Canada woke up to smoke a cigarette and noticed a bright light shining in through the window. Looking outside, she saw a beautiful humanoid figure staring back at her. Meanwhile, other people in the area saw UFOs.

THE DAW PARK HUMANOID. Late at night on May 30, 1976 Trevor White was in his home in Daw Park, South Australia when his radio became staticky and the dog outside began to bark. Looking out the window, he saw a humanoid in a silvery uniform looking back at him, speaking a strange language.

“IT WAS NOT HUMAN.” When four men took a wrong turn while driving late at night on Jan 2, 1978 in Rainford, England, they were confronted by a 7-foot-tall humanoid wearing a glowing spacesuit. When the spaceman began to walk towards them, the men panicked. But the car wouldn’t start.

“MY LIFE BECAME HELL.” Around 9:00 pm on Sep 17, 1978, Rivo Faralli left his mother’s home in Torrita de Sienna Italy only to have a UFO drop down on the road in front of him. Two short humanoids came out and began walking around his car. They seemed more interested in his car, than in himself.

THE SILVER MONSTERS. On the afternoon of Oct 2, 1978, four young boys hiking in the Groendal Nature Reserve in Rhodesia, Africa, were astonished to see a landed UFO and three silver-uniformed humanoids walking by them. One carried a suitcase like object. Another stopped and looked right at them.

MONK-LIKE ALIENS. On the morning of Jun 20, 1986, Cesar Locatelli was out hunting bees near his home in Menetrux-en-Joux, France, but instead came upon a landed flying saucer. The craft was transparent, and inside, he saw six hooded figures studying something on a table. Then one turned in his direction.

CAT-LIKE EXTRATERRESTRIALS. On Aug 31, 1987, Randy Springsteen and Dennis Mauer were playing on the swing-set by their home on the Bangor Naval Base in Bremerton, Washington when a UFO appeared. Inside they saw cat-like humanoids. Then it emitted a beam of light on them, lifting them off the swing.

“I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SUCH BEINGS IN MY LIFE.” At 12:30 am on Jul 9, 1996, police officers Marian Mancu and Marcel Rusu of Cercesti, Romania were shocked to see a craft hover above the road. Out stepped three humanoids with elongated skulls.

THE ALIEN IN THE WHEAT FIELD. Just before dawn in Jun 2005, a farmer was bicycling to his mother’s farm in Scalenghe, Italy when he saw something strange: a tall humanoid with bulging eyes standing next to a floating sphere. Frightened, he biked away as fast as he could.

“I WAS COMPLETELY FROZEN.” On Dec 29, 2013, Madame L was petrified to see a glowing saucer hovering over the garage of their home in St. Zenon, Canada. Two weeks later, on Jan 14, her husband entered the garage and surprised a very unusual-looking humanoid doing a very strange thing in his garage.

Skeptics can no longer claim that there is no evidence. UFOs are real, and extraterrestrials are watching over us very closely.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. Today's episode is called, "More Strange Humanoids: 15 True UFO Cases". These are all true life 
cases. Many very well investigated. Some involving multiple witnesses. Many involving a wide variety 
of physical evidence such as landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, 
animal reaction and more. And what I really wanted to focus on today is the fact that this 
is a phenomenon that has been occurring for a very long time. So, I have cases reaching back 90 years. 
All the way to the 1930s through 1940s, 50s, 60s, 1970s, 80s, and 90s and up into the 2000s and 2010. 
This is not only a historical phenomenon but one that is also still ongoing. Some very recent cases. 
Another thing I wanted to focus on is that this is a global phenomenon. So, I have cases all across 
the United States but also in Canada. All across Europe, Africa, as well Australia. This is, again, 
just a small sampling. There are cases pretty much everywhere. But yeah the cases I'm presenting today 
are all over the globe and another thing I find super fascinating is the wide variety of humanoids 
that people report it is almost exclusively almost without exception humanoids bipedal beings but we 
do see a great variety of descriptions and I find that super fascinating I think these cases have a 
lot to teach us and that's really why I wanted to talk about them today so let's just get started 
because I've got a lot of cases and the first case I like to talk about I call the Alaska 
alien photograph this is a really interesting case while it is quite brief and apparently was 
not investigated it does have some interesting evidence in terms of there being an actual 
photograph and this reaches back to the 1930s and of course took place in Alaska this case comes 
from BJ Booth who runs the UFO case book and he received a letter from from a witness who wants to 
remain anonymous and here is what the letter said the included picture was taken by my grandfather 
in the early 1930s I scanned the image immediately after he gave it to me last week I wish to remain 
anonymous since I don't want anything to do with any research or whatever on this I know 
it looks like an alien or a Bigfoot and I know my grandfather was telling me the truth about 
him taking this this picture that's why I think it should be in the right hands you are the only one 
I'm sending this to so please respect my privacy and don't contact me about this so apparently this 
Anonymous witness was on his way to a lake the gentleman who took the photograph when he saw a 
strange an approximately 4ot tall white colored entity which he briefly chased and managed to 
take the photograph you see here this entity does appear to have an oval-shaped head and round eyes 
and the witness waited 4 months actually before even developing the photograph since he lived 
in a remote and desolate area in Alaska but it was the day after he gave the photo to his grandson uh 
when the witness died and this was approximately 70 years after the encounter so while this wasn't 
isn't officially investigated it's certainly an interesting photograph again a pretty brief case 
without a lot of information and apparently not really investigated but certainly interesting you 
can make up your own mind about this Photograph but I thought it was worth presenting because it 
sure does look like a typical gray and now we move on to the next case a lot of these cases 
are going to be quite brief because there is you know a lot of information to present and you could 
do an hour on any particular case but what I find most interesting is that there are so many cases 
in the next case I'd like to talk about I call a wartime UFO and humanoid this took place in 
November 1943 in Escondido California and what's super interesting is not only the time period 
that this case took place but the fact that the whole family saw it so it's a interesting multiple 
witness case it was one day in November 1943 around 10:30 p.m. again in Escondido California 
on a dark and moonless night when the Sledge family consisting of lavenia sledge the mother her 
husband and their son were listening to the radio when lenia decided to step outside to get some air 
and this is when she immediately noticed an object hovering about 15 ft above the roof of her house 
very low she said it was shaped like a disc with a dome on top she estimates it was about 12 feet 
in diameter and she could see that this Dome on top of this craft had Square Windows all the way 
around she has estimates these windows were about 30 in wide each but behind two of these windows 
she could clearly see the silhouetted shapes of what looked like figures and the Dome inside which 
she could see appeared to be like shiny Chrome metallic so seeing this lenia ran into the house 
for her husband first thinking that this might be some sort of aircraft that was in trouble at that 
point living his husband and son ran outside and looked at this object but could not identify it as 
anything conventional they could hear a very quiet humming noise kind of like a spinning top but this 
object was hovering in place so lavenia actually flashed a flashlight um and sort of pointed it 
to go onto the ground believing that this is what the pilot of the object wanted to do but instead 
this object blinked out its lights and disappeared and of course they realized at this point that it 
was quite unusual and they didn't talk about it for many many years wasn't until later when the 
subject of UFOs became more popular that they finally disclosed what they saw can't blame the 
family the Witnesses in this case for remaining silent for so long certainly at that time there 
wasn't a lot of information about this subject it wasn't really being taken seriously in the public 
certainly but it's an interesting case and was professionally investigated as well so I think 
it deserves to be well known now moving to the next case this one did get a lot of attention and 
has appeared in a few UFO books I'm not sure if you've heard of it but it is quite fascinating I 
call this one they looked hideous and this took place on July 3rd in 1955 in Stockton Georgia 
while this is a single witness case it's got some very interesting details to it as we shall see it 
was about 300 a.m. on July 3rd 1955 as Margaret Simmons drove her brand new Oldsmobile South on 
Route 129 this was just a few miles south of Stockton Georgia her husband Wesley was in the 
back seat dozing it was a clear night this was a pretty remote area with no houses on or along the 
highway and I'll just let Margaret describe in her own words which she did under affidavit by 
the way about what happened so this is Margaret talking as Margaret says it was a clear night 
the moon was shining there were no houses you could see for quite a way down the road it was 
straight and it was a two-lane Highway with flat shoulders on each side I was driving at about 60 
MPH I first noticed something in the center of the road when my headlights which were on the 
upper beam shown on four objects that I first thought were animals maybe Hogs or something as 
I drove closer I reduced speed because I didn't want to hit them then as I got almost up to them 
I could see that they were wearing some kind of clothing what appeared to be capes gray in 
color one of them had what looked like a stick and they were huddled together in the center of 
the road as though they were about to dig in the road as I drove up I had slowed down to about 40 
mph one of the things stepped to the side about a foot to get out of my way and looked right at 
me he had the stick in his hands his arm looked longer than would be proportionate for the size 
of his body the head looked to be of approximately normal size only roundish it had what looked like 
a slouch hat on turned down all around I had never seen anything like them before and I'd never seen 
any clothes or material like that either the eyes there were two of them were big like saucers and 
they reflected a reddish light I saw no pupils I was terrified as I drove close I swerved to 
the right side of the road but I didn't lose control of the car I passed close enough to 
reach out and touch them I sped up right away and kept driving I screamed and my husband woke up he 
wanted to go back and see what it was but I was afraid the nose was long real long and pointed it 
reminded me of a witch I heard no noise I smelled nothing peculiar I was told since I came back and 
told what I saw that these things are supposed to smell but I didn't smell anything the mouth 
seemed small to me I didn't notice any lips the lights didn't seem to bother them any and except 
for that one step that the one took sideways that was the only movement the other didn't look up I 
would say that they were all about the same size and about up to the bottom of my car window maybe 
about 3 or 4 feet high their legs appeared to be short I couldn't see too much about their bodies 
because of the cape the hands had claws on them real long claws I didn't pay too much attention 
to the feet but the skin seemed to be a dark color very rough or coarse the legs seem to be 
very short for the size of the body and the arms seemed long the one holding the stick held it in 
his right hand and although I don't know what kind of stick it was it was short and as he held it in 
a hanging position the stick touched the ground when I first saw them the one with the stick had 
his back to me his shoulders were very square and seemed unusually strongl looking for that size of 
a body so when she says it has a normal head she means a normal adult-sized head but on this body 
this very small body the head was too large and she said they looked hideous her husband 
Wesley was of course woken up by her screaming and wanted to turn around but she refused and 
after a few moments she pulled over so he could drive and she could recover and they kept their 
account secret until a short time later when the Hopkinsville Kentucky case involving the Sutton 
family hit the news and that yeah that was just a short time later so Margaret Simmons did tell 
her story and actually as I said told it before a notary public Calvin W Prem and this case has 
become something of a classic it has appeared in several books one researcher believes he's 
found the answer he's skeptical and says that Margaret Simmons probably saw nothing more than 
eagle owls and while there are a few similarities she says these were three or 4 feet tall which is 
possible for an owl but pretty large also one was holding a stick she said they were wearing 
clothes had rough skin I am not so sure these were owls it had a hat on there's other details that 
just don't match up but it's certainly a strange case it's a bit of a shame that Margaret Simmons 
didn't turn around as her husband requested so that they both could have seen what was going 
on in the middle of the road there but I can't blame her it was quite frightening clearly for 
her but certainly would have been interesting to get another witness and now we move on to the next 
case and I call this one the ET in the tree and that's what I find super fascinating about this 
particular case and one of the reasons I wanted to present it because sometimes ETS are seen in 
places you would not expect such as inside a tree this case took place on August 25th 1968 this 
is in Townsville Australia and this is a single witness case but was professionally investigated 
by an experienced UFO researcher which I think lends a level of credibility to it particularly 
because this researcher was actually a scientist of High Caliber an interesting case for sure as we 
shall see was on August 25 1968 when Hector Davis and his wife were sleeping in their trailer again 
near Townsville in Australia when for some reason unknown to him he woke up as Hector says in his 
own words about 2:00 in the morning I woke with a feeling that something was very wrong I threw back 
the covering which was over my head and looked up at the branch of a tree which was was directly in front of me squatting on this limb with his back to me was a visitor in a sort of spacit 
now according to Hector this being which was only about 12 feet away and 6 feet up in this tree was 
about four 4 and 1/2 ft tall had long blonde hair blue eyes it wore a onepiece gray suit complete 
with gloves and shoes and the suit had kind of a corrugated texture now this being was wearing 
a cap with what looked like antenna on top which were glowing faintly and this figure was watching 
the davises as they slept so Hector wakes up and this being is looking right at them at this point 
Hector jumps up and the figure which seemed to look at him sort of guiltily quickly floated away 
from the tree and across the road it covered about 2 ft off the ground as Hector says legs swinging 
like walking away only not touching the ground and as Hector says in his own words the amazing thing 
was that I could tell it was peaceful and would not hurt me I firmly believe we have been visited 
by aliens for thousands of years for biological reasons just as we have visited the moon so a 
very unusual case but this was was investigated by scientist and UFO researcher Dr Dan herbison Evans 
and as Hector says Dr herbison Evans and I have talked at Great length and he is firmly convinced 
that everything I say is true so like I said what I like about that case is that the ET was 
actually seen in the tree which is quite unusual to say the least another interesting takeaway 
I think is that the witness woke up apparently sensing that somebody was looking at him that is 
something we do see in a number of UFO cases so I think that's an important aspect to this case and 
here's another case would which was professionally investigated it is a multiple witness case it does 
have physical evidence of different types and a quite long encounter as well and I call this one 
they are martians and that is a direct quote from one of the witnesses this took place in Late July 
of 1969 In Tua Rivier in Quebec Canada and yeah it is a thrilling case which was quite traumatic for 
the witnesses involved again it was late July 1969 when a group of teenagers parked near a reservoir 
outside of the town of CHA Rivier in Quebec and around 900 p.m. they were just preparing to leave 
but one of their two cars that they had taken there wouldn't start so some of the teenagers 
left in the car that was working to go get help and they left three others aged 12 to 16 alone in 
the car that wouldn't start so now alone the three teenagers saw this bright light behind a Grove of 
fur tree and looking up saw this classic saucer with a dome on top and as one of the witnesses 
says the three of us were looking at this funny thing asking ourselves what the hell is that so 
they were staring at it when shortly later a group of eight quote luminous beings appeared they were 
floating just a foot or two off the ground and had a very strange appearance the closest thing they 
could compare it to was that these beings looked almost like snowmen but had no eyes or mouth now 
at this point they realize these are not humans and one of the kids shouts out they are martians 
and this is when the beings approached the car floating in a single line towards them 
this really freaked the kids out they bundled up into the back seat and hid under a blanket 
as The Entity surrounded the car and according to the witnesses kept trying to get inside the car 
cuz they could hear them knocking around at the doors the youngest the 12-year-old began crying 
and as one of the witnesses says they were as white as light from a neon tube they floated 
in the air they were between 6 and 7 ft tall I could make out where their face was by an oval 
shape but I didn't see any eyes nor mouth they tried to open the door because we felt them shake 
the car I saw them looking in the car so while this was happening the children talked quietly 
and fearfully among themselves at one point one of these beings actually walked on the car roof 
pressing down the metal and it was during this time the temperature in the car Rose sharply and 
this wasn't a short incident this actually went on for a full hour until suddenly their friends 
returned in the other car in fact as soon as the headlights came around the corner the eight beings 
immediately retreated back into the UFO which promptly took off and going outside the teenagers 
who were hiding in the car could now see that there were dents on the roof of the car where one 
of these beings had apparently walked and as one of the witnesses said you could hear the metallic 
roof PR down like under a pressure after the departure of our visitors we looked on the roof 
and there were traces now they tried to keep this quiet at first they didn't want to talk about it 
uh they were very afraid of not being believed but at some point the three Witnesses did speak about 
it researchers found out and they told researchers exactly what happened explained that they never 
wanted to have another experience like that that and that it was easily the longest hour of 
their lives and in fact the youngest said he had difficulty sleeping for a week so that's another 
case that we almost didn't hear about because the Witnesses were afraid of being disbelieved it's 
such a shame I blame our own governments for that they've put on a campaign a vigorous campaign to 
discredit this subject to make Witnesses look like fools to label every encounter as a hoax 
hallucination or misperception and using our tax dollars to push this cover up it's really 
a travesty so I'm very glad that the witnesses did come forward and it's another interesting 
thing about this case is not only the appearance of the ETS and the fact that it does have physical 
evidence and involved multiple Witnesses but that it affected them so profoundly certainly a lot to 
learn from that case and moving along to the next case which I call it was beautiful that's 
one of the things I really like about this case is the witness who saw this humanoid was really 
impressed by the beauty of this being this case occurred on November 22nd 1973 also in Canada 
more specifically in Joliet Quebec and while this is a single witness case in terms of the humanoid 
scene there is some corroborative or supporting Witnesses who saw UFOs in the area at that time 
as we shall see it's a fascinating case the witness in this case is mostly Anonymous and 
goes by her initials Mrs JP and it was around 2 a.m. on November 22nd 1973 When Miss JP went into 
her kitchen to smoke a cigarette and that's when she noticed that a bright light was shining into 
the window and looking out the window she saw a quote 4ft tall thing she said it was standing 
right outside the window only a few feet away she could see it clearly it had a round head two 
glowing luminescent eyes three times the size of normal eyes she said she didn't notice any nose or 
mouth but she said around the head or helmet there was this sort of glowing ha which looked almost 
like it had Flames coming off and around its neck looked like there were laces hanging around the 
neck so yeah she felt no fear and in fact she said this being looked absolutely beautiful to her she 
estimates she watched it for about 15 seconds but she couldn't be sure because there was a sense 
of timelessness to the whole incident she was unable to move she felt like she was on almost 
in a trance but at some point this figure departed and after Breaking Free of this trance she rushed 
rushed back into her bedroom woke up her husband he quickly got dressed and went outside to 
investigate he found no evidence of this strange visitor other than one thing their dog was lying 
on the ground quote scared to death and in fact the dog refused to follow the husband as he invest 
investigated the property which was normally something he would have done also the next 
day their cat was acting very strangely and kept running up and down through the house and looking 
out the kitchen window where Miss JP had seen this entity now later Canadian researcher weido hovil 
invested the case and did find other witnesses to UFO activity in that area he talked to a police 
officer and a Catholic priest by the name of Mr goule who saw UFOs on that night about 34s of a 
mile away from Mrs JP's house th those Witnesses saw this UFO hovering over the dtar Quarry which 
incidentally or not contained several Springs and power lines carrying some 730,000 volts of 
electricity which may be pertinent here I can only imagine what it must be like to wake up and go 
into your kitchen and see a humanoid staring right at you through the window uh it's certainly would 
be a shock I think it's interesting in that in this case there was a quarry nearby with several 
Springs and some high tension wires which does seem to be something that turns up in a number 
of cases another interesting thing about this case is not only the animal reactions but the fact that 
the witness reported a sense of timelessness while in the presence of this being there's no direct 
indication of missing time or her being taken on board but this sense of timelessness is something 
many witnesses report and this gives us another clue of what it's like to have direct fa face Toof 
face contact with an extraterrestrial humanoid and now we move to another truly fascinating case 
I call this one the Daw Park humanoid this took place on May 30th 1976 this is in Daw Park South 
Australia and this is another really interesting case someone who woke up to see an ET looking at 
at him through the window of his home this case is so strange it was around 2 a.m. May 30th 1976 when 
Trevor white age 17 realized something strange was happening when his radio began to static and his 
dog began barking so looking out the window into his backyard he saw a humanoid figure standing 
there only about 30 ft away he estimates it was about 5 and 1/2 ft tall certainly wasn't normal 
it was wearing a silver onepiece uniform with white boots it had gloves and a helmet with what 
looked like a visor and it had this weird sort of square shaped device strapped to its chest 
with what looked kind of like a figure eight on the front now amazingly this figure reached down 
and actually petted his dog Pat his dog and then turned and looked directly at Trevor and started 
speaking a few words in a foreign language this figure then began to walk directly towards Trevor 
which really frightened him caused him to retreat back to his bedroom door at this point the figure 
stopped advancing suddenly flew up into the air and entered a cigar-shaped object which 
was hovering nearby over some trees Trevor saw this he said the object was metallic silver was 
glowing red at one end and green on top he said it moved off quickly into the distance after 
this humanite figure entered inside and later that morning he went outside and saw that the lawn in 
his backyard had what looked like Footprints and some of the green grass had turned yellow in color 
very hard to say why the ET was there in that case case it's very interesting that so many people are 
seeing these craft these humanoids right next to their homes to me the most interesting thing about 
that case is that the ET reached down and started petting the witness's dog I think that shows that 
these beings are not that far removed from us they're just like us they love pets it's certainly 
a fascinating case in that regard also fascinating is how the humanoid flew up into the UFO which is 
not unusual but we do see a lot of the these cases of flying humanoids and here's another case this 
one comes from rainford England and occurred on January 2nd 1978 I call this one it was not human 
and that is a direct quote from the witnesses there are multiple Witnesses in this case it's 
got some really good corroborative Witnesses who saw uo activity around that time in that same area 
some interesting also unusual aspects to it and that this encounter occurred right after taking 
a wrong turn there's some interesting emotional and phys physiological reactions that occurred in 
this case and just a really strange humanoid as well so again a lot to learn from each case and 
this one certainly it with 11 11:15 p.m. again on January 2nd 1978 in rainford England when four men 
drove outside of town along the B 5203 Road the witnesses include the driver Jeff hailes and his 
friends stevenh Simpson Glenn Matthews and Keith Thomas now coming to an intersection Jeff for some 
reason he doesn't know why turn turned right when he should have turned left and realizing 
his error he broke break the car stopped and although he was only traveling at 30 m hour 
the road was quite slick and this caused him to Skid off the road onto the embankment and into a 
ditch and this one was when he noticed a strange figure illuminated by the car headlights it was 
standing about 25 ft ahead of the car on the road he immediately pointed it out to his friends and 
all four of them saw this strange figure which they described as being 6 and 1 half maybe 7 
feet tall quite tall they said it was wearing a onepiece body suit of fluorescent glowing 
white it also had white boots black gloves and a rounded helmet there were no markings whatsoever 
on this uniform the only detail they noticed was a rectangular box with two horizontally spaced 
red lights which was placed high on this figure's chest so these red lights were flashing rapidly 
they said this figure was very broad shouldered had extremely short arms less than a foot long 
they estimate and they said they These Arms ended in what looked like claw likee hands but 
they couldn't be sure but they do insist that this figure was not human all of them became extremely 
frightened at this point they actually panicked in their attempts to leave and it was at this point 
that this figure took three or four what they perceived to be hesitant steps towards them and 
in fact the witnesses had the impression that this figure was surprised or frightened to see 
them as they were to see him so Jeff hailes again who was driving suffered from asthma and as soon 
as he saw this figure he suffered an immediate attack but after about 20 seconds they managed 
to get the car started and turned around and immediately drove off to the nearest Farmhouse 
which turned out to be brown Birch farm and They begged the owner to call the police which they did 
now this case was investigated by Stephen Balon he's a experienced researcher and as he says those 
Lads were really scared when they called they were not messing about the officer who showed 
up on the scene was officer mclusky and he later spoke with researchers confirming the incident 
and said of the witnesses there was no doubt they were scared both visibly and physically I think 
they definitely saw something the lad who was asmatic was sitting in the back of the car when 
we arrived his knees were shaking he was white and he couldn't speak properly so yeah this was 
something that clearly impressed the witnesses and Steven Balon later learned that there had been a 
sighting on the previous day only about 3 miles to the east this included four Witnesses who saw this 
glowing red circular disc moving soundlessly at Treetop level bright enough to illuminate the area 
all around and it was 10 days later again very close to the same area in the same time that two 
policemen officers low and Roberts saw a bright light hovering over the nearby bold Power Station 
first and then over the Fiddler Ferry power stations so so as we see a very well investigated 
well verified multiple witness case of people seeing a humanoid very very close I also find 
it interesting that the corroborating Witnesses who saw UFOs in that area at that time said that 
the UFOs were hovering over not just one but two power stations this shows another interesting 
aspect of UFO activity in that ETS are very much drawn towards installation hard to say why for 
sure I we could always speculate but I think it's something that we do need to take note of and here 
is another case which is super interesting one of the more interesting in this bunch I think 
and I call this one my life became hell this one occurred on September 17 1978 in a town called 
Torita D Sienna and this in Italy and this is an amazing case for a number of reasons it involves 
quite a few Witnesses some absolutely undeniable physical evidence some really remarkable 
electromagnetic effects and some really strange behavior on the part of the ETS as we shall see 
it was around 8:15 p.m. again on September 17 1978 when timina BAGI and her 12-year-old son Ricardo 
were standing in front of their house on pagi ortis Street in Torita D Sienna again in Italy 
and they heard this very loud almost explosive sound and at the same time saw a quote Fireball 
with a yellow orange contour and a reddish tail so this vanished in a flash of light but frightened 
them enough that they ran inside they said it actually not knocked out the power briefly for 
several houses in the area unknown to them they weren't the only Witnesses Santina feral who lived 
nearby also heard the explosion saw the flash of light through her windows and said that her house 
lights went briefly off and back on now meanwhile santina's son Revo feral he works as a barber he 
came over to visit and then about 900 p.m. he got into his car a little Fiat 127 and was departing 
the area he had literally just gotten into his car and was driving along when his car lights went out 
and his engine quit at that moment a bright object dropped from the sky and hovered over the road in 
front of him only 2 feet above the ground he said it was sort of rocking up and down like it was on 
water in the waves and it wasn't a huge object it was about 9 feet wide he estimates saucer shaped 
with a dome on top kind of shaped like a hat he said but was glowing orange red and he said three 
beams of light were coming out from underneath it one was yellowish green the other was red and the 
other was sky blue and these three beams of light were shining onto the road and as he watched an 
opening appeared and two humanoid figures Flo it out he said both wore full body green jumpsuits 
with boots and gloves what looked like a belt and helmets with face plates with what looked 
like two antenna on either side of their helmets these were short little guys each under 4T tall 
they never touched the ground but floated towards the car circling around it as if to inspect it 
this is how he knew how tall they were because they barely came up to the windows and he said 
they seem to be more interested in the car than in himself and through the transparent screens 
on their helmets he could see that they were basically human looking but different they were 
very lean with bony high cheekbones and thin lip mouths they then returned to the craft which rose 
about 30 ft straight up at this point he could still see them through the dome in this craft this 
craft then took off very quickly with a flash of light and a loud explosive sound and disappeared 
off into the distance now following this encounter his lights went back on as did his car engine and 
later he found three scorched circles about 1 and 1/2 ft wide exactly where this object had hovered 
as you can see here an analysis of these burn marks showed no unusual elements but did show 
that the ground had been exposed to a very high heat source and I'll just give you a brief quote 
from the witness Revo as he says they meaning the figures floated in the air not very high they seem 
to have thin faces one could see this a little through the helmet's front they turned around my 
127 the Fiat seeming more interested in it than in me then they left so he returned home as he 
says in a quote stuper I was late my wife asked for an explanation I could not say anything to 
her I was in a State of Shock it was only later I did not tell people what had happened I was afraid 
not to be believed to be called a crackpot I did not go to the police force then the rumor spread 
and my life became hell another after effect of this encounter was that Revo suffered from quote 
burning eyes so I love that case for a lot of reasons so many witnesses the behavior of the 
ETS is really unusual I think the most important takeaway is that there's an enormous amount of 
evidence we have electromagnetic evidence with the lights going out we have physiological evidence 
with the witness suffering from eye irritation pretty severe eye irritation for days afterwards 
and of course and I think most importantly The Landing trace evidence so there's some really 
important takeaways and I think one of the more interesting and frankly important takeaways is 
the fact that this poor witness really suffered after going public it's traumatic enough having 
a very close encounter with humanoids like this but to have people reacting negatively 
from it sort of it's hitting people with a double whammy and I blame our governments for this who 
are spending an enormous amount of time money and energy discrediting the subject and again 
making Witnesses look like idiots and calling every encounter a hoax a hallucination or a 
misperception that just can't go on it's time we accept that we are being visited 
by extraterrestrials and I think the fact that there are so many cases makes this absolutely 
undeniably true and let's move on to the next case which speaks again to this I call this case the 
silver monsters because that is what the witness wies thought these humanoids were certainly at 
first all these Witnesses are young kids there was four of them and what's super interesting is they 
didn't immediately jump to the ET explanation because it wasn't something they were super familiar with but they weren't the only witnesses there were other people in that area who saw UFO 
activity at the time and of course as it turns out there were Landing traces as well there's 
some very very interesting aspects to this case there are four Witnesses in this case all 
teenagers and one pre-teen the Witnesses are Peter Simpson age 16 Yanni bizot age 15 Hugo Ferrera age 
12 and Joe Perino 13 they were all friends and again hiking in the grandle reserve which is full 
of protected wildlife of all kinds again in rhia and after hiking they were waiting under a large 
Tree near a stone monument by a gravel road one of their mothers was coming to pick them up and 
take them home and I'll just let Peter describe what happened in his own words and I quote we all 
four of us saw this silver thing glisten between the trees on the side opposite to us I thought it 
was a large Stone shining in the in the sun Yanni saw the two of course and as Yanni says I saw two 
silver monsters standing there in the beginning they looked just like ordinary men and we thought 
they were poachers but then we could see they wore silver suits like firefighters again I'll 
quote Peter what struck me was that their clothes Shone so brightly they were completely silver and 
I couldn't see any face at all there were two men at first and they were moving in a strange 
way they didn't have any noticeable walking movement and it looked as though they were 
Gliding Over the surface the two men came from the direction of the glistening object when they 
were in the middle of the Hill they were joined by a third man who was carrying a silver Square 
suitcase I do not know where the third man came from he just suddenly appeared they moved along 
the fence towards the top of the hill and then they disappeared yanning confirms this he said 
they walked up the hill alongside the fence until they disappeared here's the thing though this is 
quite a steep hill filled with brush and these three figures just glided right up that hill 
very quickly far faster than a normal person could also all the boys said that they felt very strange 
during this encounter weirdly disoriented they also know noticed that there was an eerie silence 
over the whole area during the whole encounter and one other interesting thing at one point one 
of the figures actually stopped looked directly at the boys just briefly and then moved on but 
they were close enough to see that these figures had grayish skin and again were floating along 
much faster than a normal person could now it was later some for forry workers in the area did find 
what they belied to be very large Footprints and later found at least nine separate areas where 
it looked like an object a large oval object had come from down from above and flattened the grass 
and in fact in each of these nine oval areas there were three deep indentations in the ground so this 
became quite an a popular case among researchers who really looked into it interviewed all the 
witnesses and further research did reveal that there was a history of sightings in this area in 
fact on the Friday prior to the sighting a woman in the area said she saw a disc-shaped object take 
off from the reserve area definitely an important case I find it super interesting that these UFOs 
are being seen repeatedly at this Nature Reserve in Africa perhaps that was why they were there 
studying the nature really hard to say but with a long history of UFOs in that area something 
important is clearly going on and with so many witnesses and Landing traces and the way the ETS 
were behaving floating up that Hillside and moving so quickly much more quickly than any human being 
could do I mean that is really a compelling case for sure and here's another case with some real 
high strangeness to it I call this the monk-like aliens this one occurred on June 20th 1986 in mini 
trucks onu in France and while this is a single witness case it's got some very interesting 
aspects to it and as well some interesting physical evidence as we shall see this case was 
investigated by Michelle Morel seu he's a French researcher and the witness was a wood cutter and 
truck driver and his name is Cesar locatelli now Cesar was also an avid beekeeper and it was around 
400 a.m. on June 20 1986 sometime after he had spotted a swarm of bees that he decided he would 
go looking to find and capture these bees for his hives so he had woken up very early 4:00 a.m. in 
the hopes that the bees would be asleep and easy to capture he knows this area very well he turned 
off of the IL Day menetre Road d39 where he had seen these bees and instead of finding bees He 
Came Upon something else entirely an enormous transparent saucer which was landed right along 
the road on the ground and he could see six hooded figures inside so by the time he stopped 
this object was only 12 feet in front of him so close that he almost collided into it he could 
see these figures which were all standing on the right side of this totally transparent craft they 
weren't large they were all about four and 1/2 ft tall he estimates but they all wore what looked 
like white monk robes with hoods that hid their faces they all seemed to be standing around this 
table and were bent over it apparently examining something on the table he didn't see but realizing 
these guys were notum and this was not a normal craft uh he tried to reverse his car only to find 
that his engine was dead he's not sure if this was just because he was so afraid or if it was 
an effect from the craft itself but he could hear a quote sound like a high tension line a bit more 
high pitched now he estimates that this object was about 25 to 26 ft in diameter and again was 
transparent except for these dark vertical lines kind of like framework strangely although he was 
that close with his headlights shining on it the figures did not react to his presence at all so he 
tried to start his car a second time and this time it did work out he backed out he was glad to get 
away and as he drove off he took one quick look back and saw that one of the beings had actually 
moved away from the others to the left side of the craft and was now partially facing him at least 
to the point that he could see the tip of this figure's nose and what looked like blonde early 
hair so completely freaked out he drove off but later that morning around 9:00 a.m. he returned 
to investigate and of course this object was now gone he knew this area very well having been there 
many times before so it was easy for him to locate the exact spot and one of the reasons 
he knew where this spot was because this craft had landed partially on this enormous White Rock and 
he looked at it this rock this kind of Boulder was not affected but he did find an area of crushed 
grass where the rest of the object had come down now he knew this White Rock well cuz he's always 
wondered about it it was a very white and he wondered you know why it was so white and no 
Moss ever grew on it but it was about four years later in November 1990 that he went back to this 
exact spot and discovered something strange this White Rock was missing and this made zero sense 
cuz this rock he estimates weighed over a ton but there was no evidence that it had even been there 
so that was very strange and on a previous or later occasion rather he returned to that spot 
and had a very uneasy feeling he almost became ill so some very strange after effects to this 
case I really do wonder about that case it's so interesting on many levels with the craft being 
almost totally transparent these ETS looking very much like monks in robes fact it was landed right 
there on the ground right in front of this witness and the ETS didn't even seem to react or care that 
they were being observed I have have to believe they knew but that's pure speculation and again 
the disappearing Boulder that is very bizarre and while we can't say for sure that it's directly 
connected to this case it certainly looks like it hard to say for sure but super interesting and now 
we move to another case which is very compelling I think because of where it took place I call 
this one catlike extraterrestrials this took place on August 31st in 1987 and it occurred 
at Banger naval base in Bremerton Washington so this is an area where there are nuclear weapons 
nuclear submarines being held I suspect that may have been the draw What attracted the ETS to it 
again pure speculation but as we shall see a super interesting case with humanoids that are quite 
different from most that we usually hear about it was about 1055 p.m. when Randy Springstein age 8 
and his friend Dennis Mau age 10 were playing on the playground at the US Navy Trident submarine 
base in Banger Washington Brer Washington now the boys had gotten permission from Randy's mother 
to go outside and play for just a few minutes and they had played for about 10 minutes uh when they 
saw a big circular object hovering above Randy's house and Shining a beam of light down on the 
house and as they watched this craft then moved directly over them and through a port hole they 
could see quote some sort of creature they said it was very bizarr looking it had cat-like ears 
it bent down and seemed to move a lever at which point a larger beam of light came down from the 
craft and struck the boys directly this point the boys could also see a second occupant standing in 
another opening on the bottom lower left of the craft and these were not short entities 
they estimate that they were more than 6 feet tall tall as one of the kids' fathers is how he 
described it but they had oversized large heads thin bodies and they thought that these beings 
looked like they were covered with fur and had an almost greenish cast to them but the eyes they 
said were blue green round had what looked like very long eyelashes they said their mouths were 
wrinkled quote like an old Grandma's they had very long fingers with what looked like suction cups on 
them and the hands and feet looked almost webbed like they said like frogs feet so very unusual 
humanoids to say the least but this craft they said look like quote a spaceship with red and 
blue lights going around it after talking with investigators the investigator got measurements 
as best as he could from the kids and estimates that this craft was about 50 ft wide but according 
to Randy and Dennis this craft was totally silent the lights were rotating in sequence 
in a counterclockwise Direction and very low this point it's hovering less than 100 ft overhead now 
when they saw this the boys were on the swing set and when this beam of light hit them they felt 
this beam lifting them up on the swing towards the craft this freaked them out after taking a quick 
look at this they ran inside and told Randy's mother Charlene Springsteen she heard the boys 
spill out their story and quickly went outside and was amazed to see this strange quote aircraft and 
she verified that it had 10 maybe 20 red and blue lights in a long row hovering High overhead and 
as she watched this craft made a quick turn and zoomed away now Charlene immediately went back 
inside called the police the police said that they are not allowed to investigate on the base grounds 
and suggested that they called base security which was done but base security said that they do not 
investigate UFO reports now the other child Dennis Mau told his mother Linda Mau and she believed him 
she had seen a UFO previously in her life now this case did PL take place at F court on albore Circle 
contains about 25 housing units this is directly on the base and in fact the boy's fathers were 
both Navy security personnel and they learned about this incident and expressed skepticism 
and they joked that it was Russians who they had seen so they weren't taking this seriously or 
perhaps downplaying it on purpose but it's very significant because this Naval Base had nuclear 
powered sub Marines and a stockpile of nuclear weapons which could very well be the reason this 
craft was there now this case was investigated by Donald A Johnson PhD who worked for the center of 
UFO studies qos uh and totally investigated the case interviewed the witnesses and as he writes 
and I quote is my belief that they were not lying or concocting the story but were trying to relate 
as best as they could some unusual event which they believed had happened to them the families 
decided not to report the sighting to anyone in Authority at the base and to this day I don't 
believe the base commander knows anything about it it remains a perplexing story either open 
to an unusual psychological explanation or interpretation as a truly anomalistic 
aerial phenomenon so there are a lot of important takeaways from that case the fact that the kids 
felt that they were being levitated off the swings that's super interesting the fact that this UFO is 
hovering right over a very sensitive Naval Base involving nuclear material that's super important 
was a very well investigated case as well with the researcher interviewing all the witnesses 
involved also super interesting also inter in is that this was apparently not researched At 
All by the base security officials which makes me wonder were they not taking it seriously or 
were they intentionally ignoring it super hard to say for sure but an important case for a lot of 
reasons and now we move to the next case this one is also super interesting I call this one I have 
never seen any such beings in my life and that is a statement from both the witnesses there were two 
witnesses in this case good Witnesses because they are both police officers trained observers 
people whose job it is to notice anything unusual to patrol the streets and of course they did see 
something really unusual and not only did they see humanoids but these humanoids are also a 
bit different from the kind we normally hear about this took place on July 9 1996 in cesty Romania it 
was a half hour past midnight on July 9 1966 when police Sergeant Maran Manu and volunteer police 
officer Marcel rousu were patrolling the main road in front of the police station in ceresti 
Romania now there was nothing going on so Maran drove to his home and went inside to get a little 
snack when without warning both he and his fellow officer Marcel heard a strange Whistling noise 
Marcel felt a blast of air he looked up and saw something hovering in the air and as he watched 
this thing came in for a landing now Maran at this point ran outside of his house and saw these red 
and blue lights shining down on the road he heard this noise which he described as going Voom Voom 
and his first thought was that this was another police car and he approached closer could now see 
that it was in fact a saucer hovering just one or two feet directly over the road and Marcel 
had a much closer view of this object according to both of them this craft was somewhere between 
15 and 18 18 ft wide and about 6 to 8 ft High it had red and blue lights which blinked around the 
perimeter and a white beam of light Shone down from the bottom now there were figures walking 
around this craft Marian who was a bit further away saw only one of them but according to Marcel 
there were in fact three and these figures had large elongated bald heads Big Eyes large ears 
their skin was very white very pale their bodies were clothed in what looked like a shiny metallic 
uniform much like fish scales but these figures look different I mean they had large protruding 
bellies very thin arms and they were floating above the ground kind of weaving back and forth 
as the witnesses says quote as if they were drunk so kind of floating around in this wobbly way and 
both officers described them as being quote ugly now Marcel was close enough to hear them actually 
talking in some strange language and both of them were quite frightened as Maran says when I saw 
what they looked like they're very ugly faces I told myself they are not human I became afraid and 
I was hiding myself in the the ditch just in case something might happen because I have never seen 
any such beings in my life before and Marcel was equally frightened as he says when I saw how they 
were when I saw their state of ugliness I said to myself these are not ours then I got scared 
and went down into a ditch to hide as if somehow that I have never seen something like this in my 
life in fact he thought they might be Devils or something but these figures went back into this 
craft this craft took off straight up at which point the street lights went off for just a short 
moment as it came down I forgot to mention the street lights dimmed now this did reach the ears 
of investigators and later it was learned that there were other Witnesses in the surrounding 
areas that had seen strange lights in the sky on that exact night and also a further investigation 
where this object had hovered showed that a large cherry tree right near where this all 
occurred showed some damage to its leaves which looked like they had been exposed to a very high 
heat Source a lot of real interesting things about that case and I love the fact there was physical 
evidence as well with the leaves from the cherry tree being burned and with two witnesses and 
other people in the area seeing UFOs at that time it's an undeniable case uh something clearly very 
unusual happened to those two police officers and now we move to another case this one I call the 
alien in the wheat field and this occurred on June 2005 in scalen this is outside of Turin in Italy 
and while it is a single witness case what I like about this case is it does involve a very unusual 
humanoid and for that matter a very unusual craft as well it was 4:15 a.m one day in June 
2005 when a farmer who wants to remain anonymous was bicycling to his mother's Farm to help her out 
with the morning chores and he was getting pretty close to her house passing a recently harvested 
wheat field and noticed this strange dark figure bending down in the field and it was quite close 
about 100 ft away but the same time the farmer noticed this figure this figure apparently 
noticed the farmer and stood up and this is when the farmer could see that this figure was 
about 6 feet tall had a very large head Broad bro shoulders two large round black bulging eyes large 
pointed ears which reminded him of a dog he said this figure was wearing a dark skin tight suit or 
may have actually been covered with fine fur was still too dark to tell but a short distance behind 
the figure was a black sphere kind of floating or resting on the ground again he's not sure it 
looked quite small he estimates it was about 3T in diameter and was floating probably just a few 
inches above the ground but he says a bright white light Shone from the center of this sphere much 
like a flashlight and this figure actually watched the farmer as he biked past and the farmer he was 
quite astonished and frightened took one look at this figure and pedal off as fast as he could and 
as he got away this farmer looked back and saw that the creature and the sphere were gone yes 
a brief case without a lot of physical evidence to support it but certainly interesting for a lot of 
reasons we do see a lot of UFOs landing by Farms so perhaps there's a lesson there but it's also 
interesting how the witness reacted when someone sees an ET and a craft so so close rarely is their 
reaction to move forward and investigate it more closely and now we get to the last and final case 
in this little collection and I call this one I was completely Frozen I like this case because it 
involves multiple events multiple Witnesses and a really unusual ET who is behaving in ways that 
are very very strange this one occurred on January 14 2014 so relatively recent and it occurred in St 
zenan and this is in Lano dier in Quebec Canada and as we shall see a very interesting case and 
this is our final case was 2:45 in the morning of December 29 2013 13 when the main witness Madame 
L does not want to use her first name she was suffering from insomnia and was in the living 
room and noticed an intensely bright red light shining into the room so she looked outside to 
see what the source was and was amazed to see a glowing disc-shaped object hovering directly 
above the garage and not high up she estimates it was about 15 to 20 feet above the garage and she 
could tell because it was so close to the garage that this object was about 30 ft in diameter and 
as she watched this object emitted five small red glowing spheres which descended toward the 
garage and appeared to enter inside of it now at this point she says she was unable to move she 
felt a strong headache and and she remained in this position for about 5 minutes as this craft 
just sat there and then she saw these five red spheres emerge and move back into the craft she 
didn't notice one odd thing these spheres which had all been the same size well now one of them 
was quite a bit larger than the others after they re-entered the craft the craft quickly departed 
and she wanted to quickly run and tell her husband and kids but she couldn't she said she was totally 
incapacitated for about 20 minutes finally she was able to move woke up her husband and told him what 
happened and yeah it caused a headache and this headache remained for 2 days she didn't see any 
humanoids at this point however it was 10 days later around midnight on January 14 2014 when 
Madame l noticed that the garage door had been left open she went to her husband and children and 
asked which of them had left the garage door open all of them denied it this is the main garage door 
the one that can only be opened with the remote control now her husband went out to investigate 
her husband's name is Elaine and he went to the small door in the back and noticed that it was 
padlocked as it's supposed to be so the garage door shouldn't have been able to be opened he 
unlocked the door entered the room very quietly because he could hear something going on in there 
and could see a light and he was shocked to see a very strange looking figure crouched in the center 
of the garage he could see that it had a glowing spot on its left palm another light was coming 
from its right palm and being exerted towards the floor the entire body of this humanoid figure was 
glowing but it looked quite strange looked like it was wearing a mask of some kind he couldn't be 
sure but as Elaine says this creature was blue gray and white it was hard to say because it 
was bright I froze I was completely Frozen so a very strange figure and he noticed that its 
legs were also strange shaped different than a normal person this figure did not seem to notice 
Elaine and actually turned its back to him and continued to shine this weird light on the floor 
as if scanning it for something but there was really nothing there certainly nothing Elaine was aware of but then at this point the figure seemed to become aware of elain stood up and 
walked directly up to him and placed its hand on his shoulder and as Elaine said he pushed me he 
looked at me I could see his face if you can call it a face its head was rather elongated but it 
seemed that it was covered with a kind of helmet I am a tall man but this creature was bigger than 
me he did not seem to touch the ground his legs were moving he seemed to be touching the ground 
without actually touching it to move through the air it looked like he was lighter than us 
basically it seemed like the astronauts on the moon are a little lighter than we are but he was 
running very fast I do not know anyone who can go that speed so this figure went right out of 
the garage and off into the woods and of course Elaine went to investigate because as he says I 
wanted to see if he'd left any tracks in the snow I went back to see there were no tracks I saw some 
something and I can confirm that it is not human so this case was fully investigated there was a 60 
page or so report on all the details of this case which is very very unusual what I like about that 
case is that it was very well investigated uh the witnesses had quite a prolonged encounter not only 
with the craft but with the actual humanoid the fact that they were able to draw the humanoid in 
detail really gives you a sense of exactly what it looked like and just so strange and they described 
things we hear so often with these very Advanced Technologies using light fact that the humanoid 
was able to float off the ground move much more quickly than any normal humanoid it's also really 
interesting that this humanoid actually apparently used the garage remote control so that alone 
makes this case in my mind quite unusual and high strangeness for sure so that is our show for today 
all these super interesting cases coming from all over the world reaching back all the way to the 
1930s all the way up to 204 shows again that this is ongoing and remember the vast majority of cases 
go unreported so this should be considered only the tiny tiniest sample of what's going on and 
with such variation well you can see how really interesting it is that there are so many different 
types of humanoids but they all are very much like us behaving in ways that we would behave as I've 
often said ETS their behavior falls under the same umbrella as human behavior they are very much like 
us more alike us I think than different so yeah a lot to learn from these cases hope you've enjoyed 
this episode I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time 
keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye for now.
