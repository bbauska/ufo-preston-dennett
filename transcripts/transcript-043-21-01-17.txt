IS JESUS AN ALIEN?
Jan 17, 2021

Summary:
Jan 17, 2021
Many researchers have studied and remarked upon the obvious similarities between modern day UFO accounts and stories in the Bible and about Jesus. Some have come to the belief that Jesus may have actually been an extraterrestrial. Much of the research into this area has focused on ancient and historical accounts, including many paintings throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance which portray Jesus and UFOs in the same scene.

This video, however, focuses on current firsthand UFO accounts which contain overtly religious elements. The fact is, there are several recent cases on record in which people have reported seeing Jesus or other religious figures onboard a UFO! Investigators call these "mixed motif" cases, encounters which contain both extraterrestrial and religious themes. While these cases seem to be very rare, there are enough to raise serious questions about UFO origins and the connections between ETs, angels, demons and humanity itself.

Are UFOs angelic in origin? Could they be demonic? Are we dealing with a powerful interdimensional intelligence that shapeshifts and wears different masks? Or can these accounts be explained as extraterrestrials in the classic sense?

Whatever the explanation, these mixed motif cases defy the standard model of UFO contact, and may contain important insights into the nature of the phenomenon.

hello everyone my name is preston bennett and the title of today's presentation is called 
is jesus an alien I know this is a controversial topic i'm not trying to offend anyone or be 
facetious or anything like that instead I want to take a serious look at first-hand 
modern day cases which have overtly religious elements I know there's a long history of 
research and speculation into ufos and the bible and the connection between the two and the 
possibility that jesus was an extraterrestrial i'm not an expert on jesus in the bible 
but i'm certainly aware of many of these connections a lot of researchers have looked  into them researchers such as barry h downing who wrote the bible in the flying saucers or reverend 
michael carter who wrote a series of books a lot of people have written about the connection 
between the bible and ufos and jesus for that matter and i'll touch on that briefly and some 
other evidence but again mostly I want to talk about modern day first-hand cases in which people 
claim to have seen religious figures on board ufos or had you know cases involving overtly religious 
elements because there are a lot of them I have some of my own I think says something 
important to say about the ufo phenomena and that's why I wanted to put together this video 
so just touching briefly on the bible of course we have the wheels of ezekiel  that's often referenced as being possibly a ufo encounter and certainly the book of enoch as well 
which again I won't get into because this is not my area of expertise  uh but also the account of jesus and his life all the miracles surrounding him are some that 
we've seen in modern day ufo accounts such as the star of bethlehem being interpreted as the ufo 
the virgin birth the many healing accounts surrounding jesus uh levitation walking on water 
being raised from the dead the prophecies again many elements that do occur in modern 
day ufo accounts have led people to believe that possibly there is a connection there and that 
was jesus an alien I think it's very hard to say because this is something that occurred long ago 
but this is something that keeps recurring throughout history and up to the modern day 
uh just touching on a briefly on a few more historical accounts which I think are very  interesting are the many uh paintings from various artists across the world who have depicted jesus 
in association with what looked like modern day flying saucers and there's a 
lot of researchers have already looked into this i'll just touch on this briefly and
show you a number of paintings which show this connection  such as the fresco painting of the crucifixion of christ on the wall in the spezzitz covelli 
cathedral in georgia russia this dates back to the 11th century and it shows jesus 
on the cross and behind him are two dome-shaped objects flying in the sky
the crucifixion of christ painted in 1350 in the visoki dakhani monastery in kosovo 
shows the crucifixion and again behind jesus in the sky are two ufos each with an occupant inside 
in 1432 italian painter masolino de panacalli created the miracle of the snow which depicts 
a miraculous snowfall which occurred in august in the fourth century jesus and mary are seen 
looking outside what appears to be the porthole of a bell-shaped craft behind them are dozens of 
metallic looking silver saucer-shaped objects with domes on top all flying through the sky 
so this seems to be very clearly ufos for example there's the enunciation with saint amitis 
which was painted in 1486 by carlo crevelli an italian artist it depicts the virgin mary shortly 
before she realizes she will give birth to jesus and in the sky above is a saucer shaped object 
with little lights around it it is sending down a thin beam of light through the wall striking mary 
and there are other paintings a late 1400s painting called the madonna with saint giovanni 
shows mary praying over jesus and above her a solid saucer-shaped object hovers in the sky 
in the background you can see a man staring up at the ufo it looks like a modern day account 
another one is the 1710 painting called the baptism of christ by dutch artist 
art degeld which shows a saucer-shaped ufo sending down four beams of light striking jesus 
so clearly uh early painters thought there was a connection here and they didn't even 
interpret this necessarily as far as we know in an extraterrestrial sense but it looks like modern 
day accounts and that's that's fascinating because it continues all the way up to the modern day one 
of the first researchers to really look into this connection deeply was researcher jacques valle 
who points particularly to the case of the miracle of fatima this occurred in 1917 over a period of 
months and it's a very interesting case involving initially three children who saw a glowing female 
figure the lady of fatima floating in above them glowing in light she said she came from the sky 
and gave them a series of prophecies basically these prophecies were about upcoming wars which 
did occur and the decline of the influence of the church which is something we are seeing of so 
at any rate the lady of fatima said that they she would come back with a display that would convince 
all the people that this was real and some 70 000 people showed up and sure enough there was 
a display it was described as the sun moving around in the sky it clearly wasn't the sun 
it was a large glowing disc shaped object researcher l.a marzulli 
is another researcher who has pointed out the many modern day ufo elements of this particular case 
included including reported healings a wispy substance falling from the sky feelings of 
paralysis disclosing disc shaped object the glowing figure of course and the prophecies 
all sort of very common ufo elements that we see in modern day accounts
so yeah he calls jacques vallee called these mixed motif cases and the point is they're still 
occurring today so let's get into some more modern day cases i'll tell you about a few of my own 
and see if we can make any sense of this one case comes from contactee howard menger he was 
a sign painter from highbridge new jersey and was one of a handful of gentlemen claiming to 
be in contact with friendly human looking ets throughout the 1950s he ended up writing a book 
about his experiences called from outer space to you and in his book he describes not only seeing 
ufos and human looking ets but at one point he saw a figure that reminded him very much of jesus he 
saw this figure exiting a ufo a saucer shaped craft as howard menger writes and i'm quoting 
a tall handsome man with long blonde hair over his shoulders stood towering at the entrance the 
sight of the man thrilled me a slight enigmatic smile played on his lips as he looked at me 
while the expression in his eyes was one of pure love and understanding  I felt like a small child humble and loving and I wanted to embrace him as a long lost friend 
i believe I had the same feelings I would have experienced had the master  jesus just stepped out of the craft I shall never forget this aw inspiring experience it 
is too strongly impressed in my soul by the love compassion and wisdom of this profound teacher 
that wonderful being unlocked the door to my own soul and in a few brief moments planted 
the seeds of infinite knowledge in my subconscious which over a period of months and years gradually 
seeps out to my conscious expression it reminds me of the ministry of jesus and 
the point is he's not the only one reporting this type of experience these are continuing to occur 
all over the world and do seem to occur to people with strong religious backgrounds at least a 
number of cases though not all as we'll see here's another case which was quoted by jacques mallet 
which he found interesting because it's one of these mixed motif cases it involves a witness  by the name of jose antonio de silva from brazil and on may 3rd 1969 da silva was taken 
on board a craft by short helmeted figures and inside he saw these human looking figures which 
looked kind of like figures from the bible is how he described them and one of them 
grabbed his crucifix at one point and it was at this point that a jesus-like figure appeared 
at least according to the investigators who interviewed uh antonio they think he 
was trying to describe jesus he seemed very reluctant to actually identify this figure  as jesus but described him as about five feet tall caucasian slender bearded with long hair 
dressed in a robe and looking at him with very friendly eyes that were quote clear and serene 
so it was clear to the interviewers that  antonio believed this was jesus but was reluctant to admit this fact or that he believed this 
and it's very interesting because there are a lot of cases where people have seen claimed 
have seen what appears to be jesus on board a ufo and other religious figures for that matter 
take the case of donna r butts her case was investigated by dr s scott quarter this is 
is a case that occurred in russell kansas and involves an abduction along a highway 
and following this donna the main witness says that she was visited by an angelic figure 
in her room which she believes was saint peter and as she says and i'm quoting 
this peter was breathtaking he wasn't human or maybe I should say not physical there he 
stood in purest white from head to foot sparkling with millions of tiny lights he was not flowing 
robes like you might think I would tell you he was in what looked like a uniform of some sort 
that later donna would have more onboard ufo experiences and she saw saint peter she believes 
on board this ufo several times one time she was taken on board she was physically examined 
she was made to drink a strange liquid which she said actually improved her eyesight they shined 
a weird light on her body and then they took her to quote the throne room and here's where she had 
an encounter with who she believes might have been jesus as she says and I quote whoever he 
in capital letters was I saw him sitting in front of me this brilliant being was in a white uniform 
similar to peter's only more magnificent to either side of me were 12 beings in robes 
they proceeded to give donna a series of prophecies most of which involved sort of the 
second coming the rapture the tribulation this sort of thing which they predicted would begin 
in russell kansas and as of yet hasn't happened but uh here we have a very overtly religious 
elements in a modern-day ufo case and are we to take this at face value are these screen 
memories is this actual divine intervention our et's angels as we would think of them 
what's going on here here's another case which is very bizarre talk about mixed motif cases this 
case is from giorgio dibotanto of geneva italy and he ended up writing a book about his encounters 
ufos angels and starships and he had this very interesting experience giorgio he says 
where an angel appeared in his room and said his name was rafael and raphael told giorgio 
to drive to a certain location on a certain evening and they would have another meeting 
and so that's what grgo did he drove to this remote location  and instead of having an angelic visitation he was confronted by a metallic saucer 
as giorgio says it was quite a large silver plate in places like molten glass mixed with molten tin 
around it were lights of different colors and underneath it were three large spheres 
so this began a series of contact contacts in which giorgio and actually his friends he says 
were taken on board this craft and met both jesus and mother mary so again these are he's saying 
this is physically what happened he's he's not interpreting it I should say as a screen memory 
uh he believes these are actually uh religious uh figures that he is being confronted with 
as he describes mother mary and i'm quoting the young woman was dressed in soft sky blue 
her hair was chestnut blunt and fell to her shoulders she wore a pair of sandals  that seemed to be woven of gold it gave off such an iridescent splendor of many colors 
as to be beyond description she appeared to be about 20 years of age her lovely eyes were blue 
and expressed a great kindness and understanding equality of refinement and magnaminity 
radiated from her whole being she moved with a graceful natural simplicity as she came towards us 
and like many other witnesses such as in the fatima incident
uh they were given prophecies of future disasters  uh striking our planet this seems to be a common theme not only in these religious accounts and ufo 
accounts but in the mixed motif cases and there are very high profile modern day cases with this 
mixed motif such as the case of betty andreasen who interprets her gray type ets as angels 
she is a housewife mother from ashburnham massachusetts whose case was investigated by  raymond fowler who wrote a series of books about them the andreason affair and many others and uh 
it became clear that while some of betty's experiences involved you know physical 
examinations and needles and implants and things like this some involved what appeared to be 
very spiritual events or religious events on one occasion she was taken to see quote 
the one and she recalled under hypnosis that the aliens took her to this very large majestic door 
and told her to quote go home and see the one and betty recalled this under hypnosis and remembers 
what happened but she says it was so personal so sacred that she won't does not want to tell anyone 
she would not even tell ray fowler what happened so it's clear that this was a very religious and 
personal experience for her and she's made no uh you know she's always made it clear 
that she interprets this as religious and angelic and as ray fowler writes 
betty believes that her ufo experiences involved angels or messengers in the biblical sense of the 
word can it be betty's experience as a modern-day example of so-called angelic visitation religious 
and prejudice of the religious would cause many to reject such a thing a few might say at this 
point that the religious interpretation of the eti visitation was strictly the invention of the awe 
struck witness however can we legitimately separate the message from the messenger 
should we do the same with the andreason affair so again raymond fowler is pointing out the 
religious aspects and raising the question is this something we take at face value 
is this experience being interpreted through a religious lens are the et's religious themselves 
are they angelic are these screen memories what is going on here so 
there are a lot of cases that really raise this kind of question and one that really raises it 
overtly is what happened to denise and bert twiggs of malala oregon they wrote a book 
about their experiences called secret vows our lives with extraterrestrials and in this 
book they describe what sartar is a very typical sort of missing time abduction by great type ets 
they thought but it evolved into sort of a very friendly and bizarre contact account with friendly 
mostly human-looking humanoid et's and they ended up having a very close relationship or taken on 
board the craft many times healed shown nurseries an alien zoo the whole deal i've quoted the twiggs 
case before and it should come as no surprise that they also report some overtly religious 
elements and in fact report seeing jesus himself which they weren't particularly happy about 
because they did not know how to interpret this they were not super religious they were part of 
a church but ended up getting kicked out when they revealed their encounters and now they have this  experience which as they said and i'm quoting we even believed we were open-minded but our beliefs 
were put to the ultimate test when we recall being taken to the community religious center 
to be introduced to jesus our conscious minds rebelled believing that jesus died about two 
thousand years ago we refused to believe that jesus would be alive on a mother ship  or anywhere else besides heaven for that matter more than once on the ship we recalled seeing 
this entity known as jesus as well as beings surrounded by light at first we told no one of 
our encounters with jesus and his angels fearing that other humans would react the same way we did 
but then we began hearing of other humans who also recalled seeing jesus and the beings of light 
we do not fully understand his appearance there nor do we know its true implications
so it's interesting that they themselves had a hard time with it and I think we see evidence of  this in other cases there was a case which uh was actually someone who called into the oprah winfrey 
show oprah winfrey had a talk show of course for many many years and of course tackled the ufo 
subject on at least one occasion bringing on some people who said that they'd been taken on board  a ufo but during the show she had someone call in and report her experience and this lady who called 
in said that she saw what appeared to be jesus the lady said that she was taken from her bedroom she 
went willingly she's not sure why and there was a craft landed near her home she was brought inside 
and as the woman said and I quote they told us that the creator would be in in a moment 
and this man walked in this man stood about seven feet tall and he was the most beautiful  man I had ever seen in my life he had white hair a white beard and he wore a white robe 
and he told me he told all of us that we were there for a purpose that the information we 
would be given would not directly affect us but our children what they told us more or less is 
that the men are going to screw up the world and it's going to be the woman that have to get it out 
and we were given information which I don't know what it is they told us we wouldn't be  allowed to remember until the time comes so yeah this was on the oprah winfrey show 
and uh we have that same prophecy being given again of uh upcoming disasters but that i'm 
not sure what to make of these accounts where people said they've seen jesus on board a ufo 
but there are enough or I think we have to take them seriously and there are other cases that have 
weird religious elements here's a very interesting case which was reported to mufon I believe this 
occurred in denver colorado uh on august 12 2012. and the lady who had this experience also reported 
it to linda moulton howe and says she called coast to coast and reported this sighting she 
saw this star-like object hovering overhead and she became fearful and she started talking to it 
to see if this was you know friendly was this something that was from jesus or 
was it demonic and as she says and I quote I asked it if it was sent from the christ jesus 
and if so would it blink off and back on the star dimmed down and lit back up again I then asked 
again inaudibly telepathically if it was here for the rapture it dimmed down and lit up again twice
so here we have someone in telepathic communication with the ufo and  it's sort of signaling her these religious messages it's very interesting uh here's another 
case which i'm not sure uh about the source or how seriously to take this case but uh the 
writer of the case r.l hobbs uh does list the name of the witness and his location uh according to 
r.l hobbes nigel harshaw of suffolk england went to visit the united states in specific nevada this 
is on january 28 2017 nigel harshaw was in nevada and had a ufo come down and take him on board 
and there were human looking beings on board and according to nigel these beings said we 
have good news have you heard the good news and told him jesus loves you and so 
nigel found this very perplexing because he actually was not a religious person and  he didn't know what to interpret it and he just kind of went along with it because he didn't want 
them to freak out but the beings told him that jesus had come to their planet some 400 000 years 
ago and uh that's what they were here to talk about sort of like extraterrestrial missionaries 
uh at any rate it's a bizarre case if true and uh the witness was not happy he says honestly I wish 
it had happened to someone else whether true or not it certainly fits the pattern we see in 
other bizarre cases here's one case which was reported to the mutual ufo network mufon this 
occurred on july 25th 2014 to a family of three a father a mother and son they decided to go 
camping at mount rainier at a campgrounds in mount rainier washington washington state 
and they had a very bizarre experience involving a ufo  and they had some disorientation what possibly could be missing time 
which that's what they've concluded actually because later this they had varying memories of 
the incident and the son recalled seeing this very tall being approach the campsite and talk to the 
father and the father and mother did not remember this at least not at first and uh that evening 
they decided to sleep in the car instead of the campsite itself because they couldn't light a fire 
and the father had a very strange dream in the dream he saw this very tall humanoid who announced 
itself identified itself as god and proceeded to give him a series of prophecies showing him 
visions of war-torn countries across the planet in the future and told him these things will happen 
and the witness said why are you showing me this you know what does this mean and uh the next thing 
the being showed him was an image of jesus wearing a crown of thorns the very famous picture of jesus 
with a crown of thorns around his head so the witness does not know what to make of this because 
he is not a religious person but he became very concerned because these prophecies started coming 
true he watched them come true on the news and it really has affected him profoundly as he says and 
i'm quoting I am an atheist and the fact that the being told me that he was god and then the picture 
of jesus has done a number on me mentally I keep my head on my shoulders but I am just wondering 
if anyone else saw something that night as this interaction has led me down a path of intrigue
he definitely feels like he was shown future events because again he kept seeing them and 
there's that sort of pattern again of people being given prophecies usually of upcoming 
disasters so I think this is a very important factor as i'll get to later but I want to quote 
another modern day case which occurred in 2018 to a lady by the name of bettina rodriguez aguilera 
actually it occurred earlier than that but in 2018 bettina of florida decided that she was 
going to run for congress for the u.s house of representatives and she started her campaign and 
of course the media started digging deep into her background and that's when they found out that she 
gave an interview in which she claimed that at age seven uh she had had an extraterrestrial encounter 
and bettina says that the et's she saw looked pretty much exactly like the statue that uh is 
in rio de janeiro called christ the redeemer it's a very famous statue it's huge and she believes 
that perhaps this is what they looked like and that they were associated with this somehow 
uh they certainly did give her a very uh religious type of message  as they told her and i'm quoting 
god is a universal universal energy it's in everything 
god talks to people and they understand it in different ways but there's only one religion
so definitely uh it appears that uh people are having this I mean we know they were 
having this experience but whether this is a due to religious interpretation or are they actually 
experiencing this is not entirely clear uh but we really can't talk 
about ufos and jesus without at least mentioning the other end ufos and satan and demonic phenomena 
and I know there are a lot of people who believe that ufos are demonic in origin and I have to tell 
you i've investigated angels and demons both in some detail so uh i'm not completely ignorant 
about this these phenomena which is near as I can tell are separate because for the most part people 
who encounter angels aren't seeing ufos people who experience a demonic haunting aren't seeing 
ufos either people who see ufos for the most part aren't seeing angels or jesus or anything 
like this however there are weird connections uh one weird case pointing towards the possible 
demonic origin of ufos comes from a witness by the name of michael corey who back in 1972 
had joined a religious group this is in june lake california and uh michael had joined a spiritual 
group which talked about jesus and gabriel being extraterrestrials and taken on board a ufo 
and he was uncomfortable with these ideas as he couldn't reconcile them to the bible 
and he left the group and he says the next morning he had a very interesting experience 
on which he was able to banish a ufo in the name of jesus is basically what he says happened and 
as I quote the next morning I was up early and on the way to mammoth and the sky was 
blue and as clear as can be and a spacecraft came up over the pine trees in full sight 
i looked at it and pointed my finger at it and said these words satan you're a liar in the name  of jesus be gone the craft shook in the air and disappeared and i've never seen one to this day 
so the witness is up obviously convinced that the ufo phenomenon is demonic in origin 
that's something he believes today and as he says and I quote I believe that this entire 
ufo lore is just the demons trying as hard as they can to do the job they do so well 
deceive i'm telling this story knowing that many will think i'm lying or fabricating this  for a personal religious view but I promise you that nothing could be further from the truth 
at the time I was not a christian but these events plus others have helped me find that way of living 
i witness these things and I tell you that I stand by this statement  so this was his experience we have to respect that certainly and uh he's not the only one 
who's reporting this type of thing I scoured the files of mufon and I honestly was thought 
i would find many more cases I found just these two that had something to say towards you know 
interpreting this in this manner and another case from the finest occurred in august 22nd 2007 a 
woman had gone out to see the meteor showers this is in brevard north carolina and she saw a ufo 
and she felt like it was making or sort of a threatening maneuver at her and again she 
believes that this is a demonic phenomena so sh this is what she says happened according to the 
witness and I quote I felt a surge of courage and boldness from the holy spirit within to challenge 
these lights with the truth of jesus I shouted out to the lights that I did not fear them 
that they had no control over me that jesus would return soon to establish his kingdom 
forever that they the demonic spirits would be thrown in the lake of fire soon and that I was 
commanding them in strength through the lord jesus that they be gone immediately so that they may not 
deceive anyone else sky watching that night and she says they disappeared at that point 
so whether these two cases are you know coincidental the witnesses certainly don't think 
so and I think we have to respect that they feel like these ufos were listening to them but I do 
think that we have to be clear that these is being looked at with a very strong religious viewpoint 
and uh this witness certainly believes ufos are demonic as she says I do believe that people do 
see ufos ghosts etc but that they are simply a deceptive tool used by satan to confuse and 
ensnare the unsaved I believe this ufo deception will play a key role very soon in world affairs 
so she's saying not only are ufos demonic but all paranormal phenomena and this is something that 
uh many people who hold this interpretation of ufos uh do believe to be true and again 
i couldn't find a whole lot of evidence for it these were the two cases that I found which had  some you know certainly anecdotal evidence towards it I thought I would find more but I didn't 
there's actually more angelic cases pointing towards this phenomenon being angelic  which I find interesting but sometimes yeah you look at these weirdly mixed motif cases 
for example ann druffle is a very well-known researcher she's written  a number of books the tahunga canyon contacts firestorm about james mcdonald a 
ufo scientist and also she wrote a book about how to defend yourself against alien abduction 
and according to and ruffle it's possible to halt an encounter she has a number of cases 
in which people have been successful doing this and she cites a resistance technique number eight 
which she calls appealing to spiritual personages and what she's saying again is calling out to 
some religious figure such as jesus or an angel can actually halt a ufo encounter 
and she does provide one case uh at least one prominent case certainly in which 
it appears that this did happen the witnesses uh melissa mcleod and according to melissa she 
was having encounters with uh et's where she was being taken on board a craft they would come it'd 
paralyze her in her bedroom and pull her on board and she learned to resist this she says if she 
called out to saint michael this would sometimes break the paralysis she would call out verbally 
dear saint michael help me and this seemed to work for her on multiple occasions so uh whether 
or not this is actually an effective technique I don't know because I certainly don't have
a lot of cases like that but I do have at least one  that's very close to something like this and actually has multiple religious elements to it
having you know talked to hundreds of people who've had ufo encounters most I can confidently  say have not interpreted this way or described overtly religious elements but a few have 
it definitely does come up and for example my latest book on board ufo encounters I present 
a couple of cases which have religious elements I present 15 cases of people been taken on board but 
12 I would say believe they're dealing with extraterrestrials in the classic sense there's  no overtly religious elements but a few do have some in fact uh one guy by the name of ron had a 
very friendly encounter as a young teenager in new kensington pennsylvania in 1965 where he saw ufo 
human occupants he had missing time but recalled what happened he recall being taken on board and 
these were very friendly human looking people who he said radiated goodness and perfection to such 
a way that he connected it to angels and he feels very strongly that the ufo phenomena has a strong 
angelic connection and he's not the only one that feels this way that's one of the rare cases 
i've personally investigated um but uh there was another case in this same book where a gentleman 
believes he's dealing with a phenomenon that's essentially demonic this is the case of ramon 
i did a whole video on ramon and his experiences because they're very extensive and i'm not going 
to repeat them all here other than to say he's been abducted his entire life he saw et's while 
in the military while in vietnam he had sightings had strange experiences in a hospital in japan and 
back here at camp pendleton in southern california and had an abduction experience outside of 
los angeles where he was taken on board a ufo and he says it was a very scary experience for him 
um he was they tried to seduce him with a female looking alien they showed him alien hybrid babies 
uh they took him to the control room it's a fairly standard case he was being physically examined 
whole time he's looking for a way off the ship he's got a very strong religious faith 
he grew up uh religious but became increasingly religious and feeling really out of control and 
pushed around by these great type ets he's come to interpret them as being demonic 
because he feels they're deceptive and while on board this ufo sitting in a chair he was 
fighting for consciousness when he says saint michael appeared the archangel michael and uh 
he says not only that there were angels on either side human looking glowing figures uh 
with olive complexions and very friendly eyes and they commanded wake up release him and uh at this 
point ramon was effectively escorted from this ufo and taken down a ramp and back to his car 
and he says that as he went down this ramp that there were actually rows of angels 
on either side of him not just a few dozens of angels in the classic sense so I am not sure 
what's going on in ramon's case uh his case does have a lot of very bizarre elements and this is 
certainly one of them and yet he again he's not the only one who's reporting this kind of thing 
so is this his beliefs that are causing this to happen is this a show put on for him 
a screen memory are we dealing with actual angels in the classic sense um you know our ufos demonic 
i don't know I can only present the evidence we have that either supports or denies these theories 
and every now and then you run into these mixed motif cases one lady who I interviewed for 
the book on board ufo encounters is lynette and she's had experiences with gray type ets her whole 
life and they've given her an enormous amount of information and they told her flat out that 
they have been visiting humanity for millennia and that the people 
who they visited interpreted them as angels they told her who you thought were angels 
were us so they said that flat out that uh people are actually misinterpreting them 
and now that we've got you know actually there are extraterrestrials so perhaps you 
know there's not only issues here with screen memories but you know interpretation issues 
and I have to tell you there's one guy interviewed for that same book joe  who is not entirely convinced he's seeing et's or for that matter angels or demons or anything like 
this he prescribes to the possibility that the ufo phenomena certainly is he's experienced it 
uh might be something else an intelligence that wears different masks  and is able to put on sort of whatever appearance it wants this is the jacques filet john keel 
you know lauren coleman school of thought that perhaps we're dealing with interdimensional  beings uh an intelligence of great power that you know has the ability 
to intervene in people's lives but it's not extraterrestrials as we would think of it 
so i've definitely looked into a lot of cases like these and I know there are others  out there I think would start to get repetitive at this point I looked into all these cases above and 
others and for my book not from here volume three and uh yeah there's some very interesting details 
which definitely coincide precisely with modern day ufo accounts and for that matter near-death 
experiences we see a number of people who describe near-death accounts of being taken up a you know 
into tunnel of light and meeting jesus and being given prophecies and being spiritually 
transformed so there are some very interesting correlations between all of these accounts and 
and I honestly am still not sure what this connection is uh having studied angels 
and demonic phenomena i'm convinced they're separate in in their structure 
you know in their main in their main part of it the reason I say that is because people who 
describe demonic hauntings aren't seeing ufos and people who describe angelic visitations 
you know they're just aren't seeing ufos as well and most people see ufos aren't describing these 
overtly religious elements in fact the actual number of cases that I could find 
is statistically almost insignificant it's very very small in my own having talked to 
hundreds of people i've only run across it a few times so i'm not sure how to interpret it 
i have to respect the witnesses and their interpretations because it's their experience 
but I do feel that probably most people are seeing extraterrestrials in the classic sense 
but some people perhaps are seeing angels and that we should take these cases at face value or 
perhaps sometimes ets are putting on a display or a screen memory or for that matter perhaps 
some of these are interdimensional entities masquerading as angels or et's or what have you 
so it's hard to say but I do did want to point out that there are a number of cases with these strong 
overt religious elements i've got them myself lots of cases with a little bit of bleed through 
and definitely a strong correlation among what actually happens onboard ufo as opposed to a 
religious experience so that in itself is very interesting and significant and that's why I 
really wanted to cover this video because yes there's a lot of historical evidence supporting 
the possibility that jesus is an alien or that ufos might be angelic in origin but uh 
not a lot of research into modern day cases and I was interested to find that yes there's a few 
cases which point towards a demonic origin but uh many more cases pointing towards an angelic 
interpretation whereas really the vast majority of cases support I think you know just looking at 
objectively a an interpretation that this is our extraterrestrials in the classic sense as we would 
think of you know extraterrestrials biological beings on a planet very much like us but different 
so that's this presentation I hope you enjoyed it  thanks once again for listening and like I always like to say keep having fun
