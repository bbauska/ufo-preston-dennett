SCHOOLYARD UFO ENCOUNTERS, PART 1: SIGHTINGS
Jun 28, 2020

Summary:
Jun 28, 2020
All across the world, schools are being targeted by UFOs. More than 100 documented cases are on 
record. These are typically long lasting, low level, daylight encounters viewed by large groups 
of witnesses. Something very profound is happening here.

This video is Part One of a two-part presentation on the history of schoolyard UFO encounters on 
our planet. Why are UFOs targeting schools? What happens when a UFO hovers over a school 
playground and is viewed by hundreds of witnesses, including teachers? 

The cases shown here will answer these questions and more. 

Part One covers dozens of sightings, starting as early as 1853 and continuing to the present day. 
There are cases of UFOs hovering at extremely low levels, sometimes causing panic on the 
playground. There are cases involving photographs and moving films. Two cases involve physical 
evidence in the form of angel hair. In some cases, there is a strong government response. 

And this is just the beginning! While the sightings are amazing enough, even more astonishing 
are the many cases of landings and humanoids.  Part Two of this presentation: "Schoolyard UFO 
Encounters Part Two: Landings and Humanoids," covers the cases of actual contact, revealing the 
truth behind the alien agenda of targeting schools. 

All these cases and more have been collected in my book, "Schoolyard UFO Encounters: 100 True 
Accounts," now available on Amazon.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and  today I want to talk about a very special type  
of UFO encounter which I call schoolyard UFO  encounters these are cases in which UFOs hover  
over schools sometimes landing I've documented  about 100 cases more than that actually coming  
from all across the world these are not normal  sightings your typical sighting is a flyby of an  
anomalous light late at night these are profoundly  different in a number of ways first of all in  
these cases they directly target schools coming  from above or the horizon and heading over the  
school and stopping in a number of cases these  are very low-level sightings a thousand feet a  
couple of hundred feet sometimes much less these  are typically daylight sightings also these are  
very long lasting sightings not just a couple of  minutes sometimes hours or even days they're very  
widely viewed 30 students 40 students 50 100 200  even 400 often teachers also view these objects  
and about half the cases in fact typically in  these large cases there's a government response of  
some kind police perhaps or even Air Force becomes  very interested in these sightings so all kinds of  
schools are being targeted but 50% of the cases  involve elementary schools our youngest children  
so that I'd find kind of interesting at least 30  to 35 percent of these cases are not sightings  
these are actually landings and sometimes  humanoids are seen so again these are very  
close encounters part 1 of this presentation is  going to cover just the sightings because there's  
a lot and part two I will cover the landing and  humanoid cases so let's just get right to it there  
are a lot of cases earliest case I could find took  place in a 18:53 in Spencer Tennessee over burette  
college it's a typical schoolyard encounter  it lasted about 20 minutes two lights glowing  
pulsating putting on what amounts to a display  for a number of students and teachers really  
cases began in the 1950s the earliest I could find  was March 15th 1950 it occurred to a Prestonsburg  
elementary school it's a little town in Kentucky  Prestonsburg there were 35 kids and the teacher  
Miss Holbrook when three very loud UFOs not planes  came swooping down over the school scared the  
daylights out of the kids some fainted some threw  up they scattered thinking was the end of the  
world and these objects moved off finally miss  Holbrook that the students calm down and about  
an hour later for UFOs showed up and again buzzed  the school causing near panic so apparently these  
objects do want to be seen something very strange  about the timing of these cases because it was two  
weeks later about a hundred and fifty students and  five teachers at Pine Point Elementary School in  
ponds fir'd Minnesota saw a metallic mirror-like  object which stayed hovering over the school for  
most of the morning a few months later in October  1950 a teacher and the entire fifth grade class at  
a school in Emporium Illinois watched a plastic  UFO hovering outside the window for about 10  
minutes so these cases you know following 1950  seem to occur about once per year in May 1951  
at Irving Elementary School in Kansas both the  kids and the teachers saw what they described  
as a beautiful silver disc shaped object which  hovered over the playground at a pretty low level  
for the entire duration of the lunch period  finally the kids had to go inside and after  
that the UFO went away but it's important to note  that around this time kids you know particularly  
at that age had no conception of what a UFO was  so they did not even really know what they were  
looking at in 1952 at 4:00 p.m. school had just  let out at a elder Park Elementary School this is  
elder Park primary school in Glasgow Scotland and  everyone was walking out on the playground when  
they saw a very large shadow circular coming down  on the field and looking up this are huge metallic  
sombrero shaped craft it moved silently and slowly  and started to hover over the school itself but  
over the steeple maybe 50 feet up and stayed there  rotating finally it started to make a loud whining  
noise it tilted and it darted off over the city  of Glasgow where a bunch of other people saw it
another case occurred about one year later  July 1953 the student was 13 years old his name  
was Donald MacAlpine he and a bunch of other  students on the playground saw this metallic  
saucer a disc-shaped craft hovering at about  treetop level right behind large elm tree next  
to the playground the investigators from nycap  the National Investigative Committee for aerial  
phenomena interviewed the students and they felt  like this UFO was spying on the kids cases all  
over the world one from France comes from French  researcher aim Michelle this is in 1954 during a  
wave of sightings a UFO appeared and it made  a beeline for the school the Ecole lair OU's  
school and a teacher in about 23 students saw  this object came to Porter school stopped right  
over the school turned on its side then resumed  the horizontal position and darted off one of my  
favorite cases occurred on October 22nd 1954 in  Marysville Ohio to the Jerome elementary school  
it was a beautiful day the kids had been good  so they got an extra recess around 3:15 p.m. a  
bright disk-like object showed up in the sky it  was very low it had very bright lights finally  
some of the students decided to go get the teacher  and they got the principal mr. Warwick he runs out  
and sees this thing he said it was almost too  bright to look at he's never seen anything like   it before or since and he called for another  teacher mrs. dittmeyer to come out and look  
at it as well she comes running out at which  point it disappears she didn't get to see it  
but following this the entire sky filled with this  weird cotton candy-like substance we now know it  
as angel hair we're not sure what it is but it's  a very fibrous light white colored substance that  
looks very much like cotton or cotton candy and  it fell over the school for the next hour or so  
Miss dittmeyer said it was absolutely beautiful  it covered the entire playground and about a three  
mile circle radius some of the students collected  the stuff up brought it to the teachers who took  
it into their hands and coiled it up and me it  formed small gelatinous balls which eventually  
just dehydrated or dissipated and disappeared  it turned the both of the teacher's hands green  
however temporarily that's an interesting case  they did manage to save a sample which they sent  
to luck born Air Force Base but never heard back  from them what's interesting about this case is  
years later researchers found out that Robert  C white an Air Force officer who worked in a  
governmental capacity studying UFOs had heard  about this case it generated special interest  
in his office because they were not able to solve  it in December 1954 there was a huge display of  
UFOs over the town of San Lorenzo over a thousand  people did this object this is in Argentina and  
least four hundred students saw this display over  the san lorenzo college - fainted from all the  
excitement and it was yeah very dramatic sighting  and that's sort of the pattern we see in these  
kinds of cases it appears that they're putting  on displays typical case occurred in 1955 at a  
Elementary School in Nashville Tennessee thirteen  year old student Stan Lee Mikkel Heine was one of  
the witnesses he thirty other students and their  teachers saw metallic saucer hovering about three  
hundred feet away from the school it hovered for  just a few minutes and then darted away but had a  
really big effect on Stan Lee and he became very  interested in astrophysics and would speak about  
UFOs on radio shows throughout his life for years  afterwards another very interesting case that's  
almost identical to the drôme elementary school  case occurred almost exactly one year after it on  
October 27th 1955 this event occurred at Whitsett  Elementary School in North Carolina and there were  
a hundred and twenty students and the principal  his name was HD Lambeth they all observed and  
another teacher six or seven metallic sphere like  objects darting around in the sky and just like  
in the Jerome elementary school case they released  an enormous quantity of angel hair over the school  
playground I honestly think this is deliberate  a display sort of a gift or calling card because  
angel-hair cases are very rare and here we  have two in a row and it fits this pattern of  
displays the entire playground was covered with  this angel-hair one of the students scooped his  
stuff up and actually put in his mouth and began  to eat it before the principal could stop him he  
spit it out he said it tasted salty and bad  again the principal did get a sample which he  
sent off to Burlington science labs who were not  able to identify it as any known substance they  
thought it was organic they suggested sending it  to a biologist because the only thing they could  
think it might be would be spiderwebs so they  did they sent a to a biologist and the biologist  
immediately ruled out spiderwebs as the fibers  were far too even and there was no evidence of  
spiders for that large quantity of angel hair this  was a case that did generate a lot of interest the  
Air Force heard about it and sent over captain  Murray Thornton who actually tried to debunk  
this case and told Lambeth what he was seeing were  reflections on the clouds what well it turned out  
that principal Lambeth was a world war two veteran  who had flown more than 40 combat missions and was  
actually actually an aerial observer a trained  observer so he was a very good witness and he  
wasn't having any debunking from Captain Thornton  so lots of cases by the way in that Whitsett North  
Carolina elementary case the sample of angel  hair mysteriously disappeared at some point in  
the years following wave in 1956 and 1957 there  was a huge wave of sightings to many really to  
cover there was a school in Bakersfield that  was visited another in Nashville Tennessee one  
in Ada Oklahoma another in Homestead Pennsylvania  another in Salina Pennsylvania had hovered about  
a hundred over the school and that case Bismarck  South Dakota had a visitation a school in Dublin  
Ireland Alaska Brazil England there were two  cases from that period 56 and 57 that really  
stood out both occurred in 1957 in New Zealand  one occurred on April 10th at Taradale school in  
Hawke's Bay New Zealand at least 30 students saw  a glowing cigar shaped object just a few thousand  
feet above the school performing all these really  fantastic maneuvers and it was just a few months  
later on August 2nd 1957 when 130 students and  three teachers at Rifton District High School in  
New Zealand saw us a glowing cigar shaped object  again a few thousand feet up performing fantastic  
maneuvers before darting away cases pretty much  everywhere in the world one case comes from Xiao  
ping China and the Hunan Province was just before  dawn still dark when a giant fiery object came  
over the school it dipped down into the valley  where the school was it was huge it was glowing  
bright and actually gave off a lot of heat it  made a weird sound like chirping birds left a  
very strong odor and moved pretty slowly made a  sharp turn and then moved off into the distance  
so clearly not media or anything like that  another case occurred in Brazil at Machado  
elementary school that was June 18th 1958 a bunch  of students saw this object go right by the school  
one month later at Rickman's grammar school and  Hertfordshire England there was a hat shaped  
glowing saucer with a yellow band which again move  right next to school an amusing case occurred at  
Ramapo high school in New Jersey in October 29th  1959 when a student one of the football players  
ran into the locker room and said a UFO was  hovering over the playing field and the entire  
football team dressed only in their underwear  went running out onto the field and observed this  
object for about five or ten minutes but had to  go inside because it was too cold so yeah I think  
these objects are definitely putting on displays  on purpose in 1959 at fleetwood elementary school  
in Canada a UFO appeared for like six days in  a row and later appeared in 1962 to a student  
and his mother and at that point they saw it  was only 20 feet over the school there are at  
least three cases in 1960 there was a good one  in Scotland another in Rogersville Pennsylvania  
where an object hovered about a hundred feet  over the school there's one interesting case   which occurred at James Logan High School in  Union City California where only one student saw  
the object it was very low it covered most of the  playground he said he turned her on to tell the  
other students to look and when he looked back it  was gone this is not the only case like that where  
only one student will sees things a great case  occurred in 1961 in Washington another in 1962  
were a hundred and eighty children at a school and  teachers at a school in Argentina saw three UFOs  
buzz over the school there was another case in  China in 1963 also 1963 there was an interesting  
case in mark leavel California were about 20  kids and teachers this is a very small school saw  
this object just dropped down out of the sky and  hovered right next to the school 40 feet overhead  
for just a few minutes and then darted away over  the nearby mountains a very strange case occurred  
just a few days after the famous Lonnie Zamora  landing in Socorro New Mexico and not far away  
from there at all this is at Lowell elementary  school in Albuquerque New Mexico April 29th 1964  
a bunch of students saw this egg-shaped object  hovering over the school it was very low making  
pendulum like movements and yo-yo like movements  one of the students Sharon stall watched it their  
entire duration of the recess and returned to her  classroom where she started to feel unwell she  
went to the nurse and the nurse was shocked to see  that there were burns on Sharon Stone's face she  
was rushed to the hospital and was diagnosed with  second-degree burns her eyes swelled up she had  
difficulty seeing for a number of days and it was  painful her mother was very alarmed because over  
the next month or so Sharon suddenly became much  more mature not only mentally but physically and  
grew almost a half foot over in a period of over a  period of a few weeks which the mother attributes  
to this sighting that this was a case that also  generated interest from a lot of UFO researchers  
a very compelling case occurred on April 22nd  1966 at Beverly Massachusetts Beverly High School  
a young girl Nancy Modugno was in her home next  to the school when she saw a UFO just float down  
the street she ran downstairs told her parents who  didn't believe her at first but she insisted that  
she saw it so her mother and two other ladies  exited the house and walked over to the Beverly  
High School next door they were standing next  to the field and were shocked to see that their  
daughter had been right there were three objects  one was very low they were metallic with colored  
lights there were no apparent other witnesses  though at the time there was a high school game  
going on inside the school these three ladies were  watching this object when one of them decided to  
wave at the closest one what she did at that point  the object swooped down right over their heads  
about twenty feet two of the ladies scattered  one was rooted to the spot the object got even  
lower they finally the remaining woman ran away  and all three ran home one of the woman had been  
so frightened by the object's appearance that  she urinated herself once home they called the  
police gathered some more neighbors and everyone  within shouting distance and a group of about a  
dozen people approached the school again and the  objects were still there one of the objects was  
now about forty feet over the school building when  the police arrived one of the police officers got  
out of his cruiser and said okay who called about  the plane and they pointed out the object he was  
visibly shaken the other officer saw it as well  and eventually this object darted away what's  
really interesting is this object did not leave  it actually made a beeline for the nearby Gordon  
College about five minutes away very close and it  swoops down over the quad there at Gordon College  
and scares the living daylights out of another  group of students so I mean clearly these objects  
are targeting schools Raymond Fowler investigated  this case he interviewed the witnesses the police  
officer and other people in the area the air force  expressed some interest in this case Project Blue  
Book investigated it and after really nothing more  than a cursory examination said the the witnesses  
had mistaken the object for jupiter and that what  they were seeing was actually jupiter go figure  
so there are cases where people have actually  managed to photograph these things in January  
of 1967 an object was repeatedly seen hovering  over Hotchkiss High School after appearing  
several nights in a row as it was seen by many  students and at least eight teachers one of the  
students 17 year-old Richard Gipps teen took a  photograph of it it was a time-lapse five-second  
long photograph and actually managed to capture  this object that has appeared as it appeared and  
disappeared following this incident the sightings  suddenly stopped and that was it the UFO has moved  
off to another school to target which they did  just a few months later March 9th 1967 about 40  
students and three teachers nuns and a guard of  police officer William Fisher or at the Sacred  
Heart elementary school in Moline Illinois when  this very large object glowing appeared over to  
school and started putting on maneuvers people  around the school saw it as well it stops traffic  
William Fisher happened to have a movie camera as  part of his job he ran and got it and managed to  
take about 30 seconds of film of this object as it  moved off into the distance he told the police the  
Air Force expressed interest in his case and  did an interview and he was later approached   by men and black type characters who from some  intelligence agency that they would not divulge  
who also expressed interest in his case and in  particular the footage so many many cases to other  
cases I know of in 1967 a principal and teachers  and students at a school in Shamokin Pennsylvania  
observed three objects hover over their school  for about 90 minutes one of which was very low  
and what was interesting is at the time there was  a power outage in the area also in 1967 students  
at a school in Venice California were buzzed by  a very UFO which made kind of an electronic siren  
like noise apparently to get their attention which  it sure did many of these cases involve strange  
memory problems a good example is what happened in  1967 at Spring Creek Elementary School in Dallas  
Texas one of the students recalls about a hundred  students himself and teachers saw a very large UFO  
come swooping down and hovered over the school  it released a bunch of silver discs like objects  
causing a complete panic everyone rushed back into  the school he forgot about it until sometime later  
and started asking all the students and teachers  who were there and nobody remembered he finally  
found one other student who did remember though  his version of events were slightly different he  
remembered it taking place at his house and he  said that there were the little disks weren't  
silver they were red so yeah weird memory problems  which makes me think probably a lot of these cases  
are taking place and aren't being reported at  all a great case occurred a year later on May  
21st 1968 English teacher karma Winterton and 21  students at the Union High School in Roosevelt  
Utah saw this object hovering right next to the  school for at least fifteen minutes it was very  
low hovering over a small hill next to the school  this case was investigated by Frank Salazar II and  
jr. Hicks and this took place in a very active  area the winter basin in Utah which by the way  
is not far from the skinwalker ranch which is very  famous not all of these cases are seen by students  
some involve just teachers actually in 1969 five  teachers and school administrators their attention  
was drawn outside by a large silver object  hovering over the school for just a two minutes  
another more dramatic case took place in May 1970  this is in Bronx New York at public elementary  
school number 50 for at least a hundred students  saw this it was a very large silver pyramid shaped  
object the size of a school bus it was only a  hundred feet high and it was spinning pretty much  
the entire duration of the recess the student who  reported this had to go inside but when he went  
inside it was still there a very impressive case  took place also in 1970 in maraenui New Zealand  
about four hundred students and two teachers saw  this one of the teachers first noticed something  
was strange when the normal hustle and bustle and  loud noises from the children playing completely  
stopped was utterly Sant he looked around all the  students were staring up at this object which was  
now approaching the school it was extremely  large covered about one third of the sky was  
black had a glistening almost metallic looking  surface and stopped directly over the school I  
was very silent it stayed there for about five ten  minutes maybe a little longer everyone just stared  
at an open mouthed one of the teachers one of the  students approached the teacher and asked is that  
a flying saucer and the teacher had to say yes  because he couldn't imagine what else it would  
was there was an airport nearby which later denied  seeing anything and anyway this object hovered for  
just a few moments minutes moved over to the side  change sate shape turned on its side and darted  
very quickly upwards it's an amazing case and  probably one of the most widely viewed schoolyard  
encounters another widely viewed encounter took  place in Foxcroft boarding school south carolina  
october 1970 about 50 female students we're out on  the front lawn and observed this disc approaching  
very slowly very leisurely very low treetop level  as soon as it got right overhead opening appeared  
in the bottom of the craft and a bright beam of  light came down and shined on the field all the  
students jumped up and like it's a UFO take us  with you they shouted as this object moved off  
just a few miles per hour and sort of led them  out towards the field for little ways and then  
darted off very quickly like a bullet and was gone  these encounters have a very strong effect on the  
students for years to come a good example is what  happened to Malcolm Robinson in 1970 he was with  
other fellow students at bang curry elementary  school when a white egg-shaped object appeared  
just a few hundred feet high maybe 600 feet and  was just hovering there in place they thought it  
might be a balloon but Malcolm was pretty sure it  wasn't it was absolutely beautiful when suddenly  
this thing just disappeared or darted away  and Malcolm Robinson later as an adult would  
become one of Scotland's leading UFO researchers  and writers so yeah if these ETS are trying to  
convince children that UFOs are real it's a pretty  effective strategy another case occurred in 1973  
at Normandy avenue elementary school when students  saw three grey disc-like objects hovering over  
the school which were chased away when a police  helicopter approached in 1973 at Our Lady of Mercy  
Elementary School in East Greenwich Rhode Island  Patrick Casey alerted all the other students to a  
metallic object that was hovering about a hundred  and fifty feet over the school all the children  
saw this they felt of weird effect they felt  like giddy and tired after seeing this object  
none of the teachers saw it they tried to alert  the teachers but the teachers did not believe  
them not the first time this happens in cases  like these 1973 a prominent researcher gin book  
from New York researched a case which took place  at Johnstown elementary school were seventy kids  
saw an object with metallic portholes with landing  legs come in for a near landing it looked like it  
was about to actually land when it disappeared  in a huge explosion of light in 1974 there was  
another case were at the cool ajita University  where all the girls in the girls dorm heard a loud  
explosion came running outside and saw this large  star like object which started emitting smaller  
orbs five of them in total which darted around for  a few minutes and then all the orbs started off  
in different directions and disappeared in March  1975 one year later about 60 children and teachers  
at Andrew Lu primary school at Fort Victoria  Zimbabwe saw this large metallic cylindrical  
object hovering a pretty low level over the school  only a few hundred feet up it stayed there for at  
least three hours before finally moving away  and none of them could figure out what this  
thing was in 1977 at a boy's boarding school in  Eastbourne England to UFOs approached the school  
all the students saw it from the windows before  his objects just came right up to the school and  
then darted away very quickly a very similar case  occurred in January of 1977 in Warminster England  
when a small group of students and their teacher  Michael grete saw a object which they described as  
sort of black in color and donut-shaped circling  around over the school for just a few minutes and  
then moving away the headmaster Michael greet his  description matches with the children's honesty  
he was glad the children were there because he had  trouble believing his own eyes a very famous case  
occurred on February 14 to 1977 at rosie ball  Elementary School in North Wales this was the  
case that did generate a lot of interest when a  small group of children and their teacher observed  
a silver cigar shaped object with a black dome  on top it hovered in place it moved quickly at  
times it was very low and stayed for about five  or ten minutes really impressing them and finally  
moved off so yes I mean there's so many cases  another occurred on May 2nd 1977 this is less  
than a month later in California Downey elementary  school a group of elementary aged kids were on  
the playground when a very beautiful silver sphere  with beautiful colored lights around its perimeter  
appeared at very low level the students were all  entranced I thought it was the most amazing thing  
and it stayed the entire duration of the recess  and disappeared when recess was over no teachers  
saw it but all the students were talking about  it for quite some time may 15th just what two  
weeks later in 1977 two students saw a silver  disc hovering over oak trees by a parking lot  
one forgot about it for years but the other later  remembered this was on the East Coast July 1977  
Don Worley reports on the case of three boys  at Maplewood elementary school in Connersville  
Indiana who described seeing triangular shaped  object came over right over one of the students he  
estimates it was about three hundred feet across  and a hundred feet high and was so large it scared  
scared him and he fell on his back as it moved  over her head on October 4th 1977 same year again  
ten children at Upton primary school in Wales saw  a UFO hovering over a grove of trees next to the  
school no teachers saw it so and all the students  reported this object one of the teachers had them  
separated and had them draw what they saw and many  of the drawings were almost identical showing this  
object hovering among the trees and sending  down this little ladder like device another  
case which was investigated by Wendell Stevens a  very well-known investigator occurred at Florence  
Elementary School in Florence Arizona when the  teacher was taking all the students into the  
school after recess one of them pointed into the  sky and said what's that and it was this silver  
disc hovering very low it was hovering in place  and then started darting around and doing weird  
maneuvers there was an airport nearby who Wendell  Stevens contacted they denied seeing anything  
and decided just darted around for a few minutes  totally totally silent and then moved off so this  
is what Tojo in 1978 another object hovers right  over st. Mark's primary school this is in England  
it was shaped like a fedora metallic hovered about  twenty feet over the ground March 1979 at the  
North Carolina School for the Deaf the UFO came  right over the school it was so low the teachers  
who first saw thought it was going to the school  and what's interesting about this case is this UFO  
was emitting a very loud kind of woo-woo-woo so it  sound and a vibration it was so loud that even the  
students who were profoundly deaf came running out  to see what was causing this vibration so everyone  
at the school saw it and you could say even heard  it so I think that's another obvious display  
October 1982 Adams middle school Grand Prairie  Texas the school holds a sock hop after the sock  
hop a bunch of UFOs show up their multicolored  they put on a fantastic display over the school  
blue lights red lights yellow lights orange lights  darting around for a good period of time the next  
day that one of the students actually worked  in the school office she was surprised to see  
the Air Force show up that had never happened  before and the principal made an announcement  
shortly later saying that what the students saw  was nothing but a light show one of the students  
who later became an intelligence officer did an  investigation and could find no evidence of anyone  
who could put on a light show of that magnitude  she's pretty darn convinced it was a UFO because  
while these objects were overhead everyone could  feel this really weird staticky feeling which you  
know made their clothes act strangely and their  hair stand up so yeah it's another great case  
another case involving weird memory problems  occurred in November 1989 during the wave of  
sightings over France and Belgium one lady was at  a boarding school in vendôme France and this huge  
triangular object came very low right over the  school everybody saw it it moved off and nobody  
talked about it including herself and in fact she  forgot about it apparently everybody forgot about  
it it wasn't until years later where her husband  brought up the subject of UFOs that she suddenly  
remembered seeing this thing so these cases go  right up to modern time may 6 2010 iron mountain  
saw an object hovering at treetop level over  the school it was so low the whole class saw  
this hovering over the Flay ground it was so  low that one of the students could see that  
this object appeared to be made out of steel rivet  steel plates which were riveted together another  
modern case took place on September 15th 2009  this is at Clayton High School in North Carolina  
a group of students were doing band practice when  a UFO appeared and started doing this display they  
all saw it it was very strange they could not  identify it what was really strange is a couple  
of days later one of the students reported seeing  a UFO hovering directly over her home October  
8th 2015 another UFO seen hovering over Rockville  High School case after case April 2nd 2018 a very  
bright object was seen over West Nessus cool this  occurred on tangora Island in Indonesia it was  
very bright one of the teachers all the students  were panicking one of the teachers saw this object  
she quickly grabbed her cellphone and attempted  to take a photo unfortunately the object was so  
bright that all she got was just a white screen  but the point is there are a lot of these objects  
they are appearing at very low levels they've  been appearing regularly for like 50 years and  
is amazing as all of these cases sound this is  really just the beginning these are just the  
sightings I haven't even gotten to the landings  and humanoids I've covered all these cases in  
detail in my book schoolyard UFO encounters and  we'll be covering the landings and humanoids in  
part two of this presentation but that's it for  now thanks for listening and keep having fun
