DUDLEY DELANEY'S ALIEN ENCOUNTER
May 6, 2022

Summary:
May 6, 2022
In the late 1940s, young teenager, Dudley Delany was listening to the popular radio host Frank Edwards talk about UFOs being seen in the skies across the world. Dudley was amazed and entranced. Extraterrestrials were visiting our world? The idea seemed fantastic, and yet there were so many reports. So began Dudley's lifelong fascination with the subject.

Dudley now believed in UFOs, but he certainly didn't think he was personally involved. He grew up and became very interested in medicine. He went to school and became first a registered nurse, then a licensed chiropractor, and also a licensed massage therapist. So began Dr. Delany's lifelong mission to help and heal humanity.

Then one morning, he woke to a puzzling mystery. There was a strange lump on his cheek. It hadn't been there the day before. How had it appeared so quickly, seemingly overnight? The strange mystery concerned him, and one day he decided to take action. Thinking it was perhaps a boil, he sterilized a needle and started to pierce and drain the boil. To his shock, out popped a tiny crystal-like object! Dudley was confused. How could a crystal be lodged inside his body? It made no sense. But with no explanation, he forgot about it.

Years passed. Then in 1991, Dudley (now in his fifties) started to feel unwell. He went to the doctor and received a devastating diagnosis: he was suffering from multiple sclerosis. Always interested in alternative healing, Dudley began researching ways to heal himself and came upon the work of the world-famous psychic, Edgar Cayce, who was known for diagnosing and healing people of a wide variety of illnesses. 

Dudley found information about how to heal his own condition, and it worked! His MS went into full remission. Delighted, Dudley wrote a book about his healing experience and became a strong proponent of alternative healing.

Then, one evening in 1998, not long after he had retired, Dudley had his first unambiguously UFO-related encounter. He woke up to see a beam of light coming through the roof and ceiling of his home, striking his body where he lay in bed. What, he wondered, was that? A beam of light from a UFO?

A few years later, in early 2001, Dudley had another strange experience. He woke one evening to sense a presence in his room. He felt and heard something or someone sit on the bed next to him. Then he felt a strange hand grasping his own. Alarmed, he quickly opened his eyes and turned around. But the room was empty. Again he wondered, what was that? A ghost? An alien? He wasn't sure.

But he began to research the subject, and asking other members of his family, he was shocked when his niece revealed that she herself had been taken onboard a UFO at age ten, where she met both grays and human-looking ETs. This provided Dudley with some confirmation of his own experiences. 

In July of 2001, Dudley traveled to Virginia Beach to attend a conference at the Edgar Cayce Foundation. He had a wonderful time meeting with like-minded people and talking about alternative healing and UFOs. Then, one evening he went to bed and had the single most profound UFO encounter of his entire life. At the time he had been experiencing prostate problems which were causing him pain and difficulties with urination. That evening, he woke up to find that he was no longer in his room. Instead, he was apparently onboard an ET craft, lying upon a table.

Unable to move or speak, he watched as a short humanoid approached and began to conduct a procedure, telling Dudley that he had a tumor, and that he was there to be healed. Dudley felt no fear, and was in fact, amazed and delighted to receive a healing at the hands of ETs. Following the procedure, his prostate problems disappeared.

Dudley now examined his past in a new light. Suddenly all those weird events began to make sense. The weird crystal in his cheek. Could that have been an alien implant? The beam of light that came through the ceiling, the strange nighttime visitor in his bedroom -- perhaps he had been having more contact than he realized. Then he remembered a weird event which occurred when he was a young teenager, something so strange and personal that he had never told anyone, or even though about. But now, with the benefit of hindsight, it suddenly made sense. And he wondered if it was possible that his contact with ETs had started much earlier than he had ever imagined. And perhaps he had hybrid alien-human children!

This video presents the story of Dr. Dudley Delany's lifelong alien encounters, and provides some interesting insights into the UFO contact experience.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode dudley delaney's alien encounter this is the true story of one man's 
lifelong encounters with extraterrestrials in many ways it's a fairly straightforward case but in 
other ways it's got some very unusual elements and I think it definitely has something to contribute 
to our understanding of the ufo phenomenon and that's why I wanted to present it to you today 
dudley's story begins in flushing new york in the late 1940s 
as a young teenager he started listening to frank edwards radio broadcast frank edwards 
was one of the first radio broadcasters to talk openly about the ufo phenomenon 
and dudley became a huge fan was very interested to hear that ufos and aliens were visiting our 
planet the subject absolutely fascinated him and from that point on he paid close attention 
to the ufo phenomenon but he certainly didn't think that he himself was involved 
so he grew up believing in ufos and as an adult became very interested in medicine and healing 
and he went to school and became a registered nurse following that he continued his education 
became a licensed chiropractor and then a licensed massage therapist and became very interested in 
alternative healing and spirituality but again he had never seen a ufo did not think he was involved 
in this phenomena in any way and his first real clue came around his late 30s or so early 40s 
when he woke up one morning to a mystery there was these two strange lumps on his face 
one was on his cheek on his left cheek and the other was this little lump above his left eyebrow 
and he was very curious about them how quickly they had appeared but he didn't think much of them 
however this lump on his cheek did begin to bother him so one day he decided to take action 
as he says the lump on my cheek kept bothering me and at times it actually hurt 
so one day I sterilized a needle for the purpose of dissecting and draining it 
when I opened it up with the needle and squeezed it to my surprise a tiny crystal came out 
so this shocked delaney it was clearly unexplained he had no idea how this sort of object could have 
gotten into his cheek as a doctor he knew it shouldn't be there it was this weird little 
crystal he had no reason to connect this to ufos or aliens and unable to explain it he threw this 
thing away in hindsight he regrets it but at that time he didn't know so he just tossed it 
and moved on with his life he still had this other lump on his eyebrow which never went away actually 
then in 1991 in his 50s dudley received very devastating news he had been having some health 
problems went to the doctor and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and the doctors told him there 
was very limited treatment for this disease so he decided to seek alternative healing methods and 
this led him to the works of edgar cayce a very famous psychic from virginia who is well known for 
giving psychic readings and curing people of a wide variety of conditions illnesses and diseases 
so he really dug deep into the works of edgar cayce and tried various methods of alternative 
healing to treat his multiple sclerosis and to his amazement he was successful he not only halted the 
progress of his disease he cured it his symptoms went away and he was no longer suffering from 
multiple sclerosis this very much inspired him to pursue alternative healing and help 
others and he ended up writing a book in 1999 he wrote a book about healing multiple sclerosis 
inspired by the teachings of edgar cayce this book is now a collector's item on amazon.com 
and following this of course he became a strong advocate for alternative treatment not only for 
multiple sclerosis but a wide variety of diseases he became very active in the 
alternative healing community was a very loving giving generous man who helped an enormous 
number of people he has a lot of testimonials uh praising his work in this area 
but it was in 1998 one evening when he had his first unambiguously ufo related experience 
he was in his bedroom and woke up to a very unusual event and I'll just let dudley describe it 
in his own words as he says I awoke to find myself bathed in a shaft of blue light that came down 
through the ceiling of my bedroom instead of converging towards the floor the rays 
appeared to be parallel which suggested that they either came down from a great height 
or perhaps they were some type of laser beams dudley sat up in amazement and although the 
strange beam of light was shining directly on him he felt nothing and after less than a minute 
this beam of light abruptly blinked off and the room was plunged back into darkness dudley was 
completely mystified as he says to this day I do not know the meaning of that experience 
but he certainly did wonder if this might be related to ufos because it was a very bright 
beam of light and it came through the ceiling but he really didn't know what to think of it 
around that time he retired so he's able to start devoting more time to studying spirituality 
the subject of ufos and in particular the works of edgar cayce and in 2001 
he learned that there was going to be a conference held at the edgar cayce foundation in virginia 
beach virginia and he decided he was going to attend and it was just two or weeks before this 
conference that he had another very strange experience and again this occurred in his 
bedroom and I will just let dudley describe in his own words what happened as he says and I quote 
i was lying on my right side as I gradually stirred from slumber I felt strongly that 
someone else's was in the room behind me watching me observing me their eyes piercing me however I 
didn't move a muscle partly out of fear and partly out of curiosity as to what would happen next 
then a place on the bed behind me gradually sank down accompanied by a creek in the mattress as 
if someone were now sitting behind me I still didn't move wondering what this was all about 
then I felt what seemed to be fingers trying not to grasp but to inter-penetrate the fingers of one 
of my hands then I balked saying to myself no I didn't want that I quickly snatched my hand 
away and summoning my courage slowly turned over to confront my uninvited guest to my surprise 
no one was there I searched my apartment but still found no one so after waking up 
and finding no one there he wondered what just happened could this have been a ghost he didn't 
think so it felt physical he could feel the hand he heard the bed creek felt it being pressed down 
so he wondered perhaps this was et related because he had seen that beam of light and he wondered hmm 
what is going on here and so he started doing more research into ufos 
and started to see commonalities uh he decided he would ask various family members to see if any of 
them had had encounters and boy did he get a shock when he spoke to his niece who told him that yes 
not only had she had encounters she believed that she was abducted by ets when she was just 
a little girl and I'll let dudley describe what he learned from his niece as he says 
my niece claims she was abducted at the age of 10 and had a tissue sample removed from her thigh 
you can see an indentation where some tissue is missing 
she said her abductors wore blue uniforms with a little insignia on their chests and that some 
possessed the stereotypical small body with big eyes but that others looked quite human 
so much so that they were indistinguishable indistinguishable from normal human beings 
so this very much impressed dudley by this point he knew that if a person has ufo 
encounters it's much more likely that someone in their family will be having ufo encounters 
so this provided him certainly with a level of corroboration and he became even more 
interested in the subject was still very excited about attending this conference 
in virginia beach and so he decided that he would go down there and in june of 2010
he drove down to virginia beach virginia to the edgar cayce foundation to attend a conference 
which he very much enjoyed there were a lot of very open-minded people there he was able to talk 
freely about his interest in not only edgar cayce and spirituality but ufos and his own experiences 
and it was here that he had his first really major experience what turned out to be 
an on-board ufo encounter at the time dudley was suffering from prostate problems difficulty with 
urination and he was going to get it all checked out and this is when he had this experience 
he woke up not in his bedroom but finding himself in a different place 
in a strange room was poorly lit uh he was lying on what seemed to be a steel table 
or a hard table and he was unable to move unable to cry or talk talk and he was able to see 
and observe and again I will just let dudley describe in his own words what he experienced 
as he says I gradually attained the level of consciousness that I was permitted 
and I found myself looking at a small flickering light the only source of illumination in the 
room that was about a foot away from my face and attached to the edge of a table upon which I was 
lying I was in the same semi-prone position in which an osteopath had placed me many years ago 
when adjusting my tailbone it's called the sims position slowly I became aware of what seemed to 
be a slender probe that had been pushed up inside me and was gently vibrating against my prostate 
i wondered what in the world was going on and then it dawned upon me that I was 
receiving at the hands of aliens some kind of radiation therapy presumably for prostate cancer 
i do have prostate problems but I didn't know that cancer was one of them 
the session lasted about five or ten minutes when it was over I was of course tremendously grateful 
for this gift of grace and repeatedly thanked the doctor who administered it to me because it was 
so dark I could only barely see what he looked like he was clothed in white he was humanoid 
but quite homely almost misshapen in appearance he may have been hybrid part alien and part human 
i heard him quite distinctly convey the message it was a small tumor I asked him his name 
but perceived immediately that he was reluctant to give it nevertheless he seemed to convey the word 
june I thought that can't be right june is a woman's name then I drifted off into 
unconsciousness so when dudley awoke he was very much impressed he remembered this whole experience 
in perfect clarity I mean he was awake during this experience so this was a fully conscious 
onboard ufo encounter in which he did receive what appears to be an anal probe 
and he believes he was healed because following this his prostate symptoms 
completely disappeared and as he says I felt different I felt indeed as if something had been 
done to me so he does believe he was healed of his prostate condition by what appears to be a gray 
alien or something along those lines perhaps a hybrid he's really not sure because he didn't 
get a good look at whoever it was but it was a very positive experience for him he did not felt 
feel any fear and actually feels quite grateful to them and this was when he really began to 
scour his past and looking for clues that he was in fact a contactee and he really connected 
the dots and started to see that yes he had been having contact his whole life there was of course 
the weird crystal-like thing he had pulled out of his cheek and the lump above his left eyebrow 
he remembered the bedroom visitation in which something had grasped his hand or the other 
incident in which a beam of light came down and struck him this beam of light that came through 
the ceiling itself his nieces encounter and uh all these weird events his strong interest in ufos 
but then one event came to the forefront of his mind for the first time in decades he had never 
thought about it this was a very weird event that occurred when he was just a little boy a very 
young teenager it was a very unexplained event it was somewhat embarrassing very personal he never 
told a living soul about it because not only was it personal and embarrassing he couldn't explain 
it but now looking back in hindsight he wonders if this was in fact related to ufos or even an actual 
ufo inc encounter and what happened was he woke up in the middle of the night to have a powerful 
orgasm however when he started searching for any evidence of this he couldn't find it he didn't 
have to change his sheets or his clothes and this really really puzzled him and as he says 
i couldn't find any semen anywhere except in my urethra so this had always puzzled him he didn't 
know how to explain it but now looking back in hindsight he wonders if perhaps ets had come to 
visit him and collected a genetic sample from him perhaps with the agenda of creating a hybrid baby 
which is something he'd certainly read about in other people's cases and as he says and I quote 
in retrospect I wondered whatever happened to that sample of semen which presumably was collected by 
aliens and used to produce offspring that are now living in some distant part of the universe 
i wonder what my hybrid children look like how they are getting along perhaps someday 
somewhere somehow I will be allowed to meet and share a little bit of a father's love 
with them so that turned out to be the extent of dr dudley delaney's alien encounters for the most 
part at least however a couple of years later in 2003 dudley did have a very powerful lucid dream 
which he believes may be a direct message from the et's and I will just let dudley 
describe this dream which impressed him so deeply as dudley says I awoke in a dream to find myself 
standing beside the runway of an airfield a large transport plane was noisily lumbering 
down the runway in preparation for takeoff just as the plane lifted off the runway it was enveloped 
in a bright white light and then it suddenly vanished without sight or sound into thin air 
at that point I resumed the unconsciousness of sleep to me the experience was clearly 
a demonstration by an alien intelligence of its power over this material universe 
and it makes me wonder what the limits of that power is and whether it could be used not only to 
heal men's bodies but also men's hearts and minds or that it might be exercised in a manner that 
will bring peace on earth and good will towards men so that was actually dudley's last encounter 
and uh it's quite an interesting story he has no fear uh ever of this his experiences have 
been entirely benevolent he does not feel the ets are here to hurt or harm people in any way 
and in fact he himself feels very protected due to his strong spirituality and in particular 
his very strong christian faith and to wrap this up I will just give you one more quote from dudley 
how he feels about his own encounters and this phenomenon in general as dudley says 
i find the whole subject of alien abductions to be a fascinating one for there can be absolutely 
no question but they not only occur but as far as I am concerned have occurred to me 
i know that some people report having had terrible experiences at the hands of aliens personally 
i am not too concerned about that type of experience happening to me as a born again 
christian it is my belief that no harm or evil can befall me except that which my lord 
and his infinite love and mercy allows therefore I expect not only good things from aliens 
because they will definitely have to answer to the king of kings and lord of lords not to mention the 
universal law of karma for their treatment of me I know it and just as importantly so do they 
so that is the story of dr dudley delaney I presented his story in my book wondrous 25 true 
ufo encounters and as I mentioned in the beginning of this episode it's a fairly straight 
forward series of events but I do find some interesting elements to it 
it confirms much of what we already know about the et agenda in terms of perhaps collecting genetic 
material from people it confirms that these sort of encounters do run in families the presence of 
alien implants is not unusual bedroom visitations one thing I find very interesting about 
dudley's case is that he was taken on board and healed I find this very interesting because a 
lot of the people I've talked to have had ufo experiences in general or in particular healings 
are often doctors or nurses or social workers environmentalists people who fight against racism 
uh musicians artists people who are doing good work for humanity in some capacity and that's 
certainly true of dr delaney has spent his entire life in service of others so I think that speaks 
towards the e.t agenda why they're here they are helping those who help others and that is 
certainly what dudley believes happened in his case so yeah it's got some interesting things I 
think to say about the ufo phenomenon and that is why I wanted to present you his case today 
uh sadly in april of 2020 dudley delaney did pass away of natural causes he was in his late 80s 
but yeah his story is not only very interesting I think it does have something to say 
about this ufo phenomenon and that is why I again wanted to present it to you today 
and I want to thank you very much for watching I hope you've enjoyed this episode and until next 
time keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
you
