UFO ENTITIES: TEN TRUE EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS
Dec 20, 2024

Summary:
Dec 20, 2024
Many questions remain regarding the nature and origin of UFO entities, which is why continuing research and documentation is so important. In this video I present ten little-known cases from across the world, from the 1940s to the 2010s. Many different types of humanoids are represented, gray ETs, short little beings, human-looking ETs, very tall figures and more. Many involve multiple witnesses and various forms of evidence. These ten cases provide a tantalizing glimpse into the very heart of the UFO phenomenon: face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.

UFO LANDING DURING WWII. One summer day in 1942, thirteen-year-old Madeleine Arnoux was bicycling near Verger, France. Stopping to pick some berries, she was shocked to see a saucer-shaped craft and several dark-suited humanoids. Frozen in fear, she bent down to get her bike. There was a blast of wind and the craft was gone. But the memory remained for the rest of her life.

“THEY WERE DIFFERENT FROM US.” On the night of October 25, 1954, two 12-year-old boys were minding sheep in the fields near Appignano, Italy when they came upon three tiny beings wearing shiny suits, standing next to a strange craft. The beings promptly fled into the craft which took off. The boys' encounter earned national news, especially when another witness was found.

“THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS.” On the night of August 10, 1962, “J” awoke to find his bedroom filled with light. Looking into the backyard of his home in Vienna, Virginia, he saw a small flying saucer, and next to it were three skinny figures with large bald heads, huge dark eyes, and gray skin. They were holding hands, and J had the strong impression they were his friends.

THE ALIENS IN THE CORNFIELD. At 9:30 pm on July 19, 1967 Maria de Figueiredo picked corn from her father’s field in Sao Benedito do Sul, Brazil. Hearing a weird sound, she turned around and saw a three-foot-tall being staring at her. Behind him was a small craft with another being inside it. The being held up an ear of corn and gestured at her. As the being returned to the craft, Maria became terrified and promptly fainted.

“THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE!” One evening in June of 1973, Louise Gaudet woke up in her home in Alma, Quebec, Canada hearing an engine noise and watching a green mist come into her room. Through the mist, she saw a small humanoid form wearing a silver suit and a helmet. It appeared twice, and in the days that followed, Louise began to have very unusual alien dreams.

“I FELT TRANSFIXED WITH FEAR.” As Phil Shepherdson drove his scooter to work one morning in February 1979 in Easingwold, UK, he was amazed to see a small craft landed alongside the road. Stopping to look at it, he saw two very thin humanoid figures standing next to it, and one inside it. All three stopped and looked at him. Suddenly he felt a strong telepathic connection with the beings. Phil was overcome with fear, and fled. Arriving at work, he discovered he was late, and may have had missing time.

ET SURVEILLANCE. On September 25, 1983, a young couple was camping out near Playa de Salgueiros, Portugal, when they were woken up by a strange noise. Looking outside, they saw three craft and four humanoid figures. The humanoids began to walk around, surveying the field. For the next few hours, the craft remained flying back and forth as if looking for something, before finally leaving.

A HUMANOID BEHIND EACH WINDOW. On December 31, 1997, eight children decided to camp behind their homes in rural Kenwick, Western Australia. As one of them noticed strange streaks of red light in the distant sky, he called it to the attention of his friends. Suddenly a large craft zoomed towards them. And through the windows, they saw humanoids looking down at them.

THE PURPLE LIGHT BEING. On the night of December 21, 2004, a man and his nephew noticed a glowing object outside their home in Chillicothe, Ohio. Going to investigate, they were amazed when humanoid forms emerged from it, and one flew down and approached them. It was a glowing purple light being. The witness reached out and shook its hand. It then floated back and departed. Unknown to him, numerous people in the area were having encounters.

THE GIANT ALIEN. On the night of August 21, 2014, three friends decided to meditate in a field near their homes in Talavera de la Reina, Spain. Suddenly a glowing object appeared over their heads. Moments later, they were confronted by a giant figure at least 12 feet tall. When it started to chase them, all three men fled in fear. The next day, one of them found strange landing traces.

These ten cases show how truly strange and bizarre contact with UFO entities can be. So many different kinds of craft. So many varieties of humanoids. One thing that remains very consistent is that the experience always affects the witnesses profoundly, proving to them firsthand that we are not alone in this infinite universe.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal I'm
calling today's episode the UFO entities 10 true extraterrestrial encounters I
think it's important to remember that there are entities humanoids people inside of these craft that we are being
visited and it's important to note that you can easily dismiss one case even 10
or 20 or 100 but there there are thousands upon thousands of these cases
Skeptics really don't have a leg to stand on anymore there's far too much evidence far too many cases to deny the
fact that we are being visited it's why I like doing this research I think there's a lot we can learn from these
cases and it is the humanoid cases that really lie at the very heart of the UFO
phenomenon I've chosen 10 cases coming from all over the world including
Australia Brazil Canada England France Italy Portugal
Spain and two from the United States including Ohio and Virginia and I've got
cases reaching pretty far back in time to the 1940s all the way up to the 2010s
so there are some of you out there who've asked me to cover some more recent cases and you will find a few of them here I like doing these
chronologies because they prove a couple of important points one that this is has been going on for a very long time
another that this is occurring all over the world and another is that these reports are remarkably consistent
regardless of when they occurred or where a wide variety of humanoids here
we've got short little humanoids we've got very tall ones human looking Grays
light beings I mean you name it all different types of
entities and of course all kinds of evidence so again each of these cases do
have remarkable commonalities but many of them have some unique details too and
all of them provide profound insights into what's going on here so let's just get started in the first case I call UFO
landing dur during World War II I think this is an important case not only
because it occurred quite early in the summer of 1944 in ver France but also it
occurred at a time when this country was being torn apart by war that alone is
quite unusual it is a single witness case but it was professionally researched by experienced investigators
so I think it's got something to offer to our understanding of what's going on here this case first appeared in the
June 1972 issue of the French publication lumier Donan it was written
by the witness herself a lady by the name of Mademoiselle meline aru at the
time of her encounter she was 13 years old and at this time every week she
would travel by bicycle to a farm near ver not far from her home in
Tulu to get food this was during war time again and it was on this hot
overcast summer Day in 1942 that she was bicycling from her home to this farm
along Road 42 and nearing her destination she stopped got off her bike
to walk down a small dirt road into the woods where she knew of some berry bushes that she could pick from so as
she's heading down this path this little dirt road she looked up and about 300 ft
in front of her right before a curve in the road sitting in the middle of the road was a small dull metallic gray Dome
shaped object she said it was quite small about the size of a small car
smooth featureless no markings no Port holes no doors but standing next to it
were three or more small humanoid figures and as meline says the beings
who stood nearby must have been less than 1 M high and were dressed in some
sort of brown colored jumpsuits they made no gestures in my direction and for
my part I was frozen in place suddenly I was able to react and wanted to take
back my bike which was lying a few meters away the time it took me to bend down and when I raised my head to look
again at the strange Apparition there was nothing left only at this point the
trees were shaken by a strong wind I did not think to look up where I probably still would have been able to see the
flying machine so yeah she thinks the strong wind was coming from this craft taking
off and again World War II was still taking place France was invaded at this
this time she was familiar with tanks and planes and all of this but as she is certain that the strange figures and the
vehicles she saw had nothing to do with any of this and in fact the whole experience left a profound impression on
her as she says I was terrified and I hurried back to the farm where of course
I did not talk about anything I did not talk about it anymore at home when I got back because I suspected that I would be
called a liar and a fabulist I thought about the strange encounter for a long
time and then I forgot about it it was not until people started talking about flying saucers that I made the
connection and thought that i' had probably seen one of those mysterious UFOs there after so many years the image
is still very clear in my memory and I know very well that I did not dream it and that what I saw in the woods that
day was nothing known there were many resistance fighters in the region but it
couldn't have been any of them no more than German sh soldiers and no doubt one
or the other would have called out to me so I must assume that what I witnessed was one of the first UFO visits there
and I can assure you that for a young 13-year-old girl these facts were quite
exceptional quite surprising quite fantastic so that I still remember it
very well now it's also important to note that meline says only a few years
earlier she and many other people in the area did view a motionless object
gleaming in the night sky and this went on for several nights in a row there was all kinds of speculation about what it
might be balloons or Zeppelins but that failed to account for the strange appearance of this object and
disappearance cuz one day it just stopped appearing really interesting is
that this was seen directly above where meline had seen this landed
object yes that is a single witness case and yes the witness was a teenager but I
think old enough to recognize the difference between a tank or a plane or
any other normal vehicle cuz some Skeptics have brought up well you know she's just a little girl maybe she
didn't realize what she was seeing but as you can tell from her testimony she was very deeply impressed by what she
saw and still talks about it decades later it's an important case I think
and now let's move to another one and of all the cases in this compilation I have to tell you this one is probably the
most famous it did get a lot of publicity at the time it occurred it's still being talked about today I call
this one they were different from us this is a direct quote from one of the witnesses it's a multiple witness case
two well actually three Witnesses if you want to be technical about it this one
occurred on October 25 1954 in aano
Italy this is during the middle of an intense wave mostly in France but
certainly in the surrounding areas as well and I like this case because the humanoid is one type that I don't think
I've ever heard before in terms of its description it was a cold day October 25
1954 in the area where this encounter occurred aano Italy as two 12-year-old
boys martiano Gian pieri and his friend Pacifico tantui were grazing their
family's sheep after school so they after doing this returned
home to get something to eat it was around 5:00 p.m. that they went back to mind the sheep and coming up to the
flock they noticed that the Sheep had moved some distance away from their original location so they began to round
the Sheep up and then they lit a fire to warm themselves and this is when their dog pho began to bark insistently and
seemed to be looking at one certain spot so they went to investigate and they got
a tremendous shock they could hardly believe what they were seeing as martiano says we decided to head to that
spot and once we were there we were breathless we stumbled across three
small beings about 35 cm tall together close to a kind of barrel the three
beings wore a silver suit that enveloped them completely they were different from us they had a very large head compared
to the rest of the body and besides that instead of round it was very
flat so martiano got a much better look than his friend as he was closer he said
that the suits that they wore were dark and shiny and looked almost plastic in texture and this barrel-like object he's
describing was apparently a craft only about 7 70 CM wide and 1.5 M long or 2
and a/4 ft wide 4 and 1/2 ft long it had what looked like short little antenna or
projections of some kind coming out of one end and again these figures were
less than 2 feet tall very tiny three of them and almost immediately these three
little figures apparently frightened by the sudden appearance of the two boys fled back into their cylindrical shaped
craft the craft then made a hissing noise it Rose upwards about 20 M or 60
ft the little antenna on the back began to vibrate and then it let out this
large Fireball and the craft darted away at Fantastic speed the boys said to the
East and this Fireball that it it emitted came down and exploded just before reaching the ground made a loud
banging sound it emitted a strong gust of wind which struck both the boys now
not too far away was an older woman Maria rieri and she was working in the
fields and she saw this craft also she saw it go up and depart she described it
as an object surrounded by many lights flying upwards and then disappearing so marcizio and Pacifico
ran straight home and told their parents who absolutely believed them because they could see how emotional the boys
were and they reported it to the police and soon their case attracted all kinds
of attention it actually became national news as Macio says the carabinieri
that's the police the carabinieri came and questioned us for several days to
understand what had really happened while the national press provided a lot of coverage of the story of course our
tender age and the nature of told facts have kept our story not officially
believed they threatened us to run lie detector tests I was targeted by everyone one journalists
carabinieri and even then the parish priest Don Quinto who made me swear on
the gospel that what I was saying was really true not only that is if Pacifico
and I were criminals we were interrogated separately by the carabinieri despite the pressure and
fear we always confirm our story and what we had seen so yeah following this
encounter the boys were visited by many researchers and even 60 years later Mauricio found
himself being interviewed about his amazing childhood encounter with a landed UFO and humanoids an undeniably
very unusual and interesting case and again multiple Witnesses it's amazing to
me how profoundly these experiences affect people cuz here we are some 60
years later and this witness is still talking about this case and how deeply
it affected him he's sticking to his guns as do most Witnesses so yeah
another amazing example of a UFO landing and humanoids getting out this is happening all over the world because
here's another case which occurred in the United States I like this case it's quite
profound uh yes the witness is a young child and it's primarily a single
witness case though apparently it does have Landing traces and possibly another
witness it's not completely uh verified but the case was
professionally investigated by a very respected researcher I call this one
they were holding hands it occurred on August 10 1962 in a rural area of Vienna
Virginia I think you'll find this case quite interesting this amazing case was
investigated by muon field investigator Norm gagnan and was written up in the
August 2015 issue of the muan UFO journal the
main witness is known only as Jay he's anonymous at the time of his encounter
he was either seven or eight years old his family had just moved into a new house in the fairly small town of Vienna
Virginia I mean they had just moved in Jay hadn't even explored the backyard yet he and his two brothers were sharing
a bedroom he had his own bed while his brothers slept in a bunk bed but Jay's bed was right next to a window
which overlooked the backyard and when it was August 10 1962
or so everyone in this house was asleep when as Jay says quote something made me
wake up so he opened his eyes and saw that his room was filled with bright
light the whole room was illuminated and Jay felt strangely compelled to look out the window as he says for whatever
reason I wanted had to look out the window to this day I wonder why I looked
out the window but it's good that he did because he saw something so extraordinary so unusual that it would
remain etched into his memory for the rest of his life as Jay says the whole
area was a very bright white was like in the middle of the day brightness there
were three what looked to be people in my back yard these entities reminded me
of a family there were two tall ones I'm guessing maybe 4T tall and a smaller one
the smaller one was in the middle and I'm pretty sure that the two tall ones were holding hands with the smaller one
I know they were looking at me I don't recall seeing their noses necks any hair
or even mouths it is like their heads just blended into the body they were grayish white no clothes and nothing to
reveal if they were male or female just all grayish whiteness except for their
eyes which were very dark and almond shaped now again this was the first time
Jay had even seen the backyard it was as he says all lit up like daylight now
looking towards his neighbor's house he did see this 15t tall antenna tower he
would later learn that his neighbor was an amateur radio operator and the beings were standing just to the left of the
antenna tower and right next to this Tower was a quote saucer shape which Jade describes as
gray and so bright that it was hard to look at this could be an important detail that it's Landing next to a radio
antenna tower because we do see this sort of interest in technology so
perhaps that's why they were there but as Jay says regarding this craft it appeared to be a grayish silver circular
object with a dome on top like a classic Flying Saucer that is portrayed in films
but it didn't have any doors or Windows he said this object was quite small that was his impression maybe 4 feet in
diameter he guesses and it seemed to be hovering a few feet above the ground but
he really only glanced at it and was far more interested in these three little figures and as Jay says as weird as it
sounds I felt like something was telling me it was okay and not to be scared and
I wasn't scared and looking back it was very peaceful they just continued to
stare at me I felt very safe and like they were friends it was a feeling and
knowledge from within that I have a hard time explaining it was hard not to continue looking at the three of them I
felt very at ease and safe so Jay did notice that the whole backyard was
illuminated by a very bright light source apparently coming from above as
he says there was a very bright white light or something lighting everything up a light shining down from above it
seemed I don't really know where all the bright light was coming from so it could
have been that there was another object above but he didn't see it and for
reasons that elude Jay he dropped back down into bed and immediately fell right
back to sleep while he did this instead of continuing to watch the little gray man continues to puzzle him to this day
he's not even sure he actually recalls going back to bed he was just suddenly asleep and morning arrived and it was a
short time after this incident that he went out into the backyard and he of course recognized all the features of it
from having seen it all lit up on that previous night and as Jay says the most
amazing thing about it is there was an indentation in the ground round in shape
where I saw this grayish saucer thing so he kept secret about the entire
event but later did tell his family and a few close friends and when he did one
of Jay's Brothers said that he remembered that night this surprised Jay because he did not remember his brother
being awake but he does admit that he could have been because he didn't actually check so it's possible at the
time of this encounter Jay had never heard of gray aliens and it wasn't until decade decades later when he saw the
image of GRA appearing in popular media that he was surprised to see that they matched quote exactly what I saw and as
he says I find this incident really weird and strange as years go by I know
what I saw it's amazing and baffling at the same time so it really impressed him
deeply and as he says I call them friends I remember being at peace and
feeling like they were friends that's the only way can describe it it was a strong feeling and still is such a cool
case I think it is quite possible there's more to it than the witness remembers given that he doesn't fully
remember getting back into bed but I love this case because it shows a really human aspect to these ETS with what
looks like a mom and dad gray holding the hands of their little child and it's
also interesting to me because the witness felt very strongly bonded to these ET as if they were his friends
this is something I do hear quite a lot when I interview people so it doesn't surprise me but I think it's an
important detail so a real interesting case and here is another one that I find quite
compelling I call this one the aliens in the cornfield this one is another single
witness case but certainly very interesting in its details this one
occurred on July 19 1967 in Sao Benedito D this is in Brazil and
boy this lady got a very very close up look at this UFO and two entities who
have a very interesting appearance a very interesting description she gives of them this very profound case comes
from researcher Enoch Bergos and was published in the sbde bulletin this is a very popular
brazili UFO publication and it was around 9:30 p.m. again on July 19
1967 as 18-year-old Maria de figu redo
and her two young brothers age 8 and 10 were collecting ears of corn in their
father's cornfield in Sao Benedito doou again this is imperor nuko Brazil their
dog was also with them and they were using Extra Care as they explored this field to avoid encountering any
poisonous snakes which were known to be in the area so Maria's two younger brothers moved off and she found herself
alone and this was when she was suddenly overwhelmed by a strong gust of wind
which was strong enough to rustle the cornstalks all around her and at the same time she heard a soft cracking
sound behind her so she Whirled around and was amazed to see a little 3-ft tall
humanoid standing very close less than 10 ft away from her she said this figure
looked entirely human it had an oval-shaped head thin hair styled in a
bowl cut and a neatly trimmed mustache he was wearing dark trousers a belt a
shirt with with a kind of vest he wore what looked to her like a necklace around his neck with a strange Medallion
that had strange indecipherable symbols on it now directly behind this 3-ft tall
humanoid was a small strange craft 6 ft long about 3 ft High had a dark metallic
base with what looked like a cross or almost a propeller looking thing on the front of it and on top of it was a large
rounded transparent glass-like Dome this craft was hovering at an angle
just above the ground about 3 ft up and inside this transparent Dome Maria could
see another small humanoid pretty much identical to the ver first
but he was only visible from the shoulders upwards now at this point Maria wanted
to shout out for her brothers and flee the area but found that she was immobilized and she watched with
astonishment as this little man walked to the front of the cornfield picked up
an ear of corn and began to closely examine it he then looked directly at
Maria and gestured to her now this being did not say anything but
Maria did have the impression that the humanoid was asking her if the corn was edible it then looked to her like the
humanite was saying something to His companion who was still inside the craft
so for the next few moments this little guy continued to explore the cornfield then at one point nodded to the other
humanoid in the craft the humanoid inside the craft waved To His companion in the field at which point the little
man in the field promptly returned into the craft it was at this point that the
family dog began to bark and jump up towards this hovering object which quickly Rose straight up actually
hitting the top branches of some nearby trees and as Maria says that's when I
got really scared and I fainted the next thing Maria knows she's waking up to see
her two brothers leaning over her calling her name she looked Brown there
was no trace of the two humanoids or their little craft but following this encounter she was interviewed at length
by a lot of people doctors authorities and University professors and she
reported her experience to them in great detail and with obvious
sincerity I like that case because here we have a witness who's really never heard of UFOs before and yet describes
what she saw in such great detail detail with such obvious sincerity that it's
really hard not to take her report seriously it's also very interesting because the entities she reported look
pretty much human except they're quite small but to have this 4ot tall 3ot tall
little guy with a mustache I mean it's just interesting to me the variation
that we have of all these humanoids they're all basically human I think with just different
ancestries that is what the evidence is really beginning to show us I think that's becoming increasingly clear and
here is another case very unusual I call this one there is someone in the house
this is a quote from one of the witnesses it involves a married couple who had a very close encounter with an
entity in their bedroom this is important because this is one of the most common places people actually do
see humanoids in extraterrestrials you wouldn't think so but yeah bedroom
encounters are really quite common this one occurred in June of
1973 in Alma Quebec Canada 1973 was a
big year for humanoids but this case also has some really interesting and unique details to it this next case
comes from Canadian researcher Christian L and was published in the UFO magazine
UFO Quebec was around 3:20 a.m. early one morning in June of
1973 when Louise goday woke up in the bedroom of her home in Alma Quebec
because she heard this strange soft sound similar she said to the purring of an engine of some kind so she sat up in
bed and was shocked to see this weird greenish Mist enter through the window
of her bedroom and settle down near the doorway so she's peering at it looking
more closely and this is when she could discern a strange humanoid form she saw
it quite distinctly it was 4 feet tall it appeared to be wearing a diving suit
silver covering its entire body complete with helmet and a dark face plate she
could not see any facial features but this figure yeah was about 4T tall and
was floating just above the floor so Louise immediately shoved her husband
George waking him up and shouted out George there is someone in the house so
George looked and he immediately noticed the strange bluish light but he did not
see any figure he got up searched the house for any sign of an intruder but
found nothing he returned to the bedroom and told Louise that she must be
dreaming he told her you're sleeping thinking that perhaps she was in the middle of an attack of sleepwalking or
something like this which was something she had never experienced before so he's shouting at her wake up and she looked
at him and said I am not sleeping there's someone in the house and he's behind the door still George could not
see any figure but following this he did notice that his wife was acting quite
strangely almost as if she was entranced or under hypnosis or something
eventually they did go back to sleep both of them but as Jorge said he kept
one eye open it didn't help because about a half hour later Louise woke up
again and saw this same figure again she woke up her husband and shouted out
George there is someone in the bedroom so he asked where and Louise said he's
behind the door and explained again that it was this strange humanoid figure
George himself now began to feel some fear and concerned so he again got up
inspected the area around the bedroom door where Louise was seeing this figure but couldn't see anything and he
wondered again if his wife was sleepwalking or something and he said look you can well see that there is
nobody and she said no he's there behind the door I see him and George asked her
well what does he look like and Louise explained this figure again in detail it was very short was dressed in a tight
fitting aluminum outfit and she told George it's looking at you
it looks like it's trying to tell you something so in order to reassure her
George turned on all the lights in the house tried to joke with her and sat up
with her in bed trying to calm her down and finally after a short while this
humanoid had disappeared and they both went back to bed and the rest of the night passed without any unusual
events however events weren't quite over yet because the next week Louise began
to suffer from some pretty severe headaches and she also began to dream about
extraterrestrials she said these were not nightmares she says that in the dreams she found herself in the presence
of several humanoids who looked just like the one she had seen twice in her home and in these dreams she was
explaining to these ETS how humans live here on Earth that is a very unusual
case and it's hard to reconcile why the wife could see this entity and husband couldn't I find that very unusual but
not unique it's also really interesting because this case involves obviously
deeper levels of contact with the wife having some communication following this
encounter which again is Not Unusual a real close encounter with a humanoid sometimes precedes more contact and
that's I think what we're seeing here so in that regard it's a real real important case now let's move to another
one which occurred in England and this one is a really fascinating case on multiple levels I call this one I felt
transfixed with fear again a single witness case but it does have Landing
traces it's got some very interesting elements to it it occurred one morning
in February of 1979 in eing Wald this is in York in the
UK and the witness is a really uh standup guy I think he's obviously very
sincere in his testimony but what I find so interesting about this encounter is
that following it he pretty much forgot about it it was a very cool crisp
February morning in 1979 in eing Wald this is near York in England as Phil
shepardson was driving his scooter his motorbike along a curving Country Lane
he had just passed cek Village and was heading towards huie where he worked as a chemical technician and this is when
he noticed something to his left something that would change his life
forever I'll just let Phillip describe in his own words as he says I looked to
my left and my head flipped at what I saw hovering in a corner of a small
field was a black triangular-shaped object what I saw just blew my mind was
hovering in the field in total silence I stopped to get a better look not
believing what I was seeing at the top of this object was a cockpit of some
kind and there was a figure inside it all I could see was a black helmet and
some sort of black overall began to turn and look in my direction turned to gaze at me I was
transfixed with fear at the sight of The Craft were two two figures which appeared also to stop what they were
doing and look in my direction they were slim looking figures who too wore black
overalls and they were trying to push the vehicle into the next field perhaps to conceal it amongst the standing
Grove and for some moments I was just Spellbound I was shaking the silence was
stifling as we gazed at each other and I felt some sort of contact taking place
but I just don't know what that was I just had an intense feeling of some connection I could not move I could not
think I was rooted to the spot time seemed to stop so Philip is not really sure how
long this face off lasted he did get off his motorbike and was standing next to it at the time he saw this the road was
otherwise deserted he did see that the figure in the craft was looking directly at him through this small round port
hole he also noticed that its helmet had had three spikes on top but his mind was
completely overwhelmed by what he was seeing and the strangeness of it he recalled that the figures by the craft
had been crouched down when he first saw them and appeared to be doing something to the craft but then stood up and
looked directly at him when he approached he said they were slender in form and tall and as Philip says what
struck me at the time was that this was a nuts and bolts technology not fuzzy
lights with a smudgy image I freaked at the fact that an aircraft floating like
a silent kite with not a blade of grass out of place and without Jets was way
beyond our technology then it flew off at tremendous speed suddenly my mind did
not accept it anymore couldn't take it anymore and I got on my bike and took off to work I don't remember getting
there in fact everything after that seemed surreal I appeared to forget the
experience as if told that this was something I shouldn't have witnessed I
just forgot it I did not want to believe it so fearing ridicule Philip told
nobody he actually just drove it out of his mind he does remember arriving to work a little later than normal but
ultimately he blocked the whole experience out of his mind and for over a decade he didn't think about it at all
but then one evening he began to experience these nightmares about this
incident and this is when he slowly recalled the entire experience all these
details came back to him as these dreams continued and finally he decided it was
time to come forward and share what happened to him he ended up co-founding
a UFO group The Yorkshire UFO group and he came forward he says in hopes that
someone else saw what he did did or something like it and that they have been too scared to come forward but now
maybe he could encourage them to do so his account has since been published in the UK UFO publication Northern UFO news
and in the Yorkshire evening Press newspaper and in other UFO Publications
I think in most respects that's a pretty typical encounter in terms of a UFO landing and seeing humanoids but I find
it very interesting that the witness did report some very strong telepathic communication sort of bond with these
ETS that he felt as if they were very friendly almost like friends we keep
hearing this over and over again I think it's an important detail also really
compelling is the fact that this entire encounter kind of just left his mind for
years and came back later I'm really glad he stepped forward to talk about
this most people don't they are scared Away by all the ridicule and disbelief
and fear surrounding this subject so kudos to all these Witnesses who do have
the courage to step forward go public and in some cases as in this one use
their real names so yeah thank you very much to the witness for doing this
because it's important a lot of people are having these encounters far more I think than the general public realizes
and probably far more even than people within the UFO Community realize I don't
think it's nearly as rare as a lot of people believe all right here is another case I
found this one super interesting because it's got some really unusual and unique
elements to it I call this one ET surveillance this one occurred on
September 25 1983 in pla de saleros this
this is in Portugal this is a really interesting case because it's quite longlasting the humanoids are really
interesting because they're quite tall but apparently looked human but yeah as we'll see it's got some really unusual
details to it this case was investigated by two researchers viente Juan ballister
Almos and Juan a Fernandez Perry and was published in their Spanish language Book
Encyclopedia of close encounters with UFOs the two witnesses in this casee are
Anonymous but we do have their initials one is jfm he's a 25-year-old agronomist and
then there's his girlfriend age 26 known by the initials
mfbr they were camping in the woods not too far from PL de saleros this is a
Beach area it was around 1:30 a.m. on September 25
1983 that both were awakened in their tent by a low frequency motor
sound so the girlfriend M went back to sleep but Jay stayed awake and after
about 20 minutes he stepped out of the tent and looking up he saw a bright
rotating orange light about 1 kilometer away hovering over the fields
surrounding the beach it was bright enough he said to illuminate a large portion of the field and was pulsating
at 3 second intervals was very low at the same level of their tent so
apparently at ground level it was at this point that Jay noticed two additional objects on either side of
this light and he could now see that they were actually craft three total each supported by three pillar-like
Landing legs which were touching the ground these objects were kind of boat shaped they looked identical and he
estimates that they were about 6 m in diameter 18 ft and this is when he
noticed four humanoid figures standing next to this Central object they were
essentially human looking normal stature and height but all were wearing a white
coverall which covered their bodies completely three appeared to be men and
one looked female that was Jay's impression and they were all standing together clearly illuminated by the glow
coming from these objects now it was not long after he noticed these figures that they each
began to move in quote slow motion walking very slowly and deliberately
away from the object in different directions they moved about 15 ft away
kind of symmetrically with their heads down as if surveiling the
terrain after a few minutes they returned and stood again together by
this Central object this point the two objects on either side took off at an angle towards the Southwest but quickly
returned and landed again as Jay looked he saw that the four humanoid forms were no longer visible
but 20 minutes later all three craft took off flew slowly over the area then
returned landed again at the original position then took off very fast towards
the Northwest so they appeared to be doing something in this area Jay
returned to his tent and it was 10 minutes later that both he and his girlfriend friend woke up again because
they heard more noises outside and going outside and looking up they saw the same
three craft had landed once again in the same exact location as soon as they saw them
however these craft rose up flew about 30 ft above the ground North along the
coastline formed a few more Maneuvers and were gone yet another example of a
UFO an ET craft coming down Landing ETS coming out and doing whatever it is
they're doing it's clear in this case they were very interested in this area
couldn't find anything particularly unusual about this area and I've said it before I think if you name any city or
town you can probably find an encounter there so it's clear that they're visiting all over the
world because here's another case which occurs in the farflung area for me at
least uh here in the United States all the way in Australia I call this one a
humanoid behind each window this one occurred on December 31st 1997 a fairly
recent case this is in Kenwick Western Australia there is some interesting
things about Kenwick this is an area where there is a nature preserve so that
could be a factor here we do see a lot of cases of UFOs in very natural areas
studying w Wildlife perhaps that's what was going on here I also like this case because there are multiple Witnesses
it's a fairly long lasting case and the description of the humanoids is also very interesting so this case took place
again in Kenwick in Western Australia it's mostly a rural suburb of about 5 to
6,000 people located on the outskirts of Perth but it does have large areas of
pristine wetlands and lots of agricultural property this case was published first in the UF Forum Journal
again occurred on December 31st 1997 when eight children five boys and three
girls ranging in age from 7 to 13 decided to go camping on the Family's
property in this area now it was around 10:30 p.m. when the primary witness Ryan
he was the first to notice flashes of red light streaking down from the sky and back up from the ground he estimates
about 2 km to the Northeast just over a mile and after watching the activity for
some time and seeing how strange it was Ryan decided to call it to the attention
of the other children all of who were in the tent so some of the children came
out of the tent and watched this activity for about 30 minutes but became
bored apparently and returned back into the tent but Ryan was still curious and
remained outside to watch these lights and this is when he was astonished to
see a huge illuminated object coming directly towards him from the direction
of these lights so Ryan immediately called for the other kids to come back outside of the tent and take a look five
of the eight children came out and each saw the UFO moving towards them overhead
except for the last few who by the time they came out saw that the UFO was already directly above them all the
children could now hear a sshing sound as this craft began to maneuver in the sky above them all of them described it
as being very large its exact shape wasn't clear but underneath it they
could all see in the center of the bottom of this object three brilliant yellow lights in a triangular formation
and around this triangle was a circle of much smaller lights multicolored blue
yellow red and white this object did appear to be metallic as they could see
three bright silver looking sort of Landing pods now Ryan did tell researchers that
he saw something else very interesting a row of large yellow win windows in the
center part A Long strip of Windows above one row and another below it but
behind each window in the central section Ryan could see separate humanoid
figures one in each window so these figures had no hair large lar eyes thin
arms and legs and looked like a pot belly no apparent clothing and behind
each of these figures he also saw what looked to him like some kinds of controls or technology of some kind so
these sound like typical Grays and according to Ryan this object moved until it was directly overhead at which
point it stopped for a few seconds and at this point it was close enough that they could see a white mist or vapor
swirling around the landing gear and the lights the object then moved off and
disappeared from sight and was gone a very interesting Case by any standards I
think it's a really good example of UFOs putting on a display because not only
did this UFO fly overhead it came directly over this group of children so
it's clear to me that it wanted to be seen that it was showing off essentially announcing its presence I do believe
this is one of the missions ETS have a sort of really vigorous Grassroots
publicity campaign announcing their presence probably because our own governments refuse to be truthful and
transparent and talk with any honesty about this subject such a shame we could
be far more along in terms of progress with our relationship with ETS if our
own governments would just be honest about the subject alas I don't see that
happening anytime soon all right let's move to the next case this one is so interesting think of
all the cases in this compilation today this one to me is the most fascinating
and I was initially going to present one single incident but it turned out that there were others surrounding this one
encounter that I think are connected to it so this is really a series of events
I'll be covering here I call this case the purple light being very unusual
encounter in terms of the description of the humanoid this one occurred on December 21st 2004 in chilo Ohio and
yeah a series of events surrounding it so there's some pretty good corroboration of this event and it's
also a multiple witness encounter it was throughout 2003 and
2004 that quite a few UFO events occurred in chileo Ohio and the
surrounding areas for example on October 18
2003 Lonnie kaplinger and his son Bruce were attending a football game when they
saw strange glowing objects in the sky as Bruce told reporters I couldn't
believe it it was too weird he said he saw two Bright Lights moving towards
them from above and then as he says all of a sudden a third one appeared then a
fourth one they were in a horizontal line four bright lights then they slowly
turned orange and just disappeared just makes you wonder what's out there so yes
a simple sighting but it was just a few days later on October 21st 2003 that
another father and son Duo were driving along us23 between chili cooth and Waverly
again in Ohio when as the father says my son and I witnessed a br iant green
light that appeared in the sky and dropped from Northwest to Southeast before
extinguishing immediately after it went out the same event occurred which made
this very unusual so again a simple sighting but yeah unusual doesn't sound like a
shooting star or anything that's easily explained and events were still in
progress because it was one month and one week later at 10 p.m. on November
18th 20 three that a married couple were in their chili coth home when a UFO
appeared outside the husband saw it first as the wife says my husband came
in and told me that there was a strange object in the sky my husband I and the
neighbor went out to watch it the object started out as being triangular we
looked with binoculars and it appeared to be changing colors it had red green and blue lights was glowing a white
color also would shine a beam of light and then it would stop as we watched it
would change shape at one point it appeared to divide in half so they
watched it for a good long time almost 3 hours they did try to take pictures but the pictures did not come out and after
it disappeared they went back into the house and found out something else
unusual had happened as the wife says we had a strange message on our answering
machine which was sounds like Echoes my computer would not work also the
neighbor called complaining her computer would not work also so she called the police who said that they had not
received any calls but later asking around she learned that others had seen
this object and had also called the police but events ramped up a short time
later it was 6 months later when a man in Circleville this is 19 miles to the
north not far away reported a very unusual experience was 10: p.m. July 12
2004 he was grilling in the backyard talking to his mom on the phone when he
noticed that he was suddenly enveloped in a beam of light and as he says out of
the corner of my eyes at about 300 to 500 ft above me was an oval-shaped craft
with a blue and white colored light fixed on myself he said this object was gray in
color quite large three to four times the apparent size of a full moon and
again he was talking with his mother on the phone and excitedly started to tell her what he was looking at when this
beam immediately retracted and the object darted quickly away so he went
back inside the H house only to learn that his wife who was watching TV said
that during the time of his encounter she noticed that the TV was showing
strange flickering interference this case was investigated by Pete
hardinger the director of the roundtown UFO Society who learned that 5 days
after this event on July 17 a UFO was seen 64 miles to the south in Portsmouth
and it was also sending down beams of light but events came to a really
startling climax on December 21st 2004 when two separate UFO events occurred on
the same evening I'll talk about the first one which occurred in Strongsville
175 miles north of chili cooth just a few days earlier the witness known only
as Diane was sitting at her computer when as she says and I quote I heard a
static kind of sound and turned around to see a round ball was about the size
of a grapefruit or a small melon that looked like the sun yellow and orangey
bright about 10 in above the floor it moved along the wall across from me in a
straight line doubled back to the middle of the wall then disappeared and that
night I had such strange things happen in my sleep they are bizarre but I can't
get them out of my mind I'm a nervous wreck I feel angry cranky and scared and
very concerned so much that I have had bumps on my back for about a week now
she didn't notice a couple of other things her gold ring had a mysterious break in it and bracelet had been
crushed at the clasp but it was a few days later again on December 21st 2004
she was leaving the post office when she saw a quote light in the sky which she
could not explain and she believes it was a UFO now alone these cases are
interesting enough but when you add this next and final report also on December 21st 2004 Things become truly bizarre
again as investigated by Pete hardinger of the roundtown UFO Society was around 8:00 p.m. as a 43-year-old man and his
nephew and their dog were walking outside his home in chili cth when they
saw a quote bright light up in the sky they said it was following the hill
behind their house and then it stopped and began to hover over a field near a
hill this point their dog ran away in fear but they were curious so they
decided to walk to the area now it was night 8 p.m. so They Carried flashlights
to navigate through the trees to the field and as the main witness says when
we got to the field we saw that the light was above the tree line on the other side and was fairly large we
signaled the light with our flashlights and to our amazement the light reacted by flashing then changing shapes into a
pyramid a star a square as if it was some kind of laser light show then it
returned to its circular shape and began to Glow in a purple light and the whole field was glowing purple also now events
quickly escalated to a whole new level cuz as the witness says we noticed what
appeared to be some kind of entities coming out of the top of the globe and they were gesturing at us with their
arms then one came out of the go Globe completely and floated down until it
stood in front of us it was shaped like a human but was made completely of the
purple light like a hologram and had no facial features fingers on its hands and
it wore a long robe we tried to communicate with it to no avail so I
reached out my hand in a friendly gesture and the being reached out its hand and put it in mine I felt no
pressure on my hand no feeling of a presence at all we we then noticed these
four red blinking lights appear around the field surrounding the field on each side one moved to the large purple Globe
then back to its position now was at this point that something even weirder happened the father apparently blacked
out for a second and does not recall what happened but the nephew does he saw
the glowing purple being float back up and reenter into the globe but as his
uncle the main witness says apparently I had a memory lapse once I touched the
creature's hand I do not remember this happening I had glanced up to see these
lights and when I looked back at the being in front of me it was gone once the being of purple light was gone we
now began to get very cold and got a strange feeling of paranoia like there was something else in the field with us
that we could not see so we went home rather quickly at this point we found
our dog hiding in the woods how amazing is that I think probably these various
events are connected to some extent obviously really hard to say for sure
it's pure speculation but given that they occurred in the same area around the same time that's pretty interesting
I love all the evidence surrounding this case uh in that last case with the
animal reaction as well it's important because this shows once again that it's
not just just us being affected by these encounters but animals as well in fact
the witness in that case only came forward because he wanted answers he wanted to know if any other people had
seen late beings like the one he saw and there are the cases very much like it so
the answer is yes all right now let's move to the last and final case in this
compilation this one is a doozy it's quite unusual I call this one the giant
alien and I like this one because it is a multiple witness case some really unique
and unusual elements to it that I don't think I've heard before frankly I don't think I've ever heard a description of
an ET quite this large but they verified it so I have to think that you know
they're good observers in this case which occurred fairly recently August
21st 2014 and taliva Deena this is in Toledo
Spain and yeah this is a really unusual encounter to say the least this case
comes from researcher Albert Rosales who talked directly to the witnesses and published this account in his 2010 2015
volume of humanoid encounters the others amongst us it involves three Witnesses
all friends the primary witness is known only by his initials
LF was late in the night of August 21st 2014 and they had gone to a field near a
local extension bridge probably the one pictured here is there are no other extension bridges in this area of taliva
De laena Toledo Spain and they were planning to do a
meditation exercise and had meditated silently for some time when suddenly a
large glowing orb oneir the apparent size of the Moon descended down from the
sky and hovered directly above them now at first paid no attention to this light
this object but then he was suddenly struck by a powerful quote electric
current so he could physically feel this thing and after about 1 minute a smaller
sphere came out of the larger one and the larger one disappeared so curious the three friends
examined the area and began to walk through the field to look for what was going on here and I walked for about a
half mile and which point they could smell a very strong kind of odor of
sulfur they also noticed the temperature in the area Rose noticeably now LF became even more
intrigued and ran ahead of his friends to reach the end of this wall that they were standing nearby and as he did so
his friends began to yell excitedly at him to stop stop please come back come
back so LF immediately stopped he turned around to look at at his friends who
were now about 300 ft away from him and his friends shouted out that they had seen this strange figure huge they
weren't sure how big he was but somewhere between 9 and 12 feet tall and
he was standing on the other side of this wall but moving at very high speed seeming to Glide above the ground and
heading directly towards their friend and that's when they screamed at which point this figure quickly hid behind a
tree on the other side of the wall which was only about 15 ft away from LF so
hearing this LF turns around to look and to his shock he can see its figure and
he agreed that it was exceedingly tall very broad shoulders a dark body but
really the only thing he noticed was its eyes which seemed almost shine with this
bright golden yellow light so the witness stared in absolute disbelief as
this figure stared right back at had him and he became overwhelmed with fear he
felt like this figure might try to reach out and grab him so he ran in Terror yelling at his friends to do the same
and all three took off with the feeling that they were running for their lives now as they ran they saw that this
figure was following them sliding along the top of the wall and apparently
coming right along with them so they ran across the field towards the main road
Road and lf's two friends said as they were running away they felt this weird
feeling as if their legs were becoming numb and they were being pricked by needles which interfered with their
ability to get away from this area now LF did not notice any strange Sensations
but again he was slightly separated by them from them now however as they ran away from
this Chase figure and we're coming up to the safety of the main road all three
men became they said enveloped in this strange almost spider Webby like
substance which made it very difficult for them to see anything in front of them so they had with to with some
effort free themselves from this weird substance which they did and they reached the main road at which point
they turned around and this figure was now gone they were all too shook up to investigate further and they quickly
returned home but the next day still curious LF did returned to the site he
examined the tree where this creature had briefly hidden behind so he could try to gauge its size to his amazement
this tree was a bit taller than he thought about 24 ft high so when he saw
this creature he said it was nearly as tall as this tree itself which would make its sides considerably in excess of
12 ft but hard to say because again it was at night they were quite frightened
he did continue to search around this area and found an area of flattened and scorched grass as far as the Webby
substance that they all felt he didn't see any remains of it but he is sure it
wasn't spiderwebs as the trees in the area were quite dry with little vegetation this was an area he had been
in many times before and he had never seen either ERS or webs before so that
remains a mystery that's another case that I think is hard to dismiss given that there are three Witnesses given
that there's apparent Landing traces it's a really interesting case and I'm a
little bit sad that the witnesses did experience such intense fear because I often wonder what would happen if
someone did not experience fear and flee the scene you might have a much more
extensive encounter and we might have learned learned quite a bit more about what's going on here certainly we do
have a lot of cases where that has happened and often people are taken on board and they have an encounter which
they learn a lot and perhaps even get healed or learn all kinds of information
so yeah this does happen but so many humanoid encounters I've presented 10
here again all the way from the 1940s up to quite recently the 2010s all over the
world impossible to to deny that something is going on here and it's such
a shame that our own governments all they'll talk about drones all they'll talk about UFOs and sightings they're
not talking about humanoids and that is very telling I
think that's a very important detail that we really need to recognize this coverup is still in place
we're still dealing with a lot of machinations I guess one way of putting
it it's there's a cover up it's still in place but I think now we're definitely
turning the tide this subject is growing in popularity by Leaps and Bounds
there's a lot of people talking about it it's moving mainstream so we're absolutely making progress but until I
see that Roswell craft in a museum until I can see the ET bodies until we have
full truth and transparency with this subject I'm going to continue doing this research and putting out these episodes
because I think it's an important subject that has the potential to change the world for the better in many
different ways so thanks very much for watching guys I truly appreciate it it's
because of you I'm doing this research and putting out these episodes so thank you thank you thank you and until next
week keep searching for the truth keep asking those hard questions most important of all keep having fun and I
will see you later bye for now
