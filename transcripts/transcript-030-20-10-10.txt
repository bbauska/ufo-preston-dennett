THE CORONADO ISLAND UFO INCIDENT
Oct 10, 2020

Summary:
Oct 10, 2020
On the weekend of March 26-27, 1994, the Triad UFO Conference (funded by billionaire Robert Bigelow) was held at the Del Coronado Hotel on Coronado Island in southern California. Featured were leading abduction investigators Budd Hopkins, Yvonne Smith, John Carpenter and others. Several hundred people attended the conference.

Mike Evans, his wife, and a small group of other friends decided to attend. Unknown to them, they were about to become embroiled in one of the strangest and most unique events in UFO history: a mass UFO abduction. Six witnesses in three adjoining hotel rooms at the Village Inn all experienced an alien encounter on the same evening. Meanwhile, conference attendees at other nearby hotels also experienced extraterrestrial visitations.

Coronado Island is a small, densely populated island, much of which is owned and used by the United States Navy. It's a popular tourist destination, heavily guarded by police and military personnel. In other words, an unlikely location for a mass UFO abduction.

But wait, there's more! At the time of the abduction, the presidential Secret Service swarmed the island. President Clinton was visiting the next day. He planned to stay at the home of Larry Lawrence, US Ambassador to Switzerland, owner of the Hotel Del Coronado and one of the wealthiest men in the United States. Lawrence was a huge donor to President Clinton's campaign. And by some strange coincidence, the home of Larry Lawrence and the Village Inn were separated by only a few thousand feet.

Another thing that makes this case different is many of the witnesses suffered alarming physical symptoms following this encounter and others. One of the witnesses discovered an apparent alien implant in her leg, which was subsequently removed by Dr. Roger Leir, providing incontrovertible evidence of extraterrestrial intervention. 

This video presents the Coronado Island UFO Incident from beginning to end, as told by one of the main percipients. Yvonne Smith's excellent book, "Coronado," tells the comprehensive story of this case, with several more new witnesses. You can also read about the experiences of the six experiencers at the Village Inn in my book, "The Coronado Island Incident," co-written by Mike Evans.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and today's episode is called the coronado island ufo 
incident this is about an amazing multiple witness abduction case which took place on march 26 27 
in 1994 on the island of coronado california this is located just south of san diego north of mexico 
and how I got involved in this was in 1999 I went to speak before a ufo group about ufo 
healing cases this is a group headed by yvonne smith it's called the close encounter research 
organization ciro and after the presentation I was approached by an audience member 
a gentleman by the name of mike evans and mike evans proceeded to share with me that he had had 
a lifetime of encounters with gray type ets and he was very interested in collaborating on a book 
i encouraged him you know to write it himself and that I i would help him but he really wanted to collaborate uh he felt he was kind of too close to the story 
and wanted someone with object objectivity and as he proceeded to tell me about his encounters 
i became really intrigued at first it seemed like you're sort of run-of-the-mill abduction 
account by grey ets but then he proceeded to tell me about this incident that happened while he 
was attending a ufo conference on coronado island on the weekend of march 26 27 1994. 
this was the triad ufo conference I immediately became intrigued because I had actually been 
there I attended that conference on that weekend on coronado island turned out I had a friend who 
had a place to stay and as it turned out uh where I was staying was literally about a 
quarter mile maybe uh away from where mike and several others had had an abduction experience 
so it was right next door to me and yeah that intrigued me for sure 
so with after quite a bit of convincing uh we did collaborate on a book together the coronado 
island ufo incident and that's what this presentation is about it's an amazing case 
it's not super well known but it definitely should be because it's got some very strange elements the 
first being where it took place again this was during the triad ufo conference it had a number 
of real big heavy hitters in the ufo field yvonne smith certainly a leading abduction investigator 
in the united states colin andrews crop circle researcher don ecker editor of ufo magazine 
bud hopkins was there speaking as was john carpenter uh michael lindemann all very 
prominent ufo abduction researchers so this was a conference that was really about ufo contact and 
was being held at the del coronado hotel on coronado island now coronado island is it's not 
huge it's this little island it's about 32 square miles it's connected to the mainland by this 
really long and uh very high bridge it's world famous the coronado island ufo bridge
and what's interesting about this case is you know coronado island is very densely populated it's got 
at least 20 000 people on it at that time more now uh which is you know 32 square miles and much 
of this is not public land this is actually a navy island this is where the navy trains 
the navy seals and much of this island is devoted to the navy 
about half and the other half is pretty much a tourist trap it's very densely populated 
there are lots of little shops and stores and restaurants and cafes and definitely a bunch of 
hotels uh it's a very famous tourist destination it's got some of the best beaches around 
and extremely pop densely populated as I said it's got a very strong police presence it's a 
quasi-military island and really the least likely place you'd expect to have uh ufo abduction 
much less a mass ufo abduction however this is what happened and how it all kind of unfolded was 
in 1994 mike and his wife and four other friends decided they were going to attend this conference 
mike and his wife gina drove down so did his friend nancy and 
lacey and also two other people nancy's brother phil and his wife so all six of these people 
decided that they were going to attend the conference and they all booked adjoining rooms at the village inn which was really less than a mile away from the del coronado hotel 
and as I said I i was very close to the village inn where I was staying in a private residence 
and what's also very interesting uh is this hotel and the actual windows 
that mike and nancy and the others were staying in overlooked the home of maurice larry lawrence 
who is the ambassador to switzerland for the united states so that house was literally within 
stone's throw and was visible from the hotel so that fact will become important
and at this time you know mike did not think he was an experiencer he was very interested in 
ufos he was very active in mufon he was actually a section director a field investigator as was nancy 
and uh together they had worked on several ufo cases including one of their friends who was 
with them that uh weekend who was lacey so these guys were all connected and in the middle of the 
night mike was in his hotel room when he woke up because light was flooding the room this is 
what he consciously remembers and he was very confused by it kind of rolled over and went to 
sleep he thought at some point he got up he remembers stumbling around in the bathroom 
and thought he slipped or and hit his lip somehow uh he was a little bit confused by it all 
and woke up the next morning and there was a spot of blood on his pillow about the size of a nickel 
uh he pointed it out to his wife he's like I think I hit my lip and his wife look and she's like well 
no your lip is fine though he did a q-tip and find blood in his ear so he was still somehow convinced 
he hit his lip despite the evidence and was also feeling a little fluish had had a restless night 
and in the morning at breakfast when nancy and lacey finally came down he brought this up 
he says you know i'm not feeling well I had a kind of restless night and I found a spot of blood on my pillow nancy's feeling unwell as well she said she had a sort of restless night and mike said 
that he had a restless night as well and thought he saw a weird light entering the room there's 
a spot of blood on his pillow and lacey didn't want to talk about it she was very tight-lipped 
she just did not want to talk about what had happened and kept changing the subject so that was kind of strange mike thought and even stranger finally uh nancy's brother shows up with his wife 
and makes an announcement that shocks them all he says he's not going to the ufo conference 
despite the fact that he'd already paid I had been very excited about it and drove some 150 miles uh down to san diego to attend the conference he now said he did not want to go 
and uh was instead just going to go shopping with his wife so mike thought that was curious but 
you know what are you gonna what are you gonna say and he went and he attended the conference 
it was a successful conference uh it was very interesting all the speakers were great 
and afterwards mike drove home and that was that or so he thought but in the days and weeks 
following this conference mike started to have some very strange experiences 
he would wake up and find bruises on his arm sometimes they were very severe 
sometimes it was more than just bruises there were you know triangular marks puncture wounds 
and he was waking up feeling foolish one time it got so bad he had to go to the hospital he had 104 
degree fever I was about two weeks or so after the conference he's had a high 
blood pressure attack and had to seek medical attention and during the examination the doctor 
said what happened to your ear it looks like you stuck something in your ear there's a puncture wound well mike says he just about fell off his chair when he heard that 
because now he was starting to connect the dots something was wrong not only was he waking up with bruises sometimes his wife you know 
at least once both he and his wife woke up with nearly identical marks in nearly the same place 
so at this point he contacted his friend nancy they were very good friends and uh told him about 
told her about what he was experiencing and nancy got a little pale she's like listen mike I think 
you might be having abduction experiences and uh it took quite a bit of convincing on her part 
mike kept saying no no I don't think so these are just bruises and but could not 
explain how they were happening nancy brought up what happened at the coronado island with 
uh him seeing blood on his pillow and he says no I just hit my lip and she 
explained no your lip wasn't hurt but your ear has a puncture wound in it think this through so she finally got through to him and mike agreed to seek hypnosis 
uh he at the time was very interested in ufos but did not think he was involved until now 
and he really began to look at some childhood experiences in a different way he remembered a 
few times where he thought intruders had come into his home when he was a tiny little kid 
he could point to a couple of incidents where he had seen ufos as a child and 
for that matter as an adult also he had a few incidents where he may have had missing time 
uh he suffered very badly from sinusitis as a kid uh had a lot of nosebleeds he knew that was 
a symptom uh had a lot of depression his grades suffered so all of this seemed to be connected 
so he decides to go under hypnosis with yvonne smith leading ufo abduction investigator 
and under hypnosis he discovered that yes he did have a lifelong series of encounters and was in 
fact apparently visited in his hotel room at the village inn on coronado island in march of 1994. 
so he ended up going through several sessions and recalled all of these experiences 
he remembered as a little boy that there had been an intruder under hypnosis he recalled that there 
was an intruder it was a gray type e.t it peeked around the doorway at him the room filled with 
light this foggy light he ended up being taken on board remember being laid out on a 
silver table that indented to his body it wasn't a scary experience he was just a little kid he 
was pretty calm and he had the feeling they were just checking on his physical development and he had several experiences like this growing up at age 12 he was in his backyard it was sunny 
suddenly there's a dark circular shadow covering him he looks up and sees this object it flashes 
the light at him next thing he knows it's night time under hypnosis like he recalled being taken 
on board and physically examined they seemed happy about his progress was starting to get 
scary at this point uh once when he was also 12 years old he was at school on the playground 
recess had just begun when he had missing time next thing he knows recess is over and he has 
this weird scoop mark on his leg under hypnosis same thing recalls being physically examined 
and uh had several missing time events while hiking behind his house as a teenager he liked 
to do a lot of hiking and would often come back far far later than he should have and that always 
puzzled him so looking into that he discovered more missing time encounters was always the same 
they would just take him on board there was little communication don't be afraid we won't hurt you we need to examine you and they would physically examine him around this time he 
did have some interesting uh effects he became very interested in you know as a kid in school 
in hypnosis and psychology in quantum physics magnetics crystal radios this sort of thing he had 
some really esoteric far thinking ideas even as a very young kid which he relates to all of this 
he did have some ufo sightings he remembered seeing a ufo with his parents and turning 
to look at them and seeing them just frozen and entranced and so definitely has a long ufo history 
which went all the way into adulthood when he reached college age he decided to become serious 
with his life and uh went to college despite having bad grades in uh junior high and high 
school he really worked hard and became something of an overachiever really he got a degree in 
psychology he also got a degree in anthropology and then took more school and became a registered 
nurse he joined the military and was stationed on the uss fire drake and while on the uss 
fire drake on the pacific ocean uh and uh he and many other people on the ship saw a fleet 
of ufos fly overhead from horizon to horizon there were six or seven of them in formation 
and clearly not normal aircraft and after seeing that that's what got him interested in ufos 
he kind of thought that was really his first sighting he had pretty much blocked out or 
it was buried in amnesia everything that had happened in his childhood but that got him into ufos he heard about afro the aerial phenomena research organization 
and joined that group and started getting some literature on ufos after being stationed on the 
uss fire drake as a medic he was transferred to camp pendleton in southern california 
that immediately intrigued me as well because uh I had interviewed other people and knew of several 
other cases involving ufos in this area at camp pendleton some really major cases so I 
wasn't surprised when mike said he had had some very strange incidents occur at camp pendleton 
including his entire barracks lighting up in the middle of the night him feeling paralyzed 
and unable to move and multiple incidents involving missing time uh with he and his friend 
so after being stationed at camp pendleton having several ufo experiences there 
he left the military joined the private sector and worked as a nurse in a hospital outside of 
l.a and eventually joined mufon became a section director started investigating 
he started investigating cases that's where he met nancy that's how he met lacey 
because he and nancy were field investigators from mufon and actually 
investigated a case where lacey had been abducted off the freeway in ventura in 1992. 
so these they were all friends by the time this incident on coronado island occurred 
and under hypnosis mike recalled what had happened while he was on coronado island 
in the village inn he in the middle was in the it was the middle of the night 
and he woke up to the room filling with light his first thought that it was a plane coming in 
from san diego it didn't occur to him that his window does not overlook the airport
uh so that explanation couldn't be true he tried to wake up his wife his wife wouldn't wake up and 
i'll just let mike describe uh in his own words what happened so here is me quoting mike directly 
this light came in through the window shade the whole room turned white the light was so bright it was like cotton candy or or cotton palpable you could feel it it almost looked like 
a light shining through smoke it was kind of thick the texture of the light almost like you could feel it it was coming through the walls the windows the whole thing 
and in this light these beings came through four of them it looked like they were gliding through 
or kind of walking I couldn't see their legs but they were moving pretty uniformly they had a very 
large head very large eyes a pointy chin and they just kind of glided in they positioned themselves 
the first one came around to my side and the three others came and stood in front of the bed in front 
of me he had something in his hand I remember him turning my body over he kind of took something in 
his hand like a silver object and he put it in my left ear and then he put me over and they left the 
room became smokey with all this light and it's like they went back where they came from they went through the wall they all kind of got into a line and glided I saw them all shuffle off and the 
last one that was next to me he kept watching me all the time as he was shuffling the other three 
went back into the light he was the last one to go back into the light and as it was looking at me 
then it was dark but it was light outside the room you could see the light outside the room so mike 
believes he was implanted he got a pretty good look at this instrument and i'll just 
want to let him describe what this instrument looked like in his own words because it's it's a description I have heard many times from other witnesses as mike says it was kind of a long 
instrument silver not really shiny just kind of a burnished silver at the end there was a little 
cage there was a little ball inside the cage and then he put that in my ear the instrument was he 
held it in his hand maybe about four inches I only saw three or four fingers holding it very 
thin fingers wrapping around this handle thing it was fairly thick at the end where they grabbed it 
and it narrowed down and at the very end there was a little cage with something inside the cage
so that was pretty much the extent of mike's recall it was a pretty scary experience for him 
he remembered screaming at one point in fear and uh waking up the next morning all he remembered 
was just this restless night the light coming in and the spot of blood on his pillow 
so this was pretty shocking revelation for him and after finding this out you know he asked nancy 
at this point yvonne smith was hearing back from other people and she instructed them all not to speak to each other about their memories in order not 
to contaminate their stories because it turned out that this was a mass abduction which had occurred 
not only at the village inn to these six witnesses but there were at least twice as many witnesses it 
turned out uh 12 maybe even more so this is a very profound important and strange case so after mike 
revealed what happened to him attention turned to the next room which had nancy and lacy in it 
and uh nancy uh said that she had had a very restless night consciously she does recall 
seeing the room fill up with light she saw it through her clock closed eyelids it was 
just a brief flash and she it's just almost a subconscious memory uh and she also remembers 
having a nightmare where she was being chased it was a very restless night and 
even more curiously she remembers something that happened before this incident that could 
be and I think is very significant she and lacy had gone to the del coronado hotel 
for a late evening snack they had a salad and while there this was you know 10 p.m or so
they said that they saw secret service agents or who they perceived to be secret service agents 
they thought perhaps even some of their waiters might be because they had an awful lot of waiters for just the two of them and they seemed to be kind of trying to listen in to their conversation 
and they became even more alarmed because as they left the hotel in the del coronado hotel and walked toward the village inn where they were going to stay 
they were followed by one of these guys and uh it was very apparent and 
so they made a few turns and this guy stuck right on their trail 100 yards behind them 
and they were very nervous about it they sped up he'd speed up they'd slow down he'd slow down 
and he followed them all the way to the village inn the secret service agent 
both of them confirmed this and they were kind of freaked out about it they knew that 
president clinton was coming into town that weekend to stay at the home of larry lawrence 
so perhaps that was why but the the secret service they definitely seemed interested in them and many 
people by the way at the conference noticed these secret service people certainly I did uh 
so that evening nancy has this very restless night with this nightmare and wakes up the next morning 
to something even stranger not only does she feel fluish and her eyes are glazed and she's kind of 
out of it she can't get up out of bed something is holding her down she hears lacey start laughing 
and looking in front of her she can see that the bed spread which had been uh you know at the foot 
of her bed had now been rolled up into kind of a tootsie roll all folded up into like a scarf 
and was now tucked around her neck holding her down it was tucked under the mattress pressing her 
down around her neck and she had to really make an effort to get out of bed and pull this thing off 
that just blew my mind because I had heard the exact same description from another abductee 
in a completely separate case I personally think that was done on purpose and was left by 
presumably the et's as sort of a calling card a little sort of reminder that something strange 
had happened because there's no way she could have done it herself and certainly lacey didn't do it 
it's just a very odd thing and so she wrestles herself out of bed and is trying to 
compose herself and lacy remains very tight-lipped well now that they know something has happened 
nancy goes under hypnosis and under hypnosis she's not able to recall a whole lot anytime 
she gets anywhere close to recalling something she gets this very severe pain in her head and yvonne 
smith kept having to pull her out of hypnosis all she could really recall was a bright light 
filling the room something some sort of figure rushing towards her touching her shoulder 
and she blacks out and i'll just read a very short quote from nancy as nancy says what I 
remember is sometime after I fell asleep I saw a bright bright flash of light in my eyelids 
it was almost like one of those things where you can see the light flash but you don't wake up 
i remember I had a nightmare of some kind so yeah she really doesn't remember a whole lot 
she does have a long history of encounters as a kid she'd seen ufos with her mom her dad had 
seen ufos uh she got married as soon as she got married her husband reported seeing a gray 
come in and visit them both and uh had yeah a lot of experiences both before and after this incident 
but was apparently abducted and although she doesn't remember it lacey does lacey also has had 
a lifetime of experiences and actually as a very young girl when she was just a wee toddler was in 
her backyard picking snails off of the plants in the garden when she was confronted by a very tall 
praying mantis type e.t this is how her encounters began and they were very frequent throughout her 
childhood and into adulthood as a young girl she was abducted while scuba diving off on the far 
side of catalina island and as an adult she had an abduction experience in 1992 with her friend this 
is invented ventura and this was the case that was actually investigated by mike evans and nancy 
so this is how they all kind of came to know each other and uh yeah lacey had had a lifetime of 
encounters and a lot of them were fully conscious and she had a real hard time with it she had lost 
friends because of this because whenever she had friends they would start having experiences too so 
it was a very difficult time for her and she would her method of coping was to just not talk about it 
so she went to this conference very reluctantly because she had noticed a pattern that whenever 
she went traveling this is when she would be abducted uh it seemed to cause an abduction to 
happen and she told nancy this and she's like no I don't want to go something might happen and nancy 
convinced her said don't worry we'll be staying at a hotel it's coronado island what could happen 
it's a ufo conference and nancy reluctant or uh nancy convinced her to go and lacey reluctantly 
agreed and they drove down and everything was fine until they were followed to the hotel by the 
secret service agents that's when it got weird and sometime in the middle of the night lacie wakes up 
and there's this very loud throwing noise this was something micah evans also recalled hearing 
a very loud humming noise he recalled that under hypnosis lacy recalled it consciously it 
woke her up and she could see that the room was starting to fill with light and she turned over 
and saw that nancy was moaning in her sleep and had rolled off the bed and was hiding in the 
corner appeared to be semi-conscious lacey jumped up and ran over to her and hugged her because lacy 
knew what was happening she knew they were coming she had felt this sort of thing happened before 
and was terrified and starting to cry as the room filled up with this foggy cottony 
white light just like mike had described and suddenly through the closed window she sees 
grays up here multiple grays two or three and uh they just glide right in they levitate lacey 
pull her away from nancy and place lacey on the bed then levitate nancy and whoosh take 
her out of the room lacey said they smelled really bad kind of like sulfur or rotten eggs 
and i'll just read a short quote from lacey describing what she experienced as lacie says 
they smell like I want to say sulfur rotten eggs they're coming through this window they 
were small gray beings they're really small maybe three feet high very limby spindly 
looking their torso is quite big their heads are large but they're disgusting they look disgusting 
the room was lit up like daylight they were pale gray that a large torso is more structured 
than the rest of their body but their arms and legs were really stick-like they had huge heads 
huge round almond-shaped eyes I couldn't really see a nose or a mouth they may have that may 
have been because they didn't have one or the light was behind them I just couldn't see them that well but their chins were really pointed very very pointed and they just took
nancy right out of the room you know she's laying there in bed uh sennai paralyzed she's not sure she was just too afraid to move or she couldn't move 
uh but here's this very loud thrumming noise and it's palpable she hears mike 
screaming bloody murder from the other room it sounds like he's very startled very terrified and 
this goes on for just a brief moment the screaming but uh the humming goes on for a short time she's 
not sure how long she uh believes she did pass out lose consciousness but at some point 
she's wakes up and the room is filling up with light again and she can see nancy being brought in the same way she was taken out floated in on a beam of light the 
grays are there they're levitating her they place her back in bed and again they smell really bad 
and just glide right out of the room and slowly the room becomes dark again 
uh lacey's very disoriented very shaken up and she can see that nancy is unconscious 
and she jumps out of bed and checks on nancy nancy is breathing but very shallowly 
and lacey's not able to wake her up and lacey herself is still very disoriented and extremely 
tired and is not able to remain conscious and ends up back in bed where she falls unconscious 
wakes up the next morning remembers everything is horrified she blames herself because she thinks 
it's her fault she knew this was going to happen of course it's not her fault but when mike asks her you know did anyone have a restless night I had this weird night 
uh she doesn't want to talk about it it's too traumatizing for her and it's totally 
understandable that she you know kept this secret for quite some time she did end up going under 
hypnosis and didn't really have anything to add to what she had already consciously recalled 
one thing she did find curious was not only the fact that their window was overlooking the home 
of larry lawrence the swiss ambassador but that this was the first time she had ever seen gray 
type ets before she had always seen the praying mantis type the first time she'd ever seen grace 
so yeah it was a very scary experience for her she didn't like it and now that she had recalled this attention of course turned to nancy's brother phil and his wife 
what had they remembered phil turns out did have an ex you know a lifelong 
experiences with et's which he knew about again he's nancy's brother and she had had experiences 
his wife is repulsed by the ufo subject she refused to be interviewed doesn't want to 
talk about it was pretty upset that phil had agreed to be interviewed phil was initially very reluctant but only agreed to be interviewed because he thought this case was really important 
and uh he as I said did have a lifelong series of encounters sightings as a kid back in the 1980s as 
an adult he had an encounter with a gray type e.t in his bedroom he could feel it coming for days 
he just knew something was going to happen he finally just said something's going to happen let it happen and that night it did he saw this gray tight being which he described 
uh very clearly it had you know looked old had a little bit of hair on its head 
he described it very vividly the strong hair is taken directly from his description and uh 
he screamed he was covered in sweat he doesn't really remember anything else except falling unconscious back on his wife and uh woke up the next morning and he felt very unwell 
event tried to be rushed to the hospital uh with very severe symptoms the doctors were 
horrified because he had ear infections in both ears he had a sinus infection 
his eyes were infected he had infections in every single orifice he had an infection his prostate 
so this was a very serious situation he lost weeks of work and was took him weeks to recover 
he of course links it to whatever happened on that evening when he was visited by grace and 
certainly links it to what happened to him at the coronado island ufo conference at the village inn 
in march of 1994 after he found out that mike and lacy nancy had all had experiences 
he started to look back at that night because he had had some flashbacks 
he did remember actually hearing someone scream he thought he heard mike screaming in the hallway 
he remembered at some point his room had filled with light to all he really remembered consciously except it being a very restless night he remembered waking up the next morning and just 
being repulsed by the whole ufo subject he didn't want to talk about it he didn't want to see it 
and wanted nothing to do with it so he went shopping instead with his uh wife well after he 
found out of course that all these experiences had happened he did agree to go visit yvonne smith and 
go under hypnosis go under hypnotic regression and under hypnosis he recalled quite a bit he recalled 
the room filling with light mike screaming gray's coming in he was not the target of the abduction 
apparently his wife was and I will just let phil describe in his own words what happened 
so this is phil talking I remember the room getting really really bright it was weird kind 
of luminescent like a bright whitish blue color shortly thereafter I saw these three beings kind 
of walk through the front door and enter the room there were three of them they were all 
short grayish blue in color big eyes they kind of just walked over to our bed and were walking 
around the room they were very spindly real thin long arms I didn't really notice any clothing 
one had a black rod in his hand that had a ball on one end and he made eye contact with me 
and then touched me on the temple with the rod and I just kind of was paralyzed at that point 
at that point he was just like right in my face to where he was just inches away from me and I 
could only see into his eyes when he was staring at me I just kind of felt that he was saying 
it will be over soon and don't worry that type of thing not that he spoke or anything 
but that's just kind of the thoughts that I had that he was projecting towards me 
nothing really happened to me I do remember them taking my wife however she was enveloped in a beam 
of light and then she just kind of vanished I was still frozen with that being just kind of peering 
at me and then in the course of time I could hear different noises like an electrical buzzing type 
noise that was kind of filling the room I also heard a man kind of scream like he was real 
startled that was for a couple of seconds and that was out in the hallway it was fairly high pitched 
sounded like somebody really got the life scared out of them then I remember being kind of frozen 
looking at this being and the whole room went pitch black to where I couldn't see anything 
and that went on for a short time then the room started getting brighter and brighter and then I saw my wife slowly sink back down onto the bed she was enveloped in a beam of light when 
i saw her she was about a foot off the bed just being lowered into the bed and then 
after that this beam of light went away and I just started coming to and not being able to move I got 
up to go to the bathroom and when I got back in bed she kind of awoke turned over and fell asleep
so that's what he recalled under hypnosis other than that he woke up the next morning and all of that had been blanked out of his mind all 
he really remembered was being having a restless night and uh being repulsed by the ufo subject 
and kind of ignored the few flashbacks of light filling the room and someone screaming in the 
hallway until he heard about what mike and the others had recalled so there are 
six witnesses right there to this incident uh mike's wife gina elected not to go under hypnosis 
so we don't have any testimony from her however other people had started to contact yvonne smith 
and said that they had experiences on that night while attending the conference and they weren't in 
the village inn they were in another hotel or other hotels actually I was able to interview 
one of these witnesses who I called patrick and he was in another hotel and had a visitation on that 
evening which he doesn't consciously recall other than waking up the next morning and he had a mark 
on a very intimate part of his body a triangular shaped kind of bruise which healed very quickly 
but it was a very strong and obvious indication that he had had an experience and it turned 
out his roommate had also had an experience his roommate elected not to be interviewed 
but yvonne smith was later contacted by even more witnesses including melinda leslie a very 
well-known abductee who had almost completely forgotten that she was even at the conference 
but did recall being taken on board and seeing other people on board this craft in chairs laid 
out on tables being physically examined and other things she's one of the few people who 
does remember actually being taken on board and yvonne smith goes into this in her investigation 
on the case uh so yeah this is a very interesting case there was another abductee jesse long 
who was apparently abducted on that evening even though he wasn't at the conference but 
may have been abducted into the same object or taken there very hard to say it's a very complex 
case with all kinds of levels to it and yeah I was there I was just a couple of thousand feet away 
i don't remember anything unusual about that night uh neither does anyone in the home that I was uh 
staying at uh but i'm sure that there are other witnesses to this case and yvonne smith has done 
an enormous amount of research into this case I uh was kind of a late comer and was drawn 
into it by mike evans who was very very eager to get this information out as soon as possible 
and as I said we did write a book together on this called the coronado island ufo incident and yvonne 
smith of course wrote an excellent book highly recommended on this case called coronado in which 
she goes into quite a bit more depth in terms of like the on-board experiences and some of the 
other witnesses beyond the original six including mike and gina nancy and lacey and nancy's brother 
phil and his wife so yeah I would definitely recommend that book it's got some incredible 
revelations uh into this case including the possibility that bill clinton the president of the 
united states may have also apparently according to a source she was contacted by an unnamed source 
told her that president clinton had also been abducted as had two of his secret service agents 
so if true I mean that's an incredible revelation and appears to be connected to all of this uh and 
i think that's what makes this case so profound so important and so strange I mean was this a display 
of power in front of uh our government was this a my lab a military abduction is there some element 
of mind control going on here was this abduct abduction observed by our military I find it hard 
to believe looking at where this took place that our military was not aware of it on some level 
just because coronado island there's no way that this could have gone unnoticed unless 
the et's have a very very advanced technology which allows them to do this which does seem 
to be possible because we do know abductions can happen anywhere out of moving vehicles 
out of planes trains boats while scuba diving crowded condominiums hotels uh yeah i've got other 
i've got an abduction case which took place out of the marriott hotel uh in woodland hills california 
so I guess it's entirely possible and again following this incident mike did have more 
experiences which he did was able to recall under hypnosis interestingly he started seeing praying 
mantis et's after this incident which he had never seen before he did recall how he had 
gotten some of these bruises and puncture wounds particularly this massive bruise on his arm he 
recalled from that incident that there was this metal plate which had been placed over his arm 
which apparently caused this bruise and what's interesting about this case is it's not only a 
multiple witness case and not only to take place in a location that's truly bizarre and unlikely 
but it involves a number of amazing physical effects physical evidence physiological 
effects that are very hard to ignore and I think conclusively prove that this case did happen both 
mike and nancy suffer from fluish effects flu-like symptoms so that's important I think uh 
they both felt these effects immediately following the incident and not only had did mike have all these bruises and puncture wounds and a high blood pressure attack and a hole in his ear 
he was able to get some mris after discovering that he was apparently implanted 
during this incident he arranged to have some magnetic resonance imaging taken of his head 
of his brain and these mris showed what were diagnosed as foreign bodies 
these little opaque possibly metallic bb like objects which are in various strategic locations 
in his brain which might be connected like to his emotions his visual cortex uh these sort of things 
and uh they showed up on his mris the doctors told him that uh they do see these things occasionally 
they don't know what they are but they uh one told him that they he would diagnose these as 
foreign bodies uh mike was at the time friends with dr roger lear the date the late dr roger 
leader who is well known for for removing implants but because these were in his brain 
there was certainly no possibility of these being removed but certainly is very intriguing 
evidence to say the least as far as phil uh yeah we've already discovered he had that horrible 
multi-body infection uh after one encounter so that's incredible physical evidence perhaps not 
linked to the coronado incident but linked to one of his encounters uh let's see lacey she's also 
had some really incredible physical evidence that I think confirms the veracity of her encounters 
she's woken up with some pretty severe cuts and bruises and puncture wounds 
she has this mark this small triangular mark on her hand that seems to be chronic it looks like 
a burn it looks like it's inflamed and painful it's not painful but it's always there and uh she 
found out it does in fact fluoresce under a black light that's strange and her e.t contacts told her 
at one time that it's a genetic card a genetic marking of some kind 
following her abductions you know one time she was being abducted so often 
her health really began to suffer and she did have to go to the doctor she was suffering from severe 
allergies to just about everything and so yeah her health has definitely suffered from all of this 
at one point uh she had something very interesting happen 
she decided to take a hearing test and on the computer and uh her whole family and herself 
were very surprised when her hearing was off the charts I mean it was very excellent hearing 
and rated I mean she had the hearing equivalent of a german shepherd she could hear very very high 
tones very high beeping tones so that was strange and she connects that to all of this 
so definitely some very interesting physiological effects from all this perhaps the most interesting and compelling being what happened to nancy following the 
coronado island ufo incident about a week or two afterwards she noticed the scoop mark on her leg 
and I was very intrigued by it because she knew it hadn't been there before and when things began to 
come out about what had happened on that night she connected it to this incident she believes 
she got it on that night and uh being friends with dr roger leer as mike was mike was actually 
he had participated in some of the implant removal surgeries that dr roger lear had done
and when dr roger lear found out that nancy had had this experience and she pointed out she had 
the scar dr roger lear was really interested because he had another client who he calls doris 
who not only had the same scar but it was on the same place on her body and she also had a history 
of experiences and believed she was implanted and dr roger lear had removed his implant from 
doris and it was this small cantaloupe looking cantaloupe seed looking object and uh nancy agreed 
to have her implant removed and had images taken of her leg and there was in fact an object 
present in the images and had this object removed by dr roger leer 
and it looked identical in appearance to that which was removed from the other client 
doris and i'll just quote dr roger leer here briefly as roger lear says 
the results of the sir dr roger lear uses the pseudonym annie for nancy and as dr roger leer 
says the results of the surgeries on annie and doris each revealed a little round ball 
of grayish white material found deep within the tissues but attached to the underside of the skin 
and each of these implants and the others showed many strange properties one being that there was 
no foreign body reaction normally when there's a foreign body the object is surrounded by calcium 
produced by the body to protect it that did not happen in these cases also the blood vessels uh 
in this tissues in this area showed evidence of being completely destroyed again no foreign body 
reaction no inflammation of the tissues except there was a weird inflammation of the tissues 
uh in the blood vessels themselves and they appeared to be exposed to some sort of ultra 
violet light which was very hard to explain again they were the same appearance as other 
objects and just all kinds of strange properties some of the other implants not necessarily nancy's 
were apparently composed of metals meteorotic iron there was one in a couple of implants that 
were magnetic one implant actually gave off some sort of electromagnetic signature so the implants 
uh yeah very very interesting and I think kind of smoking gun evidence interestingly immediately 
following this implant removal surgery it was just a few days maybe a week later nancy was visited 
again and apparently re-implanted nancy says she will not be having any more her implants removed 
and uh yeah following this incident all these witnesses continue our experience 
including mike evans uh mike says all of his experiences have been pretty cut and dry 
physical examinations in which they take reproductive material 
they're mostly interested in just physically examining him he hasn't gotten any special messages nancy did you have experiences as did uh the others phil lacey and uh the others
and uh haven't you know they hasn't been particularly pleasant for them 
and today they've pretty much dropped out of the spotlight pulled away from the spotlight 
they don't want any attention they don't want to be contacted they pretty much uh 
have pulled out of the whole ufo scene and are just trying to live normal lives which I totally respect and understand because this has got to be 
pretty difficult to deal with but i'm very glad they did agree to be interviewed and did allow 
you know this information to come out because I think it's an important case and uh not only 
i mean it's got such interesting elements first again that's being held at the time of 
a ufo conference which by the way was a triad ufo conference funded by billionaire robert bigelow 
also unusual is being held on coronado island which is very densely populated 
also unusual it's that it's a navy island it's unusual that it was the subduction took place 
right basically in front of the home of maurice larry lawrence one of the richest 
men in the united states the owner of the hotel del coronado a very strong clinton donor and the 
very home where clinton was staying literally the next day so that is just mind-blowing to me 
that's a very very unusual element to this case it's also unusual that so many people were taken 
so i'm not sure what the meaning behind this entire coronado island ufo incident 
is but it's definitely a very profound case and that's what this presentation is about 
thanks once again for watching and keep having fun
