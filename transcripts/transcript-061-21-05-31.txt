UNIDENTIFIED SUBMERSIBLE OBJECTS: FIVE USO CASES WITH HIGH STRANGENESS
May 31, 2021

Summary:
May 31, 2021
Unidentified Submersible Objects! UFOs aren't only flying around in our skies. They are also 
swimming around in our oceans, in our lakes and other bodies of water, perhaps in large numbers. 
A UFO becomes a USO the instant it hits the water and disappears beneath the surface. 

What are USOs doing in our oceans? How many of them are there? Where are they going and why are 
they down there? Until recently, there hasn't been very much research into USO activity. Now, 
however, there are hundreds of documented cases.

This video presents five USO cases involving high strangeness, including:

--Four teenagers encounter a USO in Lake Hamilton, Arkansas and experience an episode of missing 
time.

--A young couple boating on Lake Miccosukee in Florida watch a UFO dive into the water and head 
straight for them, underwater.

--A married couple vacationing in the Bahamas find themselves targeted by a massive USO which 
swims directly under their boat.

--A man and woman walking along the California coast in Mendocino see a UFO dive into the water, 
and then later, watch it rise up and fly away.

--Three people attending a dinner party in Aptos, California watch a USO emerge from the ocean, 
fly over to the local Moss Landing power plant, and then do something which leaves them all speechless.

USOs are being seen all over our planet. It's time we start investigating these strange accounts 
and learn what secrets are hidden beneath the surface of our oceans, lakes and rivers.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the  paranormal today's episode I call unidentified submersible objects five uso cases with high 
strangeness i've investigated many cases of usos these objects are not only flying around in our 
skies but al also in our oceans and for that matter in our lakes and rivers and I think it's 
important people know that that's why I wanted to do this video and i've picked five cases that 
i think have something unique or interesting to contribute to our understanding of this phenomenon 
so let's just dive right in first case I want to talk about I call a uso in lake hamilton 
lake hamilton is a rather large lake it's located just outside of hot springs arkansas 
and this case occurred in 1952 to a gentleman i'll just call  mark that's not his real name but uh he does not want to be identified and so I used a pseudonym 
so if his friend hadn't begged him mark would never have gone to the lake  on this one summer night but he did go and his life would never be the same mark was about 16 
years old at the time and his friend randy that's also a pseudonym was practically begging him to 
go to lake hamilton with him on this particular night randy had a problem he was dating a girl 
tina and had asked her if she would go with him on her family's 16-foot speedboat 
to cruise the lake she agreed but only on one condition that she could bring along her 
friend natalie and that randy brought a friend along so that they could sort of have a double 
date randy immediately gr agreed and turned to his friend mark to come along on the date and
join them on the speedboat mark however wasn't really interested in natalie as a girlfriend but 
after much persuasion by randy he finally agreed and only on one condition uh that he could drive 
the boat so randy and his girlfriend tina agreed because they wanted to be alone in the back of 
the boat anyway so it was around 7 00 p.m that mark and randy randy's girlfriend tina and her 
friend natalie all boarded the 16 foot ski boat and pulled away from the dock for the next hour 
they cruised around lake hamilton it's about a 10 mile wide lake with many little sort of inlets and 
finally at around 8 pm it started to get dark and mark pulled up to the middle of a large 
isolated bay they were about 50 yards or so from the shore and still in a deeper section of the 
lake they cut off the motor to the boat and as far as they could tell they were totally alone on the 
lake they certainly couldn't see any other boats so randy and tina were in the back of the boat 
and now that it was dark and quiet they kind of curled towards each other and began  smooching and meanwhile mark and natalie did their best to ignore them and kind of talked awkwardly 
about trivial subjects and less than five minutes passed before something very strange happened as 
mark says in a quote you know how a submarine makes a gurgling sound like in the movies 
well we started to hear this gurgling sound and it was pretty loud natalie asked what is that noise 
mark said I don't know and started looking around for the source of this noise 
randy and tina were in the back of the boat peeled themselves off of each other and began 
looking around for the source of this noise  natalie kept repeating what is that you know what is that noise and mark could see that she and tina 
were both starting to get kind of scared and mark just kept saying I don't know I don't know what 
it is they were all looking for the source of this noise which was getting louder and louder 
suddenly they discovered what the source of this noise was and they could hardly believe their eyes 
as mark says all of a sudden right beside the boat something started coming out of the lake 
it started coming up and it broke the water I could see that it was black and it was round 
was probably 25 to 30 feet in diameter there were no lights and I heard no noise but this 
gurgling noise and it came up right next to the boat I could have reached out and touched it 
at this point the girls started screaming what is it what is it and mark and uh his 
friend randy just stared at this black object trying to figure out what it could possibly be 
mark's first thought was that it might be a sunken boat dock that had just spontaneously risen 
from the bottom of the lake at that time botox were sometimes constructed using 55 
gallon barrels tied together with boards nailed over them uh but it was pretty clear to him that 
this was not a boat dock as he says it looked to me like a black saucer it was tapered in the 
middle it went up a little bit higher this object rose about three maybe four feet out of the water 
and was easily twice the size of their boat and up until this point mark wasn't feeling any fear 
but the girls were very terrified and were screaming let's get out of here get out of here 
let's get out of here and randy was also screaming at mark to start the boat so mark didn't hesitate 
any longer he turned on the ignition and jammed the accelerator at a high speed and to his shock 
the boat would not move it was only then that he started to feel a little fear as he says 
i started the boat and I jammed it wide open it just sat there and it wouldn't go like something 
was holding it it just felt like it was tied to a dock so at this point the boat engine was revved 
at full blast and the boat just would not move all four of them were screaming at this point 
something weird happened there was a shift they became disoriented they lost track of time 
and as mark says the next thing I remember we were about 200 maybe 300 yards down the lake 
going 50 miles per hour the boat was purposing like crazy and everybody was still screaming 
mark says all of them were quote scared to death the boat was heading straight for a pole sticking 
up out of the water mark swerved the boat and stopped and everyone slowly stopped screaming 
and tried to gather their weights none of them had any idea what had just happened 
mark steered the boat towards his girlfriend's house or you know towards natalie's house uh 
where the dock was and it took them about 15 minutes uh to return and pull the boat into its 
little uh stall there they went inside and got another shock it was now already after midnight 
tina's parents were absolutely furious they screamed at the boys to get out of the boat 
get into the house and ushered the girls into the bedroom parents were not interested in hearing 
any explanation neither from the boys or the girls they told the boys leave now or we are 
going to call the police so mark and randy didn't need any convincing and they just went straight 
home following this incident the subject kind of became taboo none of them wanted to talk about it 
mark tried to tell a few adults but each of them just kind of laughed him off thought he was just 
a teenage boy messing around with girls and so he put the experience behind him and lived his life 
he wanted to talk about it but strangely he wasn't able to because shortly following this incident 
randy and the two other girls all moved out of town and as the years passed mark often thought 
about this incident I was particularly puzzled by this missing time aspect and estimates that 
they lost about four hours of time while they were on this lake hamilton it was about 20 years later 
in the early 1970s that mark was in the local department store when he was shocked to come 
upon his old best friend randy and after saying hello and talking a little bit uh randy actually 
brought it up he says do remember that thing we saw coming out of lake hamilton that night 
and mark says yeah I do remember it and randy nodded and the conversation moved on there didn't 
seem to be much else to say and it was just a few years later that randy unfortunately tragically 
contracted his cancer and passed away so mark had lost his a good friend and one of the few people 
who might be able to answer what happened on that night and it was following that that his curiosity 
con continued to consume him and he thought he's gonna try and contact these other two witnesses 
it was in 1975 that mark heard about the two men in pascagoula charlie hixson and calvin parker 
who had had an experience while fishing where a ufo landed them landed right next to them 
and they also experienced missing time they recalled being taken on board the craft 
and mark really began to wonder did this happen to him and if so what did the aliens do 
as mark says I remember the fisherman in mississippi that kind of made me think 
but I can't remember a thing of what happened i've tried and tried but there's a blank there 
nothing it's just strange that something could happen like that and there's nothing to explain 
anything the memory loss is really the thing to me because I can't remember anything about it 
it's just a blank I don't know what happened in those hours it's like they didn't exist 
like you have an operation and you can't remember anything it just happened that quickly i've heard 
they can make you forget everything if you're captured by one well something sure happened so 
mark started to read about ufos at that time there wasn't a whole lot written on the subject 
but by the 1990s there was and mark learned that a lot of people had had this kind of experience 
and used hypnosis to recover their memories and he started seriously thinking about going 
under hypnosis he also learned that people have strange marks on their body 
he didn't notice anything like that however he read that many people who are experiencers have 
sinus problems and that's certainly true for him as he says i've had two complete sinus operations 
i don't know if that has anything to do with it I wish I could remember something in 2002 
mark retired and he decided he would try to search for the other two witnesses he was easily able to 
locate one of them as he knew she was a nursing student and like mark she was now in her late 60s 
mark introduced himself she remembered him clearly and mark asked her about that night on the lake 
and all she remembered was that they came in very late and her parents were quote 
awful mad mark reminded her about the weird gurgling sound they heard 
and the black saucer-like object them screaming and suddenly missing four hours of time and 
she told him quote I don't remember anything on the lake I don't remember anything about that 
so that upset mark he wasn't able to locate the other witness he's still considering hypnosis 
the only thing that's really stopping him are finances and also as he says i'm kind 
of embarrassed to mention it in front of anybody nobody believes me so I don't say much about it 
he still lives in this area not far from lake hamilton but he never went back to that spot as 
he says i'm going to start fishing in this lake at night this summer i'll be fishing right where 
it happened i'm a little leery about going back to this place at night by myself I don't know if i'll 
go back I don't know so yes this is a very strange uso encounter and one of very few cases that 
i've investigated and really very few that I actually have ever read about in which someone has 
experienced an apparent abduction by a uso while he doesn't remember actually going on board it's 
pretty clear from the missing time that there's more to this this experience than he recalls 
so yeah that's the first case I wanted to share with you and now let's move to the second case 
which is equally strange and I call this uso encounter on lake mikasuki lake mikosuki is 
located very close to monticello florida and the main witness in this case is a gentleman by the 
name of wade bentley and this incident incident occurred in the fall of 2007 when wade and his 
girlfriend decided to take his minn kota kayak out on the lake this is a pretty large lake 17 
500 acres it's located in jefferson county and it's a large swampy prairie lake 
uh not very deep it's often filled with lily pads covering a large part of the surface so they are 
out there on this evening in the fall of 2007 uh just watching the stars and enjoying the solitude 
there was only one other boat within view uh it was uh several hundred yards away from them 
uh they could see that that the only person on that other boat was an old black man 
who was fishing for perch he was about 300 yards to the southwest and at this point they saw 
something very strange uh it looked at first they thought it was a helicopter coming west 
over the lake sending down a beam of light like a searchlight but as they watched this searchlight 
suddenly shined towards their direction dropped down to the level of the water and started heading 
north now at this point this light was several miles away when without warning it 
darted towards the old man's boat and dove into the water disappearing beneath it wade and his 
girlfriend were completely shocked uh strangely the old man didn't react at all and just kept 
on fishing and as they were discussing uh what had just happened they could see that this light 
was moving as wade says the light now under water took off south east just to the point of 
pine island three miles away then popped up like a periscope shining the brightest and 
tightest spotlight I have ever seen by now we were praying and that light focused on us I was 
holding my breath as it dropped underwater and in three seconds it rushed at us and disappeared 
under our boat we were calling on jesus at this point all of this happened in about 30 seconds 
at this point uh wade became somewhat confused and disoriented as his girlfriend because suddenly 
this uso and the fishing boat with the old man in it were both gone and as wade says the old 
man had disappeared and now a bass boat with two men nearly rammed us literally out of nowhere 
i pulled a 357 a magnum revolver revolver on them hammer back face to face and screamed for them to 
back off they did not see us or react whatsoever they just faded off so that was really strange 
and wade and his girlfriend were very confused and very concerned they headed immediately for 
sure and were physically shaking as they docked their kayak so they have no explanation for how 
this fisherman who was right near them disappeared and how this other boat suddenly appeared uh right 
next to them and actually nearly rammed their boat uh while still failing to even see them 
so this was very strange this was not wade's first ufo experience throughout the month of august 1988 
he and many other people in the area were observing multiple ufos on a nearly nightly basis 
these objects were sometimes dozens in number appeared very much like the object he and his 
girlfriend had seen on the lake that was years earlier regarding this 2007 encounter 
wade remains convinced that it was a genuine uso as he says and I quote ninety percent of this lake 
is less than five feet deep and covered in lily pads I don't see how an object with a physical 
body can move at these speeds above and below the surface and through thick aquatic foliage 
much less with no sound whatsoever it was moving a mile or more per second and it seemed to have an 
intelligence about it when I spoke of it it shined our way and came not once but twice 
there is no doubt in my mind my heart and soul and spirit that it was being intelligently controlled 
or driven so it sounds to me like wade and his girlfriend probably had missing time 
just judging from the fact that they were directly targeted by this ufo this uso it shined a beam 
of light on them the black man in the boat disappeared and there was another boat there 
they had some disorientation with time these are all red flags pointing towards the strong 
probability I think that there's more to this this experience than they can consciously recall 
hard to say but it is what it is it's a very strange encounter and I wanted to include it 
because it shows how these objects are able to maneuver at very high speeds not only in the sky 
but under water and in very shallow water for that matter they must have some sort of force field 
that allows them to move in and out of the water hard to say but definitely a very interesting case 
another case i'd like to talk to you about um I call a uso in the bahamas uh this gentleman 
who I will call dean he doesn't want his real name used contacted me because of my research into usos 
it's not a lot of information out there and so he wanted to talk to someone who might  have some information that could explain what he saw while he was out boating with his wife 
they had actually decided to take their boat he's an avid sailor from their home in jacksonville 
florida to the abacos islands in the bahamas and i'd actually just like to let dean tell his story 
in his own words because he gave a really lucid interview and it's really quite an interesting 
encounter this is actually very near or part of the bermuda triangle so that might be significant 
because this is an area of very high levels of strangeness and ufo uso activity so i'll just let 
dean describe in his own words what happened this is dean talking in august of 1984 after completing 
a month-long cruise in the abacos islands of the bahamas we were on our 30-foot sailboat 
sailing from walker k bahamas to jacksonville florida we were about 19 miles off of daytona 
florida I was at the helm and my wife was sitting up with me in the cockpit keeping me company seas 
were calm with a light breeze there was no moon and the water was extremely clear I would estimate 
there was at least 100 feet visibility we were on a course of 310 degrees at about three knots 
at about 1am I noticed a green colored beam of light sweeping under the water under the boat 
from right to left this was followed by another and another sweep of light under the water at 
regular intervals this went on for a while and the beams kept sweeping under the boat 
as time went on the beams grew stronger and more well-defined and after about 15 minutes after we 
first noticed light beams on the water a large green object passed directly under our boat on 
a course of about 300 degrees the object was round about a hundred to 150 feet in diameter 
and had spokes of green light radiating from it rotating counterclockwise and bright 
lights around the mid diameter after the object passed under the boat we saw the beams of light 
now sweeping from left to right for at least 20 minutes before we could no longer make them out 
there is no way I can tell you what we saw but it was real I have seen submarines and I can  tell you this was not a sub dean felt like this object was actually targeting his boat because 
it came right for them and actually passed directly underneath their boat 
at a slight angle traveling at about 15 knots which is you know three times their own speed 
and as dean says by the laws of chance for it to go directly under my boat 
it's pretty thin I feel like it came by to take a look neither he nor his wife felt any fear 
uh during this incident they were mostly curious curious there was no apparent effect on their boat 
this object they estimate was just a hundred feet below them they did have a depth finder 
but they didn't want to go down below to look at it and miss the view of this fantastic object 
as dean says this thing was vastly bigger than my boat and it had an inner ring of lights shining 
but the outer ring had spokes of lights and it was all one kind of green hue when it 
went under my boat it had spokes radiating in all directions I didn't count them but 
i was in awe of this situation and it was these strange beams of light that impressed him the most 
because they seemed to stretch for hundreds and a feet under water uh as dean does not 
think that this was any type of phosphorescent fish or jellyfish or I mean it clearly wasn't 
he had seen phosphorus and fish on many occasions as he says 
the waters in that area are teeming with light emitting plankton i've always thought the energy 
emitted by the object was disturbing the plankton and perhaps that was the cause of the light spokes 
but he's certain that the plankton itself was not the cause of the object itself as dean says 
the round object had a brighter glow than I think could have been achieved by plankton  and this circular array of lights was definitely not plankton so he can only speculate what he 
and his wife saw it was clearly a structured object they heard no sound it didn't affect 
their boat in any way they did not have a missing time that they're aware of but they 
are absolutely convinced this was not anything normal not a submarine or any kind of conventional 
c-craft it was a u-s-o a very strange case and that's why I wanted to include it here 
and now let's move to the case number four which I call a uso off the coast 
of mendocino this is a very interesting case because it's one of very few cases i've researched 
in which the witnesses observed the object coming down out of the sky and into the water 
and then coming out of the water and into the sky so clearly not a plane and clearly not a submarine 
we do not have any flying submarines officially at least and as you hear 
uh this gentleman's account it's clear that he did not see a submarine or a flying submarine 
this took place again off the coast of mendocino which is in northern california 
and it occurred on the evening of july 9th 1981. I call the witness davey that's not his real name 
but davey and his wife were staying in a hotel located along the bay uh this is at fort bragg 
actually and they were walking outside the hotel watching the coast when they saw something amazing 
as davey told me and I quote it was dusk as we watched a large green fluorescent orb 15 to 20 
feet in diameter come from the east over land out over the bay and slowly descend into the water 
we just thought weird and they continued their walk and to their shock they actually 
saw this thing exit the water just a short time later as the witness says about 10 
to 15 minutes later we were just about to go back into the hotel when this same craft 
came up out of the water and steadily rose back upward and eastward until out of sight 
at this point all the hair on my body stood up so that's a significant detail these crafts do 
sometimes emit some sort of perhaps gravitational or electric or magnetic field around them and uh 
this witness davy could actually feel the effect of this field on his skin it made all his hair 
stand on end so this is a very interesting case for a couple of reasons yeah an 
object going into the water scooting around doing whatever it's doing down there and then 
coming out and flying off clearly not a normal object it's a briefcase but a very unusual case 
which is why I wanted to include it here so these four cases I uh I presented in my book 
undersea ufo base an in-depth investigation into uso activity in the santa catalina channel 
as I said i've investigated a lot of cases involving usos and i've cove 
presented most of them in that book including these four cases but this next case that I want 
to talk about is really why I wanted to do this video it's one of the most unusual uso 
cases i've ever heard in my life i've never heard of anything like this before or since 
this case is presented in my new book wondrous 25 true ufo encounters and I think it deserves to be 
widely known because it's wow what a strange case I call this case uso encounter at moss landing 
now the main witness is joy williams and at the time of this incident she was 45 years old 
it was a warm august evening in 1997 and joy and her husband tom had decided to have dinner with 
their friend emily that's a pseudonym but joy and tom did allow their real names to be used 
so their friend emily had this beautiful home that overlooked monterey bay in california this is 
where moss landing is the home is actually located in aptos which is about a quarter mile from the 
bay and it's perched high in the hills and affords a fantastic view of the bay so they ate dinner 
that evening and afterwards joy decided to step out onto the veranda to enjoy the fresh air and 
the beautiful view everything looked normal she was just looking at the ocean and uh she noticed 
this weird bright yellow green glow in the water maybe a quarter mile offshore it was well inside 
the northern edge of the bay and for the next few minutes this glow slowly brightened and then to 
joy's utter amazement this gigantic egg-shaped object began to rise from the water as joy says 
it was huge it was really big and as it was coming out I could see all the kelp slipping off of it 
it rose out slowly joy immediately called for her husband tom and her friend emily to look at this 
and all three of them watched it in amazement was immediately apparent to all of them that this was 
something very unusual joy herself was actually a military brat had grown up on 
military bases and was quite familiar with all kinds of strange aircraft and she had never seen 
anything like this as she says we were staring at it with our jaws slack and then it started to move 
at this point the conversation between them became pretty animated they kept asking you  know what is it what could this be there was no sound that they could hear the object was 
a good half mile away but if it was a plane they should have been able to hear it 
this object after rising upwards out of the water moved slowly north sort of skirting the shoreline 
and it appeared to be following a very deliberate path uh emily at this point 
remembered that she had a telescope uh it's already set up right there on the veranda 
so they quickly rushed to the telescope and looked at this thing joy was the first 
and as joy says and I quote when we looked at it through the spy glass we could see portholes all 
around the center of it joy estimates that there was about a dozen visible portholes 
all of them elliptically shaped and they were alternating green and amber in color 
so as they watched it this object continued moving slowly towards the north it took about 20 minutes 
while this object just sort of moved lazily along  and it was heading directly for the moss landing coal power plant and after about 
20 minutes this object stopped right next to the smokestacks of this power plant at moss landing 
this object was so close to the smokestacks that the light from this object actually 
illuminated the smokestacks themselves now we know that these smokestacks rise about 500 feet 
and this object was hovering immediately next to the openings of these smokestacks and so 
they knew that this object had to be at least 50 feet across so by this point they were absolutely 
convinced that they were seeing a genuine ufo or uso tom seemed to take the experience in stride 
joy herself she felt slightly nervous and wondered if the occupants of this object 
realized that they were being observed and emily actually who owned the home was the most upset 
of the three of them as joyce says it was a little scary to be honest it disturbed me it's a hard 
emotion to express it made me feel like I wasn't in control a bit intimidated because I almost 
felt like it knew I was watching it and here's where things went from strange to absolutely 
bizarre what happened next left them all stunned this gigantic metallic arm emerged from the side 
of the craft farthest from the smokestacks this arm extended over then bent upwards over the 
craft itself and then bent downwards it was hinged and the end of this arm contained a giant pair of 
pincers which now began to dig inside the opening of the smokestacks as joy says I don't know what 
it was doing but it had these long pincers on it and it looked like it was collecting something 
it was just hovering right next to the power plant and it did that for about 20 minutes 
we couldn't stop looking at it because it was just so bizarre we were stunned like what is this thing 
they continued to talk excitedly among themselves this area was fairly well populated 
and they thought to themselves other people should be seeing this this is going to be front page news 
of course it wasn't they checked the newspapers the next day there was nothing in the papers about 
this but this craft was huge and quite bright and at the time they thought for 
sure they were not the only witnesses I think there probably were other witnesses but nobody 
perhaps reported it but the strangest thing about this thing was this weird metallic arm for 
one thing why was it coming out of the far end of the object that was weird the arm itself extended 
practically twice the length of the craft and the pincers alone had to be at least 20 feet 
long tom also saw all of this clearly as tom says in his own words my first memory of seeing this 
thing hovering in the sky was between us and the power plant I didn't see it come out of the water 
it had an arm on it in several lights there was a telescope and once we had a good look at it we 
saw this definite arm and a couple of different colored lights the thing itself was kind of a 
golden yellow color and it hovered in the sky for quite some time finally I called the police 
at first the officer was very receptive and friendly and he listened to both joy and tom 
describe what they were seeing and the moment it became clear however that they were describing 
an apparent ufo the officer's attitude changed 180 degrees it was like a switch being turned 
off they said this officer now began to just dismiss their testimonies completely 
and told them quote it's probably just a fishing boat tom said in the middle of the sky and joy 
who was on the other line said fishing boats don't fly this definitely came up out of the water and 
they told him that the object was still there right next to the smokestacks at moss landing 
but the officer absolutely refused to listen as joyce says it didn't seem to make any 
difference to him and as time says he said it was probably this or that we didn't get much help 
so this officer was not the least bit receptive and awkwardly they all ended 
the call this object was still hovering there and after about a total of 20 minutes 
this object without warning suddenly just winked out they did not see it move away it did not 
slowly fade away suddenly it was there and then it wasn't in a split second it was gone so this ended 
their dinner party and joy and tom said goodbye to emily and drove nervously home as joyce says 
my husband and I were both pretty shaken up by watching it because it was just so strange 
and tom agrees as tom says that's why we're still talking about it years later emily 
was still upset and she refused to discuss it ever again joy however could not let the experience go 
she knew it was an important case a very unusual case she wanted people to know about it 
and that there were strange objects hiding in monterey bay which joy pointed out 
is known for having some very deep trenches in fact it's the deepest trench along the 
north american coast it's quite deep in fact joy called the local radio station 
and they told her that they had not received any reports she called linda moulton howe 
some years later and shared the sighting with her and actually also made a report to mufon 
20 years after the incident 2018 she submitted a written report to mufon unknown to joy however 
that was not the only sighting that had taken place at moss landing in fact moss landing had 
encounters both before and after the incident that joy her husband tom and emily observed 
so uh five years earlier in fact one evening around 10 p.m in november of 1992 a former 
u.s army officer who is in anonymous was working as a security supervisor 
he was on patrol and driving by the power plant and as this officer says and I quote 
as I approached the moss landing bridge I saw a flash above the power plant's east cooling tower 
i pulled off the road on the north side of the bridge I exited the car and observed a blue white 
orb it traveled at a uniform height of a 100 feet or about 20 feet above the tower as the orb passed 
over the towers there was a series of three bursts that came from the orb something fell from the orb 
trailing white smoke the object moved due west out over the ocean through a clear starry sky 
until it vanished from sight the officer continued on his patrol when about one hour later 
he was again approaching the power plant when he saw yet another glowing orb as he says 
i saw a blue white orb about the size of a basketball moving due east at about a 
hundred feet it was coming in from the ocean at about 30 miles per hour he watched it move 
inland towards the south and disappeared and that night he says the local radio station 
did receive a number of reports of ufos but discounted them as meteorites but it's clear 
from this officer's description that what he was observing at least were not meteorites 
and there were still more sightings it was actually several years later on and after 
joy and tom williams sighting that there was another encounter at moss landing 
this was on thanksgiving day 2006. two friends were walking along the beach at moss landing 
and as one of them says and I quote them directly I noticed an oval white light in 
the sky near the power plant shortly after I saw the same object about a mile offshore 
i watched it appear suddenly remain stationary for a few seconds then zip up and over a few hundred 
yards and then again in the other direction it disappeared suddenly then reappeared further away 
this witness happened to be a photographer and quickly got his camera ready and snapped 
a couple of photos which I was not able to get a hold of unfortunately but as the witness says 
it appears on the photos and negatives very clearly and is not a camera or developing 
error so there's something about this power plant that is attracting ufos or usos 
and certainly this is not unique ufos are known for hovering over power plants 
but uh in this particular case it's quite uh dramatic and ongoing and in fact there were 
more encounters it was five years later on january 28 2011 when there was another witness 
to an encounter in this same area a woman was shopping at a store nearby watsonville when she 
saw two orbs several thousand feet high glowing with about 10 times the brilliance of venus 
she said so quite bright both orbs slowly faded she says and moved out towards the ocean 
and she estimates that these objects were hovering get this directly over moss landing 
and there's yet another sighting uh just a few years later four years later in july of 2015 
several witnesses observed multiple glowing red orbs about five miles off the coast of moss 
landing the objects hovered and were moving about in the same general area for more than an hour 
at one point they noticed one of these objects emitting beams of light towards the ocean 
and as the witness says and I quote it appears as though  the ocean's surface was being illuminated by a moving floodlight
so clearly there's something going on here if is the most landing power plant attracting 
ufos uh yeah I think it probably is because it wouldn't be the first such case like this 
and as I mentioned earlier there are many other cases in which uh ufos have been attracted to 
say nuclear power stations uh copper smelting plants factories uh dams and other power plants 
but what makes this case so bizarre and unique is the fact that it came up out of the water for 
one thing and that it had this huge arm that came out of the object on the end of which 
was this gigantic pair of pincers which was scratching on the inside of the the smokestacks 
so i'm guessing i'm purely speculating here that it was taking material to measure 
the pollution or whatever was coming out of these smoke stacks because this does seem to be one 
of the ufo occupants main concerns is our disregard for earth's environment and the way 
we are polluting our planet this is something they warn many many contactees about so perhaps that's 
what they were doing just measuring the levels of pollution coming out of the moss coal power plant 
so whatever this thing was joy and tom williams are absolutely convinced that this was a genuine 
uso or ufo as joyce says and I quote this happened but we're no closer to knowing what they are 
than we were 40 years ago so again the full accounting of this case appears in my 
brand new book wondrous 25 true ufo encounters the book contains many other really unusual cases 
but I really wanted to share this case because this is just so  strange so unusual and uh yeah one of the most bizarre really uso cases I have ever researched 
so that's the end of this little presentation I hope you've enjoyed it I hope you learned 
something a little bit more about ufos and usos and these strange visitors to our planet 
i want to thank you all for watching I really appreciate it and until next time keep having fun.
