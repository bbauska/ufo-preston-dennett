EIGHT VERY WEIRD ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS
Oct 17, 2025

Summary:
Oct 17, 2025
Onboard UFO encounters represent the cutting edge of UFO research. These cases represent the very 
heart of the UFO phenomenon. They contain more data than any other kind of UFO cases, and they 
have the potential to answer the many questions surrounding this subject. This video presents 
eight exceptionally unusual cases, each of which has received little or no publicity, and each 
which adds to our knowledge of the nature of extraterrestrial contact.

SOMETHING I’LL NEVER FORGET. One hot sunny summer day in 1951, six-year-old Stephanie played in the 
backyard of her home in rural Louisa, Virginia. Suddenly a disc-shaped craft appeared overhead, 
hovered, tilted and landed behind some trees. Stephanie ran inside and told her grandmother who did 
not believe her. Later, as Stephanie sat in her bedroom, she saw two gray aliens in her backyard. 
The next thing she knew, it was 10:00 pm; she was missing ten hours of time. She soon began having 
memories of being inside the craft, looking down on her town from above.

THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING. One night in October 1975, Michael (age 19) woke up to find himself 
floating above his home in Rockville, Maryland, and into a classic metallic flying saucer. Inside, 
he was levitated to a table. He was shocked to see an Air Force military officer in full uniform 
standing next to him, and what appeared to be two doctors. They proceeded to do some kind of 
operation, he believed, on his brain. At some point he blacked out. Waking up the next morning, 
he wondered if it was a dream, but later, hearing other accounts, he became convinced it really 
happened.

I CANNOT REVEAL WHAT I SAW. Gustavo was 19 years old and living in Funchal, Portugal, when his life 
changed forever. Early one morning in December 1977, he was awakened by a flying saucer hovering 
outside his bedroom, filling the room with light and sending him a telepathic message. A few months 
later, he was visited by a female, human-looking ET, and then had a close-up sighting of a disc-
shaped craft. Then, in January 1979, he was taken onboard a craft, given a medical examination, 
and was transported to an alien world.

A WARNING OF THINGS TO COME. In 2019, Gavin began to have weird memories of being taken onboard a 
craft while a young boy in his family’s home in Texas. He soon recalled being floated upwards into 
what appears to be a craft where he was greeted by short human-looking figures who began to show 
him moving images of future calamities on planet Earth. He had forgotten the entire encounter 
until the events he was shown began to happen. Only then did his memory of the encounter return. 
He also recalled finding a strange implant in his body as a teenager.

I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO AFRAID IN ALL MY LIFE. One night in October 1990, Winifred Crause woke up her 
home in The Entrance, New South Wales, Australia, to sense strange beings outside her home. 
Suddenly she found herself on an operating table inside a room surrounded by grays. She felt like 
a bug as the grays were heedless of her protests and roughly examined her. The next morning her 
body was sore. But she also reports a dramatic increase in psychic abilities and soon became a 
world-famous psychic.

YOU DON’T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM US. On the night of March 10, 1996, Morris (a high school 
student from Omaha, Nebraska) was out looking at the Hale-Bopp comet when he saw a strange craft 
hovering nearby. It sent down a beam of light, and a gray alien appeared. He then floated up into 
the craft where he had a telepathic conversation with the grays and was given a tour of the craft 
before being returned. After the encounter, he reports being followed by men in black.

AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF LOVE. On the night of December 15, 2012, Cheryl was asleep in her home in 
Auburn, Alabama when she had an unusual dream (she thought) of being called outside where she was 
greeted by three human-looking figures and taken into a craft. They proceeded to hold a long 
philosophical conversation with her. The next thing she knew, it was morning. She assumed the 
experience must have been a dream until she found a mysterious circle of crushed vegetation in her 
yard.

I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WALL. On the night of June 5, 2015, Dylan woke up in the bedroom of his 
home in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, sensing an intruder. He became paralyzed and was levitated off 
his bed and through the wall, waking up inside a craft. He lay on a table and was being examined 
by a gray alien. He asked to go home, and another gray appeared. Then a third gray appeared, along 
with a hybrid child who had a strange message for him. The next thing Dylan knew, it was morning, 
and he had a strange mark on his body.

Onboard UFO encounters are far more common than previously believed. There are now tens of thousands 
of cases on record, but there are indications they might number in the millions. It’s time that cases 
like these are taken seriously.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. 
Thanks very much for joining me today. I truly appreciate it. I hope all of you are doing well out 
there. I'm very excited about today's episode cuz I'm going to be talking about onboard UFO 
encounters, which is my very favorite aspect of UFO research. I like these cases because 
they contain a lot of information. These are not simple sightings, even landings or face-to-face 
encounters with humanoids. In these cases, people are actually going inside the extraterrestrial 
craft, meeting ETs face-to-face, conversing with them. These cases lie at the very heart, 
the core of the UFO phenomenon. It's these cases that really answer the many questions surrounding 
this subject, such as who these ETs are, where they come from, and why they're here. I think 
these cases represent the cutting edge of UFO research and for that reason alone, they're very 
important. 

So, I've got eight cases for you today. I call this episode eight very weird onboard UFO encounters. 
They come from a wide variety of locations including Australia, Portugal, and six cases inside the 
United States, including Alabama, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia. These cases 
date from 1951 all the way up to 2015. They do involve different types of ETs. There's physiological 
evidence as well. Some landing trace cases and some really interesting psychic effects as well. And 
yeah, these are more obscure cases. I'm guessing you probably haven't heard of any of these. They 
are a little bit different and unique and offbeat. I like these kinds of cases because again, they 
are unusual and have something to offer in terms of helping us to understand what's going on here. 
So, let's just get started. 

First case I'd like to talk about today I call something I'll never forget. That is of course a 
direct quote from the witness. This case was not recalled through hypnosis but rather spontaneously. 
This person did remember this experience shortly after it happened. This occurred in the summer of 
1951. It's a pretty early case and it occurred in the very small town of Louisa, Virginia. And I 
think you'll find this case particularly interesting. Stephanie, that isn't a pseudonym, was only 
six years old when she was taken on board a craft. At the time, she was living in the small town of 
Louisa, Virginia. At that time, the population was only about 500 people. It was a hot, sunny day 
around noon in the summer of 1951. There was hardly any breeze, and Stephanie was playing in her 
front yard. She was waiting for her grandmother to call her in for lunch when a UFO appeared at 
low elevation overhead. 

As Stephanie says, about 50 to 60 ft above me was a saucer-shaped vehicle hovering and spinning. It 
caused all of the leaves on the tree to fold and turn downward as if trying to avoid radiation or 
some sort of emissions. The saucer hovered for about 2 minutes and tilted towards me. At that time, 
it moved away from my yard and landed behind some trees, blocking its view from my house. I ran 
into the house and told my grandmother what I had seen, and she just blew it off. Now, even at that 
age, Stephanie knew that what she had seen was unusual, but she didn't realize that this was just 
the beginning of her encounter. She went into her room and while her grandmother began to prepare 
lunch, it was during this time when she looked outside and saw two strange humanoids. As she says, 
"I was sitting on my bed looking out the window in the back of the house when I saw the two beings 
passing along the outer edge of our yard beyond some peach trees. They were different heights. One 
was half a head shorter than the other. One of them was 5 feet tall and the other about six feet, 
maybe a little less. 

They seemed to be wearing suits which were rouge red in color. They were walking side by side and 
moved out of sight from my window. So, at this point, Stephanie apparently experienced a period of 
missing time because the next thing she knew, as if a switch had been flipped, it was now 10:00 p.m. 
She was missing almost 10 hours of time. And as Stephanie says, my grandmother and I were standing 
in the kitchen in the dark and lunch was still sitting on the counter. When I realized I was home, 
there was dried blood on my legs and feet. So, it wasn't long after this that Stephanie began to 
remember some of what happened during this missing time. Now, she says, "At one point, I know I was 
in the saucer. It had a window and I could see the road below. I think we were over the Blue Ridge 
Mountains which were visible from our house on a clear day. We were hovering above a car traveling 
along a winding mountain road. I was watching the headlights from the car flashing into the woods 
as it went around curves. I think we may have taken them, but I can't remember a lot. I don't 
recall any words ever being spoken, but they showed me lights off in the distance and said that 
was where I lived. I had never been in a plane, so watching that car below me was something I'll 
never forget. 

Now, following this encounter, 
Stephanie didn't think much about it for a long time, but it was about 9 years later at age 15, 
she went to visit a doctor, and this brought her memory back to this strange encounter. This was 
about 6 years after it occurred. And as Stephanie says, I had an exam by a gynecologist and I 
overheard the doctor asking my mother who had done the surgery on me. I had never had surgery or sex. 
I thought back to that night of finding the blood on myself. This has happened more than once, so I 
know they have some sort of tracking device inside my body. I'm now in Florida and they did some sort 
of scanning on me. I have a lot of details. I would even consent to hypnotherapy. I don't mind 
others knowing, but the fact is most don't believe it if you tell them. So Stephanie did report her 
experience to Mufon in 2014, writing, and I quote, "I'm a 68-year-old and I am not a nutcase. I've 
never had any mental problems. I have a friend who is an FBI agent and I gave him the written 
details as well. Thanks for listening." As you can see, the witness is very sincere about her 
experience. And the way she describes it, you can tell it was quite emotional for her. It was a very 
profound experience. And having 10 hours of missing time, it's clear to me she probably 
doesn't recall everything that happened, but she recalls some. 

And again, as she said, this was 
something she never forgot. So, this just goes to show how an experience like this, 
even early in childhood, can affect you for the rest of your life. It's truly amazing. Now, let's 
move to the next case which is equally astonishing and very unusual. It's got some aspects to it that 
are only very rarely reported. I've got more to say about it, but I'll talk about it afterwards 
because I'd like you to make up your own mind about the nature of this case. At any rate, I call 
this one This can't be happening. This occurred one evening in October 1975 in Rockville, 
Maryland. This is a single witness case. He did recall this consciously without the aid of 
hypnosis. I think that's important because there are a lot of skeptics out there who are saying, 
"Oh, onboard cases rest solely on the recall through hypnosis." And that's simply not true. 
So that ca that aspect I should say makes this case really interesting and important and yeah 
as we'll see it's very unusual. 

This onboard encounter was reported by the witness to Newfork 
the national UFO reporting center. He provided his firstirhand written eyewitness testimony starting 
by saying this is something I have only recently been willing to talk about. So, he reported his 
encounter in the hopes of finding other people in the area who might have had a similar experience 
around the same time. The witness is anonymous. I'll call him Michael. He was 19 years old when 
his encounter occurred. It was one evening in October 1975 in his house in Rockville, 
Maryland. As Michael says, I was suddenly aware that I appeared to be outside of my house and 
looking down at my house. I remember seeing the roof of my house and the street below me. I 
appeared to be floating above my house. 

Then I saw the silvery side of a discshaped classic flying 
saucer. I was somehow transported and floated up into a classic silver flying saucer. I clearly 
remember seeing the hall out of the dark where the two ends converge. I was absolutely stunned, 
thinking, "What the? This can't be happening. That is a flying saucer. The thing was parked above our 
house in the dark, but I could see it in the dark. So, the next thing Michael knew, he was actually 
inside the craft. As he says, "At the next instant, I am inside. I see what appears to be an 
American human military man, a United States Air Force officer in full uniform. He had black hair, 
slightly overweight. He seemed a little angry and was yelling at others. I think I may have said 
something to this person and he was mad because I was awake. I seemed to be floated around inside 
what appeared to be the outer perimeter of this craft and placed on some sort of operating table. 
I didn't seem to be walking or I couldn't feel my legs. I was transported to the center of the 
craft and put on a table on my back and doctors surrounded me. Now, up until this point, Michael 
was more astonished and confused than anything else. 

But what happened next did cause him some 
fear. As he says, I had the awareness that they were performing some sort of brain operation. This 
caused me tons of mental and spiritual discomfort, anguish, and fear. I felt that during this time I 
was outside my body and was watching from behind the surgeons. I was incredulous and shocked at 
this experience, wondering at that time, was this really real? Was it really happening? I recalled 
hearing their voices, but I don't know what they were saying. My mind seemed to be cracked open. 
I can hear others conversing, but the words are not understandable. But I can understand their 
communication among themselves. So, this seemed to Michael to go on for a long period of time, 
and the next thing he knew, he was waking up in bed the next morning. He immediately remembered 
what had happened, but was so shocked by his recall that he really didn't know what to think 
of it. As he says, "I knew that there was no way I could ever reveal this to anyone ever. It was just 
too incredible. I was very scared of the whole experience. I was shocked by it all. It all had 
a very unreal feeling about it. But I could not be sure. 

For the next 30 years or so, I would never 
discuss this with a single soul. I was too scared to admit it for anyone would think I was nuts. So, 
although he considered at first that it might have been a dream, he eventually had reasons to believe 
it was real. As Michael says, my condition was not at all what I would call normal. I felt I wasn't 
simply dreaming. It didn't feel like a dream. It had a very real aspect. Yet, I was sort of 
out of touch with what was happening. I felt like a bystander. In a dream state, I seemed to accept 
everything that happens, no matter how bizarre, as real. But in this incident and all during it, 
I was continually rejecting it, thinking this is impossible. This can't be happening. And as each 
level unfolded, I continued to be confounded at the content. In short, I could evaluate, 
which is a higher order of thinking that is beyond dream awareness. 

Now, still, the experience was so 
bizarre that Michael wasn't sure how to process it. At that time, there was very little media 
coverage of this subject. So, he simply put it in the back of his mind and didn't talk about it, 
didn't think about it. But it was years later he picked up the book Communion by Whitley Strieber. 
And reading all the details in that book that sounded much like his own experience, he realized 
that quote, "It may not have been a dream after all and could have been a real experience." 
There was one line he read in the book where Whitley was describing the feeling that ETSs 
may have implanted something in his brain. And for Michael, this was the last straw. As he says, that 
realization that my experience may have been true was almost too much to handle. That solidified for 
me that it may indeed be real. 

After that, I was a wreck for the next year or so, trying to accept 
this as reality. Now, as the subject continued to move into the mainstream media, Michael eventually 
learned to accept what had happened to him, and he was able to talk about it without too much distress. 
Then one day something interesting happened. He came upon the photo of General Curtis 
Lame and was shocked to see that this man looked almost exactly like the man he had seen on board 
the craft, the military officer. So much so that he speculated that they might be one and the same. 
Overall, while the experience was disconcerting and scary at the time, he's now okay with it. 
And as he says, I have since reconciled this. I was apparently unharmed, just a bit freaked out, 
as we say. I wanted to report it officially somewhere so we can go into the record. I 
don't have any recollection of anything like this happening to me before or since. 

I think there are 
some real important takeaways from that case. One is how the witness really struggled to accept what 
was happening to him. Could this have been a dream or was it real? And was he going crazy? These 
are the sort of struggles a lot of witnesses go through following an onboard UFO encounter. It's 
very difficult to process at times, especially if nothing like this has ever happened to you before. 
To me, the most interesting aspect of this case is that he recalls seeing what he believes to 
be a military officer on board, which really raises the possibility that this was a myab, 
a military abduction, not really ETS at all. Very hard to say for sure, but it certainly has some 
of the markers we see with my labs in terms of there being a military officer on board. 
Also interesting to me is that he believes he identified this military officer as Curtis Lame. 
I found that fascinating because Curtis Lame has been implicated as knowing about UFOs. He did come 
up in a prior episode I did. 

So I found that to be a really interesting and unusual detail. I don't 
know if this was a myab or not. You can make up your own mind about it, but it certainly sounds 
like a legitimate case. however you explain it as a genuine ET encounter or something else. And also 
interesting to me is how he got confirmation years later after reading the book Communion. Can't tell 
you how many people I've talked to who picked up that book and were really shaken up because it had 
details or the picture on the cover which really confirmed to them that they were having these 
kinds of encounters. Amazing. So now let's move to the next case. This one's also really unusual 
and this was also recalled consciously without the aid of hypnosis. Very important. I call this one I 
cannot reveal what I saw. That is a direct quote from the witness as we'll soon see. This occurred 
over a period of time and involving several incidents from 1977 to 1979 in Fchaw, Portugal. 
This is on the island of Madera. a pretty small island actually, but pretty heavily populated. And 
this case has some very strange elements to it. One of the most interesting being that the witness 
claims he was taken to the ET's planet. This case comes from researcher Pedro Barbosa, Ph.D., 
who interviewed the witness personally. Pered, the witness was very confident about the reality of 
his experiences. He was honest and related with considerable emotion. 

The witness is anonymous, 
so I've given him the pseudonym Gustavo. He was 19 years old at the time of his encounter and lived 
on the small island of Madera. That's about 286 square miles of area, and he was in the city of 
Fchaw. His first encounter occurred around 5:30 a.m. one morning in December of 1977. As Gustavo 
says, I began to hear a fantastic sound. A light opened up in my room. I looked up and saw a large 
and fantastic flying saucer. Then a voice spoke. It was an extraterrestrial being speaking in 
barely comprehensible Brazilian and said, among other things, "Do not fear death because God 
created terrestrial and extraterrestrial beings with spirit." Her Gustavo during the whole time 
the craft was hovering outside his window, he was completely paralyzed. The episode lasted 
only a few minutes and as the light faded and the craft left, he was able to move. And this turned 
out to be the first of several strange episodes because it was only eight months later in August 
of 1978. He was driving back to Bunchal, east of the city, and he saw a large quote flying saucer 
hovering over the Pinocchulo viewpoint, which you can see here. But it was 5 months later at 5:30 
a.m. one morning in the first week of January 1979 that he says he was visited in his bedroom 
by a human-looking female extraterrestrial. 

As Gustavo says, "I was in my room when I saw an 
extraterrestrial woman who signaled to me with her hand and she smiled and left." So, it was a 
brief experience, but his most amazing encounter happened just a few days later on January 8th, 
1979. He suddenly woke up to find himself standing on the ground in front of a classic flying saucer. 
It had an opening in the center and a ramp extending to the ground. And as Gustavo says, 
it seemed to be made of light. I don't know what it was like. I can't explain it. He climbed up the 
ramp, went into the craft, which he found out was quite large on the inside. And as Gustavo says, 
I saw them again. They took me. The interior was full of buttons and it had windows that looked 
like televisions. The interior was cloud white. In that room were four UFOs. They gave me a gentle 
push to enter. I sat in a chair and when we left, the one speaking to me said, "Take another chair 
in front of the window to see the world and the planet. I saw our world, our planet, from 
a great distance." And I disembarked in another civilization. They spoke to me in English now, 
imperfect, but understandable. I could tell they were learned. 

Now, Gustavo said the ETSs looked 
human and were quote, "Extremely beautiful." He said they wore tight fitting pale yellow jumpsuits 
and darker colored boots. He doesn't really remember anything else from that encounter, 
or if he does, he didn't share it. But on February 8th, he had his final experience and he said it 
was taken to their planet again. As Gustavo says, it is an ultraodern civilization. When 
I entered the other world, their world, I was so impressed that I cannot reveal what I saw. It is 
not appropriate to reveal what I saw. They live a few thousand years ahead of us. They told me 
while I was still on board, "Our planet is very close to yours, Earth, but it takes a long time 
for you to get there." What that means is hard to say, but Gustavo did say that he was given a 
quote medical examination while he was on board the craft. 

As he says, "They checked my health. 
They had something in their hand, round like a little tube, which they passed all over my body. 
The people there seemed to have no illnesses. His onboard encounter lasted, he estimates, about 4 
hours. After he was returned home, he said he felt dizzy, was tingling all over his body, especially 
his face. And he says he was also shivering from the cold. And it was for some time following his 
encounter that he refused to speak about it to anyone because he knew that anyone he told would 
likely consider him a lunatic or insane. I would really love to speak firsthand to this witness 
face to face because I suspect there is a lot more detail to what he experienced. But like many 
people, he initially kept his encounters secret. And who can blame him? 

There's so much gaslighting 
and ridicule and skepticism and confusion and fear surrounding this subject that the vast majority of 
people simply don't talk about it. I'm glad he did come forward and speak to investigators. But yeah, 
I am sure you could write a whole book about what this gentleman experienced. There's not a lot of 
people who claim to have been taken to an ET planet. So that is particularly fascinating. 
I also found it interesting that he says he cannot reveal everything that he saw. It's not clear to 
me whether this is because he simply doesn't have the words to describe it that it was just so out 
of his world view his you know what he knows or if he felt like some of this knowledge should be 
just kept secret. There's a number of cases that do seem to follow this kind of pattern that the 
witnesses don't want to talk about what they saw because it's private for them or they are 
told not to reveal certain bits of information. 

Overall, a pretty fascinating case and yeah, 
I wish I had more detail on it. I wish that with pretty much every case though, I should 
say. Like this next one, I think this next case is absolutely legitimate. It has a lot of the 
details I look for in trying to confirm whether an encounter is real. I call this one a warning 
of things to come. This one occurred in February of 1990 in Texas. And again, this was consciously 
recalled, not through hypnosis, but I will say it was apparently buried in amnesia for a very long 
time and only came back into the witness's memory years after it happened. This is again another 
pattern we see uh and as we'll see, yeah, it's got some details to it that I think mark this as an 
important and genuine case. In 2019, as an adult, Gavin, that is a pseudonym, began having strange 
flashbacks and memories of weird encounters that he had when he was just a young child living in 
his parents' home in Texas back in the early 1990s. and he believes it was around February 
of 1990 when he was actually taken on board a craft and met extraterrestrial beings face to 
face. The experience began when he felt a strange floating sensation as if being on a cloud is how 
he described it and then suddenly he found himself in a brightly lit area. 

He was unable to move 
anything except his eyes. But he looked around and as Gavin says, "I remember eventually seeing 
three beings. They were humanlike in appearance, similar facial features, short but not tall. The 
primary being was in front of me, several feet away, the second was to my right side, and the 
third was behind me." Now, Gavin soon learned that he had been brought on board for a purpose, and 
the purpose appeared to be being shown and warned about future events that were to soon take place 
on our planet. As he says, they started to show me future events on this floating moving monitors 
to the front left side of me. The monitors were kind of like 26 in or so, like television screens, 
but without the trim and buttons. There were many. They were moving left to right, almost like on an 
invisible floating conveyor belt. Now, the images shown to Gavin were both concerning and alarming. 
They appeared to show various calamities facing all of humanity in the future. As Gavin says, 
I recall seeing natural disasters, disease and famine, pain and suffering, blood being shed, wars 
between nations that led to World War II, death and destruction. These events were not like on a 
time stamp or anything. It was like icon visuals or markers in time. I recall being very emotional 
and thinking and asking, "Why is this happening? What? And where?" I remember getting answers back 
telepathically from the primary being in front of me and the being told me that I was safe 
and not to worry that I was okay. I know there was more to this conversation telepathically, 
but I still cannot recall at all. 

It was like they were warning me of things to come. Now, 
Gavin believes there may have been more events that occurred, but the next thing he remembers is 
waking up on the lazy boy recliner in his living room, curled up with no memory of how 
he had gotten there. At the time, he assumed that he must have sleptwalk. But years later, 
when he was in his late teens and early adulthood, he did become aware of the presence of a small 
oval-shaped foreign body lodged between his lower right jawbone and skin. He was actually able to 
physically move it around slightly without any pain. It felt to him like it was covered with 
some sort of thin coating. So, this appears to be an implant of some kind. But at this point, 
he totally forgot about this object. And it wasn't until 2019 when his memory of his childhood 
encounter began to return to him and was partially because he started to see things happening in the 
world that he had been warned about during his onboard encounter. As Gavin says, when it comes 
to certain events and timelines as a marker, it is like I know what is happening before it happens. 
It is hard to describe the feelings you get knowing that stuff like before it happens and 
then you see it or hear about it on the television or a news article. For example, I knew Queen 
Elizabeth was going to pass away in 2022. I knew there would be the end of the Pope's reign before 
the former pope recently passed away among other events that have recently happened or eventually 
will happen. I hope not though. 

But on our current course, it is happening the way I was shown the 
events. All these events are like a marker in time. That is the best way for me to describe 
it. It's kind of like opening Pandora's box. You want to close it, but you cannot. The events are 
pretty detailed or descriptive in my mind still and are as real as when the three beings showed 
them to me. To this day, if I really think about the events, I get emotional. So, while the entire 
encounter and the information the beings shared were concerning, Gavin ultimately feels it was a 
benevolent encounter, as he says, "I felt like the three beings were more like us than not, 
and that they cared about us genuinely and had compassion." I can only imagine what it's like 
to have an experience like that where ETSs are showing you basically what amount to future events 
and then having them happen. This does turn up in quite a few cases. So that is really interesting 
and it shows once again that one of the reasons ETSs contact people is to basically warn them 
about the fact that we are on a pathway towards self-destruction. I mean that's undeniable. 

We can see it happening right before our very eyes and ETSs are doing our be their best to 
warn us about these kinds of events. and it's very consistent regardless of what type of ETSs people 
are seeing. So, I think that is an important and very prominent pattern of UFO contact that 
really speaks to why they're here. I also found it interesting that this witness, although he was 
frightened at times, felt that this was a purely benevolent experience, that these ETs were very 
much like us, more like us than different. And he felt they were very loving and compassionate. 
So I think that's a very encouraging detail. So now let's move to the next case which is a little 
bit darker, a little bit scarier. I call this one I have never been so afraid in all my life. This 
one occurred in October 1990. Now I'm a little sketchy on the date here. It's possible it was 
the 1970s. I'm unclear about the exact date here, but I don't suppose that's terribly important. It 
did occur in Australia. There's a city or a town called the entrance in New South Wales. It's a 
coastal town. That's where this case occurred. It is a single witness case, but the witness did 
identify herself. We know who she is. And very interestingly, she's actually a very famous 
psychic. That's another pattern we see. ETSs seem to be very attracted or often contact people who 
have profound psychic abilities. And this one is an unusual case for sure. 

This next case 
comes from astrologer Gary Wiseman who published the case in his column in the Australian People 
magazine and it also appeared in the International UFO Journal in an article by Australian researcher 
Bill Chalker who followed up on the article and spoke firsthand to the witness. The witness is 
a famous Australian clarivo and psychic by the name of Winterfred Krauss. At the time of her 
encounter in October 1990, she lived in a city called The Entrance. This is located along the 
eastern coast in New South Wales, Australia. Her experience began in the middle of the night. And 
as Winterfred says, I'll tell you what happened. I was in bed. I didn't know if I was dreaming 
or what it was, but suddenly I was absolutely petrified, absolutely terrified. I had never been 
so afraid in all my life. I was shaking my husband and in my mind's eye, I could see outside and I 
could see them all around. Shortish creatures they were. I was absolutely besides myself. Now her 
husband woke up and turned to her and said, "Oh, I want to get up and go out." And she turned to him 
and said, "No, you mustn't move. Stay with me." And the next thing she knew, she found herself 
somehow transported to a different place. As Winford says, what happened was that I was taken 
up. I was in this place. There were people sitting around. It was all very clinical. They were sort 
of in a semi-trance state if you like. They had me on a bed. It was like a proper medical aluminum 
bed. They were sort of pummeling me. They had slanted eyes and silver outfits. 

They were sort 
of communicating to one another with this strange sound. They treated me as if I was a bug on a 
table. That's all, as though I was just a bug. They were pummeling my stomach and everything. 
And I was saying, "Well, you don't have to be so cruel. Can't we be friends?" That sort of thing. 
They just didn't take any notice of me at all. And I was really, really terribly upset. Now, 
per Winterfred, the beings were about 1.3 m tall. That's just over 4 ft. The sounds the beings made, 
she said, reminded her of insect noises. Suddenly, without warning, she found herself back in bed, 
very confused about what had just happened. As she says, that was when I thought, "Oh, 
I've dreamt it." But I could not have dreamt it. It was just so terrible an experience. 
But soon it became apparent to her that the experience was real because that morning she felt very 
sore in her stomach area and the reality of the encounter was further confirmed when she 
decided later to undergo hypnotic regression. As Winterford says, I went under hypnosis and went 
through the whole thing and it was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying and it was stronger. I 
think I was more terrified under hypnosis than in the beginning because it was clearer. Winterfred 
says that one of the people she saw on board the craft in a trance was actually her sister. So 
Winterfred asked her sister if she had any memory of anything like this. But of course she didn't. 
Nor did Winterfred's husband see anything unusual that night that he can recall. 

But there is 
another interesting after effect of the encounter which was a pronounced increase in Winterfred's 
psychic abilities. As she says it did I have been doing this work for a long time but it really 
did it was very strong very profound actually. Winterfred eventually became a very well-known 
clairvoyant psychic appearing in magazines and on radios and television and providing readings 
to many people all over the world. Interestingly, she also invented a metaphysical board game that 
was quite popular. It was called the cosmic Z and its purpose was to help people to achieve 
a higher level of awareness, enlightenment, and illumination. That case is definitely a little 
different. She felt very little compassion coming from the ETSs, but then again, she admitted that 
she was very, very afraid. And we know that fear can definitely alter a person's perception of 
events. When someone is in pure panic, it's very difficult to objectively observe what's going on. 
But it was her experience. She knows better than anyone else what happened to her. I did find it 
interesting that she saw her sister on board the craft and other people who were apparently in a 
trance. That's very interesting to me. Also interesting to me is that she says her 
psychic abilities increased sharply following this experience. 

And what did she end up doing? 
Creating this popular metaphysical board game that helps people to advance their own psychic 
abilities. I am speculating here, but I suspect that this might have been deliberate and that the 
ETSs knew this would happen and contacted her because this is one of their agendas to really 
wake people up to their own psychic abilities. So that I think makes this case very important that 
and the fact that we do know who the witness is. And again, for each person who's comes forward, 
it's probably a hundred or more who have not come forward. So it's far more common for sure 
than most people have any idea of. So now let's move to the next case. Also super fascinating. I 
call this one you don't have anything to fear from us. This one occurred on March 10, 1996 in Omaha, 
Nebraska to a teenage uh student, a high school student. And this was to him a purely benevolent 
encounter. It's really a fascinating case in which a person was taken on board and spoke with what 
appear to be gray ETS. On the evening of March 10, 1996, Morris, that is a pseudonym, was staying at 
a small residential farm outside the main campus of Boy'stown. 

This is in Omaha, Nebraska. He was 
in high school at the time. He and some of the other younger kids from other houses in the area 
were out shooting basketball hoops. Now, Morris at that time had developed an interest in UFOs. 
He enjoyed reading about the subject and watching shows on TV, and he was objectively weighing the 
credibility of the available evidence to see what was true and what wasn't. Now, on this particular 
night, he had brought out his telescope and was watching the newly visible Hailbop comet. And it 
was then that a UFO appeared. It was 9:15 p.m. And as Morris says, all of a sudden, out of the 
corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of an object that was hovering slightly above the treetop. It 
made almost no noise whatsoever except light wind blowing. I stayed outside watching this object, 
wanting to see what it would do. I felt quite at ease with the situation. It then started 
to randomly pulse lights around the side of the craft as if it was trying to communicate with me, 
telling me to come closer, which I did. At that time, a light came down from the center of the 
craft, and I was staring face to face with what I believe was a Roswell gray being. Now, 
by this time, Morris had done enough research to be familiar with gray aliens. 

And as Morris says, 
it had all the characteristics from the slender body to the long gray arms to the pear-shaped head 
to the oval eyes. At this point, I started to feel ringing in my ears. It was like we were talking, 
but at the same time, no words were coming out of my mouth, which to me at the time felt 
really weird. It was at this point that I felt my body being lifted off the ground and taken into 
the craft where I proceeded to encounter other beings just like the first one. One was really 
a lot taller than the other ones. I called him the captain because he seemed to be running the 
show. I remember talking to multiple beings and they all seemed like they were not here to harm 
us but more to observe. As the beings were talking in their own way of communication, 
they took me around the craft showing me all their different technologies that they had been using. 
And at this point in the encounter, the captain said to me, and I still remember this to this day, 
"We are real. Roswell did actually happen." The captain then proceeded to say in, I guess you 
would call it telepathy, "We will be looking in time to time on you." Now, that proved to be the 
end of Morris's onboard encounter. That's all he could remember. 

He was quickly returned in some 
manner that he cannot recall back to the ground. And as Morris says, after the captain said this, 
I was back on the ground with the first being I had encountered. It seemed to say in its way, 
"Now you know why we are here. You don't have anything to fear from us." It then put up one 
of its arms in a peaceful manner, as if it was saying bye to me for now. I then looked up and 
it was gone. At this point, Morris felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned around and it was the 
house leader who was looking for him and asked him if everything was okay. Morris at this point was 
overcome with this feeling of peace and calm and replied, "Everything is okay." But as it turned 
out, there were some strange events still in progress because on several occasions afterwards, 
he started to notice unmarked black cars following him around. And having heard of Men in Black, 
he wondered if this is was what was happening to him. Now, after he graduated high school and moved 
back to his home state of Kansas, there were no more visitations by these mysterious men in black. 
I would love to do a follow-up with this witness because it's rare that a person has just one experience, 
a one-off. I really wonder if he perhaps had experiences as a younger child or 
perhaps other experiences following this onboard encounter. 

It's also interesting to me that he was 
followed by what he believes to be men in black or government agents. Not unusual. I know many 
cases of contactees who deal with surveillance and being followed by government agents and this 
sort of thing. A really amazing case because he didn't feel a lot of fear and actually had a 
pretty interesting and benevolent encounter. So now let's move to the next case which was also 
per the witness a pretty benevolent encounter and again not recalled through hypnosis. You'll 
notice that none of these cases involve hypnosis. Uh so here's another one. This one occur. I call 
this case an incredible amount of love. This one occurred on December 15, 2012 in Auburn, 
Alabama. And this is another experience which took place in the middle of the night. 

And the witness really struggled with wondering could this have been a dream or not. But as we'll see, 
she found reasons to believe that this was not a dream, but really happened. This case was reported 
by Cheryl. That is a pseudonym. She wants to be anonymous, but she reported it firsthand to MUN, 
the Mutual UFO Network. She always had vague memories of having strange experiences as a child, 
but never was really able to pinpoint anything or remember any actual details. But she had recently 
been experiencing quote a deep fascination with UFO phenomena, questioning of reality, 
and a deep spiritual awakening. So, her experience occurred at around 3:30 a.m. on December 15, 
2012 while she was in her home in Auburn, Alabama. 

And it started with what she initially believed 
was a dream. As Cheryl says, I felt as if I was dreaming and I was back in my childhood home 
several miles from where I actually was. In the dream, I woke up and wandered outside as if I was 
being called to do so. I was then in my former neighbor's front yard. There was a silver disc 
with three very beautiful humanlike beings. One felt male and the other two felt female. This was 
a sort of telepathic feeling. I just sensed who they were and they felt familiar to me, almost 
like meeting long-lost relatives. They emanated an incredible feeling of peace and love and other 
things that I just cannot put into words. Now, at this point, they were standing outside the craft, 
but the next thing Cheryl knew, she was being taken on board. 

As she says, "They ushered me 
into the craft. We ascended straight up. I don't really know what was going on outside the craft, 
although it did not ascend by any means we know today. The craft itself was operated by one of the 
female beings. The craft seemed to know her. The male and other females sat on either side of me, 
and we had a deep conversation about life, existence, and our purpose here on Earth. We then 
arrived wherever we were. I have no idea where. Again, it just felt familiar. We exited the craft 
and we were inside of a building. There were many more beings of the same type. The area was large, 
very beautiful and bright. There was an enormous sitting area where we continued to discuss very 
deep subject matters. 

The other entities were also communicating. It was like a council or a meeting. 
I felt such an incredible amount of love that I did not want to leave. Suddenly, they told me that 
I had to come back, that I would be okay, that they would always be with me. Now, that appeared 
to be the end of the experience. As Cheryl says, "I suddenly woke up in bed. I dismissed it as 
a lovely dream." Cheryl did share this with her husband, but with no one else. And it wasn't long 
afterwards that she had reason to think that this experience might have been more than just a dream 
and that it might have actually happened exactly as she remembered. 

As Cheryl says, "A couple of days later, while checking my mailbox, I noticed a circular pattern in the grass in my front yard. 
The grass was bent over much like you would see in a crop circle. I asked my husband what it was, and 
he had no idea. Then I realized that the dream I had had actually occurred and the craft had landed 
in my front yard. I told my husband about it and of course he dismissed it. We never talked about 
it. But it was almost 6 years later that Cheryl brought up this experience again with her husband. 
And this turned out to have some interesting results because as Cheryl says recently it came up 
in conversation and I said what could have caused the indentation? I wish I had taken a picture. 
To which he replied, we should have had the soil sampled. He admitted that when I first showed him, 
the first thought he had was UFO. And then after telling him the story, he was so internally shaken 
up he couldn't think about it. So today, Cheryl feels that the experience was perhaps an actual 
onboard experience, but she admits she does not want any attention. As she says, "Keep in mind, 
I'm a mother and a professional and I do not want to be deemed as crazy." 

That case makes me wonder how many people have had these kinds of experiences and just pass it off as a dream. 
It was just pure luck that she went out and saw this crushed circle of vegetation or, you know, 
a circular mark in her lawn, which really prompted her to believe that this could have very well been 
a real experience. And that's what prompted her to report it. Although it was sometime later and 
again most people don't report it. She was anonymous. Made it very clear that she's a 
professional with no history of mental illness in her family. This sort of thing really makes 
me have great empathy for these witnesses who have to brave all the ridicule and skepticism 
surrounding this subject. Uh this UFO coverup has really slowed the progress of UFO research and 
continues to do so. It's really a shame because our governments absolutely know for sure that 
this is a real phenomena. I think we've got enough information to say that conclusively. 

And I don't know how many cases we need of people being taken on board for this to be accepted by mainstream 
science. Sooner or later, it's going to happen. For the simple fact that these cases are real, 
there's far too many to explain away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness, 
which is really the go-to for the folks behind the cover up. And all the time they know it's real. 
So, it's very much disingenuous. All right, let's move to the last and final case. I must say this 
might be my favorite in this compilation just because it's got some really poignant elements 
to it. I find it a really fascinating case and this is again fully consciously recalled. Uh I 
call this one I went right through the wall. This one occurred on June 5th, 2015 in Mount Pleasant, 
Michigan. That's not too long ago. So, that is interesting for sure. Uh, also, this is a single 
witness case, but as you'll see, has some details to it that to me has have convinced 
me that it's absolutely genuine. And I think you'll find it certainly an interesting case. 

This very interesting final case comes from an anonymous gentleman. I'll call him Dylan. That's 
a pseudonym. He reported his encounter to New Fork 3 days after it occurred and provided a lengthy 
firstirhand eyewitness testimony describing his encounter in detail. His experience began 
when he was asleep in the bedroom of his home located in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. This is a 
town of about 21,000 people in the center of the state. The first hint he had of anything 
strange was when he woke up to the feeling that somebody was breaking into his house. As he says, 
"I went to have a look and as I went to get up out of bed, I found myself paralyzed in place. I felt 
really scared, like I was having a nightmare or something. When I tried to close my eyes, 
I couldn't close them. And I looked up around in the air. I assumed myself to be in a dream, but I 
couldn't wake up. So, I started to scream. Before I could get a sound out, in a single second, 
I was floating above my bed. And I felt a deep, very low frequency hum like a transformer was 
inside my body. Then I could see behind me back at my bed. And my cat, who sleeps by me, didn't 
even seem to care or notice that I wasn't in bed anymore. I was absolutely terrified. And right as 
I was about to scream, I started floating towards the wall of my bedroom. 

Now, at this point, Dylan 
was still unsure whether or not this was a dream. But the next thing he knew, he was being pulled 
out of his room. As Dylan says, to my shock, I went right through the wall like I was a ghost or 
the wall was liquid. And as I saw through my wall, I was feeling this vibration intensify greatly, 
like a force in my body was going to explode from the inside out. I passed out completely. When I 
remember waking up, I was in some sort of white science-l lookinging laboratory of some sort. I 
again assumed I was dreaming until I saw a face looking down at me. It was a large head with 
black bug-like eyes. And in my head as I went to scream, I heard it say, "Don't be afraid of me. 
You are safe with me." I don't know how to explain it, but it said it through my brain like a mind 
readader would read your mind. The voice sounded like I was saying it to myself instantaneously 
to myself. Then I went to ask, "What's going on?" Before I could talk again, it said, "Don't worry, 
we're Zeta Brothers." I don't really understand what that means, but as I could see more clearly, 
I immediately noticed that these weren't people at all. It was an oblonglooking, 
bugeyed, gray-skinned being, probably around 3 ft tall, with a silver suit made of some kind 
of spandex. It had a tiny slit where the mouth was and just holes for ears. Its head was wobbling on 
what I remember was a tiny neck, and its hands looked like they were really skinny. and long 
with almost no texture, just like the lining of a hot dog casing. I can only explain it as an alien 
creature. 

So Dylan now found himself lying on a kind of table looking up at this strange being, 
and he continued to try to communicate with this being. As he says, "When I asked it to go home, 
another one came into the room, and they were talking to each other without talking. 
One said something in a weird sounding almost African type of language. And they came back next 
to me in an instant. No walking, just teleporting back to above me. Dylan now found himself being 
undressed by one of the beings and the other put a quote strange circular light orb on his genital 
area which caused Dylan some burning pain. The being immediately removed this alien instrument 
and the pain instantly stopped. And as Dylan says, then the one holding the light bulb disappeared in 
a flash out of my view. And the other one above me said, "I want to show you him." And a different, 
taller, bright one of these things came out walking with what looked like a little girl, 
but with some of the facial features of these creatures. And it looked up at me and said, 
"You know who I am." This scared me terribly and I immediately remember falling back asleep. 
This turned out to be the end of Dylan's onboard encounter. He's not sure how long the experience 
lasted, but he estimates a few hours. The next thing he knew, he was back in his home. 

As Dylan says, when I woke up again, it was the next morning and I was back lying in my bed without my 
covers being disturbed. I immediately assumed it was a very scary nightmare. Then when I went to 
get out of my bed, my ankle felt as though the same vibrational burning sensation was coming 
from under my skin by the bone in my leg. Though I looked down and noticed that there was a small, 
maybe 1/8 of an inch circular cutout and burned mark on my leg, but it went down like four 
layers of my skin, as if someone had literally punched a hole with a paper punch out of it and then 
burned it closed. Though seeing the mark on his ankle, Dylan realized that the dream 
explanation failed to account for what had happened to him. And of course, there were a few other strange 
after effects. As Dylan says, for the past few days, I haven't really been able 
to tell if this was a dream or real, but strange feelings happen to my leg, and I hear weird static 
sounds in my head when I feel it. And I also keep seeing a strange pattern of a triangle with two 
circles in it, which looks like some sort of geometric constellation when I start to fall 
asleep every night since. I still don't know if I was dreaming of this or if it really happened, 
but I can't explain why I am still feeling and seeing weird things or the hole in my leg I found 
the morning after all of this happened. So Dylan decided to report his experience to the National 
UFO Reporting Center and says that he believes that he experienced a quote possible abduction 
and that he was quote taken to an alien laboratory from my bedroom. 

It's another example of a person 
having an experience in the middle of the night and waking up thinking, "Wow, could this have been a 
dream?" and then discovering a mark on their body that kind of points to the fact that no, 
this really happened. To me, the most interesting aspect of this particular case is that he 
describes seeing a halfh human half ET little girl who said, "You know who I am." I honestly think 
although the witness didn't say this, I think that that might have been his hybrid daughter 
because that is one of the reasons people are taken on board. They have their genetic material 
taken and they basically have hybrid children on board. So although the witness didn't say this, 
I have interviewed enough people who've had that kind of experience that I think probably that's 
what's going on here. But an amazing experience and again I have great empathy for people who are 
struggling to figure out what's going on with them and kudos to him for reporting it. I wish 
everyone would come forward. It would make it a lot easier for everyone else who are having these kinds 
of experiences to come forward as well. It's really one of the reasons I do this 
research because I know there's a lot of people out there. I know a lot of you guys listening here have 
had these kinds of encounters and are searching for answers. So again, yeah, 
that's why I do this research. 

These experiences do run in my family as well. So I'm not just 
doing armchair research here. I've had personal experiences with this. And having talked to so 
many people who've had these kinds of experiences, I think it's profoundly important and I think all 
humanity deserves to know the truth about what's going on here. So that's it for today. I truly 
appreciate you guys watching. Again, I think this subject is crucially important. So, thank you, 
thank you, thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for 
the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next episode. Bye for now.
