UFO OVER LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
Feb 4, 2022

Summary:
Feb 4, 2022
Located in southern California, the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the third busiest airport in the world. Millions of people from all across the planet travel to and from the airport each year. But it's not only people who are visiting LAX, aliens are too! UFOs are being seen here in large numbers!

In fact, airports all over the world are being targeted by UFOs. For some reason, the ETs are attracted to airports. And more than any other airport, LAX is a UFO magnet. There are at least a dozen cases of UFOs hovering over Los Angeles International Airport. These cases began in the early 1950s and are continuing to the present day. These are not distant sightings of unexplained lights in the sky, but often structured metallic craft seen at low elevation for long periods of time.

Metallic discs, cigar-shaped craft, triangular craft, spherical craft, all have been seen directly over LAX. Many of these are daylight sightings. They not only move directly over the airport; they display fantastic maneuvers and will even hover in place within full view of the airport control tower. 

LAX is located in a densely populated urban area. Many of these sightings involve large numbers of witnesses. These UFOs have been viewed by air-traffic controllers, pilots, baggage handlers, airport employees and numerous other people who live nearby. The objects have been caught on radar and even photographed. The cases themselves occur with incredible regularity and have often made newspaper and television headlines. Due to the brazen behavior of these objects, it is clear that they want to be seen and are intentionally showing themselves to people. The question is, why? Is there an agenda behind these sightings? Are ETs putting on a display to announce their presence? Why is it that LAX is such a powerful magnet of UFO activity?

This video presents a decades-long chronology of the UFO activity over one of the busiest airports on the planet, and it also reveals interesting insights about UFO behavior. The UFO activity over LAX is so intense that it proves that UFOs do, in fact, have an agenda to show themselves, apparently to convince people of the existence of UFOs.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal. 
I call this episode UFOs Over Los Angeles International Airport in case you don't know it 
airports all across the world are being visited by UFOs 
and lax here in southern california is at the top of the list and in fact i've documented 
almost a dozen cases in which UFOs have hovered directly over this airport starting all the way to 
the early 1950s pretty much up to the present day I will say that lax airport is the third busiest 
airport in the world and at one point transported more than 80 million people in just one year 
so this is a very busy airport and is among like I said the most visited in terms of UFOs as well 
so let's just get started on these very interesting cases because I think they have 
something important to reveal about the nature of the UFO phenomenon and the earliest case 
i could find occurred on july 15 1952 for four consecutive nights dozens of witnesses observed 
unidentified craft directly over lax these objects would brazenly approach to within a quarter 
mile of the control towers and hover in place for minutes at a time one witness was a major 
los angeles aircraft company principal who insisted upon being anonymous 
and he wrote to the los angeles examiner newspaper and I quote I am amazed at the increasing audacity 
of the strange disc-like objects seen in the sky over the los angeles airport control tower 
for four nights running they've been seen at the same time between seven and eight pm and the 
same place on the last occasion three of them hung poised for five minutes by the clock so that's the 
first case and again it's certainly not the last it was 14 years later that another case occurred 
on april 3rd 1966 there were several witnesses including a helicopter pilot who observed 
quote an ab long object with several pairs of lights end quote hovering almost directly over the 
airport at only a few thousand feet of altitude after hovering there for some minutes the objects 
darted away seven years later UFOs were back over lax this next incident occurred on april 1st 
1973. it was around dawn when several residents of hollywood reported seeing a disc like object 
glowing and spinning and moving like quote a cork bobbing on the ocean this is typical UFO movement 
and this object was on a direct course towards los angeles international airport 
so there you go another report and it was just three years later when the UFOs were back over lax 
on march 23rd 1977 a gentleman by the name of mark hogan who worked as a cargo handler at lax 
airport saw what he described as a tear drop or tin can shaped object which came in over the ocean 
from the direction of catalina island and flew in formation over the airport runways 
the object had two fixed lights on it he said march air force base which is nearby was contacted 
but they denied any knowledge of this incident they said it did not appear under radar they 
knew nothing about it nor were they conducting any type of rocket tests I will say that lax 
is along the santa catalina channel which is a huge magnet for UFO activity that could be 
a factor here but in these cases these objects are coming right over the airport itself as if 
they want to be seen or certainly are showing no fear of being seen another case occurred almost 20 
years later 18 actually in 1995 when an anonymous air traffic controller at lax itself revealed 
that during his six years of employment as a leading controller handling restricted airspace 
he heard numerous accounts of UFO sightings and received several reports firsthand from pilots 
and one of them occurred in 1992 he says this was actually on august 5th 1992. 
and as he says and I quote northeast of lax a ual747 on out at about 24 000 feet suddenly said 
do you show something went right under us we didn't there was absolutely nothing on radar 
the pilot said it went right by us opposite direction about three times the normal closure 
rate which normally is 900 knots we pulled up the primary radar raw radar returns and there was 
absolutely nothing the pilot said it was quote kind of like a rocket but with something on top 
and it was about the size of an f-16 I got on the landline to the lower controller 
to warn him for subsequent aircraft the only restricted area had no activity at those altitudes 
and there were no military aircraft in the area we told the supervisor and he just said huh 
we just shook our heads and mostly forgot about it though the pilot did make a report on it and 
it appeared in aviation week and space technology this is a major magazine and this magazine article 
actually described the sighting as the article says and I quote the pilot and co-pilot of united 
flight 934 with a heavy passenger load from los angeles to london said they saw an unusual 
aircraft coming directly at them and pass under the 747 by an estimated 500 to 1000 feet the 
incident occurred near georgia air force base at about 1 45 pm on august 5th the 747 was at 23 
000 feet departing from los angeles international airport on a heading of about 40 degrees magnetic 
the several second sighting gave the crew the impression that the other aircraft was a lifting 
body configuration and they described it as looking like the forward fuselage of a lockheed 
sr-71 without wings but with a tail of sorts they estimate estimated the size as similar to an 
f-16 defense department and air force officials said last week that it was not one of their secret 
projects so this is apparently just one of several sightings this air traffic controller at lax 
said that he was privy to something is clearly going on here and another incident occurred 
around this same time on february 17 1995 at 2 48 p.m I actually interviewed this witness first hand 
he's a municipal park worker by the name of brian forrest and he was on or next to the airport 
grounds on his normal route when he looked up and observed what he described as a large black object 
hovering over imperial highway about 200 feet up in the air practically right over 
los angeles airport he said it was less than a mile distant and it was very obvious to him 
that something very strange was hovering there as brian forrest says and I quote it 
was about two to three hundred feet in the air I know the distance because I drove it in a car 
the way I was able to tell it was approximately over there is a jet was taking off behind it 
the pilot had to see this thing I figured the people in the air control tower had to see it 
it was shaped along the lines of a dark cylinder well not a cylinder more of a cone with a rounded 
top and bottom not pointed but rounded the bigger part being at the top where you might 
think of it as an acorn type shape I would say was approximately the size of a single car garage 
turned on end it did not move it just stayed there it was the strangest thing because i've never seen 
anything like that your mind immediately goes it's a helicopter it's a balloon it's a it's a no 
it's not that and I just kept staring at it did not move that this jet was taking 
off behind it brian forest did notice another strange detail as he says the strangest thing is 
i think about it now in retrospect is it's as though it was in focus but almost slightly out 
of focus everything else was clear as a bell but imagine a canvas with fresh paint on it and you 
went up and down and slightly smudged it just a bit it was in focus but almost slightly out 
i found that interesting because this is something other witnesses have told me about their sightings 
so brian forrest also remarked other details that UFO researchers look for including the 
immobility of the object and the total lack of reflection and as brian says and again I quote 
you just don't see things there in the sky without some apparent reason 
something holding it up or it's drifting or moving in some way but just to see it there and not move 
at all it was like a rock it didn't move it was like a part of the sky it was the strangest thing 
there were no details the object was completely black no reflection on its surface so after 
realizing that this object was unidentified he rushed back inside to get another witness but 
by the time he returned this object was gone and he's absolutely convinced he saw a genuine UFO 
as brian says and I quote it was like looking at a piece of the twilight zone it was a real weird 
moment and he did get some corroboration when one week later the orange county register printed in 
articles titled neighbors encounter unidentifiable object and it detailed the sighting of a dark 
strangely shaped object hovering in the sky just south of lax and there were various descriptions 
from witnesses including quote dark oblong objects a model t hit by a freight train 
or a piece of junk hanging from an invisible balloon one witness gave a description that 
was pretty much identical to brian's saying it was a cylinder black turning and rotating in the sky 
it was two months later in 1995 april that there was another sighting over lax 
and again I was able to interview the witness first hand the witness is a lady by the name of 
pat brown a massage therapist from panorama city she was driving along the freeway directly next 
to los angeles international airport this was around 3 p.m so during daylight hours when she 
saw something so strange and so unusual that it was instantly obvious to her that this was a UFO 
she described it as an enormous golden sphere gliding slightly downward over the airport 
and i'll just let pat brown describe this sighting in her own words as she says and I quote I was 
driving down the 405 and I got off the freeway at that howard hughes exit and I was looking 
up at the sky and this guy was crystal clear blue and then all of a sudden there was a big 
gold ship and it was obvious it was a ship it was gold it was circular it wasn't like 
an airplane that was coming in for a landing at lax not as large as the southwest airlines 
that's one of the smaller planes was maybe two-thirds the size of a southwest airline 
it was just seconds that I was able to see it it was obvious to me because I saw it 
and really on this exit there aren't a lot of cars so there was no one to my right no one in front of 
me that I was aware of and I didn't check behind me it was just there and then it wasn't there 
it was really interesting because it was on a 45 degree angle like it was coming in for something 
pat brown is a contactee has had a number of sightings and 
was visited by gray ET's and taken on board so for her this was I don't want to say normal 
but it's definitely something she's experienced before and she was very much impressed that this 
was a UFO but what really impressed her was this location directly over lax what is going on here 
why are there so many sightings over lax probably the granddaddy of all the lax airport encounters 
occurred on april and in april of 1997 when literally dozens of witnesses called the news 
called various radio stations called the police reporting seeing red lights over the airport 
that evening it was covered on the evening news I remember watching the report 
it was very tongue-in-cheek very brief they mostly just sort of ridiculed the witnesses 
but they did provide descriptions from first-hand witnesses who described these as red lights 
or strange lights that quote hovered over the airport and reportedly they were seen on radar 
so the reporting on this incident was somewhat incomplete and not a true and proper investigation 
but they certainly did verify that this incident did take place I talked to one witness firsthand 
he declined a formal interview but said that he did see the lights himself and that they weren't 
very bright but they were absolutely obvious and he estimated that they were quite low maybe a few 
thousand feet high and he watched them for several minutes before they disappeared 
so year after year UFOs are coming and visiting lax and here's yet another case 
which occurred on march 31st 1999. this occurred just after midnight when a police helicopter 
and crew were flying immediately adjacent to lax over the city of carson and they were circling 
their target location at 500 feet of altitude when the pilot shouted out that a quote orange ball 
of light was an estimated two miles ahead of them and approaching fast this ball of light 
raced towards the observers changed direction and moved at right angles the helicopter pilot aimed 
the helicopter so that they could see this object and keep it in view and as one of the crew men 
says and I quote the object then changed direction again accelerated and headed directly at the door 
of the helicopter and the crewman admitted that he was so startled that he pressed both 
the radio and the intercom and shouted out an expletive as the crewman says and I quote 
the object got within 200 feet of the aircraft and then changed direction again flying to the north 
at a very high rate of speed and out of view this crewman is absolutely insistent that this was a 
genuine UFO and as he says I hope you don't think i'm a nut but i've been around and involved in 
aviation for a long time i've never seen anything like this the texture the shape the movement the 
speed changes and the drastic angles all added up to it not being anything that I have seen before 
so he was so impressed by this that he ended up calling new fork the national UFO 
reporting center and reporting his sighting he thought it was that important it's another 
amazing case which shows how close these objects get not only to lax itself but to the actual 
aircraft I mean planes and helicopters do not approach to within a hundred feet of each other 
that would be called a near collision and would cause a huge investigation and yet these objects 
are coming right up to these objects and hovering right over the airport itself 
it's really quite amazing and another case came not much longer it was on july 23rd 2002 
and this is a really interesting sighting it occurred exactly at 10 pm when more than a dozen 
witnesses including a UFO researcher mufon state section director for los angeles mark hunzakar all 
observed a large triangular shaped UFO with red lights and it moved directly over the southwestern 
end of los angeles international airport heading out towards the santa catalina channel 
mark hunziker being a UFO researcher was very familiar with astronomy and aircraft and 
the air flight patterns over lax and he was in marina del rey just north of lax 
when his neighbor alerted him to the object he looked overhead and he described this object as 
being quote a brightly lit array of lights which looked like they were configured to what appeared 
to be a central jet aircraft however when he looked closer he realized the shape was wrong 
and the object was covered with red lights so not a standard aircraft and more than a dozen 
witnesses from neighboring communities observed this same object and allegedly one witness 
captured this object on videotape an analysis of what showed this to be a large triangular 
shaped craft the final case I found was relatively recent this occurred on november 27 
2003 when a resident of los angeles who prefers to remain anonymous was driving along the 110 
freeway this is directly north of lax and he was watching the incoming planes line up when he saw 
quote an anomalous craft crossing over the approach path to lax he says this 
craft appeared to be a very large triangular shaped object with several lights underneath it 
he carefully observed this craft as it moved northeast directly over the airport 
was so impressed by it that he later investigated all the flights that took place that day at that 
time and was unable to find any corresponding match so again he remains convinced that this 
was a genuine UFO and he reported his sighting in detail to the national UFO reporting center 
so there's almost a dozen cases I know there are more most people do not report these sightings 
and a number of other sightings could be listed because they were in the same general area the 
santa catalina channel is hugely active so this is probably part of that whole complex of sightings 
but what's really interesting about these settings is how close they are getting to lax and I think 
this shows that ufos are purposefully showing themselves normally sightings are pretty evasive 
and not wanting to be seen but in these cases it's clear that they are sort of showing themselves 
off I first covered this series of events in my book ufos over california but after finding more 
events I did another write up in my book undersea UFO base lax is definitely being visited by ufos 
it's been going on for decades so I am pretty confident it's going to happen again and again 
airports all over the world are being visited as far as I know none have had the number of 
sightings that lax has had that's another reason why I wanted to do this presentation for you 
today because lax is really at the top of the list in terms of airports being visited by ufos 
but this is definitely a thing something is going on here it's got something important to say about 
how ufos behave and that's why I wanted to do this episode for you today I hope you've enjoyed it I 
really want to thank you once again for watching I really appreciate it and as I like to say 
keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most importantly keep having fun.
