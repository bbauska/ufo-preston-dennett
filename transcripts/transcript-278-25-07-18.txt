Summary:
Jul 18, 2025
This is the true story of Janet and her lifelong experiences with gray extraterrestrials. Her contacts started around age nine. But it was an incredibly unusual encounter at age 10 that changed her life forever. Along with her UFO/ET experiences, which include instances of missing time, added time, and at least three onboard encounters, Janet, like most contactees, has also experienced many paranormal events such as ghost encounters, angels, a near-death experience, premonitions, mediumship and more high strangeness.

In 1969, ten-year-old Janet rode her bike with some friends along a suburban street in Tarzana, California. Looking up, they saw a strange craft hover over some trees at the top of a steep driveway. They raced up to get a closer look, but the craft was gone. They spent the next hour pushing their bikes up the driveway and racing down, then decided to go home. Janet headed up the driveway one more time so she could race down and pass her friends. But reaching the top of the driveway, she saw a strange boy emerge from the trees, shakily riding his bike . He wore a red shirt and jeans. As he approached, she saw he had a large bald head, dark wrap-around eyes, a tiny nose and mouth, gray skin and only four fingers on each hand. Her mind raced to figure out what she was seeing. Was he a deformed child? But when the boy reached out his hand and touched her shoulder, and spoke in her mind, “Do not be afraid,” Janet realized that this boy could not be human. Terror filled her. She couldn’t move. Suddenly, the boy was gone. Janet raced home in fear and told her friends about the “monster boy.” They did not believe her, nor did the adults she told. They asked her where she had been for the last two hours. Janet wondered, how did it get so late? Janet didn’t think of UFOs or aliens. She just knew that she had encountered something very strange and scary.

Janet’s mind went back to other recent odd events. One year earlier, she had seen a strange black figure looking at her while she played with her friend. One night, she was woken by a brilliant blue light filling her room. She got up to investigate, and that’s all she could remember. Little did Janet know, more strange events were coming.

A few years later, Janet’s family moved to another house, which turned out to be badly haunted. Doors opened and closed by themselves, ghostly footsteps were heard throughout the house, objects moved mysteriously or disappeared. There were cold spots, apparitions, orbs and other poltergeist-like events. Finally, her mother called a parapsychologist, who said that Janet was likely the cause of the strange events. Still the activity continued. She met a man, married and moved out of her house. Still the strange events continued.

At age 21, out of the blue, Janet suffered a stroke and had an NDE. Thankfully she made a full recovery, which baffled and astonished the doctors, who could find no trace of her illness. One night while driving with her husband in Canyon Country, California, the car mysteriously stalled. Her husband left to get help. Janet was alone in the car and became consumed with fear that someone was coming to get her. The next thing she knew, hours had passed, and they were driving home. It was another instance of missing time.

She became pregnant and had a child. Her marriage didn’t work out, so she separated and moved back home. Sadly, her mom’s health was failing rapidly, and Janet found herself overwhelmed with caring for her infant daughter and her ailing mother. It was then that she had a dramatic angelic encounter.

As time passed, many other strange events occurred. In 2005, she had a scary UFO encounter while driving through Victorville, CA and ended up arriving home hours earlier than she should have. She heard strange beeping tones in her head. She found an odd metallic foreign body lodged in her cheek. Then, watching TV, she saw images of gray aliens and realized with a shock that they looked just like the monster boy she saw as a kid. She went under hypnosis and recalled that she was apparently taken onboard and saw more grays who gave her a message she has yet to recall.
Moving to Texas in 2016, she had a dream she was taken onboard a UFO and examined by gray ETs. When she woke up, she found a strange substance on her neck which proved that the experience was not a dream. She soon had another event where she recalled being on a craft and seeing a gray.

More paranormal events followed. She had telepathic conversations with the grays who helped her with her health issues. She had OBEs, premonitions, mediumship abilities and more. A DNA search revealed shocking things about her ancestry. Today Janet remains in telepathic communication with the grays, and is still searching for answers about her strange life.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. Today's episode is called The Gray Alien Boy. This is the true
story of one woman's lifelong experiences with UFOs, ETSs, and quite a
bit of high stranges. Her name is Janet. That is her real name, though she has requested
anonymity. And yes, she's had lifelong encounters
with UFOs and extraterrestrials, but it was an incredibly unusual
encounter when she was only 10 years old that really changed her life forever.
Since then, she's had a number of face-to-face encounters with humanoids, quite a few sightings, some missing time
encounters, and at least three on board UFO encounters. So yes, some very
intense UFO ET experiences. But like most UFO contactees, she's also
experienced a lifetime of paranormal and psychic events. Quite a few, in fact.
She's had ghostly encounters, a really amazing angelic encounter, a near-death
experience, quite a few premonitions, outof body experiences, some experiences with
mediumship, and more. Her story is told in my book, Humanoids and High Stranges:
20 True UFO Encounters. I've had to summarize her experiences here because
yes, they are very extensive. So, if you want to hear the whole story, check the book out. I think you'll find it very
interesting. But I'm going to start with Janet's experience at age 10. This is
one of the most unusual UFO encounters I've ever heard. It's truly unique. I've
never heard anything quite like it, but it's such an amazing encounter. And this
is really how it all began for her. She had an encounter during the daytime with
what she calls the monster boy. That's what she called it at the time. Later,
she realized that this was probably a gray alien ET.
The year was 1969. It was a hot summer day in Tarzana, California. As
10-year-old Janet decided to spend the day like she usually did, riding her bicycle around with the neighborhood
kids. Her father was somewhat abusive. And because of this, she learned long ago to just stay out of the house as
much as possible. So, she rode her bicycle over to the home of her best friend Tammy. That is a pseudonym.
Unfortunately, on this particular afternoon, Tammy wasn't there, but her
brother was along with a few other boys. So they all decided to go riding on their bicycles. They all lived along
Wells Drive. You can see it here, which at that time wasn't very busy. Was a
great place for kids to go bike riding. And they would drive back and forth just
exploring the neighborhood. On that summer day, while riding around aimlessly and a little bored, Janet was
the first to notice a strange dark object of some kind hanging in the air
suspended over the tops of a grove of eucalyptus trees located at the top of a
long steep driveway on Wells Drive. You can see it here. Now, this object
floated there in perfect silence, and Janet shouted out and pointed, "Look,
you guys, look up there. What's that? One of the kids said, "Weird. I don't
know." Janet said, "Well, let's get closer and see what it is. Come on, hurry. Let's go." So, being so young,
none of them had really heard of UFOs. But they could see that this was a strange flying object of some kind.
Amazed and curious, they pedal hard as they could and then ended up running
with their bikes up to the top of this very long driveway. And at the top of the driveway, there was a large, flat,
vacant lot, was undeveloped, was surrounded by a thick grove of unckempt
eucalyptus trees. Now, the object they had seen hovering above the trees was no longer there. It was just gone. And as
they had only caught a momentary glimpse of it, they kind of just forgot about it and continued to play. So now they're at
the top of this driveway, they decided it would be a fun downhill slope. So they began to race each other down the
driveway and allowed the momentum to carry them down the street. And this turned out to be great fun. So they
turned around and pushed their bikes back up this driveway for another pedalfree ride down. After a few more
times of doing this, everyone decided it was time to take a break and return to Tammy's house, rest, eat some snacks,
and watch TV. Now, for some reason, Janet's not sure why. She decided to
take one more trip up this driveway by herself. It had been so much fun that she wanted to do it one more time and
maybe get enough momentum that she could speed up past her friends and beat them all back to Tammy's house. This would be
a decision that would have profound consequences for the rest of Janet's life. So again, this driveway was quite
steep, about a 100 ft long, and Janet was pretty tired already from the
repeated trips up this driveway. So by the time she pushed her bike to the top of this driveway, she was a little bit
out of breath. She was resting and getting ready to go down the driveway one last time, and this is when she
noticed a young boy emerge from the grove of eucalyptus trees. She could see immediately that he was riding a bike
and heading directly towards her. And her first thought was, "Who is that kid?" She already spent most of her time
outside. She knew all the kids in the neighborhood. So, she decided, "I'll just wait here and see, and maybe we'll
have another new friend to ride bikes with." So, as this boy slowly approached, Janet noticed several things
simultaneously. And the first was that this boy was having a very difficult time riding his bike. As Janet says, he
was quite a ways away, maybe 80 yards from me. He was trying to negotiate this
wobbling bike and he can't. It was very difficult for him. All the while he was
looking straight at me and trying to keep his balance. It was really awkward and he had a really, very difficult
time. He was very shaky on the bike. It seemed he had never ridden a bike before. So, as this boy approached,
Janet could now see why the boy was having such a hard time with his bicycle. He had extremely long fingers
that seemed to have trouble gripping the handlebars. He was also barefoot. He had very weird feet that didn't seem to fit
the pedals. As Janet says, he was doing everything he could to ride that bike
towards me. As he got closer, I was mentally taking note that something was
wrong with his hands and feet. He had really long fingers, long and spindly,
and his feet were so long, he was having a hard time pedaling. He had very long,
thin feet. He couldn't ride that bike very well. He just had no idea what he
was doing. So, as he came even closer, Janet could see by his clothes that he was a boy. He was wearing a red
long-sleeved button-down Pendleton shirt with a plaid pattern and blue jeans, but
he negotiated his bike so poorly that it took him nearly a full minute to
approach Janet. She could see it was a nice bike, dark colored. It had a fancy
banana seat and a high bar in back. And as Janet says, so he's coming
closer and I'm taking it in. I'm waiting for some greeting like, "Hi." And the next thing I knew, he stopped the bike
right in front of me. He put his foot with those long toes on the ground to balance himself and looked right at me
while I was looking right back at him. Everything happened so fast in a split second. My brain was assessing what I
was seeing. And all of a sudden, I can't believe what's wrong. He had a stunning and striking appearance I had never seen
before. And I was trying to make sense of it all and take it all in. So stunned by this boy's strange appearance, she
wondered if he was some kind of freak or monster, or perhaps maybe had some sort of disability. Janet's family were close
friends with another family whose child had suffered severe oxygen deprivation
in the womb, leaving him severely handicapped. And her mind immediately flashed back to her friend as she tried
to make sense of what was going on. Could this boy perhaps be suffering from
some sort of similar disability? But as Janet says, he had a very long, thin
neck. His head was really large, very round. His head size was huge, like a
teardrop, but rounded more at the forehead and above. And his eyes, those
eyes were so dark and so flat. They wrapped around a little to the side of
his head. There was no pupil. was like you were looking into a flat black. They
were very large and almond shaped, taking up most of its face. He had a grayish white head and face. Was very
odd. He had nose, just two holes, and he had this teeny tiny little mouth. I
realized something was very wrong. She could see that his body was very thin. His wrists and ankles looked almost
stick-like and were way too long. Now Janet's still straddling her bike. This
boy is no more than 2 feet away from her. Also still on his bike. He stared directly into her eyes, which she said
seemed to almost bore into the center of her mind. She did notice that the boy had the illusion of hair, but it
definitely wasn't hair, just more like a shadowed area, which came almost to a sort of widow's peak, like Eddie Monster
on the monsters. She did see that this being, this boy, had only four fingers,
each of which were at least twice as long as a normal person's. His forehead was overly large. His chin came down to
a rounded point, and his skin was very pale and incredibly smooth, but it was
his eyes that impressed her the most. They were far too large and had a kind of a flat blackness that reminded her of
dry, reinous tar. Not once did she see him blink. She saw no eyelids at all.
And at this point, Janet realized that this strange boy in front of her could not be human. There was no way. No
normal person looked like this. She wanted to turn and run, but now found that she was unable to move. She was
literally petrified, frozen in place. And this was very scary for her. And she
immediately started to panic. As Janet says, I could not move or speak or even
make a sound. It was like the awareness of my body was taken away. Like I was out of my body and had no control to
move anything at all. I could think clearly, but I was literally stuck in
time. It was a very weird feeling. I realized I was in danger. I needed to
get away and I could not I could not move. All the while he was looking at my
face. He was face to face with me, looking right at me. He never looked away, never blinked, and had a dead
panic expression and what seemed like a curious look while staring at me. My thoughts flooded in to make sense of
what I was seeing, but the weird physical deformationations were not like anything I had seen before. Yanick could
hardly believe what happened next. As she says, "You calmly and slowly raised
his hand and put his hand and fingers up on my left shoulder." The boy then said
calmly, "Don't be afraid." Now, this wasn't verbal. This was echoing inside
her head. And as Janet says, I remember thinking to myself, "Don't be afraid of
what?" That really scared me because the only time you tell someone not to be afraid is when they're going to be
afraid. What was going on? Like, what do you mean don't be afraid? Apparently, I
need to be afraid. At that moment, the world around Janet, seemed to be completely forgotten. It was just her
and the boy. She saw that his hands, unlike his face, were a little bit wrinkled. She could feel the light
pressure of his fingers on her shoulder. And she thought to herself, "Why? Why
did I have to go back up the driveway? Why couldn't I have just gone home with the other kids? This alien looking boy
continued to stare into her eyes. And as she says, he just looked right at me. I
could not help but look at his eyes. She sensed no emotion coming from him. And
this really unnerved her. So there is Janet face to face with this little
monster boy, this gray alien boy. But at that time, never having heard of gray
ETSs, she did not interpret it that way. She did not know how to interpret it. It
was a very scary encounter for her. She had never felt this kind of fear before
and she blacked out. That's the last thing she remembers. She remembers waking up standing next to her bike and
this ET was gone. What's really interesting about this encounter is I suspect, and I'm speculating here, but I
suspect that this gray ET dressed up in human clothes, this button-down shirt
and blue jeans and riding a bicycle to reduce the fear factor to sort of
provide an image that perhaps little girl might be more comfortable with. This kind of backfired. It really
freaked Janet out understandably, I think. So now that she woke up, this
little monster boy is gone. She raced down the driveway as fast as she could,
really scared, wanting to warn everyone else about this strange being she had
encountered. Now, at the time, she estimated that maybe this encounter lasted five minutes, but she was about
to discover that she had in fact had missing time, and at least an hour had
passed, if not more. Janet was more frightened than she had ever been in her young life, so she picked up her bike
and just fled. She rode as fast as she could down the hill so she could warn the other kids about this monster boy.
She soon reached the house. She saw all the other bikes lying on the ground outside. She leapt off her bike, rushed
inside, and to her confusion, all the kids were relaxing on the couch and the
floor, sitting in front of the television, eating snacks and watching cartoons. And she screamed out, "You
guys, you guys, you're not going to believe what happened." And they said, "Where have you been?" And she's like,
"What do you mean? I was just up the driveway." They said, "Well, we thought you went home." She's like, "No, what? I
just saw you guys. Did you see the freak boy?" And they looked at her like she was crazy and said, "No, you've been
gone for hours. Stop trying to scare us." So, this stunned Janet. She didn't
know what to think. Confusion swept over her. How could it be so late? Where had
all the time gone? It was at that moment that Tammy's mother came home. Janet felt a surge of relief. there was an
adult she could talk to and warn them about the strange creature she had seen. So Tammy's mother walks in and Janet
shouts out, "There's a monster boy. There's something really scary going on up the street. We have to call the
police and get help. We're all in danger." Tammy's mother was not impressed. Looked at her with a
disapproving expression and said, "Oh, you're just making up stories again." So this upset Janet. She recalled an
earlier strange incident one year before when she had seen another strange
humanoid. Nobody had believed her then either. They had accused her of lying, but she hadn't lied then and she wasn't
lying now. And she protested. She said, "No, you've really got to listen. It's
not safe. You've got to listen to me. You've got to believe me." This just
made Tammy's mother angry. And she said, "Stop making up stories. Get out of the house and go home." and stop making
stories. If you keep making up stories, you won't be allowed to come over anymore. You won't be allowed to play
with the others." So Janet was understandably devastated. She was still very scared, not only for herself, but
all the other kids. And the last thing she wanted to do was be alone. But she really had no choice. And as Janet says,
I left and rode my bike home as fast as my legs could go. I was crying all the
way, trying to make sense of everything, and I had to ride past that driveway. And I thought, "What if it happens again
and he gets me?" I was so terrified. I could barely compose myself. I was so
scared. So going past that driveway in such fear was almost more than she could handle. But she did it. She ran inside,
told her mother. Her mother only half listened. And as soon as she heard these unusual details, she immediately
dismissed Janet's account and said, "You have a big imagination. Quit making up
stories." And Janet said, "I'm not. You've got to believe me." And her mother didn't. She said, "I don't want
to hear it." Janet was crushed by this. She felt totally defeated. As Janet
says, "This was a major lifealtering thing that happened to me. And then I
got a double whammy. I tried to tell and get help even though I was terrified to
tell. I was not believed. I was told not to lie and that my imagination had taken
over. It was devastating. But what could I do? So in solitude, I was left to have
to decide how to feel about myself and the memory no one cared to hear about. I
knew it all sounded so crazy, but it all really happened to me and I was left
still feeling worried about everyone's safety. So, at this point, Janet realized she felt sick to her stomach.
She was nauseous. She had a stomach ache. It was a strange feeling because she almost never got sick. She was
unusually strong and athletic, very agile. She was a tough kid. She knew it.
But now she felt physically ill. So, her mother told her to go to bed, which she did. As you can imagine, that was an
extremely traumatic event for Janet. Not only did she have a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid that she
simply could not understand, did not know what it was, although it was obvious to her that this being was not
human. So, that alone is traumatic enough, but then to have to go through the whole experience of being
disbelieved and even ridiculed kind of a double whammy. And I do see this with a
lot of contactees, especially as children. They have an encounter. They try to tell their parents, their
friends, and they're not believed. So, this caused Janet to really clam up and
keep silent about her encounters. It affected her profoundly. And in fact,
following this incident with the quote monster boy, she absolutely avoided that
driveway at all costs, which wasn't easy because she kind of had to go by it daily. and instead she would literally
take a mileong detour just so she didn't have to go anywhere near that driveway.
That's how profoundly it affected her. Even when they drove by, she'd duck down in the car seat and wouldn't look at it.
So, you can see that this was a very, very scary experience for her. And it
really started to make her look back on her life because previously one year
earlier she had another encounter with a humanoid which at the time she didn't
understand as well. Tried to tell adults again she was not believed. She was accused of making it up and she thought
perhaps she did. Perhaps she had imagined the whole whole thing. But now in hindsight she doesn't think she did.
This was another very unusual event that marked the beginning of a lifelong experience with ETS. But this earlier
humodor encounter involved a figure like a man in black. It was one year earlier
in 1968. And at that time, Janet's only real friend was Tammy. So to escape her
own abusive household, Janet spent a lot of her time at Tammy's house or outside.
Today they were playing in the bushes and building forts. And this is when she
thought she saw a very weirdl looking man, kind of a black hat and a long black trench coat staring at them. Now
Tammy didn't notice this figure. And afterward, even Janet herself wasn't
entirely sure about seeing him, but just thought it was weird. weird enough that
she said, "We need to tell your mom and explain to Tammy about this shadowy
figure." Tammy said, "Did you really see him?" And Janet said, "Yes, I thought I
saw a man." Tammy's like, "Oh, okay." So, they went inside and told Tammy's
mother. And at first, Tammy's mother seemed to take the story seriously. She went outside to investigate and saw that
nobody was there. And she accused Janet of lying. She said, "You're making up stories. It's just your imagination."
Now, this confused Janet. She didn't think she'd made up this story, but
Janet's home life was so full of turmoil. She had learned to repress the memories of the abuse around her, and
these new experiences created so many questions, but she had no support. So,
she really had only herself to rely on. Now, the encounter with this monster
boy, who she would, of course, later realize was a typical gray ET
became something she thought about every day. She hadn't made any connection to
UFOs or extraterrestrials, but she did feel that there was more to the encounter than she could remember. As
Janet says, I did leave there with the knowing that they told me something or
gave me info of some kind. I just can't remember what it is. And it really makes
me wonder all the time what it is. Jennet is now very confident that she
did encounter this other strange humanoid. She doesn't know if it was nonhuman or what, but she absolutely
does believe it was related to all of this. And again, very difficult for her
to process. She had nobody to talk to. Janet's childhood was quite lonely. Her
father was very abusive. He didn't allow friends over. She often spent her time
outside or over at her friend Tammy's house just to avoid going home. And uh
to complicate the issue, Janet didn't really feel part of the family cuz she
was in fact adopted. She was kind of considered the weird one. Her younger
sister was considered, you know, the smart one, the pretty one. She was
excelled at sports and was very smart, whereas Janet was a tomboy and a little
bit weird. So, she felt a little bit left out anyway. And then she's having
all these experiences. And as she came to awareness of all
this, she started to look back at some other weird events cuz it wasn't just these two human right encounters. There
were a few other weird events in her childhood which she absolutely believes are connected to all of this. Looking
back on her life, there were a few events that definitely stood out. For example, one evening about one year
before the quote monster boy encounter, Janet had just entered her bedroom and
climbed into bed when she was startled by a brilliant illumination shining in through the window from the backyard.
Now, this couldn't have been a car or anything. There was no road back there, but this light was as bright as a search
light. It wasn't a helicopter because there was no noise. And Janet got up to investigate, but doesn't remember
anything other than that. In fact, she didn't remember the incident until years
later when she was beginning to put the pieces together about her encounters with these weird humanoids. Another
incident occurred around age nine. One morning, Janet, her sister, and her
mother were in the kitchen eating breakfast. Janet's father had just left for work when without warning the door
to the garage began to shake as though someone was trying to get in but couldn't turn the handle. As Janet says,
that door started to shake like nothing I've ever seen before. It just shook. I
mean, that door shook. We had never had anything like that again. Just that one
time. Following these weird events, Janet just tried to forget about them. She put them away in the back of her
mind and didn't think too much about it. She knew she had seen something unusual,
but with no way to interpret it or to process it, she just tried to forget about it. And time moved on, and in
1972, Janet's family sold the house on Wells Drive in Tarzana and decided to buy a
much larger house in Woodland Hills. This was a huge house with many rooms, a
billiard room. It had a den. It was a very expensive house. However, this
brought another complication because as it turned out, this house was badly
haunted and Janet started to experience a huge variety of paranormal events. And
in fact, so did the entire family. The first night they moved into this new
house, weird things started to happen. For example, the electricity hadn't been
turned on yet, but the vacuum cleaner kept turning on by itself. And as the days and weeks passed, other strange
things happened. There were strange sounds echoing through the house, phantom footsteps, weird knocking
noises. They heard disembodied voices. The piano would play by itself. They
turn on the radio, it would change channels. Light bulbs would burst mysteriously. They even saw apparitions
appearing and disappearing, lights going on and off, doors opening and closing,
all kinds of activity. At first, everyone tried to ignore and explain this away. But it occurred so
frequently. There were so many manifestations with so many witnesses, it was impossible to deny. I mean, the
car keys would disappear. Objects would move by themselves. They felt weird cold spots coming and going. Once Janet's
sister saw an apparition at the top of the staircase, a lot of the activity seemed to center around the stairs. One
evening, 1973, this was one year after moving in, Janet unfortunately came home
shortly past curfew, and when she walked in, her abusive father was waiting for
her behind the door. And Janet received the worst beating of her life. Moments later, her father came into her bedroom
to apologize. But Janet had reached a point where she wasn't going to take any more abuse. She found the courage to
fight back. She rejected his apology and harshly berated him for how he had
treated her so badly for so many years. She knew that this could very likely
provoke him into another beating, but at that point, she didn't even care. She let him know in no uncertain terms that
she was sick of it and wasn't going to take it anymore. Was one week later her father was driving on the freeway and
died of a massive heart attack. This was of course tragic, but for the first time
Janet was in control of her own life. She was no longer being abused. She was
finally allowed to bring friends over. And as the time passed, she and her mother became much closer. Janet started
dating. Her entire life improved a lot. Her mother started dating and found
another man to marry. But this haunting continued and Janet could not have
friends over because usually something would happen. And one day in 1974,
she invited a boy that she thought was really cute over for a date and told him to wait in the den while she got ready.
And when she came back downstairs, she saw that every light in the room had
been switched on and her boyfriend looked white as a sheet. And he said, "Get me out of this house. Get me out of
this house." He was clearly scared. So Janet said, "Okay, let's go." And she
led him outside. And he explained that he got up and was walking to one of the
doorways and this large glowing orb appeared and blocked his way. He went to
another door and this orb zipped over and stopped him. There was a lot of doors in the den and each time he
approached one of these doors, this orb stopped him. So, this was very upsetting
for him. He refused to go on the date, Janet never saw him again. And this was
something Janet had to deal with because anytime she invited someone over, she would never see them again cuz something
would happen. So this was so bad just so much activity that finally Janet's
mother sought help and in 1976 she called the parasychology department
at UCLA and they sent over Dr. Thelma Moss to research their case. Thelma Moss
was very familiar with poltergeist like activity and she concluded that the
activity was real and that the cause was probably Janet herself. Of course, Janet
wasn't happy to hear this, nor did she entirely agree, but once again, she was
the odd girl out, the weird one. So, time marched on. Around 1978,
Janet found a job as a waitress in a restaurant. She had a serious boyfriend.
At age 19, she and her boyfriend got married and made plans to move out. They
found an apartment and were packing up their belongings. And on the day she was moving out, her mother was crying in the
kitchen while Janet and her boyfriend were carrying boxes outside. Janet's
boyfriend went upstairs to get the last box while she went into the kitchen to comfort her mother and say goodbye. And
her boyfriend did not come back. So, she became concerned. She walked into the foyer and saw him sitting at the bottom
of the stairs pale and shaking his head. And he's like, "Let's go. Hurry." She's
like, "What's wrong?" And he said that while he was carrying the last box about halfway down the stairs, a sudden blast
of freezing cold air enveloped him and he became momentarily paralyzed. He
couldn't move. He couldn't speak. He could barely breathe. And finally, it passed through him and he collapsed at
the bottom of the stairs, weak and disoriented. Living in that haunted house was very difficult for Janet and
she was very glad to get out of there. It was very difficult not only with the haunting activity but because it
basically centered around her. And it could very well be like Thelma Moss says
that she in fact was the cause of these events because researchers have noticed
a pattern when there is a disturbed often teenager in the house. This can
cause a lot of poltergeist like activity and having interviewed quite a few contactees many of them will come back
from an encounter and have this kind of activity. So I'm not so sure it's a ghost. I think it might be a person's
bio electric field or their psychic abilities becoming suddenly enhanced and
all of this stuff starts happening. At any rate, it was very difficult for Janet. Very glad to move out of that
house. But it wasn't long. one year later that there was another issue that
came up which was very difficult for her. Out of the blue, Janet was diagnosed with Graves disease. This was
very difficult for her. There is no history of this in her family, she would later discover. So, she ended up having
to have some radioactive iodine treatments. Uh she did well. She
responded great. So, that was good. But then other things started to happen. One
day she was out at a pool just enjoying her life with her husband and some friends when suddenly she felt very
weak, very disoriented. She couldn't catch her breath. They rushed her off to the hospital. Good thing they did. The
hospital had a very hard time diagnosing her. But Janet ended up having a dramatic near-death experience and also
experienced some other very unusual events that she could not explain, still
can't explain to this day. So now at the hospital, Janet felt paralysis and
numbness along the right side of her body. She was pale, sweaty, nauseous. She found she couldn't even speak. The
doctors were doing all kinds of tests on her. They could not figure it out. They thought she might have heat stroke. They
weren't sure. They weren't even sure if she would survive the night. They told her family to quickly go home, get
something to eat, change some clothes, and that they would have to move Janet to another hospital. For the next 24
hours, Janet felt herself slipping in and out of consciousness. At one point, she woke up in what she believes was an
ambulance, but she was amazed to see this man sitting next to her. And she says he looked almost angelic. He looked
perfect, and she was absolutely captivated by his appearance because an intensely bright white light shone down
on her from above, only on Janet. But the entire area seemed to glow and was
so bright. The man put his hand on Janet's arm and speaking to her in soft,
calm tones, started to assure her that everything would be fine and that she was okay. And Janet calmed down as she
says, "I felt I could believe him and I had a feeling of being safe with him, though he was emotionless at the same
time. He was the most beautiful man I had ever, ever laid eyes on. He was what
you would say godlike. He was so perfectly beautiful." Now, in hindsight,
Janet wondered, could he have been an angel? Maybe even an ET. She really
isn't sure. But this intensely bright white light made her wonder if if perhaps she had had a near-death
experience. And she tried to investigate this trip to the hospital, but there was no record
of it. There was no information whatsoever about any of this. Janet
ended up spending many days in the hospital while her family waited to see if she would live or die. But Janet hung
in there and her condition started to improve. She regained her speech. She
could understand what was going on. There was a lot more tests, angiograms,
and finally the diagnosis came in and the doctors couldn't believe it. They
said that Janet had a cerebral aneurysm, a stroke. They were really baffled. They
had never seen a patient so young and healthy suffering from a major stroke for no apparent reason. But yeah, she
had a total occlusion of the left corateed artery. Thankfully, Janet rallied. Her condition slowly
stabilized, but she definitely had some damage. The right side of her body was paralyzed,
and the doctor said that there was not a whole lot they could do. But due to her improvement and young age, they decided
to send her home for physical therapy and just regularly monitor her condition. And meanwhile, strange events
began to occur. While waiting in the hospital to be discharged, she says
someone came into her room and wheeled her out for some more tests. And Janet found herself lying on this table with a
thin white sheet over her body. It was a narrow room with white walls, very
quiet. And looking at her surroundings, she saw that one entire wall was covered
from floor to ceiling with dials, buttons, switches, and monitors. There was a man dressed in a white doctor's
coat in the corner, busy with all this equipment. Janet eventually found an
image that approximate what she saw. You can see it here. She asked this man repeatedly for information, but he
totally ignored her. He did come over once to check on her, but never spoke to her. It was very strange. There were no
nurses coming in or out to explain what was happening, which usually happened during her entire stay. There was just
this one man, and he be she began to wonder if he even knew she was there.
She actually feel the heat from all this strange equipment. And yet, they weren't
really doing any tests to her at all. It was all very strange. So later she
investigated this and found out that there really was no record of any such room in the hospital and she tried to
talk about it but once again Janet was accused of imagining things. So Janet went home and began to recover from her
stroke and thankfully her recovery went really well. She started to get back to
normal fairly quickly though she was bedridden for months and more weird events occurred. A friend introduced her
to a gentleman by the name of Brian. And Brian was kind of a mysterious figure in Janet's life. He showed up and was
immediately very attentive and nurturing to her. Really helped her through her
recovery. And she did not know this guy. He was a little bit vague about who he
was and where he came from. He never had a car. Would just show up. Did not tell her where he lived even though she asked
him. Her husband was a pretty jealous guy. He never showed any jealousy. This
guy didn't show any romantic interest in Janet. Just wanted to help her recover.
She was very curious about why he was so friendly and nurturing to her. One day
he gave her a book, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Mur Murphy,
PhD. And he told her basically, I have it on good authority. If you follow what it
says to the letter every night, you can heal yourself. And he was very emphatic
about this. And Janet listened to him and read the book and did what it said. And her recovery was amazing. In fact,
she had to go regularly to the doctors for angiograms, a very painful process.
She went back after reading this book and doing the instructions and the doctors were utterly astonished. They
could not find any sign of her stroke at all. They told her this is not possible.
There's all these signs and symptoms and we can tell. They could not tell that
she had ever had a problem. They did tell her that because of the stroke she should not get pregnant and should take
very careful precautions to never get pregnant because it could be very dangerous for her. At the time she and
her husband were trying to get pregnant but unsuccessfully. So they didn't really pay too much attention to all of
this. Still more high stranges going on because every now and then Janet would
see UFOs. These were mostly distant lights in the sky, usually at night. And
she thought everybody was seeing these. She did not really think of them too much. She just thought, "Well, I guess
there's unexplained things up there." She didn't really connect it to her own experiences. This time, she's not really
thinking about that encounter at age 10. She certainly didn't think it was a gray alien or anything like that. But yeah,
she started having all these UFO encounters. And then one evening while
driving with her husband and her sister's kids, her babies, she had a
very dramatic missing time encounter. And this one changed everything. It was
1985. Janet and her husband were driving to his parents' home in Canyon Country.
At that time, this was a pretty remote desert area just north of Los Angeles.
With them were Janet's sisters, two babies. Jen and her husband were babysitting them because they didn't
know if they were ever going to be able to have kids themselves. So, this was a remote area at the end of a couple of
dirt roads. There were no other houses around, no traffic lights, really no traffic at all. They left for home
around 9:00 p.m. and were about a quarter of a mile from the house when the car mysteriously died. Now, Janet's
husband was a professional mechanic, and he opened the hood and couldn't find anything wrong with the car. So, he told
Janet to just wait there in the car with the babies, and he would walk the quarter mile back home and get help.
Janet, of course, had no choice but to agree. And as soon as her husband left, something strange happened. As Janet
says, "All of a sudden, I was terrified. I was so afraid that aliens or somebody
from space was going to come down and get us that I was making myself sick. I
was so afraid. I can't even tell you the emotion of the fear that I had. I was so
obsessively terrified. I could not stop looking out the windows to see if anything was coming. My common sense
kept saying, "Don't be so ridiculous and stupid. There's nothing to be afraid of." But I couldn't overcome the intense
fear. And that's the last thing Janet recalls. Her next memory is of being on
the 14 freeway driving home. She had zero memory of her husband arriving, the
car being fixed, or anything. And for some reason, she never thought to bring it up again. Became just another strange
incident in her life that had no explanation. Even then, the idea that
she was being visited by UFOs or ETSs never really entered her mind. So,
following this missing time encounter, the bridge that Janet and her husband had never expected to cross came. Janet
was pregnant. And in fact, she thinks she got pregnant on that night. So, this
was a a big deal. Her husband really wanted her to get an abortion. She
refused. She wanted to carry this baby. Doctors were really upset about it and finally they agreed as long as Janet
allowed herself to be monitored very carefully and would concede to having a
cesarian section. Janet agreed and the pregnancy progressed. Was not easy for
her. It was a very difficult pregnancy. She had very severe morning sickness. It
was also around this time she discovered what appears to be an implant in her mouth, a little hard lump on the side of
her cheek. She wanted to get it removed. She showed it to the doctor and the doctor's like, "I think we should just
let this slide by for now." But it really bothered her and she started to really wonder about it as well. But she
gave birth to a very healthy, happy baby girl. Uh it was a very wonderful time in
her life other than she and her husband started to experience some friction and
ultimately they would end up with a separation and a divorce. Interestingly
her child would start to sleepwalk. They'd find her outside sometimes and
later it appears that her child was also having experiences.
But with the divorce going on, Janet ended up moving back into her mother's
house, this haunted house. And it turns out that her mother was also very, very
sick. She was suffering from dementia, also had severe heart problems and her
health was failing fast. So Janet found herself not only caring for a very young
child, but her ailing mother. And it was so difficult for her. In fact, she was a
little bit overwhelmed. It was around this time that she had an amazing
angelic encounter, an encounter with an angel that really helped her through this very trying time. This was probably
the most difficult period of Janet's life so far with her ailing mother and
her young daughter. She was just overwhelmed. And one evening after fixing a meal for her mother and putting
her to bed, Janet went downstairs with her little dog, ate some food, and then
cleaned up and closed up the kitchen. She was preparing to go back upstairs
for the night. She opened the kitchen door and with her dog stepped into the high ceiling foyer in front of the
staircase. But as soon as she turned and made a step towards the staircase, both
Janet and her dog stopped to avoid what appeared to be a person. But looking up,
she could see clearly this was not a person. Instead, it was an enormous
apparition composed of glowing silvery white light just standing there,
towering almost 15, 20 ft high to the very top of the high ceilings. So Janet
immediately took a step backwards, stared up, and thought to herself, "What am I seeing?" And as Janet says, it was
a giant angel right in front of me. She was cloudy, but I could see what it was.
It was an angel. She was huge. It just took up the whole area. It stayed there
right in front of me for about a minute while my dog was scared, trying to cautiously bark at it. was looking down
at me and looking around as well. So Janet was stunned. She wasn't really
religious, had certainly never given much thought to angels. There was no mistaking it. She could even see what
looked like wings, though they weren't sharply defined and looked like a bright aura surrounding this figure. But this
angel remained there glowing for a full minute or even two. She could feel the
sheer power of its presence and could feel a kind of quiet and gentle vibration coming from it. She had the
sense that it wanted to be seen. So, she just stood there in stunned silence watching it. And her dog saw it, too.
So, she knew she wasn't imagining it. And in fact, as it hovered there, Janet
got the distinct feeling that it was sending her a message. And the message was that there were going to be big
changes coming in her life. As Janet says, I knew things were going to
change. I knew something was going to happen. And it did. It got terrible. And
in the end, my mother died. As you can imagine, that was a very, very difficult
for Janet, but she got through it. And time passed. her daughter grew up and
things started to slowly settle back to normal, at least for a little while.
One day, uh, in around 1990, Janet was driving up to Washington to
pick up her daughter who was visiting there and somehow got to the her
destination far quicker, hours earlier than she should have. she had added time
and this time she was able to confirm it because this sort of thing had happened a few times to her and she kind of just wrote it off like I must have not looked
at the clock correctly. I don't know what's going on here. But on this occasion there was no way she could have
arrived as early as she did. So that was very confusing to her and she really
wondered about it cuz missing time is one thing but added time is a different ballgame. Very hard to explain. So Janet
also found herself suffering from all kinds of strange health problems,
allergies of all different kinds. She had situational vertigo. She had
chemical sensitivities, all kinds of really weird and unusual health problems
plagued her. So this was more difficult things that she had to deal with. She
her doctors really had no answers. They did not know what was causing it.
So this was another weird complication in her life which she began to realize
was just not going to be a normal life. It wasn't long after this that Janet was
driving through the desert one day, one evening rather, and had a very dramatic
UFO encounter. This was her first real dramatic, undeniable UFO sighting. It
was 2005 and Janet was driving alone through Victorville in the Southern
California desert. She preferred to drive late at night because it was much cooler and there was far less traffic.
She was driving well over the speed limit and looking through the rear view mirror. And this is when she was
surprised and somewhat alarmed to see red, blue, and white lights behind her.
But it was strange because these lights seem to be circulating rapidly and swooping down from above at a very high
rate of speed. And not only that, they appeared from quite a distance and yet we're approaching so fast that she
actually feared a collision. And she thought, could this be the police? Is
this an ambulance or an emergency vehicle? What is going on? So in her
haste and panic to pull over, she nearly lost control of the car. But the lights
then swooped directly over her car, almost buzzing it, and then completely disappeared. She did get a quick glimpse
of what appeared to be a quote large, smooth, and rounded disc. It flew upward
and over her car, leaving her badly shaken, and only then did she realize
that there was no siren, no engine noise, no sound whatsoever coming from
this thing. As Janet says, I had no idea what the hell was happening. It freaked
me out because there was no one there and it was gone as fast as it came. So, was it a UFO? And all the abrupt
confusion, Janet honestly didn't think so at first, but it was only after she thought about it, remembered exactly
what she saw, realized how strange it was, that she really began to wonder about it. And after reviewing the event,
she became 100% convinced that this was a genuine UFO. And also strange was that
once again, she arrived home an hour earlier than she should have. She had
kept a very careful track of time, so there was no mistaking this. That UFO encounter was a huge wake-up call for
Janet. She tried to explain it away as an emergency vehicle, but it made no
sense. This thing went over her car. She saw the disc shape. She really wanted to
explain it away, but she just couldn't. And this really got her thinking about
her past and the many strange events she'd experienced. Then one day she was
watching TV and guess what? A show about gray ETS comes on. This was around 2013.
And seeing the images of gray aliens on the TV screen nearly knocked her to the
floor because there was an image there that was almost identical to this quote
monster boy that she had seen as a child. So she knew then and there that
what had happened to her and she realized oh my gosh I am having contact
with ETSs the missing time all of the UFO sightings the facetof face
encounters with humanoids all of it suddenly made sense. So she ended up
contacting Muon. She submitted a report and she started thinking about maybe
going under regressive hypnosis. But meanwhile, she had this ET implant
or what she thought was some weird foreign body in her mouth and hearing
about implants, she wondered about it and she decided, you know, this is really bothering me. I think I'm going
to have this looked at. I'm going to see if I can have this removed. So, this turned out to be another chapter of high
stranges in Janet's life. This weird object in her mouth had bothered her for
years. So Janet finally decided to take action. She went to a doctor who told her that he would be unable to remove
it, that she would have to visit an oral surgeon. So Janet made an appointment
with a surgeon. There were more X-rays and testing and the surgeon agreed that this was a foreign body and he would
remove it. He says he could not identify it. And Janet knew that this object was
strange cuz it had no right being there. So she gave the surgeon very explicit
instructions on what to do with this object. As she told him, "Listen,
whatever thing you take out of my mouth, I want you to keep it. If there's something in there, anything, I want you
to keep it. Send it to a lab to have it tested, but I want that specimen to come
back to me." So the doctor agreed. The surgery went smoothly. The object was
removed. Janet received three stitches. And afterwards, sure enough, he gave her
the object in a small vial filled with liquid. And as they both suspected, the
object, whatever it was, was in fact metallic. The surgeon did not say what
kind of metal, Janet does still have it in her possession, but has yet to have it tested. She was just happy to finally
have it removed. Janet was very relieved to get that object out of her body. To
this day, she's still somewhat ambivalent about it, but she does feel like this is very possibly an ET
implant. Also, one thing I should mention, Janet says that she was having
weird beeping like tones in her head. This is something quite a few contacties
report. It's not tonitis. This is something else. Uh, possibly implants.
There does seem to be a connection here. At any rate, this was something she was also experiencing.
But now following this, she decided it was time. She was going to go under hypnosis.
She contacted a very well-known hypnotherapist who specializes in this
sort of thing and had herself regressed to her encounter at age 10. And she
found out that yes, this was more than she consciously remembered. She didn't
remember a whole lot more than seeing this gray ET and the red button-down
plaid shirt and blue jeans on a bike, but she remembered some. And yeah, it looks like she was taken on board. She
did see more ETS as well. So, this hypnotic regression was a big step
forward in understanding her experiences. Going under hypnotic regression was a turning point for
Janet. She was finally facing the fact that she'd had encounters. She was very curious to find out if she could
remember anything else during her encounter with this little alien boy.
So, she was taken back to that time and she cried openly under hypnosis as she
recalled being taken to what seemed to be a cloudy white area. This little gray
alien boy was with her, reassuring her while two other beings stood by her.
They both wore cloaks and were looking kind of away from her. One of the beings
she sensed wanted to take her, but the other did not. And meanwhile, the gray
who had brought her there just kind of stood by while the other two debated. This is what she recalled. And as Janet
says, I don't remember whatever they might have said or done, but they told me something. They told me something
before I came back. And for the life of me, I just can't quite remember what
they told me. One of the most surprising things to me, I actually did not want to
leave him when it was my time to go back on my bike. I was crying if you can believe it. I can't explain it. I was so
torn. When I was going back, I wanted to stay with him. I'm going to be talking
about that for the rest of my life. I miss him very much. And to this day, if
you told me he was outside, I would go out there and talk to him, be with him.
So no, there was no denying it. Janet knew she was a contactee. It was the
only explanation for what she had experienced at that young age and throughout her life. And
there was no choice but to accept the fact that she was a contactee. And the
fact was, she still felt connected to this little gray alien boy. Sometimes
she would get little telepathic communications. And as time went on, this would become even more pronounced.
But in 2016, Janet decided that she was going to move to Texas. She had a new boyfriend and
they were living there in a little trailer. Uh this was a difficult time for her. Their finances were not great,
but this is when she had what she first thought was a dream about being on board
a UFO. But when she woke up, she had absolute
physical evidence that this was not a dream. So yeah, she had another onboard
UFO encounter and this was followed very shortly by yet another. So yeah, two
more on board encounters once again confirming that Janet is a contactee. So
in this first dream, what Janet thought was a dream, Janet found herself sitting in a chair very much like a dentist's
chair or an old-fashioned barber chair. Behind her stood three or four grays.
She said they had sharp angular faces, a little different from the alien boy she had encountered as a child. And as Janet
says, they were all looking straight down my throat, like way down to my stomach. They inserted an apparatus for
a clear path all the way down. I remember no pain or discomfort, just
dismay about what was happening. It wasn't a bad thing. I was just sort of stunned. I don't know what they did now.
Although she initially thought this might be a dream, Janet now believes wholeheartedly that this was a real
experience because upon awakening she discovered a strange orangecoled residue
on her neck. She was horrified. She quickly rushed to the bathroom to scrub herself clean. She felt an incredible
urgency to get this substance off of her body. And this was no easy task. It was
dry, was crusty, was about 3 and 1/2 in long. It looked to her almost like a
finger had smeared it on her neck, but she really wanted to get it off. Perhaps
because it was proof that this dream wasn't a dream at all. So, while this experience was traumatic, she quickly
had reasons to feel positive about it. Because, as Janet says, the very next
day was the beginning of all my health changes for the better. After this is
when I was in communication with them. They were coaching me what to do to help myself and it has all worked out well.
It was around that time that Janet did have another vivid UFO quote dream, but
again she believes it was probably a real experience, another onboard encounter.
Again, she found herself sitting in this same chair as before, unable to move.
Surrounding her was a cloudy milky whiteness. She was alone at first, but
momentarily a gray showed up and he was holding a large needle. As Janet says,
the needle was huge. It was long and it was huge. And I was so scared. I
screamed and pleaded, "Don't do this. You can't do this. You are not allowed
to do this to me." He did not hear me. He did not care. He came straight forward from across the room and he was
not stopping. It was going to happen. and he just put that needle in my arm and I passed out and I don't remember
anything. It was bad. I didn't like it. So those two onboard encounters were not
positive for her. She felt these were negative experiences. But she does admit that following these encounters, her
life changed dramatically for the better. Her health stabilized. She
started to get a lot more communication from the ETSs who she felt were actually guiding her with her health problems.
She left her boyfriend, moved back to California, found another gentleman, had
built a relationship with him which turned out to be a wonderful relationship. He treated her very
kindly. They were able to get a job that was both rewarding and lucrative. So her
life changed around completely. She was very, very happy. And now she had the
time to really look into her past. And being adopted, she was always very
curious about where she came from, what about her genetics. So she had her
genetics done. She started looking into her background. And she got some incredible shocking surprises when she
did this. She found out she was a twin. She found out that her genetic history
is very very unusual and has a lot of unexplained things surrounding it. So
once again, Janet found herself embroiled in high stranges and each time
she had some questions answered, it would just bring more questions. So this
was really a lifong search for answers for Janet. And this is where she is
today. She's still searching for answers, but this is how Janet feels
about her encounters currently. Investigating her past, it was opening a
can of worms because the first weird thing that Janet found out was that her birth certificate had no hospital
listed. And every effort she made to find more information just led to more
excuses and denials. And then she found out about her biological father and it was a huge
shock because it turned out that he had sired somewhere between 50 and 100
children and in fact he had been arrested for bigamy and was selling babies. He escaped prison. He has yet to
be located. By now he has probably passed away. But that was an incredible
shock. Janet's ancestry also revealed some other surprises. She learned that
she has direct relations to two royal lines in Europe, both in France and
England. And as Janet says, here's the thing. Nothing in my life has ever been
normal. I just can't be normal. I can't have a normal story. So despite all the
drama and high strangess, Janet feels overall that her experiences have been positive. She does wonder if her thyroid
problems were connected in some way to her UFO encounters with possible radiation exposure, though she has no
direct evidence of this. But given that nobody else in her family history reports any thyroid problems, she can't
rule it out. It was around this time that Janet finally found more relief for her many health problems when she began
meditating and communicating telepathically with what she calls her quote ET friends. She has come to look
upon them almost as her guides. But this was a very long journey. It was one that
reminded her again how unusual her life path has been. Following her encounters
in Texas, her health problems did improve dramatically. So if her health
problems were in any way attributable to her encounters, she's very grateful that steps were taken to help and heal her.
Janet also noticed a sharp increase in her psychic abilities. All her life, she
has had very strong intuition, including mediumship abilities. On a number of
occasions, she would receive very clear messages from the deceased loved ones of people around her, even complete
strangers. Usually, messages would come to her when someone near her had lost a
child. And on each occasion, Janet would relay the information, stunning the
recipient with the accuracy of her information and sometimes moving them to tears. Janet also reports a strong
connection to animals of all kinds, especially horses. In fact, a few have
given her great accolades with this. Many strange experiences continued.
Janet's daughter also reports very strong psychic abilities of many kinds.
Once the two of them shared a dream of going into space with a weird man in some kind of elevator. At least they
think it was a dream. On another occasion, Janet had a spontaneous out-of body experience where she found herself
being catapulted out of Earth's atmosphere, zipping through the stars and appearing in a completely different
time and place. More recently, this is in 2023, she narrowly avoided a serious auto
accident solely by a very powerful intuitive premonition. So, Janet does
have some final words about her experiences and what they mean to her. As Janet says, I feel like it's just a
part of my life. They do communicate with me regularly and have for about the
past 6 years or so. I'm able to ask questions or request information on
certain things. I get about 80% answered. I ask them straight up and get
most answers in the wee hours between 4:00 a.m. and 7 a.m. I do have health
issues and they help me with that. It's really amazing. I feel like I have them in my corner ready and wanting to give
me the information I seek. I now believe they have been with me always. In the
end, I will leave you with this. I miss the boy very much and think of him
often. I feel in some way that we are part of each other. I still hope to see
him again one day. So, that is the story of Janet's lifelong experiences, not
only with UFOs and extraterrestrials, but all kinds of high stranges, paranormal and psychic events of all
kinds. Janet is still in contact with these grays. Ultimately, she feels her
as she says that this has been a benevolent and positive experience. A
mixed bag certainly at first, but I think Janet's experiences and her account is a really good example of what
it's like to sort of go through this sort of experience. What can start out
as very confusing, very scary, ultimately leads the person on a pathway
towards healing, wisdom, enlightenment, and understanding. She certainly
believes she's had a spiritual awakening as a result of all of this. And as she
says, she would very much like to meet this gray alien boy again, which, you
know, could very well happen. Uh, as we do know, this is for most contactes
not a one-off. It's something that they experience throughout the entirety of their lives. That certainly seems to be
true in Janet's case. So, I do want to give Janet a huge thank you for allowing
me to interview her and share her experiences with a much wider audience.
Again, this should be considered a summary of her experiences. If you want to check out her whole story, do check
out my book, Humanoids and High Stranges: 20 True UFO Encounters. Janet
has a whole chapter about her experiences. And of course, there are many other people in the book who've
experienced similar events. What an unusual contact story. I mean, that gray
alien boy on a bicycle, I've never heard anything quite like it. I will say I
have several accounts of people who have seen grays dressed up in human clothes.
You know, whether it's a tuxedo suit, Whitley Strieber described that. Another lady told me the same thing. Or in
shirts or pants or what have you. So that to me is a very interesting aspect.
And again, I think this little gray alien was just trying to make Janet a
little more comfortable with his appearance. Amazing.
So, there you go, guys. I truly appreciate you guys watching. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Maybe learned
something. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep
searching for the truth. And yeah, keep having fun. I really think that's why we're here. All right, till next time,
guys. I will see you later. Bye for now.
