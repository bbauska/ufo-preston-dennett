SEVENTY CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE SEEN UFOS
Sep 11, 2021

Summary:
Sep 11, 2021
People from all walks of life have UFO encounters, and that includes celebrities. In fact, more and 
more famous people are now stepping forward to reveal their own sightings, or in some cases, actual 
face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials. Actors, singers, sports stars -- a huge number of 
superstars have had dramatic encounters with UFOs and aliens. 

This video presents more than 70 celebrity UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, UFO photographs, 
face-to-face meetings and even onboard UFO encounters -- they're all here. Many of these stars have 
faced intense ridicule and skepticism, but they are sticking to their stories. They not only 
believe in UFOs, they know!

What happens when a hugely famous person sees a UFO? Could the ETs be contacting famous people 
intentionally? Are the ETs reaching out to famous people because they know that celebrities have 
profound influence upon millions of people and have a platform to reach a very wide audience? 
Some of these cases seem to indicate this.

Whatever the reason, the list of superstars who have seen UFOs is longer than you might think. 
The seventy-plus cases presented here are likely just the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully this 
will inspire many other famous people to admit the truth about their own UFO encounters.

This video is dedicated to the late Timothy Green Beckley, author of "UFOs Among the Stars," 
one of the first books about celebrity UFO encounters.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to another episode of ufos and the paranormal. 
This is a fun episode I put together for you today. I call it 70 celebrities who have seen UFO's. There's 
actually more than 70. It's about 77. And some of these celebrities have more than seen UFO's. They've had 
face-to-face contact with ET's or been taken on board a UFO. You've probably heard of almost all of these 
celebrities. They're very famous. But I'm sure that some of these celebrities you did not know who have 
had encounters. There are several reasons why I wanted to do this episode. One is because I think people 
are fascinated by celebrities. Very interested in what they have to say. They have a lot of influence. So, 
I think it's important to know that they have seen UFOs. It's important to share their stories. 
I also think it's important because the fact that so many celebrities have had encounters shows 
that the ET's display no prejudice on who they contact. They contact people from all walks of life.

Timothy Green Beckley
and another reason I wanted to do this video is in honor of timothy green beckley. Timothy 
Green Beckley is a pioneering UFO investigator who recently passed away. He's really one of 
the first who wrote about celebrity encounters. He wrote an excellent book called, "UFOs 
Among the Stars", which I highly recommend. Several of the accounts in this list come from Timothy 
Green Beckley directly. However, since he wrote that book many many other celebrities have stepped 
forward and revealed their encounters. In this list I include actors and actresses, singers, songwriters, 
and sports stars. Pretty much exclusively. And there are a lot of them. This list is alphabetical so I'm 
going to start with a and work my way down through the alphabet. And talk about all these celebrities 
who have bravely stepped forward to share their encounters. 

The first celebrity I'd like to talk about is Dan Aykroyd. Dan Aykroyd is perhaps best known for starring 
in Saturday Night Live, the late night comedy series. He's also been in a ton of movies such as Coneheads 
which was about ET's. That's appropriate here. But Dan Aykroyd has also gone public with his own UFO 
encounters and, in fact, he's been a strong UFO advocate for years. He even hosted a 1990s paranormal 
series called, "Sci-Factor". And as Dan Aykroyd says in his own words he has seen UFO's and I quote, 
"I have seen four and I can't say that they are alien craft and neither can the Air Force. The Air Force 
has been very interested in this. They don't deny the existence of the hyper dynamic super aerodynamic 
craft. They don't deny Dan Aykroyd says that what he saw were quote "definitely aerial constructs 
of some kind". On one occasion he said one of these objects hovered directly over his head 
right above him. He had a close up sighting but he has not gone into great detail about 
what he's saw. But he certainly has discussed the subject many times and he has theories 
on why the government continues to cover up UFO's. As he says, "I believe that there are probably many 
species coming and going and that the Air Force is very interested but they can't come out and say 
fearing it would provoke a complete breakdown of society". So, that's Dan Aykroyd's story.

Next celebrity I want to talk about is singer, songwriter Ryan Adams of Whiskeytown. 
On July 11, 2013 Ryan Adams was driving near his home in Glendale, Aalifornia. This was around 11 
p.m when he saw police cars and helicopters actually chasing an object through the sky. 
As he says, "this thing was huge. If it was a blimp than that was an effed up blimp. Whatever I saw was 
like a real sci-fi film come to life. Choppers in the air near it. What is that thing uh he 
wasn't able to get a pic because he didn't want to grab his phone while he was driving. 
But he's absolutely convinced that he saw something. He did receive some trolling as a 
result of going public. But as he says in response to the trolls who don't believe him every person 
that sees something whack and unidentified aren't on drugs. Crawl back into the caves, cro-magnons, 
so some of these celebrities have been ridiculed as a result of going public. But many many have 
still stepped bravely forward and revealed their encounters.

One of the most famous people ever to reveal his ufo encounters is none other than muhammad ali he 
really needs no introduction he was originally called cassius clay but changed his name to 
muhammad ali and yeah he's super famous and thanks to timothy green beckley who interviewed 
ali we know that muhammad ali has had many many encounters one of his encounters occurred in 1970 
while he was in new york jogging very very early one morning and as muhammad ali says in his own 
words I happen to look up just before dawn as I often do while running and there hovering 
above us was this brilliant light hanging as if by an invisible thread at first I thought it was 
a beacon projected from a helicopter but moments later a similar object passed in front of us 
i brought it to the attention of my trainer who was standing nearby we watched them come from behind the skyline and move slowly across the sky for at least 
15 minutes the best I can describe the sighting is to say they were just round and big 
muhammad ali later found out that there was another witness to that sighting who 
as he says was a pilot about to land at newark airport further research actually revealed that 
there were a number of people who cited objects on that evening or that morning 
and that was not muhammad ali's only sighting not even close he says he's seen them many times 
on another time he had a large cigar-shaped object pass right over his vehicle this was 
probably his nearest sighting as muhammad ali says the closest happened when a cigar shake when a 
cigar-shaped ship hovered briefly over a car I was a passenger in one night driving north on the new 
jersey turnpike what a sight it was we could see the shadow made by the ufo as it passed over the 
pavement of the road in the light of the full moon on another occasion he saw another cigar-shaped 
craft as he says at first I thought this flicker was the north star rising in the heavens 
however within moments I could tell I was watching something out of the ordinary before I could 
blink my eyes this light had come down toward the mountains until it hovered right above the valley 
here I knew I couldn't be dreaming sure enough it was still there this had to be one of those 
big ships they talk about the ufo was streamlined and shaped sort of like a cigar but blunt on both 
ends I couldn't see any windows or anything but I'm certain there must have been people on board 
the very next night he saw the same or a similar craft and on this occasion he had his skeptical 
business manager gene kilroy with him kilroy had told muhammad ali when they discussed ufos 
that muhammad ali must be imagining things but on this occasion jean kilroy actually 
saw the ufo himself and changed his position on the subject saying and I quote there was 
something mighty peculiar happening over the camp that night I looked up and saw this thing this ufo 
doing acrobatics up among the stars the sighting changed my previous opinion concerning ufos so 
muhammad ali has probably or at least claims to have seen more ufos than any other celebrity 
I'm aware of or who has gone public muhammad ali says that he has had no less than 16 sightings 
so yeah apparently uh he's in contact with ufos because if someone is having that many 
sightings uh I think it's more than coincidence and he's not the only celebrity there are so many the next person I'd like to talk about 
is actually another sports star his name is Gareth Bale and he's a football star 
from wales and he is absolutely convinced he saw a ufo as gareth said says in his own words 
there are 100 percent aliens I'm 100 sure of that I saw a ufo myself I actually have once 
i actually have aliens exist and the evidence is everywhere there is solid evidence people 
just need to look at them the us government has released photos and videos of the flying objects 
there are aliens it can't be fake aliens really exist I definitely saw a ufo once 
uh he didn't go into detail but as you can see he's absolutely convinced he did see one 
uh and another very famous person who claims to have seen ufos 
is the singer Victoria Beckham and she actually says she photographed a ufo 
uh she's of course posh spice from the spice girls and she says that she saw 
and photographed a ufo hovering over her home in beverly hills this was on october 29th 2011.
and she saw this very bright globe of light and photographed it you can see that this 
object is very bright casting a light on the trees below which makes it look like it's 
fairly close to the ground she tweeted about it tweeting ufo hovering above our house last night 
and says that she's not the only one who saw it uh she like many celebrities did receive a 
lot of ridicule people telling her ah that's just the moon you photographed 
uh only I think she knows for sure she was the one who was there other people weren't 
so I don't think it's fair to judge unless people have actually investigated the sighting themselves 
at any rate she is convinced she saw a ufo but in victoria beckham's defense it was not a full 
moon on that night in fact it was just a thin crescent moon so it couldn't have been the moon 
i don't know you can see the photograph yourself and make up your own mind another celebrity who 
David Bowie
has seen ufos is none other than david bowie who really needs no introduction he's mega famous 
and david bowie claims to have had multiple ufo sightings he was a much younger man and at that 
time was working for two gentlemen who were ufo researchers and over a period of a year he had 
multiple sightings sometimes nightly he would see multiple objects and on one evening he saw 
he says up to six or seven objects he was actually viewing these objects from an observatory and 
he said that it was absolutely incredible what he saw as david bowie says in his own words 
i used to work for two guys who put out a ufo magazine magazine in england about six years ago 
and I made sightings six seven times a night for about a year when I was in the observatory 
we had regular cruises that came over we knew the 615 was coming in and I would meet up with 
another one and they would be stationary 
for about a half an hour and then after verifying what they'd been doing that day they'd shoot off 
so yeah he's had multiple sightings and is absolutely convinced he's seen ufos another 
Johnny Carson
very famous person who didn't go public with encounters but was actually outed by someone else 
is johnny carson the late night talk show host johnny carson never admitted to seeing ufos
but according to drummer buddy rich who was johnny carson's friend johnny carson called him up one 
evening and admitted that he had seen ufos he told buddy rich and I quote I just saw one at the time 
johnny carson was in a hotel in las vegas and he told buddy rich that he saw a ufo he said 
it was real bright I was standing on the diving board ready to plunge into the 
pool when this brilliant light passed overhead traveling at outrageous speed
according to buddy rich johnny carson told him that this object was in view for about 40 seconds 
before just darting away unfortunately johnny carson never went public with this so we will 
just have to take buddy rich's word for it but if true it's an incredible sighting
Charo
another person who has gone public another celebrity is charo charo is a dancer and actress 
she appeared on the love boat and many other television series and according to charo 
she says and I quote I was in mirja spain that's my hometown I was a little girl 
one evening while I was out in the back of the house I happened to look up at the sky and they're passing overhead was this shiny object it was really big bigger than a 
star holy chihuahua I thought what is this it hopped in the sky like a mexican jumping bean 
i was very impressed so much so that I have never forgotten what happened
George Clinton
uh there are so many celebrities who have seen ufos it's really quite shocking 
another celebrity who has seen ufos is none other than the rhythm and blues star the funk musician 
george clinton who had an amazing encounter on a deserted toronto highway in canada this was during 
the wee hours of the morning and along with him was the james brown bassist william bootsy collins 
and he was dr bootsy was driving when they saw it was dark they saw this bright beam of light which 
came down from above them and looking up they saw this object and this beam of light actually 
struck their car three times they said it was shiny and gold looking it completely freaked 
them out at one point started to really get scared and george clinton turned to bootsy and said quote 
do you think you can step on it and that's when bootsy also felt a little bit of a flash of fear 
what's very interesting about this encounter is it looks like they had missing time 
because when this object first appeared there were other cars on the road behind them they saw this other car this beam of light hits them the next thing they know this other car is gone 
and uh they're looking at the street lights which are now coming on so it was as if hours had passed 
or there was some sort of time distortion it looks like they had missing time they did actually talk 
about this encounter on video on youtube you can find it on youtube so yeah it looks like 
george clinton had a missing time ufo encounter and was struck by a beam of light from a ufo 
very interesting and so many people are have bravely stepped forward uh one person who 
allegedly had an encounter is someone who was called the most trusted man in america 
Walter Cronkite
none other than the newscaster walter cronkite who allegedly saw a ufo during a rocket launch out in 
the south pacific but I'm not going to go too much into this sighting because after doing some research 
I'm not so sure that it's a reliable account it comes from researcher bill nell a ufo researcher 
who is now quite controversial there are a number of people who thinks who think he actually hoaxed 
this whole account and walter cronkite certainly never stepped forward saying he saw a ufo 
i just wanted to let people know that I am aware of this claim that walter cronkite saw a ufo 
but I just don't know if this report is reliable enough to really trust so I am including it here 
just briefly uh but I'm going to chalk this one up as an unknown uh one person who's very famous 
Russell Crowe
who has claims for photograph the ufo is russell crowe who probably became best known 
for his role in the film gladiator but has since become very famous for a number of movie roles 
and russell crowe is absolutely convinced he photographed a ufo as he says a friend and I 
set up a camera to capture fruit bats rising from botanic gardens this was a big surprise 
and he shows this photograph which appears to show an unknown object this occurred on march 6 2013 
and some people claim that this photograph does not show a genuine ufo but russell crowe 
is sticking to his guns and believes that he photographed an actual unknown object 
so here's the photograph uh you'll just have to make up your own minds about it but russell crowe 
believes that it's a genuine ufo someone who has made a big splash lately for going public 
Miley Cyrus
is actor and musician miley cyrus who rose to fame for her role as hannah montana the 
disney series but is now a world famous musician and the daughter of billy ray cyrus famous for 
his song achy breaky heart at any rate miley cyrus is convinced she saw a ufo and actual 
actually saw occupants as well as miley cyrus says I was driving through san bernardino with my 
friend and I got chased down by some sort of ufo the best way to describe it is a flying snow plow 
it had this big plow in the front of it and it was glowing yellow I did see it flying 
and my friend saw it too there were a couple of other cars on the road and they also stopped 
to look so I think what I saw was real and I did see a being sitting in front of the flying object 
it looked at me and we made eye contact and I think that's what really shook me 
looking into the eyes of something that I couldn't quite wrap my head around
so yeah she thinks she actually saw ET's face to face 
uh you know I find it interesting because there are an awful lot of celebrities and musicians that 
claim to have had contact with ufos I am not so sure this is a coincidence ET seemed to love 
creative people artists musicians writers teachers doctors environmentalists social rights workers
human rights animal rights these are the people they're very interested in people who are doing 
good work for humanity trying to enlighten humanity and that's certainly true of musicians 
interestingly miley cyrus's father billy ray also believes in ufos and thinks he actually photographed some of these glowing 
sort of orb shaped objects during a beautiful sunset hard to say for sure 
but here we have two musicians father and daughter who both believe they have had ufo encounters
Vic Dimon
another celebrity who some of you may not have heard of especially if you're young is vic dimon 
but he's actually a quite famous singer and in 1953 he was at fort sam houston in san antonio 
texas at a drive-in theater when he saw a ufo I found this really interesting because there are 
a lot of cases of ufo sightings that drive in theaters I wrote a whole book about it but at 
any rate vic dimon was at this theater when he saw an incredible ufo and I'll just quote him briefly 
about what he says he saw as victim on says and I quote there was this peculiar glowing thing 
in the sky here was an object that stayed overhead for six or seven minutes and when it did disappear 
it left a trail that could be seen for quite some time was not a meteor it was just too bright and 
lasted too long and as far as he was concerned it was much more interesting than the movie 
Baron Davis
another very famous person who is claims to have had a ufo encounter is baron davis baron 
davis is a basketball star uh he has worked for a number of different teams the hornets the warriors 
and the la clippers but he says he also had a ufo cutter in july of 2013. he said he was driving 
back from las vegas this was during the hours of the morning was about 4 00 am when he saw a bright 
light ahead of him that he at first thought was a truck but suddenly he was disoriented had a memory 
lapse and the next thing he knew he was not in his car and in fact said he was being poked by quote 
half human half ugly mfers his next memory was being four hours away in montebello and he had 
no idea how he got there as baron davis says in his own words I was actually abducted by aliens 
two weeks ago I saw this light and it's a big truck and I said oh this is going to be traffic 
i was driving and driving and the next thing you know there's a steel thing and these crazy looking 
people half human half ugly looking mfers they were poking me on the nose looking at my eyes 
they had my hands tied and the next thing you know I was in montebello dude burning rubber 
on the way back to l.a at four o'clock in the morning they were poking me on my nose and s they 
were poking me on my nose and they were looking at me in my eyes they had my hands like tied up
so he's convinced that he was taken on board a ufo and probed by aliens and he's not the only 
one who's had this type of encounter another person who had a really dramatic sighting is 
Sammy Davis Jr
one of the most accomplished entertainers in the world sammy davis jr he's a triple threat 
sammy davis jr is a singer an actor and a dancer uh was part of the 
famous rat pack with frank sinatra and other guys dean martin and sammy davis heard about 
ufo sightings going on in california and he really wanted to see them and he did he's one 
of the first really big celebrities to go public with his sightings in august of 1952 you heard 
about these settings going on in palm springs california and as he says I wasn't to be left out 
and he went there and went looking for ufos and actually saw them he saw a number of 
small silver disks which he says appeared and quote floated overhead and as he watched they 
performed incredible maneuvers proving to him beyond any doubt that they were actual spacecraft 
as sammy davis jr says first they would stand still and then they would take off and stop 
again before finally shooting away enough flash I feel quite strongly that if they wanted to harm 
the human race they could have done so long ago so he feels that they are absolutely benevolent
Tom DeLonge
another musician who has gone public and received quite a bit of ridicule but has 
really had a profound effect on this field is tom delong the star of the musical group 
blink 182. he actually left the group so he could pursue his ufo research and he formed 
of course the to the stars academy and it's really trying to push this subject forward 
and this is apparently because of his own encounters with the phenomena 
he had a really incredible encounter he says up in china lake california as he says and I quote 
i saw some really anomalous stuff one night out in the desert zipping across the stars 
horizon to horizon zigzagging that really blew my mind because no satellites moved that way 
but I can tell you what it was I think like most people the stuff that I've seen is a lot of stuff 
on the internet where I bet some of it really is true but you really don't know which pieces
and tom de long says that he has had actual face-to-face contact or communication with ETs 
on another occasion as he says I woke up right around three a.m my whole body felt like it had 
static electricity and I opened my eyes and the fire is still going he's out camping and there's a 
conversation going on outside the tent it sounded like there were about 20 people there talking 
and instantly my mind goes okay they're at our campsite they're not here to hurt us they're 
talking about stuff but I can't make out what they're saying but they're working on something 
then I close my eyes and wake up and the fire is out and I have about three hours of lost time so 
here we have another person claiming to have been abducted by ETs another very famous celebrity 
Melinda Dillon
another very famous person who claims to have had a ufo encounter is melinda dillon you might not 
recognize her name but you absolutely do know about her she starred in the movie a christmas 
story and also had a starring role in the movie close encounters she was the one whose little boy 
had been taken on board the ufo in the movie and she along with richard dreyfuss was led to devil's 
tower where they had face-to-face contact in the movie but what many people don't know is she has 
actually had a close encounter she was interviewed by timothy greenbeckley and revealed that she had 
an amazing encounter while staying along the california coast in malibu which is a huge ufo 
hot spot she had a little apartment overlooking the ocean one evening at the time she was in a 
lot of pain she was quite ill and apparently she may have actually been healed by the ETs 
and I'll just let melinda describe in her own words what happened as melinda says 
there was this orange light out over the ocean I stared at it for a while and it was as if 
it was saying to me come with us come with us mentally I said I wouldn't 
i told them to go away and leave me alone but I stood in the window for more than an hour
again at this time she was in such intense pain that she was quote in her own words nearly 
paralyzed but while she stood at the window she said there was very little pain it was very 
soothing and she also felt that there was quote communication between them 
and me so this may have actually been a healing encounter which certainly isn't unique 
and again malibu is a huge ufo hot spot but what's really interesting about this encounter 
is this was right before literally two weeks before she got the starring role in 
one of the most famous ufo movies of all times close encounters of the third time the third 
kind so maybe not a coincidence at all that ET's reached out to her it's very interesting 
Morton Downey Jr
another very famous uh celebrity who apparently had a ufo encounter 
is the controversial talk show host morton downey jr he's very much like 
jerry springer type very controversial uh talk show host and uh during one episode 
about ufos on his show he was actually hypnotized by ufo researcher jean mundy and revealed 
a ufo encounter in which he actually not only saw a ufo but was apparently taken on board uh 
he was removed from the stage and hypnotized and filmed during this whole hypnosis session this was 
in 1954 and he was droving on a boston post road and as martin downey jr says in his own 
words and I'll just quote brief snippets of what he said I was a young kid I had to get to boston 
for a convention it was late at night and I'd have been driving for two and a half hours I'm 
outside of hartford connecticut we don't have big roads we just have this two-lane boston post road 
and I'm driving along and there is this star to my right and it's always right outside the 
window of my car I drove 40 to 50 miles with this star must be an airplane but it's moving with me 
I'm driving I'm zigzagging and now this star is in front of me 
there's an overpass and I see this fog coming down over this overpass must be a fog patch it's right 
over the bridge I hit the fog and my lights are going down my car is stopping by itself I turn 
over to the side so I can get off the road I'm in the dark except for this gray pulsating light 
at this point he heard a voice which said in his head telepathically you have nothing 
to fear he gets a little nervous and tries to get out of the car but is unable to open his door 
he can't open his window or his vent he tries to start the car it won't start and he keeps hearing 
this voice saying you have nothing to fear over and over again he says at this point the hair 
on his head and on his arms is standing up and he's very confused when all of a sudden he says 
my whole vehicle is being picked up off the road I don't feel any motion I'm just being lifted off 
the road I don't see any faces I don't feel any touch but I keep hearing a voice you have nothing 
to fear at this point he felt a strong pain in his chest and he wondered if he was 
having a heart attack or an anxiety attack uh he kept hearing this voice you have nothing to fear 
all he could see was this fog he had a sense of timelessness uh next thing he knows the 
his car is being gently placed back on the road as he says I see the pavement 
and the swirling as the fog as it starts to pick up automatically the car starts to go on my window 
rolls down I look at my watch it's now ten minutes to two I leave and I drive further up the road 
I'm tired I'm probably hallucinating when I check into the cabin I have to wake up the manager
the guy in the cabin his watch says one time and my watch says 43 minutes less
and at one point during this hypnotic session he did actually see faces he said he saw this cone 
of light and he saw quote many beautiful faces so this was actually played live on the morton downey 
jr show and it was funny because during this whole hypnotic session there was a disclaimer 
going up on the screen saying that martin downey doesn't really believe he was abducted by aliens 
so all this time he's talking about being sucked up into this craft and seeing faces and then being 
gently placed back on the road and having nothing to fear and so forth there's this disclaimer 
repeatedly flashing on the screen saying martin downey doesn't really believe he's being abducted 
by aliens while he's saying he's being abducted by aliens so he kind of backpedaled this whole 
story a bit but what's interesting is his story matches very well with other people's accounts 
so did he or didn't he uh I'll leave it to you to decide but he's certainly 
uh one of many celebrities who have stepped forward making claims to have been taken on 
board a ufo or had face-to-face encounters with aliens another celebrity who's very well known 
Fran Drescher
uh who is also claimed without a ufo encounter is fran drescher she's a comedian who is best 
known for her starring role in the nanny a very successful sitcom and fran drescher who 
has now stepped forward and said that she believes she was actually abducted by aliens she and her 
ex-husband she says you know it's funny because peter her ex-husband 
peter and I both saw aliens before we knew each other doing the same thing driving on the road 
with our dads we were both in junior high a few years later we met and we realized that 
we both had the same experience I think that somehow we were programmed to meet 
we both have this scar it's the exact same scar on the exact same spot
fran drescher's ex-husband has denied this uh he he says that uh fran uh has her own story and he has his 
uh but he's not so sure that uh he was abducted by aliens but fran is not backing down
pete told her that the scar was actually
her scar was from a burn that she had received and uh fran doesn't buy that she thinks that's 
a screen memory as fran says I said to him that's what the aliens programmed us to think but really 
that's where the chip is so yeah she believes she's been abducted and implanted by ETs 
interestingly just recently fran drescher was chosen to head the screen actors guild 
so a very high profile celebrity who's claimed to have a ufo encounter another very famous celebrity 
who has had a ufo encounter is chad everett he's probably best known for his role on 
the tv drama medical center but it starred in a lot a lot of movies including a ufo movie 
and including the hit comedy airplane too and uh chad everett went public with his ufo sighting on 
the talk show vicki when he was promoting a uh alien movie that he was in starring markie post 
and this encounter he had occurred in october of 19 or thereabouts and as chad everett says 
in his own words there were three of us and we were looking out from the beverly hills location 
over malibu we faced that way we could see that way now at a distance which we measured 
to be about a yard by our arms how many miles that would be far away from the beach 
lots right we tracked a light that was going pump pump mup he moved his 
hand side to side to illustrate the sort of darting like movement and as he says and you could 
track it it was making turns like that nothing I know of moves like that we called and we were 
told oh there's some helicopters on maneuvers but chad everett doesn't buy that for a second 
as vicki asked him a helicopter doesn't move that fast and chad everett replied no no of course not 
of course not no craft that we have could track that fast at that time and make turns like that 
so yeah chad everett has seen ufos another person who had an incredible ufo encounter is one of the 
Jamie Farr
gentlemen who starred on the hit tv sitcom or drama nash and this celebrity is none other than 
jamie farr who was probably most famous for being the you know a cross-dresser on the show mash 
he played the role of klinger and he had an incredible ufo encounter in the 1960s 
while driving through the arizona desert they observed this light zigzagging at very high 
speeds as they watched it stopped in midair it hovered then took off again and at one point 
approached very closely to them about 300 feet away from their car jamie fire was driving down 
the highway at about 60 miles per hour and said that this ufo actually paced their car and it 
was so close they they could see what appeared to be a dome with a light at the base of this craft 
and this object got so low to the ground at one point it actually stirred up the dust below on 
the desert floor jamie farr's wife joy wanted to pull over but jamie was too frightened and 
insisted on driving and at one point the ufo took off at high speed and vanished 
before this encounter jamie farsesi was a skeptic but is now convinced that ufos are real 
and says that following this incident his vehicle never worked quite the same afterwards
Lupe Fiasco
many many celebrities to go through uh not we're now up to the f's and uh another celebrity is musician lupe fiasco uh who says he believes 
he had an actual face-to-face encounter encounter and was implanted by the ET's 
this occurred in the early 1990s when he was just a little boy he was 11 years old living in chicago 
illinois he woke up early in the morning to find himself bathed in this blue light he says he felt 
like his whole body was being shocked by some type of electricity it was around seven in the morning 
and looking out the window he saw this black disc flying in the star in the sky 
as lupe says I believe I had an encounter with aliens I believe they implanted something in my 
left leg down by my achilles tendon I've got a scar there that wasn't there the day before 
i never saw it until after my little encounter with beings from another planet so yeah he's very 
famous as a rapper and now he's also famous for being one of several celebrities claiming to have 
been abducted and implanted by extraterrestrials what he called extra worldly visitors
Glenn Ford
another celebrity who claims to have had ufo encounters is glenn ford is probably best known for starring in several western movies in the 1950s and uh he had 
an incredible encounter in oxford england as glenn ford says in his own words I was trying to relax 
taking it easy so I decided to spend a few hours alone on a beach near oxford england all 
around me as far as I could see was nothing but a beautiful blue expanse of sky and water suddenly 
my attention was attracted to an object skipping across the heavens looking closer I saw what was 
definitely a disc shaped object what they call a ufo or flying saucer I watched it for a good half 
hour as it darted back and forth right in front of my eyes there is no way anyone can convince me 
what I saw wasn't some kind of intelligently controlled craft this thing made sharp angle turns 
that our fastest and most advanced military jets could not accomplish at the time
so he is absolutely convinced that this was a genuine ufo and ever since then 
has been very interested in this subject as he says scientific evidence now 
exists which proves that thousands of inhabited worlds can thrive throughout the cosmos I'm 
positive that there are other worlds nearby that contain life forms of one type or another 
he did actually report his encounter to the military and he felt he needed to do that out 
of a sense of duty but uh he was not happy with how they reacted as he says unfortunately they 
would not take me seriously in fact they acted as if I was a bit crazy glenn ford believes these 
ufo visitors are friendly piloted by creatures coming to earth 
for the reasons of quote simply out of curiosity
Ace Frehley
all right and our next celebrity is none other than ace freely who is the guitarist for the 
rock band kiss and ace freely was interviewed by timothy green beckley and revealed a really 
incredible encounter as ace freely says in his own words and I quote it was very strange 
we were flying from los angeles to new york this happened sometimes before the end of july 
1974 following the recording of our second album the flight had been delayed six hours by the time 
we boarded it was well after midnight I took a seat in the rear section of the 747 isolating 
myself from the rest of the group and the few passengers who were traveling this late at night 
it says at one point during this flight he was overcome by quote an eerie feeling 
uh he was trying to stretch out and get some sleep in this darkened airplane when he noticed a bright ball of light outside the window to his right and 
he blinked his eyes trying to make sure that it wasn't an illusion and it wasn't 
as ace says sure enough this thing was still there I couldn't make out any great tale great detail
i couldn't make out any great detail it looked like an enormous baseball and its actions were 
completely erratic moving from side to side the ufo remained in view for a brief period of time 
and then darted off traveling quite rapidly I know it wasn't a satellite or another plane we 
were pretty high up when it appeared leaving me to conclude it was a ufo uh timothy greenback beckley 
asked ace freely how he felt about the sighting you know what was his emotional reaction to it and 
ace replied that he was actually elated by it as he says I'd always wanted to see a flying saucer
Robert Fripp
lots of musicians have seen ufos another is robert fripp he's the guitarist for the 
band king crimson and his setting was quite brief robert fripp was visiting the stonehenge area in 
england when he saw quote a brilliant ball of light goes streaking across the starry sky so 
it was a brief sighting but he's absolutely convinced it wasn't a conventional aircraft
Gin Blossoms
another actually a group of musicians who saw ufo are the gin blossoms they've had a number of huge 
hit songs and all of them saw a ufo at one point jesse valenzuela bill lean robin wilson scotty 
johnson and scott hessel and uh as one of the members of the band jesse valenzuela says we're 
recording the song that turned out to be our first single follow you down and one of the guys in the 
band stepped out to smoke a cigarette he looked up and saw a couple of flashing lights or something 
so we all went out and took a look for about 20 minutes and there you go a ufo sighting 
so yeah the gin blossoms are joining the ranks of famous people who have seen 
ufos another very famous musician who claims to have had a direct ufo encounter with a parent ET's
Sammy Hagar
is sami hagar who really needs no introduction but he had an encounter at a very early age 
uh he was around four years old when he saw what he thought at the time was quote a car 
with no wheels as he says we lived out in the country and I saw this thing floating across the 
field creating this big dust storm I threw rocks at it and I don't know what happened after that 
so apparently he had missing time this is what the interviewer asked him and sammy 
hagar replied I guess I just have no memory of it and that it wasn't a dream it was during daylight 
sammy hagar said that he had initially been reluctant to talk about his alien encounters 
because he really felt that there were no words that could express what had actually happened 
to him it was very hard to explain as sami says I couldn't talk about it because I couldn't explain 
it but now I'm pretty sure it was a wireless situation either a download or an upload 
they were tapped into my brain and the knowledge was transferred back and forth I could see them 
and everything while it was happening there was a visual involved you know how big the universe is 
it's freaking huge if we're really the only ones out there that's scarier to me than thinking there are aliens my opinions about the ufo stuff 
i could write a whole book just devoted to that I love it man I'm into it deep 
so the interviewer asked him point blank whether he believes he's been abducted by aliens and hagar 
replied I think I have uh he wrote about this in his autobiographical book red my uncensored life 
in rock and he talked about being contacted by aliens in the foothills above fontana california 
as he says it was real aliens were plugged into me it was a download situation this was 
long before computers or any kind of wireless looking back now it was like they downloaded 
something into me or they uploaded something from my brains like see what this guy knows 
if you talk to ufo researchers they're very very familiar with what people call downloads 
where ETs will connect with people telepathically and exchange information giving them messages or 
recording their own memories so this is apparently what happened to sammy hagar at a very young age 
and beyond that so perhaps the ETs knew he was going to be a very influential musician 
or were programming him in some way to become successful hard to say but I think there's 
Dick Haynes
definitely a theme going on here because so many celebrities have had these encounters 
another person you may not have heard of but who is really famous it's dick hames 
who is a singer and actor from the 1950s he was part of the tommy dorsey orchestra 
and he had an incredible encounter in 1971 while traveling from new york to spain on a flight and 
it was before daybreak in the very early hours of the morning and his airplane was just approaching 
the airport in madrid spain when he looked out the window and saw quote 
an oblong object like a bullet which seemed to be flying parallel to our course
dick haynes happened to have a pair of binoculars with him so I quickly pulled out the binoculars and looked at this object through them and as he says it was gigantic almost twice the size 
of our jet I've never seen anything like it it was completely streamlined no wings no tail 
or markings visible on its light gray body uh after watching it for just a few moments 
it quickly darted away you called the attention of the stewardess and told her about it and asked her 
if she saw it and she said yes she had seen it and he asked her if she minded going to the captain 
into the control room and asking them if they saw it and she obliged she went uh and 
approached the captain in the cockpit and the co-pilot navigator and asked them if they saw 
it and came back and told dick hames that yes the pilot and the whole crew also saw this ufo 
and uh dickham said that several other passengers on the airplane also saw it so this was a mass 
sighting many people saw it and they were all convinced it was a genuine ufo
another person who claims to have had face-to-face contact with ETs is jimmy hendrix he obviously 
needs no introduction but jimi hendrix and his whole band actually had a major encounter during 
a snowstorm in upstate new york jimi hendrix never went public and sort of kept it secret 
but his bandmate curtis knight eventually did go public and talked about this 
this occurred one evening in 1965 it was four a.m in the morning snowing heavily and the band 
had been driving for about a hundred miles when they realized they must have missed their turn off 
and they became entrenched in a deep snow drift it actually was so deep it reached up to the hood 
of their vehicle they were unable to go forwards or backwards and they turned the heater up and 
had no choice but to wait until morning but it kept getting colder and colder and they were 
realized that they were in actual danger here I mean this they were in danger of losing their 
lives getting frozen to death and snowbound and this is when they had an incredible encounter 
suddenly according to curtis knight the road in front of their car suddenly lit up very brightly 
and looking upwards they saw this glowing object that was quote cone-shaped like a space capsule 
it actually came down and landed right in front of the car curtis knight was driving jimi hendrix was 
next to him and as curtis says at first we thought it was an apparition caused by the cold in our 
confused state of mind I mean we just couldn't believe our eyes now jimi hendrix had seen ufos 
on previous occasions and curtis knight knew this so he looked to jaime to see his reaction 
and as curtis knight says jimmy didn't answer but sort of smiled he seemed to 
be staring out into the night his eyes riveted on this thing resting within a stone's throw 
knight turned to the other bam banned members but they were all strangely asleep 
and he shouted at them but they would not wake up so they were perhaps entranced or 
hypnotized or put to sleep this is something we do see and particularly close up ufo encounters 
so it was just curtis knight and jimi hendrix who saw this when suddenly a door opened in the craft 
an opening and this figure appeared and began to glide towards their van and this figure was 
very tall as kurt knight is as a kurt knight says he stood eight feet tall his skin was yellowish 
and instead of eyes this creature had slits the forehead came to a point and his head ran straight 
into his chest leaving the impression that he had no neck as they watched this figure floated 
towards the van and to their amazement this creature this figure called caused all the snow 
to melt all around their van and curtis knight looked at jimi hendrix who was looking straight 
at the figure and as curtis knight says jimmy seemed to be communicating telepathically 
with it so as this figure is in front of the van melting the snow 
they started to warm up quite quickly as curtis knight says suddenly I was roasting 
this figure actually circled around their van melting all the snow completely around it 
as curtis knight says as it glided behind our truck I saw that the drift had completely vanished 
turning on the ignition key I gunned the motor and got the hell out of there the 
object the strange craft was at the same instant lifting off like a rocket from a launching pad 
so there you go they had a face-to-face encounter not only with a ufo but with a ufo 
occupant and jimmy never went public it was he wanted to keep it secret as curtis knight says 
jimmy never did talk much about what happened he sort of let me know that the cool thing to do 
was not bring up the subject it was to be our little secret however from what he did say I sort of suspect that the object arrived to save our next chiefly 
because jimmy had been practicing trying to communicate by esp with the beings on board 
i know this may hard to believe but I'm putting it straight just like it happened you hear and 
it should come as no surprise that several of jimi hendrix's songs actually talk about ufos 
and aliens for example one of his songs is up from the skies which is actually written from the point 
of view of an e.t who has come back to visit earth after a long absence I just want to quote the song 
lyrics briefly because they're pertinent the song begins I just want to talk to you 
i won't do you no harm I just want to know about your different lives on this here people farm 
so this is something that we often hear directly in ufo contact cases 
and in the song the e.t goes on to say that he has come back quote to find the stars misplaced 
and the smell of a world that has been burned well maybe it's just a change of climate 
so again here's that theme of you know nuclear proliferation and climate change and uh upcoming 
environmental disaster and upheavals which is again a very strong message from the ET's 
so yeah perhaps jimmy was in direct telepathic communication with these beings it certainly 
seems so and it's not the only case of people who have been rescued or healed by ET's
and a lot of celebrities another celebrity who you probably have heard of is jill ireland she's 
a pretty famous uh movie star she starred in the movie shane the man from uncle she was married to 
charles bronson and she went public with her ufo story she told timothy green beckley all about it 
as she says in her own words my youngest girl was only three months old at the time 
i remember it was about five in the afternoon when we had the sighting I was sitting on the veranda holding the baby in my arms our child's nurse zizi was standing around talking to me 
when suddenly my eyes drifted to a bright blue patch of sky something up there 
which had been reflecting the rays of the sun caught my attention so this thing 
glared so brightly she couldn't really tell exactly what shape it was or what size it 
was but she's pretty sure it was quote round with perhaps a dome or tower on top
but it was such a bright sunny day and it was reflecting the bright the sunlight so brightly that she couldn't really tell and she thought at first could this be a weather balloon but she 
ruled that out when this object began to rapidly rise higher and higher and flew against the wind 
and she wonders if maybe it was a secret government aircraft or a genuine ufo 
she's not sure but whatever it was she felt like it came down and paid her quote 
a brief visit and charles bronson uh her husband absolutely believes her and supports her account 
um saying that she would never lie about something like this a more recent celebrity 
musician who has come forward saying he has had a ufo encounter is nick jonas of the jonas brothers 
and uh he was on late night with seth meyers in 2015 when he revealed that he had had an encounter 
when he was just a teenager as nick jonas says when I was 14 maybe I was in my backyard playing 
basketball with some friends and I looked up in the sky and there was three flying saucers 
he turned he turned to his friends and says are you seeing this or am I losing my mind 
and uh his friends backed up his claim they also saw this strange object 
and he later researched it and found that there was a similar sighting just two weir weeks prior to this so perhaps that was related to what he saw 
at any rate it absolutely convinced him that ufos are real as he says I'm a firm believer in aliens
another famous celebrity who has seen ufos is the actress january jones 
who rose to fame largely in the drama series mad men and she had a really interesting encounter 
she revealed it on jimmy kim kimmel jimmy kimmel asked her are you into aliens and stuff like that 
and january jones said very much and revealed her own experience of a ufo sighting 
she said she was out in a field in iowa when she saw this ufo she was about 22 
maybe 24 years old and she saw this light in the sky making weird movements as january jones 
says in her own words I was in a field I saw a light in the sky and it went shoo 
shoe like it made a shape and then whoosh it was definitely a spaceship
so she actually you know gestured showing how this object darted along and then whoosh across the sky and she added well maybe it was a shooting star that just couldn't figure it out 
but no she's absolutely convinced she saw a genuine ufo she says I saw it 
i didn't imagine it it was real there was another person who was in the car near her 
but he did not see it but she absolutely saw it and she talked about this on the jimmy kimmel show 
to jimmy kimmel another person who has recently gone public with her sighting is khloe kardashian 
who said and I quote I did see a ufo it was years ago and I was driving my hummer at the time right 
we were driving and I saw one we were driving by the sepulveda area in the san fernando valley 
and I told malika and she didn't look up fast enough and I saw a ufo 
more recently in 2021 I was actually personally contacted by 
the kardashian producers for their show keeping up with the kardashians and we did a little zoom 
meeting they wanted to talk about ufos and how to contact them and I gave them a little information 
on the area of malibu where they live which is a ufo hotspot and told them about the ce5 
protocols or how to contact a ufo using meditation and lights and I instructed them to just go out 
late at night and telepathically call down a ufo bring a flashlight blink it up into the sky 
and you might be surprised you might have a sighting and they actually did this they 
followed my instructions and to their shock they actually saw this orb like object which 
was white and then blinked red and totally freaked them out her and her boyfriend so bad that they 
jumped up and ran back inside so yeah chloe has had two ufo sightings and one is very recent
another uh very famous celebrity who's had an encounter is kesha who's a very famous and 
award-winning musi musician and kesha said that she was absolutely totally sober when she saw 
a ufo up in the area of joshua tree cal california she says I was quote a totally sober 
sally just a lady in the desert I look up in the sky and there's a bunch of spaceships 
she estimates she saw maybe five or six of these objects and they disappeared and reappeared in a new formation she says I was like those are effing 
aliens they were spaceships so she didn't go into a lot of detail but yeah kesha 
saw multiple ufos up in the joshua tree area which is also a fairly well-known area for ufo activity
another musician who says she has seen ufos is alicia keys 
she's won a number of awards for her singing and songwriting and doesn't go into detail 
about what she saw but makes it clear that she not only believes in ET's but has seen 
a ufo herself as she says haven't to all of us seen something flying in the sky 
and it's at some random time of night that doesn't make sense and it's not the shape of a plane
so yeah alicia keys joins the ranks of ufo witnesses and along with her is talk show host 
jimmy kimmel jimmy kimmel while interviewing january jones admitted that he and his friends 
also had a ufo sighting as he said to january jones if it makes you feel 
any better I feel like I saw one too in a similar situation I was with my friend tony and my cousin 
sal we were fishing we were up in the sierras here in california we looked and we saw something go a 
little bit weird he made these darting motions with his hands and he says just like you said 
we had been smoking though so it was a little bit different but we mutually saw it though
another celebrity is lemmy kill me mister let me kill mr is a popular 
rocker from the united kingdom he was the lead singer for the very popular group motorhead and uh 
late in life he re he went public as a ufo witness he said that he was in rio in 2011 
and said that he saw a ufo a ship cruising over the top of a mountain he said it was moving 
at an unbelievable speed he estimates it was about a thousand miles per hour 
and uh he has mentioned this several times he's convert confirmed over and over again 
that he does believe in aliens and that he doesn't have a problem admitting it
another very famous ufo witness is comedian robert klein and robert klein 
uh says that he had a sighting in the summer of 1957 when he was 15 
years old and he was attending a youth camp in kent connecticut he and 25 or so fellow campers 
were playing baseball when this ufo arrived as robert klein says in his own words before I 
knew what was happening a group of my buddies were craning their necks skyward pointing excitedly at 
something following the direction of their stare I immediately saw what had captured their attention 
there in plain view were these six cigar-shaped objects moving by at an extremely high altitude 
they were in formation right behind the other traveling in and out between the cloud layers 
strange as it may seem they made absolutely no noise I mean not a sound they were just coasting 
along as if they hadn't a care in the world these objects were pretty high up so they couldn't 
really make out any detail but as robert klein says but because of their great brilliance caused 
by the reflection of the sun we could definitely ascertain their shape as being elongated they went 
out of viewing range after several minutes how something this size could travel at such 
great speeds and not make any noise is beyond my understanding they defied all the laws of physics
uh robert klein admits that he is definitely not an expert on ufos or aircraft 
but says that he has never seen anything like this before or sent before or since 
and it impressed him so deeply he felt compelled to report it to a nearby navy base 
and to his amazement they took his call very seriously and told him that they 
had received a number of other reports at the same time and uh later the they called him back 
the navy called him back and uh offered the campers an explanation and uh which robert klein 
learned later learned is really quote par for the course so the navy tried to debunk 
it but robert klein is absolutely convinced he saw a ufo as he says I strongly believe 
there is a rational explanation for the majority of sightings but there is also quite a bit about which we know nothing and a lot of that remains 
unexplained I must in all honesty put my own ufo sighting into this category
another super famous person who I'm sure you've heard of who has seen ufos and possibly aliens 
face to face is none other than john lennon of the beatles john lennon has professed 
his strong interest in ufos he went public with his sighting which occurred on august 23rd 1974 
at the time he was separated from yoko ono and was in a relationship with his assistant mae pang and 
he viewed this ufo from his 53rd street penthouse apartment in manhattan uh and uh were out on 
the balcony when this ufo showed up um he saw it first and he screamed out to mae to come out onto 
the balcony and looked she ignored him at first but finally came out there and as mae pang says 
i walked out onto the terrace my eye caught this large circular object coming towards us pulsating 
as on any of the aircraft we'd seen heading for a landing at newark airport but it clearly wasn't 
on normal aircraft because as they watched this thing approached within a few hundred feet 
and they said it was huge about the size of a jet but was totally silent as mei peng says when it 
came a little closer we could make out a row or circle of white lights that ran around the entire 
rim of the craft these were also flashing on and off there were so many of these lights that it 
was dazzling to the mind john estimates its size at about as about as large as a two-man lear jet 
there was no sound no noise coming from it as they watched this object scooted away and disappeared 
from view but then a few minutes later it came back and uh they quickly grabbed their camera 
and tried to take a few pictures unfortunately they did not come out but they were impressed 
enough to call both the newspaper and the police and both the newspaper people and 
the police officers said that they had received numerous calls from other witnesses reporting this 
object and according to may pang john lennon was deeply affected by this sighting and just 
kept saying I can't believe it I can't believe it I've seen a flying saucer as maypeng says 
john has always had an interest in ufos he even used to subscribe to a british ufo magazine the 
flying saucer review but after seeing what we saw that night he became even more fanatical bringing 
up the subject all the time he told her that he would like to be taken up inside of one 
and here john lennon actually describes his sighting in his own words over here 
up there I saw a ufo and it went down the river turned right at the united nations 
turned left and then down the river it wasn't a helicopter it wasn't a balloon and it was so near and it looked wet sort of round white just licensed and silent silent and it looked dark like 
black or gray in the middle and had white lights just look like light bulbs you know just going off 
on off on off on blink blink blink blink around the bottom and on top was a red light if you see 
a little note on walls and bridges it says I saw a ufo and I was just finished doing balls and 
bridges I've mastered it or done the last tape of it and I was really just relaxed and feeling good 
and it was summer in new york and I had the window open and lo and behold there was this thing just 
hovering sort of a hundred yards away but I saw it so close it wasn't in the sky or nothing you know 
and it was like I could have hit it with a brick if I thrown a stone at it I couldn't see the colors because it was just so it was a good clear summer night you know the 
sky was very clear and around the bottom of it were just ordinary looking electric light bulb 
blinking off and on alternatively like on a boat or something and on the top of it was a red light and the thing I noticed was that there was no noise and I could hear that freeway 
down below all the cars going so I realized oh it's not a helicopter then it must be a balloon 
but it was so close to the rooftop that it couldn't be a balloon so all the rational things I went through not a helicopter a balloon not a balloon it's too close to the roof and it's 
maneuvering too well to be a balloon so I just wanted it and it was there for about five or 
ten minutes it went off down the east river and there it was and that's all I gotta say about it
john lennon also wrote about his sighting in a song called strange days indeed 
and one of the lyrics says there's ufos over new york and I ain't too surprised 
nobody told me there'd be days like these
according to yuri geller
he yuri geller had a face-to-face conversation with john lennon and told him that at one point he saw what looked like bug-like creatures coming into his room 
and freaking him out and gave him this little silver egg like object which he 
gave to yuri geller at some time before john lennon was assassinated or murdered so whether 
that part is true or not uh I don't know this is a claim coming from the famous psychic yuri geller 
some people have disputed it so I don't know but what what is clear is john lennon had a very close 
up ufo sighting and very possibly face-to-face contact with ET's and he's not the only one as 
i said ET's love musicians and another who has bravely stepped forward is demi lovato in fact 
she's now starring in her own series on ufos it affected her that profoundly her encounter 
and she went public in october of 2020 about making contact with extraterrestrial life forms 
and actually shared some photos and videos which she says are quote just some of the evidence from 
under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately
and she says she's had encounters of ufos in broad daylight 
and has had actually a number of sightings she said another day another ufo 
sighting as she's pointing her video camera up the cloudless blue sky where you two 
bright white orbs of light are seeing and she's kind of narrating the film and says wow what the f 
they're coming and uh she's absolutely convinced she's not only seeing ufos but is 
in contact with them she's hooked up with stephen greer the famous ufo researcher and as demi 
lovato says over the past couple of months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness 
and experience not only peace and serenity like I've never known but I also have witnessed the 
most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me this planet is on a 
very negative path toward destruction but we can change that together if we were to get one percent 
of the population to meditate and make contact we would force our governments to acknowledge the 
truth about extraterrestrial life among us and tr change our destructive habits destroying our 
planet it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact 
happy communicating so yeah she's saying that she's actually in direct communication with ET's 
who's to say it's happening to a lot of people one actor who's been talking about this forever is of 
course shirley mclane uh who's starting too many movies to even count uh has won multiple awards 
and uh became very famous for her belief in spirituality and ufos and wrote a best-selling 
book called out on a limb where she talked about talking to a channeler and seeing 
uf hoes herself as shirley mclean writes about one sighting yes we went to mexico to mount popo
because they were having so many ufo sightings and we don't know really why but we saw them and he 
did too and she says she's seen ufos on a number of occasions uh uf ufos spaceships darting around 
in the night sky darting across the heavens she believes they're intelligently controlled devices 
that has have been visiting here for centuries she believes they're friendly and mean us no harm and 
has had a lot of mystical experiences actually and she says that 
actually when she was in her home in taos the presidential candidate dennis kucinich 
also saw ufos while visiting her in her home in taos so yeah another celebrity was seeing ufos 
and here's a another group of musicians who have seen ufos and this is the band moody blues 
super successful band composed of denny lane mike pinder ray thomas clint warwick and graham edge 
and they were driving outside of london one evening when something very strange happened 
suddenly they noticed there were no cars on the road and all the night sounds of the animals the crickets and so forth had gone completely silent 
and that's when as they say quote a fat cigar with a low protrusion on top with seven red lights on 
it appeared the upper half of this object appeared metallic whereas the lower was red and pulsed from 
left to right it acted most peculiarly so they watched it for just a few moments and realized 
that this was not a plane and sort of panicked and overcome with fear they drove off very quickly
another very famous sports star who claims to have actually been abducted by aliens is guillermo 
moreno uh he's a very famous soccer star from argentina and he says that he missed practice 
because he was actually taken on board a ufo for I believe it was three days and he was 
sort of outed by one of his teammates he did not directly say this himself but he hasn't denied it 
but according to his teammate guillermo moreno said that he was taken on board a ufo 
and the ET's actually took him out of his body removed his soul to actually run 
tests on it and were very careful to cause him no harm this was revealed by his teammate 
gustavo lorenzetti and according to gustavo and I'm quoting gustavo here 
he explained that they take out your soul analyze it and all the while on the journey they are looking after you he said something like that honestly I believe in aliens 
he gave a great explanation and will have to believe him so other type of channels 
will have to call him so he can tell it better but in any case he was abducted by aliens and
guillermo moreno does not deny this and says quote I left and I came back two days later because I was kidnapped by aliens
another very famous sports star who claims close ufo contact is baker mayfield football 
player for the cleveland browns and he received some ridicule for going public with his sighting 
which was very recent actually march 3rd 2021 and uh he says he 100 percent saw a ufo 
uh with his wife emily and he revealed this in a tweet and what she said m and I just saw a ufo 
dropped straight out of the sky on our way home from dinner we stopped and looked at each other and asked if either of us saw it a very bright ball of light going straight down out of the sky 
towards lake travis anybody else witness this I'm a firm believer in ufos and sasquatch it's real 
and his wife emily mayfield also confirms this and writes 
i will not lie I am sometimes not somebody who buys into ufo speak however all I do know is 
i noticed one thing tonight that I've by no means seen and I'm a little bit thrown off
so many celebrities now we get to another celebrity an actor by the name of casey musgraves 
and she had a very interesting close-up ufo sighting while in mexico 
as she says I've seen ufos one was in mexico and I was with several other people I was on the beach 
after my friend's wedding after midnight and it was the craziest movement of light in the sky 
all of us watched it for like 20 minutes it changed shape it flew across the sky it did 
wacky stuff that nothing normal would do I was completely sober swear to god 
and it wasn't long before she saw another sighting it was actually just a few days later she says 
four days later I was in nashville on the porch at night and out of the corner of my eye 
looked over in the sky and hovering over the neighbors 
hovering over the neighborhood were two giant balls of fire just floating along first I thought 
it was a helicopter but it was being controlled it was crazy and she had a third ufo sighting in 2014 
over la in which she saw a tiny dots of light in a triangular moving in a triangular pattern 
so yeah casey musgraves believes she's seen ufos on at least three occasions and 
absolutely believes they're real and she says I'm definitely a believer I don't think we are alone
another mega famous celebrity who's seen ufos is singer and actress olivia newton-john 
the star of the cult movie greece and uh she talked about her encounter which occurred when 
she was just a little girl at age 15. she saw a ufo flying at quote amazing speeds she said it was 
absolutely a real ufo a silvery object speeding through the sky and uh ever since then has 
been absolutely fascinated with all things extraterrestrial as she says it's true I'm 
intrigued by them I have seen one when I was very young it was unidentified and it was flying in 
england most people now think ufos are possible 20 years ago how many people would have thought that 
but yeah she says this object was bright bright silver and moved at what she called quote amazing 
speeds another person who is so famous and really needs no introduction is shaquille o'neal 
and he has also recently gone public with his own ufo sighting 
and he's absolutely serious about it as he says in an interview you know what's crazy I never told 
anybody this story this occurred in 1997 while he and a group of friends were on their way home 
from hollywood video in madera california and as shaquille o'neal says in his own words right 
when we passed the fairground I could swear I saw a flying saucer come down with all the 
lights and it was spinning and then it took off everything happened in less than five seconds 
and we all looked at each other and were like ah I know it was a ufo I don't care what anybody says 
case after case I'm telling you many many musicians or many many celebrities have seen these things more than you know another musician who has gone public is post malone and 
he had a really interesting encounter which he talks about in his own words in quite some detail 
as he says I've seen one I was probably 16 I was in upstate new york and it would just stay there 
he revealed all of this on joe rogan's show in 2020 and his post malone says 
i was looking out the window with my cousin and it's just a light that just stays there 
and then just effing goes off I mean you can't explain it and that wasn't his only sighting he 
had another one when he moved to l.a he says and I quote I used to live in tarzana and it looked like 
it sounds corny but like a classic force field it looked kind of like a dome in a circular 
shape it was looking down at the city and I'm like how did no one else see this but I was like 
there with like four other people and they saw it too so he wasn't alone there were other witnesses 
and he is now a confirmed ufo believer and one of many many celebrities who have stepped forward 
and talked about his sightings another person who went public with his sightings to some degree at least is elvis presley he never spoke publicly about him but he did 
grant an interview to an author by the name of luckman and revealed a very strong ufo connection 
and according to luckman a very strange incident happened on the day elvis presley was born 
january 8 1935 a strange unidentified blue light hovered over elvis's home in tupelo mississippi 
according to luckman and I quote the light was seen by the doctor who delivered him and by elvis's father who later told elvis all about it and uh elvis's hair stylists also uh 
heard about this directly from uh elvis's father and as larry geller elvis's hairstylist said his 
father told us he'd gone out to have a cigarette at 2 a.m during the delivery and when he looked 
up into the skies above their little shack he saw the strangest blue light he knew right then 
and there that something special was happening and elvis was very much known to be interested 
in ufos and talked about it to many many people and uh also told larry geller that he had seen 
uh ufos on a number of occasions once he saw a pair of bright lights in the sky bright objects out in the desert and another time he saw ufos over graceland and
actually at one point apparently had direct contact with ETs and communicated with telepathically this is according to luckman and uh 
reportedly elvis presley was visited by these ETs who communicated with him telepathically 
at age eight and gave him a glimpse into his future and they actually showed grainy images of 
him as a full-grown man wearing a white suit and singing before a large crowd of people at the time 
elvis had quote no idea what it all meant at that time and only later when he became super famous 
did he realize that the ETs had actually shown him a prophetic glimpse of him as a very famous 
singer so yeah maybe they are setting this up like sammy hagar and so many other musicians they do 
seem to have a very strong interest in musicians and another very famous group where most of the 
members have seen ufos are the rolling stones mick jagger says that while camping out in glastonbury 
in england in 1968 with his then-girlfriend marianne faithful mick jagger described what 
he saw as a quote cigar-shaped mother ship and it was floating among the stars and
also said he had a second ufo sighting during a really famous concert at altamonte and that 
these sightings left such a strong impression on him that he ended up stalling installing 
a ufo detector on his at his home in england and uh he claims to have had other encounters 
another band member who says that he's seen ufos is mick taylor who was a former drummer 
for the rolling stones and says he saw a ufo in war minster england this was during a time 
where there was a wave of sightings over warminster and mick taylor says he saw a huge 
pulsating object so bright that it illuminated a herd of sheep on a nearby hillside 
and two other more distant ufos were also visible and a third member to claim to have seen ufos is 
keith richards as keith richards says in his own words I've seen a few but nothing that any 
of the ministries would believe I believe they exist plenty of people have seen them 
they are tied up with a lot of things like the dawn of man for example it's not just a matter of 
people spotting a flying saucer not an expert I'm still trying to understand what's going on and uh 
keith richards believes that actually at one point ufos landed near his home
another actor who saw ufos more than once is ronald reagan who starred in bedtime for bonzo 
he was a pretty well-known actor and later became governor of california and then president of the 
united states I was definitely one of the most famous ufo witnesses of all times and according to 
reagan's pilot bill painter they encountered a ufo when uh reagan was governor as bill painter says 
i was the pilot of the plane when we saw the ufo on board were governor reagan and a couple 
of his security people we were near bakersfield when governor reagan and the others called my 
attention to a big light flying a bit behind my plane it appeared to be several hundred yards away 
it was a fairly steady light until it began to accelerate then it appeared to elongate 
then the light took off it went to up at a 45 degree angle from a normal cruise speed 
to a fantastic speed instantly and at one point reagan did actually mention this publicly to a 
reporter to norman miller who was the washington bureau chief for the wall street journal and 
reagan told miller that after setting the object he ordered bill painter the pilot to follow it and 
as ronald reagan is quoted saying we followed it for several minutes all of a sudden to our utter 
amazement it went straight up into the heavens when I got off the plane I told nancy all about 
it and we read up on the long history of ufos the reporter norman miller was surprised to hear 
reagan talking so candidly about this and as uh and norman miller asked him point blank if reagan 
actually believed in ufos and that's when reagan realized that he had actually spilled the beans 
perhaps a few more beans than he had intentionally meant to spill as norman miller says when I asked him that question a look of horror came over his 
face suddenly dawned on him what he was saying the implications and that he was talking to a reporter 
he snapped back to reality and said let's just say that on the subject of ufos I'm an agnostic later 
as president reagan would give several provocative statements pointing towards the reality of ufos 
once in 1985 he said if suddenly there was a threat to this world from some other species from 
another planet we'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our two countries 
and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings on the earth together 
two years later in 1987 he again made a very provocative comment saying in our obsession with 
antagonisms of the moment we often forget how much unites all members of humanity perhaps we need 
some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond I occasionally think how quickly 
our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside the world 
and he made a third quote in which he reportedly said what would happen if the world faced an alien 
threat from outer space don't you think the united states and the soviet union would join together 
so I'm not sure if it's an alien threat or if he was just trying to put forth the alien threat 
narrative but reagan absolutely has gone public with this ufo sighting and according 
to some sources it's more than a sighting according I believe it's lucille ball who revealed at a party that reagan told her that they were driving along the pacific 
highway when he was an actor and had a face-to-face encounter with ETs 
who told him to get out of the acting and to get into politics and that he would one day 
be the president of the united states I don't know this is a third hand story it's hearsay 
but for what it's worth this is a story that is circulating around within the ufo community
next celebrity we get to is buddy rich you may not know him but he's a very very well-known 
drummer and he had an incredible sighting in 1954 in atlanta georgia and his buddy rich says 
in his own words he saw quote two brilliantly illuminated objects come out from behind the 
dark side of the moon we stopped the car in the parking lot of the club to get a better look 
the objects were now doing figure eights in front of our bulging eyes it was as though they were 
playing tag engaging each other in a game of cat and mouse they made incredible turns at highly 
accelerated speeds under normal circumstances the resulting g-forces should have crushed 
whoever was on board 200 people saw it at a club the local air force base said they got 500 calls 
so yeah that was a very well viewed sighting in 1954 and it was 12 years later he had another 
sighting that was even closer this was in 1966 buddy rich and his wife were driving 
between la and las vegas when he says and I quote suddenly I received the jolt of my life 
there zooming down out of the heavens was this thing it was 40 feet in diameter and shaped 
like a disc with a slight dome on top the outside rim was glowing sort of pulsating red blue white 
it made three passes over their car and on the second pass went right over their roof very close then darted away as buddy rich says it went up like a bullet 
and was out of sight in a matter of seconds and he also points out importantly that this object 
made zero noise no sound whatsoever even though it was quite close
all right another actor who had seen ufos is cliff robertson who won an academy award 
for his portrayal in the movie charlie of a man who was mentally handicapped 
and this was taken from the book flowers for algernon a very famous book by daniel keyes 
and at any rate cliff robertson has gone public with his sighting of a ufo in july of 1963. 
it occurred at 3 p.m he was on the observation deck of his home in pacifica park which overlooks the southern california coast 
and as robertson says suddenly my eyes were diverted toward an object high in the sky 
whatever it was was traveling from south to north and sparkling like a diamond as it reflected the 
rays of the mid-afternoon sun he tried to explain it away as a plane or a helicopter or a balloon 
except it was clearly none of these things it was moving very strangely and looked even stranger and 
he grabbed a pair of binoculars and verified that this was definitely nothing he's ever seen before 
as cliff robertson says by no means was I prepared for what I saw through the binoculars instead of 
supplying me with a rational explanation it only convinced me that no identification was possible 
I've been a pilot for years and I have to be honest and say never before have 
encountered anything remotely like this during my experience as an aviator there in front of me 
was a weird alien contraption a cylindrical shaped craft made of highly polished metal 
he watched it for about 10 minutes before it finally moved away as he says it just hovered 
out there high up over the water then boom all of a sudden it was gone it disappeared in 
a twinkling of an eye was definitely a ufo like so many other people have seen around the world 
i was awed by its sleek design its trim appearance and the fact that one minute 
it could hover on a dime in the next blast off into space at fantastic speed 
i don't know of anything built on this planet that could maneuver in such a fashion
and now we get to another celebrity this time it's a sports star by the name of aaron rodgers 
who is a footballer for the green bay packers and he said he saw a ufo in 2005 just before 
he entered the nfl he was on the east coast for a pre-draft interview when he and his friends heard 
a siren outside and they went outside and were stunned by what they saw as aaron rodgers says 
it was a large orange left to right moving object because of the overcast nature of the night in 
the snow you couldn't make out it was behind the clouds we were seeing but it was definitely large 
moving from left to right it was me steve and his brother that saw it 
and it goes out of sight and we look at each other and go what in the f was that 
at the time of this sighting there was a couple of other things that aaron rodgers pointed out 
one was that he was near a nuclear power plant and the other was that jet fighters appeared 
shortly after and apparently began to chase after this object and as aaron rodgers says now 
if you know anything about ufo sightings or you've done your research you know that a lot of times two things are connected to ufo sightings one is the presence of fighter jets and two 
there's a lot of sightings around nuclear power plants so to tie it all together the alarm we heard from 30 miles out was a nuclear power plant that had an alarm that went off
next celebrity I want to talk about is lillian roth a hugely famous movie actress from the 1940s 
for example she starred in the marx brothers movie crackers 
and she has had a really incredible series of sightings as lilian roth says I doubt if anyone 
else would take me seriously after all how do you prevent people from laughing out loud when you tell them you've cited a spaceship that was as large as the hindenburg dirigible 
her sighting occurred in 1951 while she was traveling from new york to california and 
she saw this object she was outside when she says quote I caught a glimpse of something 
that rocked my senses there as if suspended from some invisible thread was a tremendous object 
shaped like a child's top was huge perhaps 150 feet in diameter standing perfectly still it 
remained in one position hovering it would what would be the height of a 15 story apartment 
building when it got directly overhead I remember thinking is this thing going to fall on me 
the ufo had a metallic body similar to aluminum all around the hull were small portholes or 
windows which were lit up with different colored lights they were red white green blue and orange 
each shining forth with its own sparkling brilliance adding to the effect of dazzling 
and beautiful color lillian roth says that this object hovered for about five minutes and then 
shot up she's as she says it rose very high in the sky appearing as a small speck in the 
deep blue above and then suddenly it dropped down again real close and then darted away and 
was gone the whole time it was totally silent and one year later she had another sighting 
in florida this was 1952 while she and her husband were driving to a club when as she says as if from 
nowhere they saw this huge cigar-shaped object it was hanging just above the horizon directly 
above their car it was as big as the hindenburg and surrounded in this pinkish haze and she says 
as we watched the great ship faded away just simply vanished into nothingness hard as it may be 
to believe so they went to the club stayed a while and drove home and to 
their shock they saw it again it was as she says the same or an identical ufo loomed up 
above the horizon reaching out majestically with its pinkish velour body gleaming softly 
into the heavens they're just trying to prove to us that they're really out there 
yeah I think that's probably true they're putting on what amounts to a publicity campaign in fact uh this is what happened to kurt russell kurt russell is hugely famous 
uh married or you know with goldie hawn he started the movie overboard and a million other movies 
and tv shows and had an incredible sighting he was actually one of the witnesses 
to the phoenix lights in 1997 or 94. and he was flying at the time and he saw this 
bank of lights in the shape of a triangle near the airport that he was flying into and as he says 
i was flying my son oliver to go see his girlfriend and we were on approach 
i saw six lights over the airport an absolute uniform in a v-shape oliver said to me I was 
looking at him I was coming in we're maybe a half mile out and oliver said paw what are those lights 
and then I kind of came out of my reverie and I said I don't know what they are 
he said are we okay here and I said yeah I'm gonna call in and I reported it 
and what's amazing is he did report it but the whole thing strangely left his mind he sort of 
forgot about it and this really puzzled him didn't think about it for a long time until uh his 
partner goldie hawn and he were watching a report on ufo sightings which depicted the phoenix lights 
and they were listening to this description of this giant triangle and this is when kurt 
russell suddenly remembered that he himself was a witness to the phoenix lights and it shocked him 
and he remembers turning to goldie and saying wait a minute that's the night I was landing in phoenix 
so yeah there is a weird amnesia aspect to ufo encounters I'm not saying he had missing time 
but this sort of thing does happen people can absolutely forget even a simple ufo sighting 
and not remember until they're suddenly prompted that's apparently what happened to kurt russell 
another very famous person who's seen a ufo is sean writer he's a singer-songwriter from england 
and part of the group happy mondays and sean writer was 15 years old when he first saw a ufo 
he was working as a messenger boy for the post office and was walking to the bus stop on hilton lane in little hilton 
it was 6 45 am still dark when he looked up into the sky and saw something he couldn't explain 
as he says at first it was still and then it went voom and then again voom a classic 
zigzag hovered and then went off at like 10 000 miles an hour like star trek boom gone yeah and uh
it was a short time later just a few months later in 1978 that he had another sighting 
and this was around 5 p.m when he saw a gigantic fleet of ufos as he says hundreds 
of lights going across the sky really slow and I'm thinking god we're being invaded 
and the next day in the papers it said mysterious lights in the sky lights at salford rugby ground 
have gone mad and that was bull because when the lights at rugby grounds started 
moving around it's nothing like these so he has ever since then been obsessed with ufos 
and uh absolutely believes that uh he is a witness and he gets really angry at people who 
think he was imagining or as it says off his head when he saw them 
but he says no he's actually seen these things and then anytime he's seen anything 
otherworldly he was 100 percent clean and sober another very famous singer who saw ufos is neil 
sedaka world famous singer-songwriter who owns a home in the catskill mountains in upstate new 
york this is a pretty heavy duty area for ufo activity and there was a lot of sightings going 
on and early when sunday evening neil tsudaka and his son were playing outdoors when they saw 
something very weird in the sky and as neil sidaka says there moving slowly but steadily across the 
sky was what appeared to me at first to be nothing more than a shooting star however in subsequent 
action it convinced me that this object was no ordinary aircraft because the behavior 
the movement of the ufo was erratic this object would accelerate decelerate turn at right angles 
and they watched it for long enough to know that this wasn't a satellite or plane or anything conventional and uh after just a few minutes of observation they strangely 
lost interest and this object was actually still cavorting around when they returned inside 
and uh neil sedaka did grant a recorded interview to timothy green beckley but 
never really talked about it publicly because as he says some people are still prone to laugh 
though the number of skeptics are getting to be fewer and fewer in number
all right moving along another very famous actor to see ufos is william shatner 
uh who also granted an interview to timothy green beckley and talked about an amazing sighting he had in the mojave desert and uh he was out there motorcycling 
with his friends when during the day when he had an accident hit a hole and fell off of his bike 
and the bike fell on top of him and he lost consciousness and he woke up pretty much quickly 
but could not get his motorcycle started as hard as he tried and realized that he was in trouble 
because this was you know the mojave desert it was a blazing oven and he says that when he woke 
up under his motorcycle he thought he heard a strange sound or felt something saw something 
and it sort of gave him energy and beckley pressed william shatner for further details and 
shatner replied putting this into simple words is not easily done it was more of a sense a feeling a shadowy femtom all I know is that I suddenly felt better 
so he woke up got the strength to push his bike and uh at some point felt like he was being 
led out of the desert as william shatner says by this time I was doing what I was feeling 
one could say I was doing what I was told to do but I was just doing the easiest possible thing 
fantastic as it may seem the motorcycle appeared to have a way of going on its own and at one point 
he saw a figure off in the distance which he assumed was another motorcyclist and he 
gave him the courage and the strength to keep on walking but when he got to that point there was no 
sign of the figure but he did find this gas station and it was then that he saw a ufo 
as shatner says was then off in the distance I saw an object glinting in the heavens I don't 
know if it was a flying saucer I can't state for certain it wasn't I don't claim I was being 
led out of the desert by some mysterious force all I've told you are just the facts 
so he's leaving open the possibility that this may or may not have been a ufo 
as he says it's possible that's what happened merely one of the explanations I don't wish to 
go overboard better to understate something of this nature however the whole experience was 
real enough and happened as I told you I will let you make the interpretation
so there you go star trek star c's ufo another actor who saw ufos is uh elky summer she 
uh was very famous in the 60s and 70s or the 70s rather she's a german-born actress and says that 
she saw a ufo in november of 1977 while standing in her backyard it was about 10 30 when she saw 
a glowing reddish-orange sphere floating very low buy some trees about 150 feet away 
you said it was 20 feet in diameter it hovered for just a few moments at the height of about 
100 feet and then began to move slowly towards her and descending even lower until it was 
only about 25 feet maybe 50 feet off the ground and she ran inside her home to get her husband 
and together they ran outside but by this time it was gone
another celebrity to claim to have had ufo encounters is sting the very famous musician 
and in his uh book uh alien rock michael luckman who also wrote about elvis 
said and I quote sting is eager to learn the truth about ufos and the origin of the crop 
circles particularly the one that mysteriously turned up on his property together with a friend sting witnessed to ufo while on a skiing vacation in switzerland 
they saw what looked like the top of a mountain lit up like a christmas tree the light then sped 
away at high speed sting's wife trudy discovered the crop circle on the couple's estate in the 
same area where most of the crop circle formations have appeared so yeah sting has seen a ufo and uh 
apparently believes that he landed near his home and some of his music and music videos actually do 
reflect this for example the video and stings song I'm so happy shows little dancing gray aliens
the type that's you know well known in the popular culture
all right moving along another musician who's not super well known uh is jim sullivan who's a country rock singer and uh not uh super famous perhaps 
but did enjoy some success and in 1969 he released an album called ufo 
uh and it didn't do so well but in 1975 he tried his luck in nashville and uh eventually left l.a 
one day and drove his vw beetle to santa rosa new mexico and checked into a hotel 
and this is when something strange happened he disappeared his car was found 26 miles 
away and jim sullivan was never seen again his family and many others believes he may have been 
abducted because he often talked and sang about ufo encounters and in his car was his guitar 
something that his family and friends say he would never in a million years have left behind 
so perhaps he was taken into a ufo and that's where he is these today this is uh 
not unheard of there are cases where people have been abducted and not returned though it is apparently quite rare though maybe not there are a lot of missing people 
and Jim Sullivan is perhaps just one whose fame allowed us to you know learn about this case 
all right another witness to ufos is the actress Bella Thorne who started a number 
of movies such as the duff or shake it up she's not only an actor but a singer as well 
in an interview with the huffington post she talked about her own ufo encounter as bella 
thorne says we were driving to disneyland and we saw this really weird circular thing in the sky 
it had lights and it was freaking us out and then all of a sudden we could not find it in the sky 
and it really freaked us out so yeah a brief sighting but one of many by celebrities 
another musician who has seen ufos is mel tormey who says that one evening in 1953 at around 2 a.m 
he stepped out of his manhattan apartment on 61st street to walk his dog spooky and looking 
up saw this red light flying around in strange patterns and he thought could this be a balloon 
but it clearly wasn't because it was illuminated and then it did something no balloon could do 
as mel tormey says it moved horizontal faster than my eyes could follow it before stopping dead in 
its path as though it had hit a barrier and then it did lazy loops like a figure eight next it 
made a few more circles and then noiselessly it went zap again to another part of the sky 
meltor may estimates it was about five five thousand feet up and uh he could just make 
out quote a strange saucer-shaped craft of unknown dimensions behind this powerful red glow 
and he looked down at his dog and his dog also was looking at it and stood there 
quote totally transfixed and shaking and after a few more minutes of maneuvering around totally 
silently this object dipped off zipped off into the sky faster than he could follow 
mel tormey is absolutely convinced he saw a ufo he's a pilot by the way and familiar with aircraft 
he admits it could have been government but he doesn't think so because as he says nothing I 
know of that we have could move about so quickly and yet make absolutely no sound 
whatsoever all right moving towards the end of our list there's just a few more 
the next ufo witness and celebrity is musician and drummer ronnie vannucci jr vannucchi is best 
known for being the drummer of the hit rock band the killers and he had an incredible ufo sighting 
in the nevada desert as vannucci says I was driving to the middle of nevada on route 95 north 
and I saw this red dot in the sky almost like a laser pointer kind of red but it was bigger and 
it was doing all these motions like normal flight patterns and then it would zip down and go really 
quick I pulled over I didn't have a phone at the time I tried to radio people and no one heard me 
then it went behind this mountain range and it was six at night so the sun was going down and there was this giant flash of light afterwards like a strobe and it was gone it was crazy I am 
not making any of this up and uh in 2008 uh vannucci contributed to the writing of this 
2000 hit space man and the song begins it started with a low light next thing I know 
they ripped me from my bed and then they took my blood type it left a strange impression in my head 
so who knows maybe he's hinting he's actually been taken on board 
at the very least he had an incredibly impressive ufo sighting all right we now just 
have four more celebrities to cover and the next celebrity I'd like to talk about is ray walston 
ray walston rose to fame as being a star in the sitcom my favorite martian he actually played a 
martian ironically enough he also continued to act throughout his life and in fact had a very 
well-known role in fast times at ridgemont high as mr hand at any rate he was a staging 
screen actor and in the early 1960s saw a ufo in his home in beverly hills california he 
said it was about 3 000 feet high and kind of shaped like a bathtub it had an aluminum-like 
surface and he watched this object as it darted around and suddenly shot away and out of view
another ufo witness is punk rocker helen wheels she was one of the pioneers of the new york 
punk rock scene and composed several songs for the very famous musical group blue oyster cult 
she has gold and platinum records testifying to her achievements so so yeah she's very well known and she's also gone public as a ufo abductee it was one saturday 
uh morning or afternoon it was around noon in june of 1961 she was 12 years old and 
she and her younger brother peter robbins who is now a very well-known ufo researcher 
they both saw five objects in the sky high above their rockville center long island home 
and instantly the objects zoomed down and hovered right over the two children and they could both see these were metallic craft they formed a v formation right over 
the house across the street these were silvery white disk shaped objects and
peter was 14 years old again helen was 12 years old and they became frightened and ran 
towards the house and at this point peter robbins completely forgot about the ufos just left his 
mind he said time seemed to move in slow motion when this beam of light came down and struck him 
and he was unconscious before he hit the ground and meanwhile helen was staring at these objects 
and she experienced a period of missing time and uh next thing she knows he's she's watching this 
much larger ufo scoop up the five smaller craft and it darts away 
and at that time they didn't quite understand that they had missing time but once they realized what 
missing time meant they realized they had probably been taken on board peter robbins 
helen wheel's brother went under hypnosis but wasn't able to recall anything but helen 
did go under hypnosis as well as well she recalled being hit by this beam of light and taken 
into account wheels said I was in a small round dark area and a tall being 
came and got me for some reason I wasn't really afraid of him as he kept reassuring me through messages in my mind taking my hand he led me into a control room 
in which there were all sorts of dials and meters and lights kind of like a cockpit 
she was placed inside a chair and shown this television-like screen that showed the blackness of outer space filled with bright stars according to helen the ET was about six feet tall 
with a large bald head large dark eyes and grayish skin and he wore a metallic one-piece jumpsuit 
and the whole time he stood beside right next to her was very friendly and mentally reassured her 
she was then taken to another room she was put on a table and examined by shorter looking gray type 
ets and as helen says something very painful was shoved up my nostril to the extent that it put 
a hole in my nose and blood poured out and the next thing she knows she was being returned via 
a beam of light to her home without any memory of this onboard encounter so she's still 
dealing with the after effects of this abduction and as she says I felt totally violated as if they 
had proceeded against my will and for this reason I do not know if I can ever completely trust them
another uh celebrity who's gone pub well who didn't actually go public but uh 
apparently gave an interview about his encounter it's Stuart Whitman who has done a lot of movies 
and uh this actor stuart whitman apparently had a sighting during the great new york blackout on 
november 9th 1965 on the 12th floor of manhattan hotel in new york city and he says he was woken 
up just before sunset by a whistling noise right outside his room and looking out he saw two ufos 
and I'll just quote stewart directly as he said one of them was orange and the other was blue 
they gave off a strange luminescent light so that I couldn't see if there were portholes or who was in them then I heard them speaking to me as if they were on a loudspeaker they spoke to me 
in english it may not have been audible to anyone else I was probably tuned to the right wavelength 
they said they wanted to talk to me because I appeared to have no malice or hate in my soul 
they said they were fearful of earth because earthlings were messing around with unknown quantities and might disrupt the balance of the universe on their planet 
they said that the blackout was just a little demonstration of their power and that they could do a lot more with almost no effort it served as a warning they said they said they could stop our 
whole planet from functioning they asked me to do what I could to fight malice prejudice and hate 
on earth and then they took off I felt elated I wasn't even shocked I was standing by the window 
and awake the entire time I don't know why they picked me as a contact but I'll swear off a bible 
that I saw them out there and that they talked to me so here we have again this these common 
themes of a ufo display and these warnings against war and aggression and nuclear power 
and environmental collapse very interesting 

And now we get to our final celebrity, Robbie Williams. Robbie Williams is an actor and a singer and he gave an interview on a television news show 
in which he very seriously talked about his ufo encounter while on a ranch in Utah. 
And the details are kind of sparse on this one. Apparently he saw this object come down out 
of the sky and hover directly overhead. So close that he could have hit it with a tennis ball. 
Unfortunately the guy who interviewed him kind of joked about it and didn't take it so seriously. So we don't 
have a whole lot of details about it. But it was apparently so low that it was within a rock's throw distance.

I'm not so sure that this is a coincidence I think they probably did it on purpose 
and might not also be a coincidence that Robbie Williams has written some songs that are 
sort of influential in talking about the world and like his song 
advertising space which is all about the best in the worst of humanity's existence.

So, there you have it. That's more than 70 celebrities who have seen UFO's. Actors, singers, 
Sports Stars. I didn't even get into politicians because this video would have just been too long. 
And that's enough I think to convince people that UFOs display very little prejudice on who 
they contact. In fact, probably appear to contact people who are doing good for 
humanity. People who are influential. People who can get the word out and talk about them. 
They are putting on displays. They want people to know that they exist and they want us to know 
that we are on the verge of destroying our own planet. And that I think is why they want actors 
and musicians and sports stars in particular to know that they are real and 
that they have a message they are trying to share with all humanity. I think this is important 
and that's the real reason why I wanted to do this episode. That's it for now. Hope you're having a 
great day. Thanks once again for watching. I really appreciate it. And until next time, keep having fun.
