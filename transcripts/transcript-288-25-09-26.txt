ALIENS FROM OTHER WORLDS: TEN SHOCKING ENCOUNTERS
Sep 26. 2025

Summary:
Sep 26, 2025
Strange humanoids have been visiting our planet for a very long time. Although the mainstream scientific community has been slow to accept the veracity of such accounts, there are now so many cases that they have become impossible to ignore or explain away. This video presents ten lesser-known cases involving a variety of ET types. These cases show how shocking it can be to have an experience like this, and how it affects a person for the rest of their lives. With so many people reporting humanoid encounters, it is time to take them seriously and learn all we can about these mysterious visitors to our planet.

I WILL REMEMBER THIS EVENT UNTIL THE DAY I DIE. One morning in 1946, Will (age 7) was in the basement of his aunt’s home in Cheviot, Ohio, when he sensed a presence. Turning around he found himself face-to-face with a short gray alien looking directly at him. A staring contest ensued, until Will became scared and fled the scene. It took him 60 years to find the courage to report his encounter.

I WAS SO FRIGHTENED. On the afternoon of December 9, 1954, Olmiro da Costa was feeding his sheep and cows when a strange craft appeared over his farm in Linha, Bela Vista, Brazil. Three human-looking ETs emerged. At first frightened, one of the figures approached him and smiled, which reassured Olmiro. The ETs took some of his plants and re-entered their craft. This was one of many other humanoid encounters in this area at that time.

I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THEM. One night in 1967, two boys were playing outside their apartment home in Turku, Finland. Hearing a strange sound, they were suddenly approached by two unusual-looking humanoid figures glowing with green light. The two men shuffled towards the boys in such an odd manner, the boys realized they were not normal humans and ran away.

ALIENS AT THE CAR RACE. On the night of July 4, 1969, a young woman was sitting in the bleachers with a crowd of other people at the Automemories Speedway in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Looking up, she saw an oval-shaped craft with a big window, and group of humanoids looking down and watching the race. In utter disbelief, the witness looked away and when she looked back, the UFO was gone.

THREE ALIENS IN DOWNTOWN GRAFTON. One day in May 1972, a couple was window shopping in downtown Grafton, NSW, Australia when they saw three strange figures on the sidewalk. The figures were 3 feet tall, with rough brown skin, pointed ears and were wearing strange clothes. The couple was shocked and after examining the figures, realized that they could not be human.

FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL. One night in October 1989, Susanna and her father sat in her bedroom in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Her father had his back to the window. Susanna looked up and saw a gray alien staring back at her. She had no idea what it was, but knew it wasn’t human. Frozen in fear, she couldn’t alert her dad. The ET quickly moved off. She told her father, but he said she must have seen an animal.

I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF SANTA’S ELVES. On December 24, 1997, Bonnie (age 5) crept out of the bedroom into the living room of her home in Athens, Alabama, to get a drink of water. To her shock, an alien was in her home. She’d never heard of aliens and thought it was an elf bringing her presents. She felt no fear but suddenly blacked out and woke up in bed. 
THE ALIEN IN THE BARN. One night in October 1999, Kyle (age 9) noticed that the cows on his dairy farm in Roy, Washington were acting up. Going out to investigate, he came face-to-face with a short gray alien staring right at him. After a few moments, he became scared and ran off. It was an encounter that he would never forget.

IT MADE OUR JAWS DROP. The town of Cachi, Argentina has a long rich history of UFO encounters. In 2003, activity ramped up and residents began to capture photos of the craft. On December 16, 2003, eight people drove outside of town when a craft landed in the distance. One of the witnesses approached and saw many glowing humanoid figures. This was one of several humanoid cases and other dramatic encounters.
 
I FULLY BELIEVE IN ALIENS. On the night of October 28, 2010, a woman woke up in her home in Mount Troy, Pennsylvania to see several gray ETs around her bed. Immobilized, she watched in shock as the room filled with light and her boyfriend levitated off the bed. She managed to throw her body on top of his, but he still rose upwards. The room filled with light, and she blacked out.

So many cases, so many witnesses, so many different types of humanoids…the face-to-face humanoid accounts represent the very heart of the UFO phenomenon. They have much to teach us about extraterrestrial contact and life beyond Earth. Our governments are spending an enormous amount of time, energy and money to coverup the truth of this subject. It’s time all humanity accepts the truth: we are being visited by aliens from other worlds.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. Thanks so much
for joining me tonight. I'm going to be talking about my favorite aspect of this
UFO phenomena, which is of course humanoids. I find these cases endlessly
fascinating. They have so much to teach us. I think they represent really solid
proof that we are not alone in this universe. So, the cases I've chosen for
you today are ones that are lesser known. I like finding these cases that are more obscure, ones that people
haven't heard of before. And I think that these cases you probably haven't
heard before. These cases reach pretty far back in time, all the way to the
1940s, all the way up to the 2010s. So, that's eight decades. So, I'm going to
be taking you kind of on a journey not only through time, but through space because these cases come from a wide
variety of different locations. I like finding cases all over the world
because this phenomenon is ubiquitous. It's certainly not confined to the United States as some people have
asserted. No, these cases occur everywhere on planet Earth. And the 10
cases I've chosen for you today include Finland, Australia, Argentina, and
Brazil, and six cases from the United States, including Alabama, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin. These do include a wide
variety of extraterrestrial types. So we see humanl looking ETS which is always interesting to me but glowing beings
grays of course short little dwarves the variety of humanoids is really
astonishing. So we definitely see that in these cases. Yeah I call this aliens
from other worlds 10 shocking encounters because honestly that is the theme we
see in so many of these kinds of accounts. It's a really huge shock, a
real big surprise for witnesses when they suddenly have this encounter with really little or no warning. And it's
especially traumatic if people have not heard of this subject before. It's one of the reasons I do this research. I
think we all deserve to know the truth about the fact that we are not alone. These cases are far more numerous than
most people believe. So yeah, that's the sort of theme for today's episode. Let's
just get started. First case I want to talk about is a very early case which I call I will remember this event until
the day I die. It is of course a firsthand quote from the witness himself
and it is something that a lot of witnesses talk about how truly memorable
and impactful their encounter is. This one occurred one morning in 1946 in
Cheviet, Ohio. What's interesting to me about this case is that this occurred long before the idea of
extraterrestrials had really been publicized at all. The witness in this case is anonymous. I'll call him Will.
He had a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid that left a lifelong impression on him. In fact, it's taken him 60 years
to come forward. This incident occurred one morning around 1946 when he was only
six or seven years old. And I'll just quote Will directly as he says, "It was
around midm morning. I was visiting my aunt. Her home at that time was in the country in Cheviet, Ohio. Their basement
garage was built under their house, which is where I was when this happened. I was playing with my aunt's music box.
My back was to the garage door, which was open, when I felt like something was wrong. I turned towards the open door
and there was a creature looking at me. I don't know just how tall I was at that
time, but it seemed to be about my size. Its head was larger than its body with
large eyes, small arms, and what looked to be hands. It was stooped over slightly. The most strange part about
this figure was that I could see its veins. I didn't feel frightened, but I
wanted my aunt to see this. So, I turned and ran up the basement stairs where my aunt was. And by the time I convinced
her to go down to the garage, the figure was gone. And of course, she told me not to go around telling people about what I
thought I saw because it was all just in my head. So, needless to say, Will
disagrees, and he remains vehement that he saw a strange creature of some kind.
And although the duration of the sighting was only a few seconds, it was long enough for him to get a good look
at this creature and know that it was real and that it was not human. As Will
says, I am now 66 years old. I have told this story to many people in my life and
everyone has thought that I have made this up. I guess it is because my life is growing short that I want to make a
real effort to tell my story. Until the day I die, I will remember this event. I
wonder just what that creature was thinking when we were just standing there looking at each other. I hope you
believe me, and if you do, you will be the first. An amazing case. That's the
kind of case that really makes me feel for the witness. He was so young when he had his encounter. Quite a few people do
have encounters when they're very young and so they have to deal with that at a very young age. Then there's the double
whammy of not being believed. I think it might be easier for people if they'd heard of grays or ETSs before, but in
these early cases, no. This is something that's absolutely out of a person's world experience. So I think that makes
it even more impactful. Now let's move to the next case which is equally astonishing. I think I call this
one I was so frightened. This one occurred on December 9, 1954 in a small
little town in Brazil called Lena Bella Vista. This one actually involves a
series of encounters. This occurred right after the tail end of a huge wave
of humanoids in France, but really across Europe and to some extent all over the world. 1954 was a big year for
this subject and the series of events that occurred in Brazil involved quite a
few sightings and quite a few humanoid cases as well. And once again, we see that theme where people are absolutely
surprised to find themselves a witness to something that's truly amazing. This
case comes from researcher Xiao Martins and it first appeared in the Brazilian magazine Oruo. This is a mainstream
magazine which was known for its openness to the UFO subject. The witness
is an uneducated farmer by the name of Omiro Dosta Erosa. It was around 5:00
p.m. on December 9, 1954. and Omiro was feeding his farm animals bean plants and
corn on his property in Lena Bella Vista in Brazil. Without warning, his cows and other farm
animals began to scatter in fear. And this is when he realized something unusual was happening. As he says, I
suddenly heard a strange sound, almost like a sewing machine. I looked around
and up and saw a strange person close to me staring at me intently. A short
distance away, hovering close to the ground, I saw a flying object that looked like an explorer's hat. The
object was cream colored and seemed to be surrounded by transparent smoke. Two human beings were visible in the object.
One stood in the upper door, while the other looked closely at the metal wire fence that surrounded my field. Now per
Omiro, the three beings were of normal height with white complexions which
Omiro compared to a cadaavver. They had long blonde hair, slanted eyes unlike a
normal person. He did notice that their hair was blowing in the wind. He said that they had broad shoulders and they
were all wearing one piece light brown overalls which fastened to strangelooking shoes with no heels on
them. Now, the craft, he said, was about 15 m in diameter, that's 45 ft, round in
shape, and it was glowing brightly. Now, at this point, Omiro was paralyzed with
fear. As he says, I was so frightened that I dropped the hoe that I had just
held in my hand. The stranger made a gesture that resembled a military salute, smiled, picked up my hoe, looked
at it curiously from all sides, and then handed it back to me. So after handing him back his garden hoe, the being took
one of the plants from Omiro and began to go back to the craft. Now according to some sources, the being instead
picked a few plants from the ground, but it seems more likely that Omiro handed them to the being as his crops would not
likely be in the same field where his animals were being kept. At any rate,
this is what Omiro said happened next. He turned and walked back towards the
machine, and somewhat hesitantly I followed. However, the one stranger who
had watched the field fence and the sheep in the field gestured me to stand
back. So, at this point, some of the farm animals lost their fear and began
to approach, including the sheep. And the UFO occupants started looking at these animals with apparent great
interest. Olmiro now had the sense that these beings were friendly, and using
words and gestures, he tried to communicate to the strange men that they were welcome to take one of his sheep if
they wanted. But these visitors from the UFO either did not understand or were not interested in his sheep. Omiro
shouted out to his neighbors who later confirmed that they had heard him shouting, but none of his neighbors
approached and the three occupants ended the meeting. Now, as Omiro says, all
three of them quickly disappeared into the craft, which rose into the air with tremendous speed and soon disappeared
from sight. So, after the craft left, Omiro did notice an odor, which he said was similar to burning coal, and it
remained in the air for some time. He did check the ground where this strange craft had hovered, but didn't find
anything unusual. Omiro's encounter did catch the attention of the Brazilian authorities
who began an investigation. Omiro could not read. He had never heard of flying saucers. He expressed his
opinion that the machine and its crew must belong to a foreign nation on Earth. Now, the authorities found him to
be a very credible witness and an honest man, and it was them who told him that
this might have actually been a craft from another world piloted by extraterrestrials.
And after thinking about it, Omiro agreed that this explanation was probably the correct one. Now,
afterwards, Omiro did have nightmares about this encounter. In fact, his son was interviewed many years later and
asserted his opinion that his father did not lie about the encounter and that it really happened. Also, in support of
Omiro's story is that unknown to him, 2 days later on December 11, 1954,
his next door neighbor Pedro Morice, who lived about 2 km away, was preparing to
go to a warehouse to buy supplies when he heard his hands squawking. and he had
a very unusual encounter. As Pedro says, "I heard the frightened cries of a
chicken. Thinking it might be a sparrow hawk, I went outdoors to see what was happening. I still heard the chicken,
but couldn't find it because I found another thing that made me forget the original purpose of my search. I saw a
strange object suspended in the air, hovering, making a noise like a sewing
machine and exhibiting an agitated oscilly movement. It was shaped, it
appeared to me, like the hood of a jeep on the top and like an enormous polished brass kettle on the lower part. When my
eyes left the strange object turning towards the cultivated fields, I noticed
two figures of human shape that were walking through the tobacco fields. Now
per Pedro, these beings were quite short, about 4 feet tall. Though he was unable to describe their appearance in
any detail due to their strange attire. As he says, the figures were human only
in shape of the head and body. All the time I concentrated my eyes on their faces, but I didn't see the eyes, the
nose, the mouth, and the ears. There was nothing of the kind. No face was visible. I got the impression that they
were placed into a kind of sack or bag of yellow color which enveloped their bodies completely from head to foot. Now
Pedro was actually more upset that somebody was trespassing his fields than he was frightened by their strange
appearance and he confronted these trespassers as he says. I didn't like
that and began to walk towards the machine to ask for an explanation about the invasion of the fields. One of the
figures was watching my actions and immediately raised one arm, motioning me
not to come any closer. Of course, I didn't obey the sign to stop and
continued to walk towards the object. Seeing that I was approaching rapidly, the figure that was about 10 yards
started to run towards the craft. Meanwhile, the one that was near the craft kneelled down and picked up a
tobacco plant from the ground. I saw later that the plant had been rooted out abruptly. They entered together into the
object which disappeared into the sky. Now, Pedro was also uneducated. He had
not heard of UFOs, and he wondered if he had perhaps seen ghosts or saints. He
really had no explanation. But when he later learned that the Brazilian government was interested in these
beings, he vowed to try and shoot one of them if they should return. Pedro never
did see his hen and her chicks again. And it turned out that there were quite a few landings involving humanoids in
this area at that time. In fact, on November 10, 1954, now some sources say
October 30th, an aronomist and his wife and two daughters were driving in the
Porto Allegre area of Brazil when they came upon a landed discshaped craft.
They say that two men with long hair wearing jumpsuits emerged and began to approach their car with their hands
raised. The witnesses became quite frightened and drove off, but they did
see the men re-enter the disc, which now rose upwards and darted away at high speed. And it was just 4 days later at
3:30 a.m. on November 14, 1954 that a Brazilian railway employee was
inspecting the railway tracks with a lantern at Curatiba, Brazil. And this is
when he saw a lensshaped craft sitting on the rails between the Laganhas and
Urai stations. He said, "Three beings in tight-fitting luminous clothes emerged from the craft
and used flashlightike objects, instruments to examine the gravel around
the rails. Upon seeing the man, the three beings returned into their craft, which quickly rose up and zoomed off. It
was around that time that a teacher in nearby Ure also saw a glowing object
above the town. And finally, only 6 days after Omiro Rosa's encounter on December
15, 1954, a man was fishing near Campo Grande, Brazil, when he saw an unusual craft
land a few hundred feet away from him. His dog immediately began to howl. So,
the fisherman used the telescopic sight of his rifle and could see that the craft was hovering about 6 ft above the
ground. He said it had three spheres shaped protrusions on the bottom of the craft. Another spherical object was
revolving around the larger craft. And he said that three very short and small
humanlooking occupants came out of the craft and moved with rapid agility on
the ground near the craft. One was holding a luminous basket of some kind
and the other was holding a tube with a cone shape on the end. and the one with the tube began to collect soil and rocks
from the river's edge with the tube which discharged the contents into the basket. They then quickly returned into
their craft which took off at high speed. The witness later found square holes in the ground at the sight of the
encounter. It's interesting to me how these sightings, these encounters come
in waves. I don't know what was going on in that area at that time, but clearly
the ETSs were doing either an exploration, perhaps a scientific study.
Very hard to say for sure. Maybe this was a display, but so interesting that
all these humanoid cases are clustered together in such a short period of time in a pretty specific location. Super
fascinating. Now, let's move to the next case. This one is also really
interesting to me because it's quite unusual. Don't know that I've heard one quite like it. And I really wonder
what's going on with this case. I call this one I could not take my eyes off of
them. This occurred on February 1967 in Turu, Finland. And this one does
involve multiple witnesses and a very unusual humanoid as well. Two humanoids
in fact. This next case comes from the Finland UFO Research Organization, which
has done amazing work investigating cases in their country. It was one February evening in 1967 around 8:00
p.m. that two cousins, I call them Levi and Miko, these are pseudonyms, were
playing in the driveway in front of Levi's garage located at the intersection of Elellananti and Haka
Pelinkatu in Turu, Finland. So, you can see the exact location here. They were
just playing, taking turns hitting a ball with hockey sticks and using the garage door as a goal. It was Levi's
turn to hit the ball, and his cousin Miko was playing the goalie. Now, at some point during their play, they
started to hear a very low and steady sound and wondered what it could be. It
took a few moments for Levi to notice it. And when he looked in that direction, he saw two glowing green
figures or what he calls quote the phosphorescent men. And I'll just quote
Levi because he describes this in great detail. As he says, I was startled and
froze in place. I could not take my eyes off of them. There were two of them and
they were identical. The appearance of the phosphorescent men was very humanlike. At least I don't remember
anything special about the eyes, mouth, ears, etc. What was exceptional was the
color of the skin on the face and the brightness of the rest of their appearance. The color of the face, or
rather all visible skin, was uniformly scarlet red throughout. The brightness
of the men was much more intense than anything else anywhere, but it still didn't dazzle the eyes. They were
moving, walking very slowly, unnaturally. The distance is not long, but it took
maybe almost a minute before they were a couple of meters from me. The same low frequency steady sound was heard all the
time. Frozen in place, I could not take my eyes off them. So, it was at this
point that his cousin Mo, whose view of the men was blocked by the corner of the garage, was wondering why the heck Levi
had stopped playing and kept asking him over and over, "What now? Hit the ball."
Now, as Levi says, when his voice became more demanding, I managed to turn my
gaze towards him and away from the phosphorous men, but I couldn't get a word out of my mouth due to my fright.
In terror, I just ran away as fast as I could to the courtyard of Haka Pelangatu
where we lived. He saw them almost at close range when he went to pick up the ball that had fallen on the ground in
front of me. However, he didn't panic, but ran after me into the courtyard and
to the front door of our staircase, the E staircase. So, the two boys remained in the
courtyard, waiting to see if these strange glowing men would follow them, but they never did. Earlier, Levi had
heard people talking about the phosphorus men and he thought at first it was something on TV. But after his
experience about one month later, he realized that this must be what people had been talking about. So he shared his
experience with his family, but nobody else. But then a few years later, his
teacher in school mentioned that other people in the Numei district where Levi lived had also reported seeing these
men. And as Levi says, "My own experience has not been forgotten and it
still comes back to mind from time to time as inexplicable and enigmatic."
Such a strange case. What I do like about it is we know exactly where it occurred. And this is a very populated
area. What are these humanoids doing there? How did they get there? No UFO is
actually seen. So, we can't say for sure that these were even extraterrestrials.
hard to say. Uh but absolutely they were humanoid. Uh the fact that they were
glowing green and kind of phosphorescent is also very interesting. Fact that they approach these boys so closely. Where do
they go? How do they disappear? There's always more questions than answers. It seems like when we have these
encounters, but a really interesting case also because the other people were
reporting these figures as well. This is not an isolated case. Apparently, there were quite a few accounts of these
phosphorescent men being seen in this area at that time. So, I don't know.
It's just case after case after case. Something is so clearly going on here. Skeptics at this point simply have not
done their research, their homework. It's undeniable. The sheer number of
cases, I think, provides the best evidence that there's absolutely
something to this. And here's another case. This one's also super interesting.
I call this one Aliens at the Car Race. This occurred on July 4, 1969 in
Oaklair, Wisconsin on the outskirts in sort of the country. But what makes this
case so interesting to me is that it looks like ETSs were drawn to the fact that humans are performing this weird
activity of racing their cars. So perhaps that was the draw here for the
ETSs. But let's take a look at this case. This very interesting case was investigated by Muon field investigator
Craig R. Lang of Minnesota MUON and author of the book The Cosmic Bridge,
Close Encounters and Human Destiny. It is a brief sighting of a UFO with aliens, but it does have some
extraordinary details. It was 10:30 p.m. on July 4th, 1969,
and the anonymous witness, I call her Sherry, had accompanied her father to a stock car race being held at the Auto
Memories Speedway. This is now defunct. There was a large crowd of people there.
But Sherry was sitting alone on the top bench of the bleachers that overlooked this oval racetrack. And this is when
she got a strange feeling that somebody or something was watching her. So,
looking to her right and up, this is when she saw an ovalshaped object
hovering only about 1,000 ft away from her and 100 ft up in the air, directly
north of her at the corner of this lot next to two rows of trees. It was
glowing bright yellow and red. And there was a transparent rectangular section on
the side of the object, a window, and she was amazed to see three to five humanoids inside this craft. She could
only see their heads and shoulders, and they were only visible as silhouettes, but it did look to her like they were
observing the crowd and the activities going on at the racetrack. She also had
the impression that they might have been amused. She viewed them for about 8 seconds in total astonishment. She was
in absolute disbelief at the site and looked away, then immediately looked back, but the object was now gone. She
was so shocked by this sighting that she did not tell anyone. As investigator Craig Lang writes, the witness indicates
that although the park was crowded, apparently no additional people cited the object. This is notable in that a
large anomalous object was apparently visible to the witness while the rest of those present do not observe it. If this
phenomenon occurred as objectively as described, its manner of appearance and disappearance greatly increase the
strangeness level of the event. I can think of no phenomena, either natural or
man-made, that would appear to be able to account for this event. case does leave me with some real puzzling
questions. Were they there just to sort of check out what humans were doing racing around in circles? I mean,
admittedly, that is an odd activity. I also find it interesting that there's only one witness cuz there was a huge
crowd of people there. This was pretty obvious, this craft, according to the witness. So, it's surprising that more
people didn't see it. Perhaps this was very brief, so a lot of people didn't have the opportunity. Perhaps this was
meant for the witness alone. This does appear to be a oneoff, which is quite unusual because usually when people see
humanoids, they often have, you know, a lifetime of unusual experiences, which
is possible cuz I wasn't able to talk to this witness firsthand. And there's, I'm sure, more information
to this case, but really fascinating. We don't really even know the types of humanoids that were seen in this case,
so that would be interesting. I mean, it's possible that some of these are humans in a reverse engineered craft,
but that raises even more questions cuz what would they be doing showing themselves at a car race like this? Just
an unusual case all around. And there's always more. This one, this next one, I think, is even more unusual. I call this
one Three Aliens in downtown Grafton. This occurred in one day in May of 1972
in Grafton, Australia. It's not a huge city, but it's a, you know, not a tiny
town either. This is really interesting to me because this is one example of
quite a few where people see what appear to be ETS in a wholly public location in
a place you would never expect to see something like this. This is a multiple witness case as well and there is a
loose association with UFOs in that UFOs were seen in that area around that time
but no direct connection. But clearly these were unusual humanoids and the
witnesses themselves feel absolutely convinced this was not normal in any way. This truly strange encounter comes
from Australian researcher Keith Basterfield. There's not a lot of detail to it, but it is quite bizarre. The
witnesses were Ron Farret and his wife. And it was one day in May 1972 that they
decided to go on a shopping trip in downtown Grafton. This is in New South
Wales, Australia. And they were just walking along a sidewalk when up ahead of them, they saw three very oddlooking
dwarfish people, two males and one female. They were just under 3 and 1/2
ft tall and it looked to the witnesses that they were wearing clothes that were
simulated to look like quote ordinary men in street clothes. Now, Mrs. Farret
had been a seamstress for many years, and she was interested because the fabric was totally unfamiliar to her.
These figures were wearing sandals on their feet. And this couple who saw these beings said that these dwarf
beings had rough, wrinkled skin of a deep brown color that looked very old.
But at the same time, the beings seemed to be young. They had large slanted Asian-looking eyes that seemed to quote
pop out. They had very short hair and pointed ears. and they were also moving
strangely, kind of shuffling along, looking in store windows. The couple did
notice that other passers by also noticed their strange appearance and kept well away from these figures. These
beings did not speak. Mr. and Mrs. Farret approached within several feet of them and got a very good look at them.
They speculated that perhaps these three dwarfs might be performers from a visiting children's show such as Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfves. But ultimately they concluded that this explanation did not suffice as the
figures were too strange for even that. Now, interestingly, just one month
later, on June 23rd, 1972, dozens of people in Grafton called the
local newspaper, the Grafton Daily Examiner to report their sighting of a strange, bright glowing object hovering
west of Grafton along the Rushforth Road. This was between 8:15 and 8:30
p.m. The reports differed slightly, but most described this object as quote, "a
bright orange light which seemed to hover over the ground not far above the trees." One witness said it was cigar-
shaped and had a light at each end. The police were contacted and they denied
receiving any calls about it. Hard to say if these two events, the humanoids
and the sighting are related other than being in the same area around the same
time. I think that qualifies as shocking. I really wonder about these
human. I mean, perhaps they were people who worked at a circus or, you know,
some sort of theater or something like this. The witnesses certainly didn't think so and they were there so they
would know better than anyone else who's just purely speculating. I would like to
speak to these witnesses. I have quite a few questions like what color were these clothes? I'd like more details on this.
Personally, if something like that happened to me, I would like to follow these guys and see where they were going
to because if they were truly ETSs, I mean, that would be very interesting to
see if there was a craft involved in this case. So, it's the kind of case again that raises more questions than
answers, and it's certainly fascinating. I wish there were more witnesses to that
because clearly it wasn't just this couple who saw these three dwarflike beings.
So now let's move to another case. This next case is a single witness case anecdotal from a child witness but
really unusual and clearly this witness is very sincere. I call this case
fascinating and beautiful. This one occurred one evening in October of 1989
in Murreey'sboro, Tennessee. I know other cases that have occurred in this area. Uh but this does appear to be a
singular case in which a very young child had a face-to-face encounter with
what appears to be a gray ET. But the details of this case are pretty unusual
as we'll see. The witness in this case is anonymous. I call her Susanna. That is a pseudonym. She was seven or eight
years old when she saw an alien, as she says, quote, face to face. She and her
family had just moved to a rented house located at 1947 Larry Court in
Murreey'sboro, Tennessee. Now, this is a culde-sac with only a few homes on it. It was around
1000 p.m. one evening in the fall of 1989 when this incident occurred.
Susanna was reading her book, Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Now, this was a talking book. It was supposed to read
itself out loud to her, but she couldn't get it to work right. So, she decided to get her father to help her fix the book.
Her father came into her room and sat down on the bed while Susanna stood in front of him facing him. And there was a
window behind her dad with the curtains open. And I'll just let Susanna describe
what happened next. As she says, "I heard the crunching of the leaves, which
of course directed me to look outside behind my dad, and then I saw the alien.
The alien must have been tall because even though it was a one-story house, the foundation was raised a bit. I'm
guessing it was 6 to 8 ft tall. It had a huge head and it was skinny. The eyes
had detail. They looked like ours, but huge. I remember it was wearing something silver. It was fascinating and
beautiful, but at the same time terrifying. I remember being absolutely
frozen. I couldn't move or talk, and I just stared at the alien, which felt
like an eternity. Surprisingly, the alien looked equally terrified of me,
like it didn't expect to see me there, staring back at him or her. I wanted so
bad to scream or let my dad know, but I couldn't move to get the words out. My
father had no idea as his back was to the window. After a moment or two, the
alien walked away. Now with the alien gone, Susanna's paralysis instantly lifted and she
immediately told her dad what she had seen. Unfortunately, he dismissed it and
told her that she must have seen an owl or a raccoon. Susanna, however, knows it
was an alien. She had never heard of gay aliens at this point, but she had seen the movie ET, so she knew the idea of
what an alien might be. The movie ET had in fact terrified her. But it wasn't
until one year later when she and her family watched the movie Communion about Whitley Strieber's encounters that she
recognized what she had seen as a gray alien. She immediately told her father that the alien in the movie was exactly
like the one she had seen. But again, he dismissed her story. There is one final
notable aftere effect to this account. As Susanna says, I don't know if it was
fear or a PTSD response, but since then, I could see that face every time I
closed my eyes. Eventually, over time, that faded away. I wonder about that
case. ETSs do seem to have a tendency to kind of walk up to people's houses and
look in their windows. So, it makes me wonder how many ETs are walking around at night just sort of exploring and
looking into people's homes. I also wonder if this witness had further encounters because that's a pretty close
up encounter with the humanoid. And it's interesting to me that the father was
right there and didn't get the opportunity to see it. This is such a shocking experience for people that
they're often just absolutely dumbruck. It's very hard for people to react and
point out these beings. But it's a fascinating case because how this
witness described this ET was not malevolent uh but fascinating and beautiful is how
she put it. Another really interesting detail is she described this ET looking a bit frightened. Uh she was a little
frightened herself and I've noticed there's a number of cases where ETSs will seem to mimic a person's reaction.
If they become startled, the ET will kind of pretend to be startled.
This sort of thing. So I don't know. It's a really interesting case which I think s sort of shows the humanity of
the ETSs themselves. They're not that different from us. But yeah, more questions than answers. And here's
another one, which is definitely shocking. I call this one, I thought it was one of Santa's elves. This occurred
on December 24, 1997 in Athens, Alabama. So, this is a Christmas Eve encounter. I
know a number of cases that occur on Christmas Eve. So that could be pure coincidence because we only have 365
days each year and there are encounters pretty much every day. If you peruse the
vast UFO literature, you can pretty much find an encounter on any single date.
But this one is interesting because yeah, Christmas Eve and this witness creeps out and sees this ET who as a
little child she'd never heard of these things and assumed it was one of Santa's elves. Although Bonnie was only 5 years
old when she had her encounter with an apparent extraterrestrial, even as an adult, she still remembers it
vividly. It was Christmas Eve on December 24, 1997.
Bonnie woke up in the bedroom of her parents' home in Athens, Alabama. Bonnie
was thirsty, so she decided to tell her mom to get her something to drink. Because Christmas was the next morning,
her parents had forbidden her from entering the living room until morning so that she wouldn't see all the
presents under the tree. But Bonnie figured that since she was thirsty, her parents wouldn't be angry with her. And
this led to one of the strangest experiences of her life. as Bonnie says. So, I got up and left my bed. I walked
through the hallway and standing in front of the front door was a 5-ft tall brown alien with almond eyes, a pudgy
belly, thin arms, and no distinguishable gender. The being was looking around the
living room as if looking for something. At that age, I didn't know what aliens were, so I thought it was one of Santa's
elves. Beside it was my brand new Barbie tricycle. I thought the elf had brought
it for me, so I told it, "Thank you." And when it turned to look at me, I
waved and said, "Hello." It kept looking at me. I felt no fear, though, because I
thought it was friendly. Then I don't remember anything else. It's all blacked
out. I woke up in my bed like nothing had happened. She felt that this was a
real experience. She was not dreaming. So that morning, she told her mother, confessing that she had actually seen
her new tricycle. That way, Bonnie figured her mother would know that it wasn't just a dream. Her mother listened
and then told her to draw the elf. Bonnie immediately drew an illustration of the creature. But this turned out to
frighten her mother, who immediately told her it must have been a dream. Even though Bonnie knew it wasn't, she
stopped talking about it and never really thought about it. It wasn't until many years later as an adult that she
was looking through old photographs and saw her Barbie tricycle. She asked her
mom about it and her mom did remember this incident and together they searched for the drawing that Bonnie had made but
they weren't able to find it. But then her mom revealed something interesting.
She said that other people in her family had also had quote other worldly experiences and that includes Bonnie's
mother and grandmother. But as Bonnie says, mine was the closest in the
family. Bonnie's mother informed her about Muon and encouraged her daughter
to report her experience. And 24 years after Bonnie saw this apparent gray ET,
she did report it. And as Bonnie says, it was an alien being. I've never
experienced anything similar since. Thank you for reading this. It feels good to share it after all this time.
Pretty clear to me that there was missing time in that case. So, I suspect there was probably some sort of onboard
experience or something else going on given that the witness pretty much blacked out in the middle of the
encounter. And if I were able to talk to this witness, I suspect that I could
find that they had more unusual experiences throughout their lives because that is the pattern we see,
particularly when it involves a young child who is having a very close encounter. It's one thing to have an ET
look in through your window. It's quite another to have one in your home. It's interesting how the mother reacted as
well. Was kind of fine like, oh, maybe this was an elf. But when she saw the drawing, her tune kind of changed.
Certainly understandable. That's got to be shocking. So now let's let's move to the next case. This also involves a
firsthand witness who describes their story in quite some detail. I call this
one the alien in the barn. This occurred one evening in October 1999
in the very small town of Roy, Washington. though it is near a military
base which could be significant but it's a fascinating case because there are
many cases of ETSs and UFOs showing an interest in farms and certainly in
animals and that is a pattern we do see in this case. The witness in this case was about eight or nine years old when
he had his encounter with what appears to be a gray alien. He is anonymous so
I'll call him Kyle. At the time he lived on a dairy farm in the small rural town
of Roy, Washington. This is located about 8 milesi south of Fort Lewis Army
Base. Now, growing up around cows and calves had given Kyle a great love for
the animals. And in fact, it was his love for the cows that one evening in
October 1999 directly led to one of the most unusual experiences of his life. And I'll just
quote Kyle directly. As Kyle says, "One night I heard some of the calves crying.
I got up and left my house very quietly. I was not trying to get in trouble with
my parents. The dairy farm was about 500 ft from my home. The time was about 2:00
a.m. Everyone was asleep. I arrived at the calves first. I fed them some grain.
Next, I went to check on the cows. As I arrived, I didn't see anything unusual,
just that some of them looked impatient. They would pace back and forth in a small space. Nearly all the cows knew
me, so getting close was no problem. I then started to feed them the grains as
well, but they really didn't have any interest in the food. Their eyes were wide open like they were terrified and
scared. The more I noticed them pacing back and forth, and the more I noticed them cramming to one side of the
building, I kind of started to feel scared myself. I saw they were all
avoiding the other side of the building. So, it was clear to Kyle that something
must be on the other side of the building that was scaring the cows. So, he cautiously took a few steps forward
in that direction. He speculated that perhaps one of the cows had died and that's what was spooking them. But when
he checked, there was no dead cow. In fact, there was something much stranger,
as Kyle says. Then a weird feeling of being watched came upon me. I stopped
looking at the beds of the cows and looked at the end of the hall. At first glance, I thought I was seeing a tree.
Then I realized there were no trees at the end of the hall. I saw only half of
a 4ft tall gray greenish black alien. The head was definitely bigger than the
body. The eyes were almond shaped and slanted. And it had been looking or analyzing me. My feet said run, but I
couldn't run. I felt like I was moving in slow motion. I couldn't yell or talk
in a very slow way. That thing was hiding away from me behind the wall.
Finally, it was a blessing to run, and I ran home very scared. So Kyle explains
that this figure was about 250 ft away from him, hiding behind a wall, so he
could only see the upper half of it. He but he did see that it had a slender body and reaching the house, Kyle
realized he was facing another dilemma. As Kyle says, "As soon as I opened the
door, I knew I had to be very quiet or else my parents were going to get the belt out. They were very strict. I
tippytoed back inside my room with my siblings and I never told anyone about
that night until now. I get constant thoughts about that night more and more
now. It's another good example of a case that has a profound impact on the witness. He's still thinking about it as
he says in his testimony, which is no surprise. That has got to be an incredibly shocking experience. I do
wonder what the ETs were doing or the ET was doing there in that barn. Perhaps
checking out the cows. Hard to say, but an absolutely fascinating case of a
close-up face-to-face encounter with what appears to be a gray extraterrestrial.
Now, let's move to the next case in this compilation. This one is probably the most complicated and in some ways the
most interesting. It's not just one event. This involves a series of sightings and humanoid encounters. I
call this one It made our jaws drop. The main case occurred on December 16, 2003
in this very small town of Kashi, Argentina. What makes this case so interesting is
there's apparently something about this town that is very attractive to UFOs.
This case does involve photographic evidence as well and an enormous number
of witnesses who have had activity over a pretty long period of time and of
course some very fascinating humanoid encounters. There is definitely
something strange happening in the small town of Kachi. It is located at about 2500 m above sea level. That's about
8,300 ft in Salta Argentina. and it has become very well known for its UFO
encounters, including a few astonishing cases involving humanoids. Interest in
the area really ramped up in the year 2000 when over the next few years, a
mountaineer by the name of Antonio Zueta saw and actually filmed unusual lights
in the area, which he said moved swiftly and strangely, and he actually saw them
plunge into the ground at times. He had been alerted to the activity by an art
instructor, Maria Delvier Plaza, who saw a UFO over Kachi, which she said gave
off lights of different colors and move slowly without making a sound. I never
thought I'd witness anything like it. Despite having been born here, I came back here after many years to have the
privilege of seeing these fantastic and mysterious lights, of which I've heard so many stories since childhood. So, it
wasn't long before Antonio Zueta began having sightings himself and taking these photographs. And these photos, as
you can see, were striking enough to capture the attention of scientists. And in May 2003,
researchers Omar Hess and Jorge Milstein claimed to have detected unusual and
quote unnatural electromagnetic signals coming from the area. They believed these anomalous
readings are significant because as Jorge Milstein says, this is one of the
hottest areas of the planet regarding extraterrestrial activity. And these
UFOs just kept appearing. One evening in July 2003,
two tourists were stargazing when they noticed two lights appear over the mountain just outside of this town.
These objects were sending down beams of light, blue, red, and white. And then
moments later, about 200 feet away from them, these witnesses saw two tall
humanoid figures who were wearing tight-fitting luminous outfits and walking in the direction of this
mountain. Becoming afraid, the witnesses quickly left the area. But the event
that really captured people's attention was a multiple witness encounter on the night of December 16, 2003 along the
famous Tintin road leading into the town. There was a group of eight people
traveling by bus. These include Bonito Salva and his father Ricardo, Julio
Rafael Espinosa and his daughter Tamara and four other men. Suddenly, the driver
of the bus, Bonito Salva, stopped the bus and shouted out, "Hey guys, look
over there." At this point, the passengers all could clearly see a strange glowing object off in the
distance. Now, farmer Julio Espinosa climbed on top of the bus to get a better view of this and was immediately
convinced that he was looking at something very unusual. As he says, "It
was incredible. We could see an object with impressive lights side by side
spinning in a circle at high speed. Then other lights appeared which came and went over the same spot. It made our
jaws drop. So this prompted him to hop off the bus and venture off the road and
approach the source of the light which he did so alone. The other people remained behind and he saw something
amazing. As Julio says, upon reaching a bramble, in spite of the darkness, the
landscape was very well defined. I couldn't go any further. I was moving away from the road, and I was getting
scared when my eyes started to see something that couldn't be made out clearly at a distance. There was a
device measuring some 100 m wide, resting over some kind of struts or
legs, which kept it some 10 to 12 m off the ground. Some sort of hoses emerged
from its middle with lights on their tips. Suddenly, the lights on the object went out, and these strange beings
appeared. They walked slowly in single file. They were thin, and their glow was
so powerful they blinded me. At that moment, I hid behind a bramble, and I
could see when one of them jumped onto a bramble. I don't know how he did it, and he began to pull pieces off of it as
though taking specimens. So Julio watched this for about 20 minutes and realized he had been there a pretty long
time. He decided it was time to return to the truck and tell the others what was going on. And as Julio says, when I
told them what I'd seen, they told me that they couldn't see the creatures because they were very far away.
However, they saw the luminous phenomenon which was visible from the roadside. So that's the end of that
experience, but certainly is not the end of the activity in this area. It was just a few months later on April 27,
2004 that Julio and his two sons and their neighbors were outside of Kachi on
the National Highway 40 when another UFO appeared. As Julio says, suddenly a
luminous object appeared out of the slopes of the Nevada Dachi flying at low
altitude and zigzagging. It was an intense light that suddenly began moving
and stopped above us. I thought it would whisk us away. It lasted only an
instant. It was motionless in the air some 50 m above us, and its white light
would become yellowish. It had no shape, was like an enormous refgent mass. The
entire event lasted some 3 minutes from the moment it appeared, stood over us, and vanished. Many more locals have
witnessed this phenomena. And he's not exaggerating because it was at 7:30 p.m.
on July 10, 2004. Hundreds of people in the town saw a UFO
appeared directly over the town square. As one of the witnesses said, Javier
Rodriguez, it was a fantastic vision. A perfect disc of bright luminous intensity,
moving as it issued forth red flashes at prodigious speed, changing directions in
a startling manner, gyating at impossible angles for any vehicle known
to us. It was perfectly plate shaped. I cannot say obviously that it was a
spacecraft from another world or from our own, but I can tell you that it was a phenomenon as inexplicable as it was
interesting. That was just three hours later on that same night at 10:30 p.m.
Susanna Erdin who was the coordinator of the virtual distance learning system of
the Ministry of Education and Federico and Dulfi who was a surgeon from Valisto
Hospital and another woman Maria Magua were driving on their way to Kachi when
they had a sighting of something undeniably strange. And I'll just quote Susanna as she says, "I had always heard
and read stories and accounts of UFOs seen by the residents of Kachi, but I
never thought I'd have the good fortune to see something as beautiful as it was strange. It appeared all of a sudden and
got in front of the car, although at considerable distance. It was enormous
and flashed without making a sound. It had multicolored lights and gave the appearance of being circular with port
holes all around. The vision lasted for a few minutes, but enough for us to
realize that it wasn't a natural luminous phenomenon, but a device built by someone. It vanished at startling
speed and lost itself behind the eastern mountains. However, the object reappeared a few kilometers ahead when
we were driving along the Tintin segment. It glided along as though suspended beside us and vanished into
the firmament as it did before. After seeing that, I believe we have been
privileged to have seen what we saw. Any trace of incredul I may have had about
UFOs in Kachi has been dispelled. Now, many more sightings could be listed
in this area, including one on June 7, 2006, which really impressed the witnesses. One was Cesar Miguel Naranho
who said quote it's a wonderful sensation one is left dumbfounded by the
knowledge that what is being seen is not a product of the imagination or another witness Nancy who said the truth is that
it frightened me a lot. Now, perhaps the strangest story to come out of this area
is that of Wernern Jayley, a Swiss gentleman who says that on the night of November 24, 2008,
he saw two UFOs over the town along with a local resident by the name of Jorge
Reyes. At that exact time, the town had suffered three power failures. Now,
seeing these two craft, Wernern actually called out to them, "Please come. Don't
go." And as Wernern says, the two objects landed right above us and they
descended with an impressive light show until they were 30 m above us. They
asked me to make a signal. So I started working. So Wernern explains that he
received this message to build a large stone formation on the ground in the shape of a star which he would call
quote the star of hope. And he worked on this for the next few years with the help of other people, gathering
thousands of stones from the area and built this stone monument that you can see here, which many people are calling
a UFO landing pad. He built it in honor of the ETSs that he says communicated
with him. Warner would later claim to have more than 200 sightings and be in
constant telepathic contact with the ETSs. He said he received messages of
love and peace and as he says they are superior. They are capable of performing
miracles. So even today the Kachi starport remains a testament to Warner's encounter and of
course all the UFO activity that has made this town world famous in UFO history. The name Kachi, by the way, in
terms of a Spanish name is a proper name, means quote, "He demands peace." I
ever go to Argentina, I think that would be one of the places I would like to visit cuz I'm curious about it. With so
many people in this area seeing UFOs, there's got to be something going on here. And yet, if you look at this town,
there's nothing really in the area that would be immediately apparent to attract
the interest of extraterrestrials. There is a lot of activity all over the world. Perhaps this is more of a social
phenomena where one person reports an encounter and this encourages others to report their encounter. And this would
account for, you know, the existence of UFO hotspots to some degree. I think if
that were actually true, we would have far more hotspots around the world. So I
suspect there is something about this area that is drawing the interests of what appear to be extraterrestrials. I
think that is the explanation which best fits the eyewitness testimonies and the
evidence and the facts surrounding this whole UFO phenomenon.
All right, let's move to the last and final case. This one is really profound.
This one really I think has quite some interesting elements to it. I call this
one I fully believe in aliens. This occurred late one evening in October 28,
2010 in Mount Roy, Pennsylvania. And this is technically a single witness
case, although it does involve two people. And this one is just so
interesting to me. It's funny. There are a lot of people out there who are profoundly skeptical of this subject.
But then people have an encounter and that of course changes their minds. They don't have the luxury of skepticism or
disbelief because they've had this experience firsthand. And that's clearly what happened in this case which had a
profound effect on the witness and changed the way they view the world forever. This is an amazing case. The
main witness in this case is Christina. That is a pseudonym. She's a young woman who had an experience that left her very
concerned. In fact, it shook her up so badly that she asked her boyfriend, who
I'll call Ethan, that's also a pseudonym. She asked him to help report her encounter.
And I'll just quote Ethan as he says, "I am writing this report from my girlfriend as she is nervous and wanting
to tell this story. My girlfriend recounts this as a quote dream, but the way she tells it and remembers it so
vividly scares me. And I believe this could have actually happened. She has never had any odd experiences in her
life. So for her to have this quote dream seems really strange. So this
incident occurred around 200 a.m. on October 28th, 2010. At the time, Ethan
and Christina were living with her mom and stepdad in a duplex in the woods outside of Mount Troy, Pennsylvania.
Her parents were in the room next to them. Ethan takes Christina's story very
seriously because unlike his girlfriend, he in fact has had quite a few unusual
experiences in his life, including seeing UFOs. As Ethan says, "I have seen
my share of strange things in the sky, and I fully believe in aliens and all of that. I convinced her to let me tell
this event as it may have actually happened." So, Ethan transcribed
Christina's testimony verbatim as she shares what she recalls happening to
her. And as she says, "Entities came in the house and abducted my boyfriend."
So, what follows is Christina's firsthand testimony. As Christina says,
I remember it being very early in the morning. I woke up to five or six beings
in the room. There was a little one standing in front of my closet, two tall ones, one standing on each side of the
little one, one to the left by the base of the bed, and one or two standing off
to the right of our bed. The little one was staring at me, not making any sounds
or gestures. But by the way he was, I guess that he may have been their leader. As he was looking at me, the
tall one started moving around the room. At this point, I tried to get up and
couldn't move any portion of my body. I couldn't scream or do anything. One of
the tall ones came over and got behind my head and peered over me, looking down at me. Then he walked away. Then he and
one or two of the other tall ones went over to where my boyfriend was sleeping. At this point, a bright shining light
came through the window and was shining on the floor of the room, lighting up the entire room. As it got brighter, the
little one and two of the tall ones moved towards the window and the light, and I couldn't see them anymore. I lost
sight of them. So, at the time all of this was going on, Ethan and Christina were sleeping on an air mattress and
they were only about 1 foot off the floor. So, this afforded her a good view of everything that was happening. Now,
Christina continues her account. As Christina says, "The rest of the remaining beings all converged on the
light and the window. As they were getting close to the window, my boyfriend's body started to levitate,
lifting into the air. At this time, I'm not worrying about the beings as I'm
focusing on my boyfriend elevating into the air. I regained the ability to move
and I started screaming and crying. I jumped onto my boyfriend's body. I remember the impact of me landing on
him, lowering him out of the air a little bit, but he continued to rise. I
was still screaming, and I lost sight of the rest of the beings. It got super bright and that's all I remember of the
event until I woke up the next morning unusually late next to my boyfriend. I
remember waking up sweating and feeling very frightened. I felt like I woke up later than I usually did and I was very
groggy. My boyfriend also felt like he had slept for way longer than he did and
felt like we had both lost time. He had no memory of this as he stayed asleep the whole time during the event.
So, that's the end of Christina's testimony. And in fact, when they woke up, it was already noon. While she did
wonder if this was possibly a dream, she makes it clear that she believes it also may have actually happened in real life.
And of course, her boyfriend Ethan feels the same way. As Ethan says, she told me
about this quote dream, and that's when I told her about my experiences with seeing things in the sky. What scares me
is that she can describe this story with amazing detail and vividly remembers
their faces and everything. So, it was about 2 and 1/2 years after this occurred that they decided it was
important to report their experience officially. There's some really interesting elements to that story. The
fact that this lady saw so many ETs in her room, that's pretty unusual. It's,
you know, people will see two, even three, but double that. That's interesting to me. Also interesting is
that usually there are not outside witnesses to someone being taken, but it
looks like she woke up and saw her boyfriend being taken. Whether this was a successful quote abduction or not is
hard to say, cuz she blacked out. So, I suspect probably he was taken. And given
that he does report other close encounters, that's certainly a red flag.
It's one thing to see a UFO once, but if it's twice or three times and then something like this happens, well, it's
very likely that he is a contactee. But such an interesting case and their
testimony is so obviously sincere, it impacted them enough that they decided
that this was important to report officially. And kudos to them for doing
so because again most people don't. So that's it for today. 10 cases coming
from all over the world from 1946 all the way to 2010. That shows that this
has been going on a long time. Honestly, I think it goes back to prehistory, but
it just taken humanity a long time to really realize what's going on and
certainly has escalated profoundly since the modern age of UFOs in 1940s,
which I think coincides with the atomic age and when we reached the point of being able to completely destroy our
planet. This is when onboard encounters escalated dramatically and people
started getting these messages from ETSs warning about nuclear proliferation and
pollution and the destruction of the environment and war and aggression and basically just being on the pathway
towards self-destruction. So these cases, yeah, have so much to teach us. What an opportunity it is that
these cases have to provide us with knowledge beyond our wildest dreams.
We're clearly not the only intelligent beings in this universe. We are one of
many. So I think that alone makes this subject of profound importance. It's why
I do this research and because I know so many people out there are having these experiences. I'm sure a lot of you
watching have had exactly these kinds of experiences. So that's it for today. I really want to
thank you once again for tuning in. I hope you've enjoyed this episode, perhaps learned a few things. And uh
until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth.
Most important of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next week with
another exciting episode of UFOs and the Paranormal.
