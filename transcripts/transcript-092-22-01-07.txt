WHAT LISA REMEMBERS
Jan 7, 2022

Summary:
Jan 7, 2022
This is the true story of "Lisa," a daycare worker from northern California who has had lifelong 
contacts with extraterrestrials. Lisa is not her real name. Although she did go public with her 
encounters, she now prefers to remain private. Lisa's encounters began in 1972, around age 5, 
when she was approached by a tall praying mantis alien while in her backyard. Next thing she 
knew, an hour had passed, and she was being returned to her home. Following this, her encounters 
occurred regularly, almost always involving praying mantis-type ETs.

Her next major encounter occurred at age 14, while scuba diving on Catalina Island in southern 
California. She was abducted into a UFO and underwent what appears to be the extraction of a 
hybrid-baby fetus from her womb. It was a terrifying experience and left her both physically 
sore and emotionally shaken.

Then, one evening in November of 1992, Lisa was driving with a friend along the 101 Ventura 
Freeway outside of Los Angeles, California when a UFO swooped down and began to pace their 
car. Without warning, it sent down a beam of light, striking their vehicle. Time seemed to 
stop as the two women were pulled from the car, up the beam of light and into the craft. So 
began one of the most extensive encounters of Lisa's life.

Onboard, Lisa and her friend were separated. Lisa saw her friend being shown star maps, while 
Lisa herself was taken to another room, undressed and given a physical examination. The ETs 
told her not to be afraid, that she was a part of their project, and they had to do this. 

Following the exam, Lisa was shown what appears to be the engine room or the power source of 
the craft. She was then given a long and very personal message containing details of her 
private life, and she was told several prophecies and predictions which the ETs told her 
would later occur. And as the ETs predicted, these events did in fact happen. Finally, the 
two women were reunited on the craft and sent back to their car via a levitating beam of light.

More encounters would soon occur. Two years later, in 1994, Lisa became a participant in a 
mass UFO abduction event on Coronado Island in California. Up to a dozen people experienced 
a visitation on the same night. It would be the first time Lisa encountered gray aliens.

Lisa's encounters are too numerous to count. She's been taken onboard many times. Often she 
is handed hybrid babies, half-human, half-alien and told to love and nurture them while the 
aliens observe. 

Lisa's case involves physical evidence of various kinds. She has had numerous unexplained 
nosebleeds, strange marks on her body, a possible implant and more. While many details of 
her encounters were recalled under hypnosis, Lisa is one of a small portion of contactees 
who are able to remember their experiences without hypnosis. Her story is one of great 
personal struggle and triumph. It's a story that has much to reveal about what it's like 
to have ET contact, and the ET agenda on our planet.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
I call this episode what lisa remembers and lisa remembers a lot she's had a UFO encounter 
since she was four years old onwards through adulthood up to the current day 
and her experiences have been quite traumatic for her they're very extensive she's been taken on board a UFO a craft many times she usually sees praying mantis type ETs 
uh her case I think has a lot to say about why the ETs are here and their agenda on our planet and 
that's why I wanted to present her case for you today so let's just get started lisa was born in 
1957 on a military base in northern california and at age five in 1962 she had an encounter while in 
the backyard of her family home and i'll just let lisa describe what happened in her own words as 
Lisas Story
lisa says I was picking snails off of my mother's rose bushes and putting them in a coffee can 
I look up and there's this huge bug looking thing watching me it frightened me so bad that I 
fell back it was standing in front of me I could see the feet as I was picking up 
snails and then I looked up I dropped the can as I fell back the snails came out of the can 
and I don't remember anything else after that that's all I remember it was very shocking the 
only thing I remember after that is coming back I was walking on the ground but I had this thing 
by the hand and he was taking me home he looked like a big giant bug it was not gray more like 
a green muddy color almost the color of a swamp it looked like it had very thin skin kind of an 
angular square head more of a rounded chin and a very sectional body really long legs you could see 
knees and elbows the eyes weren't black they were dark dark brown I don't remember any conversations 
other than when he walked me back I remember him saying i'll see you later and at that point I 
wasn't so much afraid anymore until later in my teens then I started rebelling more
so that was lisa's first encounter it didn't scare her but she started having more encounters more missing time she started suffering from a lot 
of unexplained nosebleeds her next really major encounter occurred when she was 14 years old 
this was in 1971 on the far side of catalina island in southern california 
lisa had gone scuba diving and this is when something very strange happened 
and I will just let lisa describe in her own words how this happened as lisa says 
I remember going into the water swimming around and all of a sudden it felt like I wasn't getting 
any air and I came back up and there was this huge ship it was mirroring the ocean and the sky it 
was just huge it seemed to reflect the ocean and yet reflect the sky it wasn't so much silver as 
it seemed to reflect everything it was very very low you could not miss it it was huge it was oval 
it wasn't perfectly round and it didn't seem to cast a shadow and I remember thinking how weird 
I looked down the shoreline and I saw beings walking towards me they looked human 
but they weren't I knew they weren't human but they didn't look alien they were saying my name 
but they weren't saying lisa they were calling me and I knew it was my name they were saying ura I 
don't know what that means I remember thinking god they look so weird and the next thing I remember 
consciously was panicking on the beach it's late my mom was going to kill me because it was late 
I just freaked I remember hiking back over checking to see if I had everything making it back 
just in time to return the scuba equipment before they closed and then going back down to the pier 
and waiting at my dad so he'd see me following this experience lisa noticed a few other things 
Missing Ring
her body felt quite sore she was also missing her ring which really upset her 
interestingly years later this ring would appear on her dresser when she was an adult 
so the ETs apparently took it and gave it back to her but she did have physiological effects in 
the form of a real soreness on her body and years later after many more experiences she decided to 
go under hypnotic regression with yvonne smith a very well respected UFO abduction researcher 
and under hypnotic regression lisa recalled what happened during the missing time and it was quite 
harrowing for her I did listen to the hypnosis tapes and she had a very difficult time with this 
experience she was quite scared and i'll just let her describe in her own words what happened 
she had seen these people on the beach calling her name and they started to approach her calling her ura and as lisa says I remember her saying come on I have to take you somewhere and walking 
down the shore a little bit it seemed like the ship was moving and I kept glancing over 
at it was almost pacing us and then I was just going up in the air into a light with her 
and then all of a sudden I was laying down and feeling appalling like a horrible tug almost 
like a vacuum sensation inside of me it was like they were ripping me out from the inside and not 
being able to make them stop and not being able to have any control over it and I heard them just 
keep saying you're going to be fine we need to take this baby we're sorry for doing this to you 
that's the only time I can ever remember hearing them telling me that they were sorry I don't know 
if it's because they thought I was a child or what or maybe they thought that it was painful for me 
they seemed very sincere and I remember seeing a tiny it was some kind of blob or something but I 
was able to see some kind of shape inside the blob and then the experience was gone the pain was gone 
at that point I could feel tears on my face and I remember them saying they were thanking me 
again and then I remember being back on the shore and being panicked because it was too late 
a few other things that lisa recalled was that before this experience before they took her on 
board the ET's told her you have something that belongs to us and she didn't understand what they 
meant until they apparently took her fetus that's what she believes happened she also recalled that 
during this whole procedure the ET's seemed somewhat confused by her wetsuit which is 
odd because after going under hypnotic regression she remembers another experience of missing time 
around age 10 four years earlier when she was on the beach with her friend 
and she was taken on board and the ETs were there and they showed her scuba diving equipment 
and told her that you need to learn how to use this and they actually demonstrated it for her 
so apparently they were preparing her for this abduction incident four years later and you 
would think they would know what a wetsuit is but this was lisa's impression so that was her second 
Major Encounter
really major encounter at age 14. she continued to have more missing time as she grew to an adult 
she became a daycare worker and her really major major encounter occurred in november of 1990
she had just gone with a friend to a mufon meeting a mutual UFO network meeting and she wasn't at all 
interested in UFOs she didn't want to hear anyone speak about being abducted or anything like that 
this was the first time she'd ever attended any meeting like this and the only reason she was going because she wanted to see some official nasa footage of UFOs 
so at any rate she went to this meeting which was located in thousand oaks california 
on the west end of the san fernando valley or thereabouts and uh following this experience 
following this meeting which ended at 9 30 she drove back home with her friend 
uh her friend was driving i'll call her friend loretta that's the pseudonym actually that yvonne smith chose for the other person who was involved in this experience 
and lisa sat in the passenger seat and they had no sooner got on to the 
ventura freeway the 101 freeway going north and suddenly they noticed this star-like object 
in the sky it was really quite bright and getting closer and brighter and very quickly 
it dropped out of the sky and hovered directly over their car shining down a beam of light 
at this point they noticed all time seemed to stop all the cars on the freeway seemed to disappear 
and they this object just kept getting closer and closer and I will let lisa describe this 
incident in her own words as she says the light was directly in front of us the entire car was lit 
up I looked behind out the back window and you could see car lights on the grade no cars were 
moving the lights were frozen I turned back around there appeared to be what was like a bridge when I 
turned back around to look out the front window loretta's hands were on the steering wheel in 
a ten to two position and she was looking out the window crouching and looking out 
and when I looked out the window there appeared to be a bridge but it was not a normal looking bridge 
the bridge legs in this instance would have been almost in the car lane and I know there was no bridge there because i've lived there I knew exactly what was going on and I just 
couldn't believe it the next thing I remember I remember floating into this light and a thousand 
thoughts running through my mind then the next thing I remember after that was being in the car 
we're back in the car and not saying a word and susan and I are both chatterboxes
so they weren't speaking they were somewhat in shock they started to drive home they decided they 
were going to stop at a store to pick up something to eat and they were both surprised to find the 
parking lot completely empty and when they got in the store they had a huge shock because it was now 
approaching midnight they had left at around 9 30. so they were missing at least two hours of time 
so following this incident both these women felt quite traumatized well i'll just let lisa 
describe in her own words how she felt as she says I was in in my pajamas for five months I was very 
traumatized nobody knew what was wrong with me this UFO experience hadn't happened for many years 
i was aware of it I have a real hard time getting rid of this stuff for some strange reason i'm able to remember it i'm able to remember a great deal of it
so lisa was very traumatized and when she spoke to her friend her friend also reported 
having nightmares and anxiety about driving she ended up going to the doctor over it and the 
doctor diagnosed her with ptsd post-traumatic stress disorder also following this experience 
lisa's friend became obsessed with astronomy and bought all this sort of 
wallpaper that was covered with stars so this was very confusing for both of them 
and eventually they sought hypnosis it was this incident actually that prompted lisa to undergo 
hypnotic regression for the first time and under hypnosis lisa did recall being taken on board 
loretta also went under hypnosis but was not able to record any of the on-board segment the 
only thing loretta recalled was the car stopping being hit by this beam of light seeing this light 
and exiting the car and standing on the freeway and one of these bug-like beings standing next to 
her other than that she couldn't remember anything but lisa however remembered a very long extensive 
Onboard UFO Experience
and involved onboard UFO experience and i'll just let her describe this experience in her own words 
as lisa says and I quote I remember rolling up the windows locking the doors 
panicking were both screaming then I see the beings come on into the car and try to pull us out 
the next thing I remember is being pulled through the glass they were bug looking things about five 
feet tall four and a half feet there were two or three on each side of the car 
i'm hanging onto her hand my left hand and her right hand and there's no way you can fight this 
i was out the window first and I remember seeing her door actually opened and I remember seeing 
her being taken by them and i'm thinking oh my god what are they going to do to her 
i remember going up into the bright light going inside it seemed as if the room was expandable 
everything was I don't want to say sterile but it was very smooth it wasn't bright colored 
there were no bright lights or anything and I was being escorted separated from loretta 
the most vivid memory I have is looking over what I call a balcony on a balcony looking 
down at loretta and they were showing her stuff on what looked like black glass 
and it looked like galaxies I remember stopping on purpose and looking down over what I would 
guess would be the first floor and seeing loretta they were just showing her what 
looked like maps of galaxies on black glass it was wrapped around where she was sitting
at this point lisa was taken to a separate room she was lay down not on a table she thought she 
was just being suspended in mid-air she's not sure but there was a bunch of these little praying 
mantis type beings dozens of them they were all quite short except for there was one that was 
very tall over six feet and with a huge head and huge dark eyes and they began to physically 
examine her lisa found this very very frightening and she tried to scream but was not able to 
uh scream out audibly she could only scream inside her head and they placed this sort of helmet-like 
device metal on her head stuck a metallic instrument in her mouth which made her gag 
she said at one point she did feel quite a bit of pain the whole experience was very painful 
for her and not at all pleasant and finally the examination was finished and uh as lisa says in 
her own words they talked very little except to say this is a normal thing we've done this before 
and that they were just back they never apologize they never say this will take only a minute none 
of that they're just very direct they don't care they just basically say we're here to find out 
how you are doing and that's it and to remind me of who I was who I am they continued on with their 
inspection or whatever they told her she was a part of this and she was part of their project 
The Engine Room
lisa didn't quite understand that and that after the examination they handed her her clothes 
and started to help her get dressed she just took the clothes herself and got dressed on her own 
and then they began to escort her back through the ship at one point 
they took her to what appears to be the engine room because she saw something very strange as 
lisa says and I quote I remember seeing something that looked like it glowed 
and it seemed like it was some sort of power source I don't know if it was rocks inside it was 
kind of a yellow green in color but it seems to be some sort of energy in itself 
following that one of the ET's stood in front of her and began to speak with her telepathically 
giving her messages prophecies or predictions about what would happen in her future 
these were very personal too lisa she did not want to go into any detail about 
them other than to say that they were about her personal life her relationships and I will just 
quote lisa in her own words as lisa says they're really big on screen shows they told 
me something that was very personal and private and i've never told anyone and they said this 
is going to happen and as a result of that this will happen and this is when it's going to happen 
well if that was so there would be no way I could make this certain event happen there was just no 
way and dabbed if it didn't happen it happened in the same month they said it would happen 
and when it happened I got the coldest chill all over my body it was a collapsing thing a 
very emotional release like my god it's a train wreck and now I have to deal with it 
was an extremely personal thing and there was no way I could control the outcome there was no way 
i could have set these events up to happen because i'm a really big one for proof you know show me so 
that's what they would do they're really big on screen shows and they would show me there it is 
that's what's going to happen and this is when it's going to happen 
Reunited
so following that they reunited lisa with loretta had them stand 
side by side and suddenly the next thing they know they're flying out through the bottom of the craft 
and being put back in their car as lisa says and I quote so then I was being escorted out 
i see loretta and she appears to be fine she doesn't appear to be upset or anything 
she looked like she was completely fine and they were just watching her and then I remember going 
back down into the light holding her hand I don't really remember getting into the car
so that was probably loretta's most vivid and extensive encounter of her life but it 
certainly wasn't the last one it was just two years later her lisa rather 
it was just two years later when lisa was involved in another major UFO encounter on coronado island 
coronado island is located just south of san diego along the mexican u.s border and 
lisa had gone to coronado island for the triad UFO conference which was being held there in march 
of 1994. she didn't want to go um she told her friends every time I go and every time I travel 
something happens I have a UFO encounter I don't want to go but they convinced her and sure enough 
UFO Encounter
lisa was right she did have a UFO encounter I did cover this event in my other video episode called 
the coronado UFO island incident which covers all the people who are involved in this apparent mass 
abduction but lisa uh had an experience on this night in which her roommate was taken on board 
and i'd just like to describe what lisa experienced briefly when she was staying at 
a hotel called the village inn and as lisa says I can see this bright light in the window I had 
a bed next to the window and nancy had a bed by the closet i'm trying not to see this bright light 
coming in through the curtains and the next thing I know I start saying oh come on not now not now 
and I get up because nancy is whining in her sleep like she's dreaming and she's panicking I go to 
nancy I hide her next to the closet on her side of the bed and i'm like on top of her and i'm telling 
her to be quiet just be quiet and they won't see you and I see these small grays come in i've never 
seen them before they smell really bad they smell like I want to say sulfur or rotten eggs they're 
coming through this window they were small gray beings really small they're maybe three feet high 
very limby spindly looking their arms and legs were really stick like their torso 
is quite big their heads are large they had huge almond-shaped eyes I couldn't really see a nose or 
mouth but their chins were really pointed they avoided me like the plague would not come near me 
they physically moved me back into my bed they raised their arms their hands and move me that way 
without touching me I remember moving my head looking over at nancy and she was just nuts going 
nuts at this time you could see her face panic stricken and she's not whining anymore she was 
quiet but the expression on her face was the same she just couldn't get it out and the next thing I 
remember is lying in bed thinking oh my god what if they don't bring her back and then I hear this 
terrible scream coming from mike's room and his wife's room next door it was a man screaming it 
was just this horrific scream and I start crying nancy is still gone I fall back asleep and the 
next thing I know that I can physically remember is nancy is in bed and the sun is coming up 
and nancy is struggling to get out of bed but she can't because very strangely 
her bed quilt had been rolled up like a tootsie roll and tucked into the mattress around her neck 
almost pinning her into the bed and she had to struggle to get free nancy felt quite fluish and 
she turns to lisa and said what happened well lisa remembered everything but she was so upset by it 
she didn't want to talk and she just said nothing so this was lisa's participation in the mass UFO abduction on a coronado island in march of 1994 
and it turned out many many people had an experience on that night so 
Hybrid Babies
there's quite a bit more to that but i'm just focusing on lisa's encounter in this 
episode so we'll move on um and following that lisa continued to have encounters and uh 
often she would be taken on board and the primary purpose usually seem to be for her to hold babies 
she loves babies and time after time she'd find herself being taken on board and being told to 
hold these sort of half human half e.t hybrid babies this was difficult for her because part 
of her felt quite repulsed by the appearance of these little children on the other hand 
her maternal instincts would always kick in and she would love these babies 
and just hold them and i'll let her describe what this is like in her own words as lisa says 
that's my job basically for them is to babysit their kids and I don't understand it makes me 
so angry what is it that they don't understand about emotion when they see me hold a hybrid 
it's like they study you and I would get so angry that they didn't know how to do that but for some 
reason they feel that these hybrids need it and that's the only contact you get with them is when 
they're really young something I believe that is human in all of us has empathy for any baby 
the babies looked like hybrids they did but they really looked more human than bug-like 
i was really surprised their limbs were still really long and lanky and they didn't respond 
like a human I don't know if it's because they weren't getting emotional bonding from a human
so besides being told to hold these babies she was also periodically physically examined 
Physical Examination
and while she was very cooperative early on sometimes she would just fight and protest 
and on a few of these occasions after protesting she would wake up and find bruises and scratches 
on her body so this has been quite difficult for lisa following one encounter
uh she did wake up with pretty severe scratches uh so she's fighting them as lisa says 
it's gotten to the point now where I fight I used to fight in the beginning and then I didn't fight 
and now i'm back to fighting and I come back bruised and just a mess because I fight and I 
remember telling them things like okay i'm getting tired of this game change the tape 
and they almost think that humor is not funny they don't understand it but at the same time they're interested in it but they can't or don't seem to grasp it like what 
does she mean change the tape you know what I mean so that part gives me some rebellion like haha 
i have humor and you don't lisa has had some very strong physiological effects as the result 
Physical Effects
of her encounters as I mentioned earlier she did have nosebleeds throughout her childhood 
that were quite severe and unexplained and does wake up with strange marks on her body once after 
she was taken three days following the experience she had to be hospitalized for anaphylactic shock 
and the doctors could not diagnose what was wrong with her but they did notice this weird triangular mark on her hand this is a small triangle on lacy's
this is a small triangle on lisa's hand and uh it's always been there it's been 
there since she was a little girl sometimes it gets sore and inflamed it's never painful 
but it's quite obvious and the doctor after examining her saw this triangle mark on her 
hand lisa tried to hide it but the doctor quickly grabbed her hand and examined it closely through a 
magnifying glass and a light and he says you know this thing is actually fluorescing what is it and 
lisa played dumb as if she didn't know what it was or where it came from but she believes that it is 
a genetic tag this is what the ET's have actually told her that this is their mark and that 
she also believes it may be connected to an implant another thing is following the 1992 
Hearing
experience on the ventura freeway lisa started to suffer from pretty severe ear pain and in 
fact she went to the doctor for it and they weren't able to find anything wrong but one 
thing she did find out that's quite interesting happened when she decided to take a hearing test 
and it turned out that her hearing was off the charts she had really really good hearing 
in fact her hearing was equal to that of dogs so she could hear very very high pitched tones 
so while lisa's experiences she interprets them as being somewhat negative she does not want 
them she's fine found them quite fearful she also admits that she has gotten some positive effects 
from them she knows that it's a much wider universe out there that ETs do exist 
and i'll just let her describe in her own words how these encounters have transformed her 
as she says i've taken some weird paths because of this one of my hobbies is astrophysics 
as nutty as I am and i'm not wrapped too tight and I don't understand a lot but one of my hobbies is 
astrophysics why that is I don't know other than maybe i'm trying to explain it myself 
i've learned morse code everyone thought I was nuts of course I have no idea why i'm 
learning morse code but I need to do it I did that in 1989 then I had a radio show 
it's almost as if I think if I can live through that I can do anything I want almost like a 
rebellion you can't make me hide i'm not going to stop I think it really has made me stronger you 
really have no choice you either lose your mind or you learn to deal with it you develop a drawer in 
your mind that you can put this stuff in and close it I know when you tell people things like this 
when it doesn't happen to you they're gonna look at you with that look their heads are 
going to drop to the left and they're going to smile it is so bizarre to live like this 
uh despite how difficult her experiences have been lisa maintains a very positive outlook she has a 
very strong sense of humor she's really a quite funny person quite lively very outgoing and if she 
has anything to say she wants to leave people with this message and I quote 
in closing I would like to say that my life is not only a wonderful and desired place of exploration 
it is filled with color and light that can and will demand my full attention 
to miss one day is to not only cheat yourself but to cheat someone else out of their exploration 
you see for every one person you meet you will affect seven others 
it is the chain of life our connection our genetic structure
so that is lisa's story that is what lisa remembers it's quite an extensive story 
Conclusion
of UFO contact I did cover it in my book the coronado island UFO incident it covers all her 
her experiences from childhood onward and I will say that yvonne smith did also write 
about lisa's experiences in her book chosen and also in her book the coronado experience 
so I think that lisa's story is important to be known because it does reveal a lot about the ETs 
and their agenda to produce hybrid babies shows how dramatically encounters can affect a person 
shows how encounters start at early childhood onward and it also shows how amazingly advanced 
these ETs are to be able to stop time pull someone off of a freeway this sort of thing 
it's a really amazing story and that's why I wanted to share it with you today I hope you've enjoyed 
it and perhaps learned something I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it 
until next time keep having fun.
