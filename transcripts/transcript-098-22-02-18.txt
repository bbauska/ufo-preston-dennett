A NINE-FOOT-TALL ET
Feb 18, 2022

Summary:
Feb 18, 2022
Born in 1960, Jill Wheeler (pseudonym) had her first UFO encounter when she was only five years old. A group of three-foot-tall figures dressed up like teddy bears entered her home and told her to follow them. A closer look revealed them to be typical grays. A short conversation ensued, at which point the ETs brought out a mysterious black box and set it up in the middle of her bedroom. A strange procedure followed, and after a little while, the grays left. That was Jill's first experience. But it wouldn't be her last.

Around age nine, the grays returned, and began to teach Jill secret lessons. Unfortunately, Jill couldn't remember what they taught her. The grays returned a few days later and shared more information with her. And over the next three years, they visited more than 100 times, always with the purpose of teaching Jill secret knowledge. The visits were always pleasant and fun, and Jill looked forward to them. In fact, the ETs showed her how to call them down using a special signal. Then, after three years, the encounters abruptly ended. And as the grays had warned her, she forgot about them completely.

A short time later, Jill and her best friend had a dramatic close-up sighting of a huge metallic craft. It was an encounter that would convince her that UFOs were real. 

After that, Jill's life returned to normal. She grew up, got married. She and her husband bought a home in a small town in Nebraska. She got pregnant with her first child, and shortly later had another kid. But it was shortly after she gave birth to her third child that weird experiences began to occur.

She had been diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child, and she had to have annual lung x-rays to monitor her condition. One year, Jill went to the doctor, and they discovered a strange unidentified object in her lungs. Doctors were unable to explain it.

More weirdness followed. Jill was changing her new baby's diaper when a tiny object fell out her nose. She instantly saw that this object wasn't natural. It was white and looked like a miniature spool. But what was it doing in her nose?

Following this event, Jill's health began to decline. She felt sick and dizzy, and rapidly lost weight. Her health slowly spiraled downward, and after three years, Jill was extremely weak, and was passing out multiple times daily. Doctors were unable to diagnose her condition. All they knew was that Jill was very sick.

Then, one evening in 1995, Jill was walking across her living room when suddenly she found herself inside what appeared to be a huge underground base. There was a domed ceiling, hundreds of small cubicles, and Jill was inside one of them lying on a cold, steel doctor's table. She was dazed and disoriented, and like other people who were there, was trying to figure out where she was. 

Suddenly, a strange nine-foot-tall humanoid entered her cubicle and said, "Okay, it's your turn now, Jill." Jill screamed in terror as the being began a mysterious medical procedure on her body.

During the procedure, Jill lost consciousness, and the next thing she knew, she was back in her home. Only now, her family would not wake up. It took her more than twenty minutes of shaking them before any of them would wake up.

Jill had no idea what had happened to her. But that evening, as she put her infant son to bed, he pointed at the moon and said, "Mommy! I went on a ship to the moon! Went on a ship to the moon!" 

Jill was shocked. Had her son been taken too? Even stranger, Jill noticed that although her body was very sore (a condition which persisted for two weeks,) she was feeling much better. In fact, the next day, she didn't lose consciousness at all. And as the days passed, she never passed out again, and she began to gain her weight back. Had the ETs healed her? And if so, why her? She was just a housewife from Nebraska.

Not long after that, Jill had another close-up sighting of a UFO that paced her car. And after that, she was taken again inside a UFO. This time she was shown a little baby who didn't quite look human. The ETs told her, "This is your baby."

Jill could ignore it no longer. She began doing research about her experiences and learned that she was a UFO contactee. But still she wondered, why her? And who was that nine-foot-tall alien? Had she really been taken to an underground base? Was that weird-looking baby truly hers? She still has many questions. And these are only some of the many strange encounters she had experienced.

This video presents the lifelong UFO encounters of Jill Wheeler, and is surely one of the strangest and most bizarre contact cases on record. To hear more about Jill's incredible encounters (and many others) check out the book, "INSIDE UFOS: TRUE ACCOUNTS OF CONTACT." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal 
i call this episode a 9 foot tall e.t this is the story of a woman I'll call jill wheeler 
that's not her real name she requested to be anonymous but she's had lifelong experiences with 
extraterrestrials different types and has a very unusual and interesting story to tell 
jill was born in 1960 in carbondale illinois and had her encounter her first encounter at age 
five in 1965 at this time her mother had actually covered the windows of their house with tin foil 
this is an important detail as we shall soon see so jill wakes up one evening she's going through a 
lot of growing pains at this time so she climbs out of her crib and goes into the living room 
looking for her dad so he can massage her legs unfortunately it's too late everyone's asleep 
and she sees something weird coming through the wall she quickly hides under the couch but 
it doesn't do any good because whoever or whatever is coming through the wall knows where she is and I'll just let jill describe what happened as she says this is going to sound 
really stupid but I looked across to the opposite wall and I saw this line of teddy bear looking 
things coming through the wall there were maybe five or six of them they literally 
looked like teddy bears anyway they knew where I was I remember hearing in my head come out 
so I came out and they put me in front of them and we marched down the hallway where I crawled back into my crib so back in her crib and her room filled with these figures 
jill stared at them and watched them as they transformed from teddy bears into what we now know 
are grey aliens as jill says they changed they no longer looked like teddy bears there was one 
who was maybe five feet tall and he looked like what I guess you would call a gray only taller 
he was skinny spindly had a big head big eyes the other ones were smaller than he was 
the tall grey walked over to jail and had a question for her as jill says 
he demanded to know why the aluminum foil was up on my window I told him it was because my 
mother put it up there to keep the heat out from the sun and he did not accept that explanation 
and he asked me again and I told him again and he still didn't accept it and he looked at me and he 
asked me again and I told him again and by then I was getting a little scared and a little irritated 
and finally the third or fourth time I told him he looked at me for a couple of seconds went uh-huh 
and then he turned around and went back to whatever they were doing in the middle of the room so jill looks to the middle of the room at this point and all the grays are there 
in the middle of her room setting up what looks like a pedestal with a black box on it 
and one of the greys walks up to her and tells her to go get some water which jill did she went to 
the bathroom got a little bathtub pail filled it with water and brought it to them and they asked 
her to do it again as jill says and I quote so I went to get some more water and this happened 
at least 10 times finally I was so tired of crawling in and out of bed going to get the water 
taking it back and giving it to him doing it over and over that the last time he asked me to do it I 
sat in the middle of my crib and I said no I'm not going to do it I'm tired and he looked at 
me with these eyes you could not believe it was just an intense kind of looking right through me 
i could feel that he was looking into my mind to see if that was true if that's how I really felt 
he did that for a short amount of time and he kind of withdrew whatever was coming out of his eyes to 
look into me with was it anything physical I could just feel that he was looking in there 
so he seemed to accept it and he turned around and went back to what they were doing so they played around with this black box on this pedestal for just a few more moments 
and then suddenly packed up all their equipment and walked through the walls and they were gone 
that was jill's first encounter shortly after this encounter that jill went to the doctor and 
was diagnosed with tuberculosis this was quite shocking to her and her family they had no idea 
how she had contracted this disease they contacted a lot of people that she had associated with 
there was really no source for it that they could find but following this diagnosis jill had to go 
to the doctor every year and take long x-rays this would later become significant so for some years 
she had no other encounters but then one day when she was about nine years old the greys came back 
and jill had no fear at this point in fact she remembers this first encounter 
and the ones after it being very positive and I'll just let jill again describe what happened 
as she says in her own words that night I remember something came and got me out of my bed 
it was not unpleasant whatever it was it told me things I learned things I don't 
remember what they were but I remember that they were just amazing to me they were just 
wow I thought they were so important and this went on for a while here's where her story gets even 
more interesting the ET's told her that any time that she was ready to have contact 
all she had to do was give them this little secret sign this little signal which involved her putting 
a blanket on the foot of her bed all rolled up as jill says in her own words I was to make a signal 
with a little blanket that I had they actually asked me to make this signal with this blanket 
to fold it up at the bottom of my bed if it was all right to come and take me that night if not 
then I wasn't to put the blanket there so I'd put the blanket there maybe every few days something 
like that so these encounters went on for years from around age 9 to 12 jill estimates that there 
were hundreds of them but whatever it was the greys were teaching her she could not remember 
as she says and I quote I will go somewhere and i know i did and i know that i was taught things and 
i know that they were really really important i felt it was really important at that time 
it was not scary it wasn't evil i enjoyed it it was so important to me that when i got back i 
would try to write something down some phrase that would help me remember what i had just learned 
i started to keep a paper and a pencil next to my bed and as soon as i put the pencil on the paper 
i would get maybe a couple of letters out and the whole thing would be gone from my mind 
and i would sit there frustrated just oh my god i can't believe this and i tried night after night 
every time it happened i tried so hard it got so that as soon as i realized i was back in bed 
i would grab the pencil and paper that very second and as soon as the pencil at the paper it would just go poof gone completely out of my head 
after nearly three years of trying jill finally did get one message it turned out to be her last 
encounter as jill says the last one of those that i remember was i remember being told when i was 
about 12 years old i would forget everything i would not have this experience anymore and 
i would forget about what i had been taught later on it would be restored and sure enough when i was 
12 it stopped happening and i forgot about it so that was a series of encounters that occurred from 
age 9 to 12. it was around this time that jill had her first UFO sighting her family had moved from 
illinois to a little town in nebraska a small rural town was around 1972 and one evening 
jill and her neighborhood friend went outside and were laying on the station wagon 
looking at the stars when suddenly this huge triangular ship came overhead 
it was just a few hundred feet high totally silent and absolutely unexplained as jill says 
it was so big that it blocked out the moon it blocked off the stars and it was moving very 
very slowly it didn't make a sound at all so they watch this thing move overhead and 
disappear off into the distance but they didn't tell anyone about it they didn't talk about it 
they felt strangely sedated after this incident as jill says we didn't really talk too much about it 
we kind of said what's that and we watched it and that's about all we said which is kind of strange 
if you think about it so they didn't tell anyone about it and they kind of just forgot about it 
and after that jill's life carried on as normal for years she went to school 
went to college got married uh she and her husband bought a house she got pregnant had her first kid 
not long after that she had her second kid and then weird things started to happen 
she went to the doctor for her x-rays of her lungs and got a huge shock the doctor called 
her back and wanted to see her so that he had found something in her lungs and I'll 
just let jill describe this incident as she says the next day i got a call from the doctor 
and not to be alarmed but they had found something in my lung and they don't know what it is i had a 
six month old baby my husband and i were pretty alarmed we thought cancer tuberculosis what is 
it and the doctor said he had no idea he couldn't even give me a guess so he went in and we sat down 
in his office and he showed me that i have a metal ring in my left lung he didn't know what it was 
you knew it was metallic he didn't know where it came from or how it could possibly have gotten in there i mean we talked about every possibility there could be 
i had never had any kind of surgery other than tonsils there's no way i could have inhaled something that big i mean i think i would remember it was fairly large 
she asked her doctor well are we going to go in and take it out the doctor told her no 
what we are going to do is watch it what i want you to do is come in every three months 
for the next year and we will take x-rays and we will see if anything is developing 
around it or if there are any abnormalities so that's what they did and there weren't any other 
abnormalities she felt no symptoms the only thing they noticed the only change was that 
tissue did start to accumulate and grow around this ring but there was no foreign body reaction 
she felt fine so they just kept it in there and it's still in there to this day and they 
don't know what it is so jill had another baby and this is when more weird things started to happen
for as long as jill could remember um she had a very strange symptom the tip of her nose 
was really really sensitive this little lump had appeared at some point she's not sure 
when it seemed like it was always there but it was so sensitive to the touch it would cause 
excruciating pain that she simply didn't touch it and then one day she's changing the diaper of her 
newborn baby and this thing just fell out of her nose and when she looked at it she got a shock 
because it was not normal as she says and i quote i just finished changing my son's diaper and i 
stood up and as i stood up this thing fell out of my nose and into my hand i looked at it and 
it looked like a spool of thread the spool the thread is on except really really tiny 
like the size of a half grain of rice it was about that size and it was white she immediately flicked 
it onto the carpet and then realizing what she had done and how unusual this thing was 
she got down on her hands and knees and searched for it but was never able to find it and it was following this that jill started to get really sick 
she had gained some weight from her third pregnancy and was somewhere around 200 pounds 
but following this apparent implant coming out of her body she started to lose weight 
rapidly she started to become very weak she started fainting first once or twice a day 
this was around 1992. this went on for three years so around 1995 she says she was fainting about 
four or five times a day she would eat get a rush of energy and then lose all her energy and faint 
she did of course go to the doctor the doctors thought she might have diabetes she does have 
diabetes in her family but no she did not have diabetes they didn't know what she had jill did 
her own research and she thought it was some form of hypoglycemia the doctors weren't sure 
they just gave her a sort of cocktail of vitamins and told her that they would watch her condition 
but as jill says i was afraid to eat by the end of three years i was just at my wit's end 
i was at the end of my rope i was very very very sick so she was losing a lot of weight things were 
going downhill she didn't know what she was going to do in in 1995 she had the single most unusual 
ufo experience of her entire life she had woken up in the middle of the night to go get a peanut 
butter sandwich and some juice uh if in case she needed to eat it to stabilize her blood sugar and 
the next thing she knows that she's walking across her living room she's no longer in her house 
she's someplace else and it looked like this huge stadium with a domed ceiling and indirect lighting 
and it was just gigantic and again I'll let jill describe in her own words where she found herself 
as jill says it was like inside a domed stadium that kind of roof it was all white it had back 
lighting in there the walls were all lit up and light was coming down from the ceiling but you couldn't see any light fixtures and it was just huge just humongous all throughout the 
place as far as i could see where i was sitting were cubicles aisles and aisles of cubicles 
like you'd find if you walked into a bank or business these cubicles were blue in color 
and looking down at the floor she saw that it was carpeted with what looked like a tough industrial 
type carpet and she's looking around trying to orient herself and as she says i was sitting there 
i began to notice what was in my immediate area i was inside a cubicle and i was sitting on a long 
steel table like you'd find in any doctor's office i was wondering what the heck am i doing here 
what is this and i looked up and across the aisle from me and another cubicle was sitting a man he 
had on a plaid shirt blue jeans a belt and those thick sold work boots he looked about my age which 
would have been about 35. he looked at me i looked at him he was completely human looking i had no 
idea at this point that i was anywhere other than a human place but i didn't know where i was i had 
never been in a place like that and i didn't know how i got there i was just really confused
so she and this man start to talk to each other he introduces himself as cooper she gives her 
name and they're both dazed disoriented almost sedated and they're trying to figure out where 
the heck they are and what is going on when as she's talking to this man cooper he suddenly falls 
unconscious his eyes are still open but he's like dazed hypnotized and apparently unable to move 
this made her quite frightened she heard a sound coming from the corridor and got a real shock 
looking down the corridor she saw someone that she first thought was human except as he got closer 
he clearly wasn't and he was about eight or nine feet tall she thinks nine and I'll just let jill 
describe what happened next i thought it was a human being a very tall very well developed human 
being until it got close enough for me to see its face then i knew it wasn't human it had a cape on 
it had on clothing that was tight i can't remember the material i just remember that 
i could see its muscles through its clothing it had a belt on and as it got closer i saw the face 
and it was huge its forehead was way way too high to have been a human being and its hair 
was bright orange and sticking straight up about two inches was kind of like thin straw 
or wheat in texture there was something about his chin too it was way too big and way too broad 
and that's when i realized something was really really wrong and at that point i knew that it just 
wasn't human i was terrified i was horrified i thought this thing was coming to kill me 
he was just a few feet from me and i was screaming and screaming i thought i was going to die 
i've never been so terrified in all my life jill can now see that there is a tray filled with what 
appears to be surgical instruments right next to her this nine foot tall being walks into her 
cubicle and says okay gel now it's your turn and he takes his cape and wraps her 
body tightly up in it and then he picks up these instruments that look like little silver bells 
and uh he takes one bell and puts it on her pancreas or near the pancreas and the liver and 
he took the other bell and slid it underneath her left side near what she believes are her 
kidney and adrenal glands and when he said okay jill now it's your turn this was jill's response 
he didn't say it in a caring kind compassionate way he didn't say it in a mean cruel evil way 
he just said it like he was talking to a lab rat so after this figure placed these bell-like 
instruments on jill's body she started to feel this energy pulsating from these instruments 
into her body this made her even more terrified and she was screaming in fear 
she tried to say the lord's prayer but she was too terrified to even remember it and the next thing 
she knows she's back in her living room she's breathless she's sweaty she's hyperventilating 
she's standing up and she's quite scared she immediately runs up to her husband and tries 
to wake him up he will not wake up despite you know her shaking him very hard she runs to wake 
up her children they won't wake up it takes her basically 20 minutes to wake up her family 
she tells her husband what happened he's absolutely baffled mystified 
concerned but very supportive of her of her he believes her he can see that she's very upset 
but he doesn't know what to make of this experience and for that matter neither did jill 
her body was quite sore she went to bed the next morning she wakes up and goes into 
her child's room and gets a real shock as she says the night after it happened 
i was putting my son to bed he was three years old then he looked outside the window was right above 
his head and he looked at the moon and he said mommy i went on a ship to the moon last night 
and jill looked at him with amazement and said you did honey where did you go and he said went on 
ship went to on ship and he pointed to the moon and she said you did when he said last night 
so that freaked her out as jill says i didn't ask him anything else i was horrified 
but here's where her story again gets even more interesting because following this experience 
in this weird place with this nine foot tall figure jill comes back her body's very sore but 
in the days that followed she noticed something really remarkable she was no longer fainting 
in fact she felt quite good her soreness lasted about two weeks but she started to gain 
weight she started to be able to eat normally again she was no longer fainting as jill says
at the end of that week when i finally realized what's going on here I'm not getting sick anymore 
i connected it to what had happened that night at that point i began to wonder who was that 
and why me why would they come and heal me over the next month or so i began to lose a 
little bit of the fear and get a great curiosity they hadn't hurt me they had fixed me i still 
didn't feel any warm fuzzy feelings towards them because that's not the impression they gave me 
i was a lab rat that's what i felt like i don't know what i am to them why would 
they come and heal me like that i don't know i really have no idea and i would like to know 
so this was when jill really connected this all to the UFO phenomena she was absolutely perplexed 
she wants to know what this figure was this this was why she contacted me she wanted to 
know if i had ever heard of anyone describing this kind of figure and i had to tell her 
no i didn't i had heard of other healing cases but uh hadn't heard of a story quite like 
hers so this was very perplexing to her and she wasn't long after this that she had 
another really dramatic UFO sighting she was driving with a family friend I'll call 
david and it started out with a weird premonition as jill says all of a sudden i had this feeling 
like he needed to pull off the road because something very very bad was going to happen 
and she turned to david who was driving and said you need to pull off the road and he asked why do you need to go to the bathroom and she said no and he said well I'm 
not pulling over. and jill said okay and she says i tried to ignore the feeling it would go away 
and then it would come back and each time it came back it i felt worse and worse the third 
time i tried to ignore it it actually was going to make me throw up so she turned to her friend 
david and said you've got to pull off the road right now get off the road at the very next exit 
do it now and uh seeing how upset jill was david pulled off at the nearest exit into a truck stop 
and turns to her and says okay now what and jill felt embarrassed uh the feeling she had 
was completely gone and she looked at her friend david and said you know I'm sorry i just had a 
really really bad feeling that you had to pull off the road right now so they got back on the road 
and started driving and this is when this huge UFO appeared it was a very large round silver object 
and jill shouted out look oh my god it's a UFO look up in the sky and her friend david completely 
ignored her pretended she hadn't said anything and she turned to him and said what's the matter with 
you look up in the sky and david said I'm not going to look jill was shocked and she told him 
again look look at that thing it's just hanging in the air floating don't you see that silver thing 
floating there look and david got angry and he said I'm not going to look so jill started to get 
angry as well she said why why aren't you going to look she was afraid it was 
going to disappear and she really wanted another witness and david shouted at her i am not looking 
she said what is the matter with you hurry up and look it's going to be gone can't you 
just look and tell me what you think it is and he said no I'm not going to look 
stop asking me so jill stared at this object she was very confused by her friend's reaction as she 
says i couldn't understand why he was angry or why he wouldn't look so i was looking at it and as i 
watched it it just went zoom and it disappeared off into the distance and it was gone and she 
turned to david and said well it's gone what's the matter with you why wouldn't you look at it 
and her friend replied i don't want to talk about it so she didn't and they never discussed it again 
uh she could tell that david was angry and upset by this object she wondered if 
he had had encounters but she never got to follow up on it because a few years later 
david passed away so that was another very strange incident that she was never able to explain
and it wasn't much longer after that you know some years about eight years or so that 
she had another very strange encounter it was 2003 she went to bed as normal and woke up and 
again she was in a different place and again I'll just let jill describe in her own words 
what happened as she says i was in the same kind of place with this domed white walled kind of area 
i was walking down a black rubber runner rug i came to the end of this long table and there 
were these not quite human looking beings sitting at the table maybe four on each side 
they had light-colored kind of thin hair down to shoulder length they had a light-colored clothes 
i didn't know who they were or why i was there it felt very real and i was just waiting i don't 
know for what i assumed there was something they wanted me there for 
and they said something about this child being very intelligent i thought they were talking 
about my son because he is intelligent and i said well what do you expect he's got the wheeler jeans 
and as soon as i said that these beings turned and looked at me with such a pitying expression like 
you think that is intelligent it was like these people considered that kind of intelligence to 
be the intelligence of an animal like a dog was that kind of withering patronizing pitiful look 
at this point one of these beings stood up led jill out of the room into the room 
right by it the adjacent room and she first noticed the floor which looked like hard plastic 
she said with a raised circular pattern kind of like a giant bath mat is how she said and this 
being escorted her to the center of the room where there was this platform and on this platform there 
was a little girl and she estimates this girl was about five years old and the being told jill this 
is your child and as jill says i walked up to the platform and the little girl 
and i looked at her she did not look any different from a normal human child except she was kind of 
frail looking she didn't look like my kids for instance who are very strong and robust she 
looked frail and kind of pale she had really fine stringy white colored hair her face didn't look 
any different than a human face except there was something about her eyes they were a little bit 
bigger and they were blue jill's memory becomes very hazy at this point she remembers becoming 
very emotional and asked to hug the child and she did the two of them embraced and at this point 
jill asked the child why don't you come home with me and the child replied no i belong here 
and jill felt this enormous wave of love and sadness sweep over her 
but at the same time she somehow understood she turned around and began to exit the room 
and the next thing she knows she's waking up in bed and the experience was over 
and that was her last UFO experience up to this date and uh this haunted her this is when she 
really began researching the UFO subject uh when she contacted me to find out if there were other 
people who had had experiences like her she did research herself and found out that the teddy 
bears she saw were likely screen memories she read about many other people who had described seeing a 
black box she even found another case involving people who put tin foil up on the windows it's 
very strange i wonder why the ETs were so concerned about that did it block them from 
surveilling her or being able to come into her room they did seem quite upset about it 
but jill is absolutely certain that she's a contactee she doesn't know where she was taken to 
she feels like it might have been an underground base certainly in that big stadium like 
area with the industrial looking carpeting in the cubicles but she has no idea she has no idea why 
she was healed she says she's nobody special she's just a housewife from nebraska 
her husband is i believe a mechanic so i don't know it's a very strange series of events with 
some very strange and unique details though many details I've certainly heard before the screen 
memories are somewhat familiar the black box is the detail I've heard in many other cases 
certainly being healed is something I've heard many times from various contactees and also 
hybrid babies as well but other details you know i have never heard of anyone describing a nine-foot 
tall essentially human-looking e.t with orange spiky hair i don't know i did cover jill's story 
in my book inside UFOs it's one of the strangest encounters I've ever had the privilege to research 
and i think that's really why i wanted to do this episode for you today because this is just such 
a strange and unusual encounter jill absolutely insists this is 100 true now she says i know what 
i saw that's about all i have to give i will take a lie detector test anything anybody wants so yeah 
i am not sure what to make of this encounter other than i think that it has a lot of details 
i've heard before the hybrid babies the implants the screen memories all of this stuff are details 
i've heard again and again it's a very unusual encounter i think it has quite a bit to say
