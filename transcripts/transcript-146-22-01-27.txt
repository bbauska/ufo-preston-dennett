CALIFORNIA UFO LANDINGS AND HUMANOIDS: TWELVE TRUE CASES
Jan 27, 2023

Summary:
Jan 27, 2023
While many people speculate about the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon, cases of landings and humanoids make it clear what they are. UFOs are craft, and they are piloted by extraterrestrials. These kinds of encounters represent the core of the UFO phenomenon. They teach us the most about these visitors to our world, who they are, where they come from and their agenda on our planet. Humanoid encounters have been occurring for a very long time, and are far more common than many people realize. In fact, according to the Roper Polling Organization, as many as one in fifty people may have had these experiences. They occur all across the planet to all kinds of people. The state of California leads the U.S. in the sheer number of encounters. And the cases of humanoids show a corresponding and profound variety of humanoid types. Here are twelve cases of landings and humanoids from the Golden State.

Oct 18, 1927: While driving outside the town of Bakersfield, schoolteacher Richard Sweed comes upon a landed UFO. As he approaches, it makes a loud whining noise, accelerates upward and disappears into the distance, leaving behind a circle of glassified sand.

Dec 1957: Edmond Rucker of El Cajon hears a loud roaring noise outside his home. Venturing outside, he is confronted by a landed UFO and four strange humanoids who speak to him about their mission on Earth.

Apr 14, 1964: A truckdriver on a highway outside of Chico comes upon a domed disc which hovers above his truck causing it to stall. When the UFO lands nearby, the man exits his truck and approaches the craft. He touches the craft and is amazed to hear strange voices coming from inside.

Apr 1964: Gloria Biggs, her husband and mother are driving outside the desert town of Baker when they see a domed-shaped object landed next to the highway ahead of them. As they approach, the UFO takes off. They examine the landing site and discover a weird depression in the ground.

Mar 31, 1966: Two women driving by a construction site near San Francisco see a metallic disc hover at low altitude. Through the windows of the craft, they are amazed to see the silhouettes of several “people” gesticulating at them.

Oct 4, 1973: While driving along the 118 Freeway in Simi Valley, Gary Chopic observes a small triangular-shaped craft with a transparent dome on top. Inside he sees a human-looking figure at the controls. And then the humanoid sees him!

Dec 17, 1973: Driving at night outside of Paso Robles, Sergeant Lance Mathias and his friend Mike Andrews see a hovering spherical UFO sending down a beam of light. Going to investigate they are confronted by two metallic-suited humanoids.

1974: The Overfelt family of Ramona are drawn out of their farmhouse by a huge glowing sphere which lands on a hill near their home. All the animals on the farm react to the presence of the UFO. The Overfelts call the police, who refer them to investigators, who have some important advice.

Mar 6, 1977: While watching over a factory in Sylmar, security guard Douglas Kriese is amazed to see a UFO drop out of the sky and land in a field nearby. He approaches it and hears it making a buzzing sound, and feels it emitting an intense heat. He immediately calls the police.

1977: Two Native American brothers from Colusa contact investigators after a UFO keeps landing near their ranch-home and a long-haired big-nosed humanoid keeps entering their can through the walls. When investigators arrive, they see the UFO themselves!

Oct 31, 1976: a husband a wife motorcycling through downtown Los Angeles see a spherical UFO hovering below the level of the buildings. The sunlight strikes the craft, making it transparent. They then see human-looking figures staring down at them. The wife quickly flashes them the peace sign.

Nov 29, 1988: Maria X. of Sherman Oaks is in her bedroom with her young son when grays show up and render her unable to move. Maria is concerned about her son, but falls unconscious. The next morning, her son exclaims that “My aliens came back!” and provides a vivid description of what it’s like to be pulled by the ETs through the wall.

These twelve cases are just the tip of the iceberg of UFO landings and humanoids in California. And yet, these cases here represent an accurate cross-section of UFO activity across the world. They also show that humanoid encounters often present good hard evidence in the form of landing traces, electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects, and other stunning confirmation.

Intro
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the 
Paranormal today's episode I call California UFO Landings and humanoids 12 true cases 
I love cases involving sightings don't get me wrong but I think it's humanoids in landing cases 
is where we get a lot more information about extraterrestrials and the UFO phenomena itself 
and all the cases I'm presenting today are from California I think that's significant because it 
shows that each location on this planet almost without exception does have a long history of 
encounters in the cases I'm presenting today reach all the way back to the 1920s up to the 1980s so 
we're talking Decades of encounters I had a lot of cases to choose from but I wanted to choose cases 
that I think are unique in some way or have high levels of credibility multiple Witnesses physical 
evidence perhaps in the front of Landing Trace cases or animal reactions and cases involving 
a wide variety of humanoids and it's really amazing how many different types of humanoids 
there are certainly not just grays so what I'm basically going to be doing today is giving you 
a reading from various sections of my book UFOs over California a true history of extraterrestrial 
Encounters in the Golden State and each of these cases provides another piece of the UFO puzzle 
so I do have a lot of cases to present so let's just get started the first 
Bakersfield
case I'd like to talk about today took place in Bakersfield again California 
this is in Southern California north of Los Angeles in the high deserts and in fact this is 
one of the first UFO Landings in California that left actual physical evidence of its existence 
these types of cases are really rare and are called Landing Trace cases and this one occurred 
well before the Modern Age of UFOs it occurred on October 18 1927 when a school teacher by the 
name of Richard Swede was driving alone in the outskirts of Bakersfield when he had an experience 
that he actually kept secret for about 32 years as he was driving along the highway he suddenly 
observed a strange saucer-shaped object landed directly along the side of the road ahead of him 
he was able to get a close look at the object as he sped closer to it 
he said the object was metallic looking bluish gray in color and was quite large about 60 feet 
in diameter and had a row of round windows around the perimeter now when he got close it suddenly 
emitted a very strange noise which he described as quote whining humming wheezing and swooshing 
this object then Rose steadily at an angle of 45 degrees and accelerated very quickly 
up into the sky now he did something very smart he kept his eyes on the exact Landing 
location and pulled over to investigate and upon examination he was amazed to see 
that the sand on the ground where the object had been was quote fused like glass crystals 
this is pretty significant for a couple of reasons one it does represent actual physical evidence of 
something very strange here but it also shows how hot these objects truly are and that's what 
happened here this case wasn't investigated by pioneering researcher Charles Bowen 
who is one of the first to accept that there were actually humanoids on board these craft 
the next case I'd like to talk about occurred in El Cajon this occurred in December of 1957 
El Cajon
to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Rucker a resident of El Cajon and this was an experience 
that was very memorable to him as he later told investigators he was awakened one evening by a 
loud roaring noise coming from outside his home and looking outside he was shocked to see a quote 
strange object Landing right next to his home so this does seem to be intentional contact and as 
Edmund Rucker says and I quote its windows were lighted and I saw strange looking heads in there 
and they were strange because as Edmund Rucker watched an opening appeared in this craft and 
four beings emerged he said they appeared to have bulging eyes and large dome-like foreheads 
they actually spoke to him saying that their intentions were scientific and philanthropic 
unfortunately there's not a whole lot of other information about this case which is it was 
again reported on by researcher Charles Bowen but yeah it's definitely an interesting case 
and there are many more where that came from the next case I want to talk about occurred on 
Chico
April 14 1964 to an anonymous truck driver who is driving at night outside the town of Chico 
and he says he came upon a domed disc hovering about 1 000 feet above his truck which 
immediately stalled at this point the truck driver reported a strong feeling of static electricity 
causing his hair to stand on end so this is a physiological effect where his body is actually 
affected in some way this is apparently because of the magnetic fields surrounding these craft 
but according to this Anonymous truck driver this domed disc then lowered to the ground 
and actually landed next to the road he was absolutely Amazed by this and he exited his 
truck and did something I wouldn't advise most people to do he approached this desk and actually 
reached out and touched the craft and as he said It felt warm to the touch and caused a 
small electrical like shock and the witness says he also heard what sounded like voices 
this was reported on by UFO researcher Richard Haynes PhD and it's a good solid 
case of a UFO landing and although he didn't see any humanoids he did hear them 
and the next case actually occurred only two weeks later April 1964 not far away this occurred in the 
desert town of Baker the witnesses included Gloria Biggs her husband and mother all of whom observed 
Baker
a brown dome-shaped object landed along the highway ahead of them while they were driving now 
they lost sight of it due to the path of the road but when they reached the site of the landing this 
object was gone they did get out to investigate however and they saw quote a depression in the 
ground where the object had been so this is fairly standard for UFO Landings they do often leave 
traces of some kind this case was investigated by Jacques Vale who became particularly interested 
in landing Trace cases UFO Landings in general and collected a catalog of several hundred such cases 
and here's another one from Jacque Valley and this one actually involves humanoids as well 
this occurred on March 31st 1966 at around 6 A.M 
the ordeal began when two women were passing by a construction site outside of San Francisco 
they both observed a strange vehicle parked in the lot and they described it as quote a large 
object with a pulsating bluish light on top an orange light below windows and an antenna 
the Witnesses were even more amazed by the fact that they could actually see Silhouettes moving 
around inside the craft gesturing it was only seconds later this craft took off very quickly 
and accelerated out of sight but it's another amazing case of a landed UFO with occupants 
there's so many cases like these seems like there are a large number of UFOs cited Landing alongside 
highways and freeways and that's what occurred on October 4 1973 in Simi Valley to Simi Valley 
resident Gary chopic he was driving along the 118 Simi Valley freeway when he saw a quote triangular 
Simi Valley
object landed along the roadside this object had a transparent bubble on top through which Gary 
could see a quote humanoid figure moving about inside suddenly this figure seemed to actually 
notice Gary and he scrambled out of sight and seconds later the bubble retracted into the 
Triangular object a strange Mist enveloped the craft and a moment later it was gone 
it's not clear if it darted out of sight or just sort of faded away this was reported on 
by Kevin Randall and Russ Estes who wrote about this case in their book faces of the visitors 
but it's an interesting case because this is a fairly busy highway and also interesting 
is this area is where there was a lot of nuclear testing going on or perhaps that is a factor here 
and here's another case which occurred about two months later in the same year this was on 
December 14 1973 this is many miles away up in Northern California in a city called Paso Robles 
Paso Robles
the main Witnesses in this case are platoon Sergeant Lance Matthias and computer programmer 
Mike Andrews was around 9 40 p.m in the evening as they were driving through Paso 
Robles when they saw a quote amber colored sphere hovering at about 800 feet above the highway 
this was a weird object they could see a black cone on the bottom of the sphere which was 
emitting a bright red beam of light which was causing itself a quote great disturbance in 
the field below and I'll just let Lance Matthias describe this as he says the beam shot out stopped 
then shot again in intermittent spurts when this was done the cone was drawn into this sphere and 
a cloud of vapor became visible where the cone had been after a few seconds this object darted away 
this is interesting because in a lot of these cases we do see strange Mists or fogs 
enveloping these craft which again appears to be a byproduct perhaps of their engines but at any rate 
Lance Matthias and Mike Andrews did what a lot of witnesses do they ran into the field and examined 
the area where this beam had hit the ground they actually found a strange ring of crushed grass 
and the ground itself appeared to actually glow though after about 15 minutes this glow faded 
they then turned on their flashlights and re prepared to return to their car 
and it turns out their encounter wasn't over yet because suddenly their flashlight beams lit up two 
six-foot humanoid figures in metallic suits and as Lance Matthias says the two were side by side 
they startled me I know I saw them at this point the humanoids waved their arms in a strange way 
but Lance and uh Mike were too frightened and they Departed the area in a panic but later 
when shown pictures of the humanoids seen by Charles Hixson and Calvin Parker and Pascagoula 
Mississippi of that year actually Lance Matthias replied that's it they looked just like that 
so this is a good case because these are pretty good Witnesses there's two witnesses there's 
Landing traces they were very close to these humanoids they got confirmation about what they 
look like and another thing I like about this case is that it was investigated by Leonard Stringfield 
a highly respected researcher and he wrote about this case in his book situation red the UFO Siege 
now here is a really dramatic case which took place one year later in 1974 outside the city 
of Ramona this isn't in Southern California North of San Diego and this is quite a dramatic case 
Overfelt Family
the main Witnesses are the Overfelt family and they were drawn outside their home by a 
bright object that had swooped out of the sky and landed on a hill very close to their home 
the object they said was the size of a small house it appeared to be perfectly round and 
it was changing in color from red to White and here's where it gets really interesting while 
this apparent craft was on the hill the horses in their house and the other animals started 
reacting quite strangely the horses started bucking the dog slammed around in his doghouse 
the goats were jumping up and down and their cat ran into the side of the house stunning itself 
so this is a very solid case of animal reactions and clearly the animals could sense this object 
and when this object continued to stay there for quite some time one of the family members actually 
called local investigators but the investigators instructed them to check for electromagnetic 
effects and the witnesses then learned that the radio in their house wouldn't work at all 
and the television screen showed strange blue spots and vertical bands this is when the object 
was still there the witnesses then obtained a compass and were amazed to see the needle of the 
compass oscillating rapidly back and forth between north and Northeast the direction of the object 
so this is not only animal effects going on here but electromagnetic effects 
so the UFO investigators headed out to the scene but after about 20 minutes of staying there this 
UFO suddenly hovered and took off and immediately several military jets appeared in Hot Pursuit 
so somehow they must have known it was there I think this is why the UFO probably took off 
at any rate as the UFO took off the compass needle flew off of its glass pivot and 
actually lodged against the glass cover of the compass the main investigator to this 
case Eric Herr calls this case quote a classic and I agree it's got a lot of evidence to it 
and here's another case which occurred just three years later on March 6 1977 in the town of Silmar 
Silmar
this is in the San Fernando Valley a pretty heavily populated area and the main witness 
in this case is a private security guard by the name of Douglas creese a lot of security guards 
become UFO Witnesses because obviously they're outside keeping guard and Douglas creese was 
at his station outside a factory in Silmar when he saw a quote reddish glowing light 
it came from the East flew over his head and actually landed behind a nearby building 
Douglas creese was in intrigued and he went to investigate and to his amazement he observed 
a landed craft and he said it was shaped like a quote tuna can with a high transparent Dome 
the object itself glowed a deep red and was emitting a low hum so he continued to 
approach this object and when he got to within about 300 feet he could feel an intense heat 
coming from the object uh this warned him away so he retreated and called the Van Nuys police 
the police told him they do not handle UFO reports and referred him to Anne gruffal who was then one 
of Southern California's leading UFO investigators she did meet with the witness Douglas creese of 
course by this time the UFO had already taken off but she interviewed him and ended up writing about 
his case along with d Scott rogo in their excellent book The Tujunga Canyon contacts 
it's a really interesting case and here's another very unusual case which actually took place over 
a period of years starting around 1977. and this occurred outside of the town of Colusa 
Colusa
the Witnesses in this case were two brothers they are Anonymous they are Native Americans 
from the Cortina tribe and they lived in a small isolated Ranch House which was quite remote it had 
no water or any electricity but this case came to be an attention of investigators after these 
brothers told their neighbor that a quote strange plane kept Landing in their fields and it wasn't 
just an object because they said a short humanoid figure would then exit and harass the two brothers 
and as the brothers told their neighbor this object showed up and then darted away quickly 
one of the brothers we do know his first name Amos told his neighbor that he disliked the 
visitations because the quote little stranger made all his horses go wild and hunting the next 
day was difficult because all the animals would go into hiding so this is another interesting 
example of animal reactions and according to Amos this figure didn't actually walk 
but floated a few feet above the ground it was quite short only three and a half feet 
tall and typically wore a strange one piece Brown uniform his appearance was quite unusual according 
to Amos he had long hair a large nose and gave off a bad smell Amos reports that this figure 
would actually enter through the walls of their cabin and then Dart away whenever Amos approached 
now when investigators arrived following several of these incidents Amos showed them where the 
object had landed and investigators did find strange Circles of crushed and swirled grass 
and during one visit on October 18 1977 one of the investigators actually observed the 
UFO approach close up and then Dart away and when the investigators finally left these visitations 
continued on afterwards this is a case that was reported on in Jacque Valley's catalog 
of UFO Landings and yeah a very interesting and unusual case now here is a particularly 
compelling report which comes from an anonymous couple a man and a woman from Los Angeles 
Los Angeles
they were driving together on their motorcycle in the late afternoon this is uh around 1980 or so 
and the couple said well I'll just quote the main witness they were driving on their motorcycle the 
late afternoon through downtown L.A when their encounter occurred and as the woman says and I 
quote I saw what appeared to be a metallic colored disc shaped object shoot up from behind the taller 
buildings nearby it got to a height of 100 feet in the air we turned left and then the 
sun shined on it and I could see inside because the ship turned transparent I could see three 
or four people inside two were looking out at me and were leaning over a console or platform 
they looked like two handsome ordinary human men I gave them a peace sign because it seemed 
a fun thing to do they didn't respond but showed no emotion other than curiosity 
I don't tell many people because of my fear of ridicule but my husband saw them 
too but not as clearly as me it reminded us of a soap bubble when the Setting Sun Shone on it 
where the sun didn't hit it the craft remained a steel gray opaque color 
my husband doesn't think it's a good idea to tell anyone but I've been keeping quiet for too long 
they ended up reporting their case to new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center 
and this case is interesting because it involves this disc which turns transparent 
and they saw human looking ETS she gave them the peace sign it's a very interesting case 
and now I get to the last case I'd like to present today and this occurred in Sherman 
Sherman Oaks
Oaks California this is Right Out near Los Angeles and the witness is Maria we don't know her last 
name this was reported on by Richard Haynes again a prominent UFO researcher Maria was 42 
years old a divorced mother of two boys and she lived alone with her younger eight-year-old son 
her older son had moved out actually because Maria was experiencing repeated visitations by gray type 
ETS and it was around 2 A.M in the morning of November 29 1988 when Maria woke up once 
again to find an E.T in her bedroom and I'll just quote Maria directly as she says 
there was a being evidently assigned to keep me absolutely Frozen to this 
spot he seemed most unhappy with his task he's he was standing almost like a century 
now this upset Maria because her eight-year-old son was also in the room and each time she tried 
to open her eyes to see him she said that this E.T forced her to close them again and after a 
long mental struggle Maria kind of gave up and her next memory was waking up the next morning 
and during breakfast she asked her son if he had had a good night's sleep and he said 
yes and you know what my aliens came back so he was absolutely aware of what was going on 
like Maria however her son was unable to recall any on board sequence however he did report 
something very interesting and that's why I wanted to include this case he vividly recounted to his 
mother how it felt to be taken through the closed front door as he told his mother and I quote 
well you see once you get halfway through it it's not Wood anymore it's really neat it changes into 
lots of little colored balls and that's the most fun part and the only time the aliens 
ever get mad at me is because I like to stay in the middle and look at the balls for a really 
long time but they tell me it's dangerous to stay in the middle I have to come out the other side 
and as Maria his mother says he was disappointed about that but he was very emphatic and then he 
went on to ask what was for lunch later and he dropped the whole subject as if it was just as 
matter of fact as could be now Richard Haynes was the primary investigator to this case and as he 
says I worked with Maria over an 18-month period she claimed to have had over 50 separate visits 
one every 11 days on the average and this event took place during the middle of this sequence
Outro
those are the 12 cases that I wanted to present to you today again all of them are from my book UFOs 
over California a true history of extraterrestrial Encounters in the Golden State and as you can 
see they are quite different in terms of what happens how people react the different types of 
ETS seen the evidence involved with them and I think these cases show what it's like to have 
face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials or what it's like to have a UFO land right next 
to you I love these cases because unlike sightings there's virtually no chance of misperception these 
encounters as a rule are very close encounters and by that I mean just a few feet away 
and as you can see these encounters have affected the witnesses profoundly 
I hope you've enjoyed Today's Show I truly appreciate you watching and until next time 
keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun bye now.
