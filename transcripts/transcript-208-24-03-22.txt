ALIEN VISITATIONS: TEN CASES FROM AROUND THE WORLD
Mar 22, 2024

Summary:
Mar 22, 2024
UFOs are real! The UFO subject is now enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Governments across the world are now admitting the validity of the UFO phenomenon, and more and more people are now stepping forward to share their own encounters. This video presents ten cases of alien visitations from across the world, seven of which involve face-to-face contact with humanoids of all different kinds. Landing traces, physiological effects, unusual electromagnetic disturbances, and most cases with multiple witnesses – the truth can no longer be denied. We are not alone!

A CLOSEUP ENCOUNTER WITH HUMANOIDS. On November 16, 1952, 40-year-old farmer, Nello Ferreri stepped into the fields near his home in Castelfranco, Italy to relieve himself. Suddenly a circle of light appeared on the ground around him, and looking up, he saw a flying saucer hovering just overhead. Looking down at him were three strange humanoids wearing rubber suits.

THREE YOUNG GIRLS SEE A HUMANOID. School had just let out for Anne Storedal (age 10,) her sister Tora and their friend Tora Moy (both age 9) and they were walking to their homes in Torpo, Norway. Suddenly a small black dot appeared in the sky, zoomed down, and hovered only a few feet overhead. The girls could now see it was a strange, spherical craft, and inside was a tiny man dressed in black staring at them.

THE ALIEN TOURISTS. On September 29, 1965, Emil and Ada Carlsson stepped outside their home in Arboga, Sweden and saw a boat-shaped object floating silently only a few hundred feet over their heads. Inside were more than twenty people wearing bright colored clothes. The strange figures were surveying the couple and the environment. The Carlssons realized that they must be alien tourists!

LANDINGS AND HUMANOIDS AT WAYNESBORO, VA. On the morning of December 21, 1965, Horace Burns was driving along Hwy 250 near Waynesboro, Virginia when a UFO landed next to him, stalling his car. This was the start of a wave of sightings in the area. One month later and a few miles away, William Blackburn encountered a landed UFO and occupants. A week after that, six young men chased three humanoids again on Hwy 250. Later, one of them and a photographer came upon a landed UFO and alien.

A 13-MILE UFO CHASE. On the evening of January 5, 1971, John Clucas (age 37) was driving to his home, from Penrith to Windsor, Australia. Without warning a glowing object swooped down behind his car and tailgated him. John sped up and so did the object. When he slowed down, the object also slowed down. No matter what John did, he couldn’t outrun the UFO, and it followed him for more than 13 miles.

THE UFO THAT SUCKED. One summer day in 1973, numerous people across England observed a black UFO that moved overhead, sucking various objects into the sky. Several people at Jodrell watched as it levitated hay and grass. A train driver at Kidlington said it levitated a bag of coal. Residents of both Chell and Burslem also saw the UFO and various items being pulled up into the sky. Strangely, nobody reported any wind.

THE UFO MADE HER CRY. On the night of October 13, 1977, Mary Arnett and three others encountered a low-flying metallic disc while driving along Mobley Road in rural Wetzel County, West Virginia. Upon seeing the object, Mary found herself bursting into tears. As the object followed them and started to land, they drove off in fear. They wanted to return to the area the next day to investigate, but they were too afraid.

A BOX-SHAPED UFO WITH HUMANOIDS. It was early morning in November 1978 when 9-year-old Dawn Smith saw a strange box-shaped object floating at low altitude outside her window in Westbank, British Columbia, Canada. She was amazed to see a hatch open and two dark human-looking men standing on either side of the door. Even more amazing was when a large flying saucer emerged from the craft.

THE ODENSE LANDING AND HUMANOIDS. Just before 5am on July 16, 1982, a young man was bicycling to work from Odense, Denmark to Broby, when he came upon a landed UFO. He jumped off his bike and walked up to it, startling five short, bald humanoids who were taking samples and putting them in bags. The ETs retreated to the craft which took off, leaving a circle of crushed grass on the ground.

BADLANDS UFO. One evening in February 1982, geologist Tom Brebol was retiring after surveying the terrain in the wilderness of the Barber County Badlands of southern, Kansas. As a strange silence enveloped the area and Tom had the feeling of being watched, he ventured outside his tent and came upon a landed craft. To his shock, two glowing blue figures appeared. As he snapped a photo, Tom blacked out.

These ten cases from across the planet, spanning several decades, show the incredible diversity and complexity of the UFO phenomenon and the various extraterrestrials visiting our planet. And they have so much to teach us, about ourselves and life beyond Earth.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. Today's episode is called alien visitations 10 cases from around
the world I love talking about UFOs and extraterrestrials for me this subject is
endlessly fascinating it's got so much to teach us not only about life beyond
Earth but about ourselves today I've chosen 10 cases from all over the world
of course and reaching back back to the 1950s actually up through the
1980s and 10 cases that I think are not super welln but ones that are definitely
interesting ones that have some unique aspects to them cases that have something to teach us about ourselves
and life beyond Earth so I've got cases from England from Norway SW Sweden
Denmark Italy Australia England and the United
States and most of these do involve humanoids though for good measure I stuck a couple of what I would call
Close Encounters of the first kind simple sightings though as you'll see they're not quite as simple as you might
think but yeah super interesting this again is my favorite subject and I can't
wait to present these cases to you today and some of these cases are quite extensive a few are brief but I think
this is going to be a longer episode always hard to predict but let's just get started and the first case I'd like
to talk about today I call a close-up encounter with
humanoids and this is a somewhat brief case but the witness saw this UFO and
humanoids so close up it removes virtually any chance of misperception
it's got some really unusual aspects to it and it's just an allaround interesting case it occurred on November
16 1952 in Castle Franco Italy and I think
you'll find it quite interesting this case involves a single witness and it is pretty brief but it's also really
strange the witness's name is nello Ferrari he's a 40-year-old farmer who on
the morning of November 16 1915 2 had walked away from the Stables of his farm
to go relieve himself in a pasture and looking down at the ground
he noticed a copper colored luminescence in a 120 ft radius circle around him and
looking up he saw a strange craft hovering at a very low altitude about 30
ft overhead he said its shape was similar to two plates one on top of the
other and they were separated by sort of a metallic section which rotated rapidly
making a loud humming noise no more astonishing than this was
that leaning out from the center section of this saucer-shaped craft were three
humanoid figures he said they appeared to be normal sized but were wearing what
looked like a rubber looking suit with sort of a transparent face mask he said
they appeared to be talking audibly out loud to each other and he could actually hear these words which really made no
sense to him but sounded he said something along the lines of verin urg
unch so what that means is anybody's guess but at this point there was a loud
metallic click and the humming noise from the object increased in
intensity and then this object took off at high speed now now Italian ethologist Renzo
kabasi did to a follow-up investigation and he learned unfortunately that the
main witness had passed away but according to his family the farmer nello was profoundly
affected by his encounter for the rest of his life again a pretty brief case I
wish there was more investigation to it but it's really interesting when someone
sees a UFO and humanoids that close up during broad daylight no chance of
misper misperception and again it's sort of a
cautionary tale is you never know what you're going to see when you go outside to relieve
yourself an interesting case for sure and here is another one which I found
super fascinating I hadn't heard of it before so I'd be surprised if you have I
call this one three young girls see a humanoid and this is an amazing
encounter which is really quite unusual it occurred on November 23rd 1954 in
torpo Norway and it's really quite well authenticated with Landing traces and
multiple Witnesses and it really affected the three young girls who saw this UFO and
ET quite profoundly as we shall see school had just ended and three girls
including 10-year-old an sto doll her sister Torah age nine and their friend
Torah Moy hgo also age nine were all taking a short cut through the woods to
reach their homes in the small town of torpo this is in Norway again November
23rd 1954 and they were walking near some high tension line
when something very strange happened it was Torah stll who noticed it first a
strange black dot way high up in the sky and as she watched it moved she said at
tremendous speed coming closer and closer and growing in size she said it
kind of arked down at a 45 degree angle coming towards them and in a matter of
just a few seconds she could now see that this black dot was actually a a
spherical shaped craft of some kind she thought momentarily it might be a
helicopter but as it got got close it was pretty obvious to her that it was something else much more strange
especially when she watched it move over the high tension lines stopped for a moment and then it moved so low it
actually brushed the Treetops sending down a volume of snow right onto her
body so this had her attention but as it moved this object became hidden by the
tree branches so Torah although a little uneasy was also very curious and she
reversed her path and began to actually run up the hill to get a better look at
this object however she had taken only a few steps when this craft actually she
said began to follow her it came up from behind the trees passed right over the
60,000 vol bolt high tension wires and continued down between the two rows of
electric poles this is how low it was until it descended until it was about
three or four feet directly over her head so incredibly close and she could
now see it very clearly she described it as a round sphere about 10 ft in
diameter and as she says in her own words it looked like a stone like a ball
about 10t cross the lowest part was black but trimmed with yellow spots
which could have been made of glass and there were also a number of small red
Jags and she also noticed that as this craft quote came down towards me it had
a long white tail behind so looking at the top section she
could see that the upper part was totally transparent in fact she could see right through it and she could see
the trees on the other side but what really caught her attention was that there was a man sitting in the
center of this stop section she said he was dressed completely in Black though
she could only see the upper half of his body she could see that his hands were holding what looked like a lever of some
kind which he was apparently manipulating as he came right over her
head it then looked to her like he was pressing a number of buttons on this
lever now she couldn't see much of his face but she did notice that this humanoid had huge eyes which were
covered by immensely large red goggles this is what it looked like to her but
what really frightened her is when this man turned his head and looked down
straight at her and this caused her to become hysterical with fear now at this point Torah was the
only one of the three girls who had seen this craft but then it moved towards her
friend Torah Moy rising up slightly at which point it apparently struck the
high tension lines themselves this did cause a shower of
Sparks and this sent Torah Moy also into a complete panic and it was at this
exact time that 10-year-old an heard this strange droning sound turned around
just in time to see this craft move over Torah Moy and then rise up and hit the
tension lines sending down all these Sparks now the younger Torah or age nine
an's sister she noticed that as the craft started to move away she said it
quote turned and moved up the tail went first that was very funny I thought and
she also noticed a strange odor which she compared to quote fried
sausages but at this point all three girls were absolutely hysterical in a
complete Panic they did not really wait to see if this craft was following them or leaving they just ran straight
home now an and tor's mother sidel was cleaning the floor waiting for her
children when they came running into the kitchen she says at 3:20 p.m. and as sidel stole says in her own
words I knew at once that something was wrong the girls were scared out of their wits
and when I asked them what was the matter they told me that they had seen a big transparent Stone which came down
from the sky and inside the stone was sitting a man who stared at
them now Tor Moy Hog's mother Miss lava ho hogo said Tor Moy told me that the
man had been dressed in a black suit and had worn big red glasses and before
the stone disappeared the man had bent his head and looked at her so the girls were so frightened that
they were practically incoherent and it actually took a few days before their parents could get the whole story out of
them as Miss hogo says her daughter had never been so frightened in her entire
life and she actually remained traumatized for several days afterwards later all three girls were
interviewed separately by researchers all told the same details in fact
researcher odar J Larson listened to a recording of the interviews and he says
and I quote what really got me was the trustworthiness of everybody there could
be no doubt whatsoever that something really had taken place not only did the
stories match but the girls use words and expressions which they couldn't have invented if they tried hard and neither
could there be any doubt as to the enthusiasm with which they spoke so after the girls shared their
story and explained what happened the adults in the area immediately went to the scene to investigate of course the
craft and the occupant was gone but below the high tension wires and between the electric poles exactly where the
girls had seen this craft hovering they did find a 75t foot long
streak in the snow and in fact an Army lieutenant later showed up and took a
photograph of it now everyone who knew the girls they were all absolutely convinced that they were telling the
truth about what they saw but what exactly they saw Still Remains a mystery
to this day what a case that was I can't imagine a UFO coming that close to me
within feet uh having an ET stare down at you a human looking ET apparently
though they couldn't say for sure given that it was all dressed up in this black clothes and
had these giant red goggles or so it appeared over its face but yeah a very
close-up encounter with Landing traces I thought the unusual smell of quote
sausages uh was pretty interesting though I have to say it's not unique I've heard that before but yeah a super
interesting encounter that was very well researched as well so I think it's an important case and here's another case
which did enjoy some recent publicity on Facebook it certainly caught my eye because it is so unusual I call this one
the alien tourists and you may have heard of it this was my first time seeing it recently on Facebook so I dug
a little deeper and got some more information about it it occurred on September 29
1965 near arboga Sweden I like this case because it does have two witnesses it's
a broad daylight sighting very close up somewhat longlasting and just super
unusual as we shall see this case was investigated by Swedish researchers Eric
Peterson and thorald berelson and it was published in the Swedish publication UFO
info and it has received considerable publicity I think probably because it
was so unusual it again occurred on September 29
1965 and the main Witnesses were a married couple by the name of Amil and
aah Carlson who lived in arboga Sweden it
was about 6:30 p.m. and Amil and aah were in the front yard of their home
this is just outside of arboga when movement overhead caught their attention
and looking up they saw something very strange a large boat-shaped object
filled with people passing at very low level overhead was totally silent they
estimate this object was about 40 ft long it had no markings on it was gray
in color and it glowed with a dim light but was again yeah kind of a boat
shaped the upper half was open to the air and inside were about 20 maybe 25
people all visible only from the Torso upwards and all of them were dressed in
very colorful clothing all of them were looking down at the couple and the surrounding environment with apparent
interest much like tourists they thought so these people did look like ordinary
humans although their clothing according to the witnesses had all the colors of the rainbow and it kind of reminded the
couple of raincoats they did notice that none of these figures wore any hats or headgear of any
kind and they all appeared to be standing together pretty tightly packed in
fact as they watched this object moved at an angle from the southeast to the
Southwest turning Amil and a estimated that it was about 150 ft higher than the
nearby aroga Church Tower which itself stands about 180 ft F feet high so this
object was at an estimated elevation of about 330 ft pretty low and as it passed
overhead at one point the object tilted sharply allowing Amil and AA to get a
good view of its width and all the people in it the object then turned
towards the Northwest and moved off slowly disappearing into the distance while it was in view for about
3 minutes the Carlson had no close neighbors to call out to so they just
watched it together as it moved off and both were convinced that they had seen quote a group of tourists who they
believe were probably from another world I have to say I have not heard of a case
quite like that with the shape of a UFO very much like a boat and ETS just
looking down like tourists that does seem to be one of the explanations for ETS visiting our planet maybe they're
not NE necessarily having an agenda to intervene or do all kinds of things with
us sometimes they're here just to take a little look see and that's what apparently happened in this case hard to
say for sure because often one person's sighting is another person's onboard
experience but given that this craft looked like it was packed from front to end with about 20 different
human-looking apparently ETS I'm not so sure that they were there to pick anyone up but what an
interesting sighting that is I can only imagine what it must have been like for that
couple all right moving along here's another really fascinating case this
one's actually a series of cases this is probably the most extensive case in this little
presentation it's certainly one of my favorite because it's so unusual there's
Landing traces there's a lot of witnesses some really interesting physiological effects apparently
photographs though we didn't don't get to see them as often turns out they
apparently were covered up but I call this one Landings and humanoids at
Waynesboro Virginia this occurred over a period of two months December 21st
1964 through January 26 1965 it involves at least three major
Landings uh too which involve humanoids but really there are numerous sightings
that are connected directly to this mini wave of encounters over Waynesboro
Virginia and wow I mean this one is a doozy it's very hard to say for sure
what encounter was the first and this very interesting wave of UFO Encounters in the wesboro Virginia area but the
first to gain widespread attention occurred on December 21st
1964 along Highway 250 between Fishersville and ston to a gentleman by
the name of Horus Burns he had just driven about a quarter
mile east of the Woodrow Wilson rehab center almost right next to it when he
saw a large metallic object shaped somewhat like a beehive as he watched it moved over his
car from left to right he instantly saw it had no wings no seams no visible Port
holes this was during the day you got a very good look at it you estimated it
was about 125 ft in diameter and 80 ft high so pretty big he said the engine of
his car a 1958 Mercury station wagon instantly cut off and he rolled to a
stop quote just as if I'd run out of gas and as he watched this object descended
to the ground and landed in the field right by him and he watched in amazement
as it quote rested for 60 or 90 seconds and then according to Horus this
object rose up tilted to the side and flew off to the Northwest with a
whoosing sound at great speed he immediately restarted his car told his
wife what happened and then he contacted a UFO organization headed by Professor Ernest
ximan now this investigator did take down horse's testimony then he got the
school's gagger counter and returned to the spot where he says he measured radioactivity where the craft had La
landed and as he says in fact quote it knocked the needle off the dial so
apparently pretty strong readings here he contacted the Air Force's project
bluebuck who actually sent over sergeants Dave Moody and Harold Jones
and they said that quote the witness appeared normal he exhibited no
indications of suffering from mental disorders and in fact Sergeant Moody said quote this is an unusual sighting
it does not conform with any known aircraft and he said that they had no
explanation for what Horus Burns had seen how however this was short-lived
because they then turned around and concluded that Horus had simply hallucinated the entire
experience as sergeant Jones later wrote in his report for Project Blue Book
quote I think we need a psychiatrist here what does a person need to eat to
see a traveling beehive so they're basically just ridiculing the witness naturally both
Horus Burns and Ernest Gan disagreed and felt that the Air Force was trying to
cover up the sighting and probably they were because as it turned out there was another
witness who had seen a strange object in the same area at the same time Horus had
his sighting in fact the other Witnesses sighting was reported in the Richmond Virginia newspaper the Times Dispatch
and furthermore Ernest learned that several people in the area had reported
weird electrom magnetic disturbances including their house lights dimming and
their TVs and radios not working for several minutes finally over the next few weeks
there were more than 30 other count that 30 new reports coming in from all over
austa County which included not only Fisherville but the adjacent towns of
Dooms Verona and wesboro but events weren't over yet this
next encounter to really get a lot of attention came from a gentleman who at
first requested anonymity but his name leaked out pretty quickly we now know
him to be William Blackburn of wesboro Virginia and his encounter involved
humanoids was on January 19 1965 uh and he was chopping wood for the
fireplace at the local Augusta County Archery Club this is located just off
Route 250 near BR flats and this is only about a mile or so distant from where
Horus Burns had his encounter now it was about 5:40
p.m. when William noticed two silent metallic objects hovering over head
about 3,000 ft High he's estimating one of these objects was about 60 ft wide
and the other was much larger about 240 ft wide now William said the larger
object was conle shaped but the smaller one looked roughly saucer shaped and in
fact it had a little bubble like coua on top both he said were polished silver
metal and as he watched the smaller one landed only about 45 ft away from
him and he now saw as a pie likee section in the craft opened and out
stepped three short humanoids he said each of them were dressed in a shiny
silver jumpsuit and they started to float towards them you could now see that they
were very short about 3 feet tall pretty much human looking except he said that
they had a reddish orange skin very long fingers he noticed that they all wore
thick sold shoes but he was mostly impressed by their eyes as he said quote
they seemed to look right through you that's certainly a common quote among UFO
Witnesses but according to William these figures approach right up to him
stopping only about 12 feet away he said They carried no weapons they made no
hostile motions he said that he was quote not a brave man but when they
confronted him he froze in place and he says these little men began to talk to
him in an unintelligible language and after a few minutes of this they sort of turned
around and entered back into the craft and he was amazed because he watched this door close and saw that quote
seemed to mold itself to the ship so there were no seams or any sign of any
door after it closed after it closed the craft
immediately took off and as William says in his own words during the
confrontation the door to the object remained giving off a strange light but
the outside shell gave off no light I never saw polished metal like that in my
life I'll bet you couldn't see that thing at 5,000 ft on a clear day I
didn't used to believe in these things this thing made me a believer so this was a fairly long
encounter William estimates that the whole incident from start to finish lasted about a half hour and afterwards
recognizing the importance of what he saw he immediately wrote everything down
and actually mailed it to himself in a sealed envelope so that if anyone else reported something similar he would be
able to prove that he had seen it himself and provide confirmation of his own
encounter now he did tell his story to the newspaper on the condition that he remained Anonymous but again his name
soon became known as word of his encounter spread fast unfortunately nobody else saw the
humanoids however there were at least three separate independent reports of UFOs cited in the immediate area on that
same night and it was some period of time after his encounter that William
says that he was visited by government agents he would not say who who told him
that he was not to talk about his sighting now Richard Hall of
naikap he and other investigators said that they actually found evidence that supported Williams claims of being
silenced researchers did look into the area of the sighting and did not find
any Landing traces but they did speak with people who knew William well and
they all vouched for his honesty and integrity and after interviewing William himself researcher Richard Hall said
quote to us Blackburn seemed very honest and sincere able to express himself well
and a man of considerable practical experience and
intelligence so following this there were more sightings and it was one week
later in the early evening that another amazing en counter occurred this one
involved a group of six teenage Witnesses including 16-year-old Steve
Huffer they were driving in the same exact area along Highway
250 when they said that they saw quote what looked like a man walking now this
man was walking towards the road from the field along the highway they really didn't think anything of it until this
figure sat down alongside the the highway and began to watch the cars pass by and as they got close to him they
could now see that this figure was very short they estimated about 3 feet tall
and he was wearing a silver onepiece uniform pretty much exactly like William
Blackburn described so they had heard about the recent UFO reports so Steve and his
friends stopped the car and they immediately got out and pursued this little man and as they ran towards him
this little man jumped up and began running and they said that two other short humanoids appeared joined the
first one and all three of these little men easily outdistanced the
boys now these small figures quickly disappeared off into the distance and
step and his friends were really surprised to see that there were no visible footprints on the ground even
though it was reportedly very muddy in this area so they immediately rushed to
the police they explained that these three figures ran off at high speed as
Steve said they left us way behind now the police were skeptical but to their
credit they did send out no less than 16 officers and there was an amateur
photographer Charles Weaver who joined them and they all went to the area
together they were unable to find anything so they all left all all the officers everyone left except for Steve
Huffer and the photographer Charles Weaver Now by this time it was fully
dark but they continued to search the area and it's a good thing they did because
to their amazement They Came Upon A landed object which they said looked to
them like quote a glowing aluminum Barn both Steve and Charles began to
approach Steve just wanted to investigate but Charles wanted to get a photograph and as they walked up to this
thing suddenly some weird invisible force struck Charles injuring him and
kind of stopping him in his tracks and as Steve says quote the whole left side
of his face was blood red and his eyes Had A peculiar red
glow so this of course stopped them in their tracks both men turned around
but as they did so Charles Weaver the photographer stopped momentarily and snapped a
photograph and they both said that in the flash of the flash bulb of the camera they could see this little man
standing by the object naturally they returned to the police station the police chief tried to
write it all off as a hoax but Steve huffer's mother said that her son was an
honest and quote hardworking boy she also said that he was quote white as a
sheet after he told her what happened or as he told her so this was apparently enough for
the Air Force who reportedly showed up at the service station where Charles Weaver worked and they took him and his
camera to Washington and nothing ever was heard from him after this the story
actually does not end here and what appears to be a deliberate attempt to deun to debunk the testimony of Steve
and his friends a man by the name of Donald cash says he makes this claim he
says that the ET that the boys thought they saw was really him and he was playing a prank apparently without
knowing any details about what Steve and his friends actually saw Donald cash who
by the way is about 5' 8 in tall and weighs 190 lb says that he dressed up in
a blue jumpsuit and played this prank on the boys pretending to be an ET and he
says that it was he who was chased by Steve Huffer and his friends as he told
newspapers it shook me up I didn't know what they would do if they got their hands on me now this is absolutely
ridiculous none of uh Donald Cash's claims come anywhere close to matching
what the boys said they saw despite this several newspapers picked up the story
and printed the prank explanation now researcher Jerome Clark
calls this an attempt to quote discredit the story and he says quote one wonders
at the gal ability of the news media which treated Cash's confession quite
seriously despite the Fantastic incongruities between his claims of
Huffer and photographer Charles Weaver as we shall see practically every detail
of the latter report contradicts Cash's peculiar account I told you that's an
amazing series of events and I think probably there's a lot more to it than
was presented here given that this wave the publicity for it rather was shut
down pretty hard by what appears to be the Air Force and the government
stepping in to debunk sightings and threatened Witnesses perhaps there's not
direct evidence of this but given that the photographer we never heard from
him uh looks like that this was pretty
effectively covered up thankfully we do know about it it's an important series
of sightings and it just goes to show how one sighting that gets publicity
inspires other people to come forth so this could be happening a lot more than
we realize we just don't hear about it it's truly unfortunate most people do
not report their sightings this coverup has been that effective it's one of the reasons I do this research I'm not
taking it anymore I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore people need to know the truth so that's why I
do this research certainly that's one of the primary reasons that and it's just so darn fascinating which brings me to
our next case this one is what we would Define as a simple UFO sighting but I
don't think it's that simple I call this one a 13 Mile UFO chase this occurred on
January 5 1971 near Windsor
Australia and it's an amazing and truly dramatic encounter as I'm sure you know UFOs do
seem to have a pench hint for chasing cars down lonely highways at night
and that is what is happening here the question is why why are they doing this
well let's just take a look at this case and perhaps we can come up with some motivations for this I'm not sure now
who doesn't like a good UFO car chase story because there are so many and
here's another was around 1 p.m. again on January 5
1971 as 37-year-old John clucas drove to his home home located in Windsor New
South Wales Australia he had just passed the town of penrith and at about 13 miles until he
reached his home in Windsor when it happened a bright light zoomed down from the sky and began to follow his car and
as John says in his own words it came up very quickly and I soon saw it was much
bigger than any car light when I slowed down it would not pass me when I speed
up would catch up in a flash now this object wasn't huge he says it was pretty
small maybe about 3 feet in diameter though he couldn't be sure but for the
next 13 miles he says this object chased his car down the highway it would
sometimes hang back about a quarter mile behind him then Zoom forward until it was only a few feet from his back bumper
literally tailgating him he says that no matter what he did slow down or speed up
he could not shake this UFO and it was bright as John says quote the light
illuminated the whole inside of my car and blinded me when I looked in the rearview
mirror so finally upon almost reaching Windsor Jon stopped his car and remained
there ready to confront this strange alien visitor only then did this object
suddenly Zoom away now John at first remained quiet about his encounter but after hearing about a couple in Perth
who had had a similar experience on a lonely Highway he decided to share his incor with reporters and again it's just
one of countless examples of UFOs exhibiting this strange behavior of chasing cars down lonely roads late at
night so there you go another one of what must be hundreds of cases in which
UFOs CH Chase cars down lonely highways usually at night so what's going on here
why do they do that I can only speculate but I suspect it's just a way of letting
people know in une in an unequivocal way that they are real that UFOs are real I
don't know it's very strange it's a very much type of encounter that I would call a display where they want themselves to
be seen because there's simply no mistaking it when a UFO is tailgating
you down the highway really just a few feet off your bumper and then darting away and zooming back up I mean that's
dramatic for sure all right now we move to another case which I had to include because it
is beyond bizarre and I call this one the UFO that sucked yeah you heard me
right the UFO that sucked this one occurred in the summer of
1973 in England and was investigated by a British UFO researcher it appears to
be totally legitimate although really unusual unique even and involves not
just one or two events but quite a number of them involving this UFO that was sucking stuff up into the air across
the countryside I think you'll find it quite interesting and bizarre this very
bizarre case was investigated by the British UFO research organization
buor but primarily by one of their members by the name of Derek James and
it involves a series of truly bizarre events connected to an apparent UFO the first report come came from a
group of people who pulled off the road near jrell bank again in England it was
midafternoon on a sunny summer day 1973 all of the witnesses said that they
observed this black sort of indistinct object which was hovering at a low
elevation about 750 ft up in the air now that alone was strange enough but what
really Drew everyone's attention was that a column of straw was being sucked
up into the air directly beneath the object from a field and it was doubly
odd because they could see no sign of any wind the air was still in fact one
of the witnesses actually exited his car and stood in the center of the field
with the straw straw Rising all around him but still he felt no
win now reportedly there were photographs taken but researchers have
not been able to obtain them and if this was an isolated report it would be
interesting enough but it's not because as buor investigators soon Learned was
just one of many weird events that occurred on this same day it turned out
earlier that day a lady at Cheshire Plains this is about seven miles to the
West she had gone outside and seen a goodye Airship pass overhead and was
still looking at the sky when a few miles behind it she saw a quote funny
black cloud and she said that hovering above this black cloud was a quote
brilliant star and it was strange because it kept blinking in and out
and she watched it and she says it was actually sailing against the breeze towards the
southeast and the next report this is so weird came from a train driver at
kidlington who told researchers that as he sat in the cab of his train he
watched a very heavy sack of coal suddenly take off upwards and travel
straight beside him so something is making this this bag of coal levitate
that cannot be a whirlwind or anything any rate the next Witnesses include
residents of the town chel in Stoke on Trent and they watched as a field of hay
was sucked up into the air and actually dumped one mile away in
bam and numerous people in between these two towns saw not only the hay but all
kinds of items being sucked up apparently into this same strange black
cloud all of the witnesses several of who were interviewed on radio and television said the strangest thing
about it is that again there was no wind now before I never really published
anything on this case and it later appeared only in the publication North
UFO news I have to say I don't know what's going on with that case again it
does appear to be totally legitimate but it's so bizarre I don't know one thing I
do feel for sure is that this wasn't a whirlwind as was put forth by
skeptical uh people who tried to explain this away because
certainly all the witnesses said that they felt no wind so it seemed to be some other force that was pulling these
objects up into the air and as of course I'm sure you know UFOs do have that
ability to levitate people animals and all kinds of things up into them so that appears
to be what's going on here perhaps it's another example of a display whatever the explanation it's a
really unusual unique case that I think deserves to be well known which is why I
included it in this little presentation and now we move to the next case I call this one the UFO made her
cry it occurred on October 13 1977 in a remote area known as Wetzel
County this is in Virginia what's interesting about this case for me
certainly is that people often do have a really strong emotional reaction to a
UFO encounter and this is absolutely true in this case though her reaction even
surprised the witness herself this very poignant case comes from researcher gray
Barker and it occurred in a very remote area of wetel County West Virginia it
was around 8:30 p.m. on October 13 1977 that Mary Arnette and her sister
Shelby low were driving home along the forested country one lane Mo Road in the
back seat of the car were their two friends Pam and Teresa hot also sisters
and I'll just quote Mary directly as she said says suddenly my eyes seemed to be
drawn Upward at the sky where I saw a brilliant object the oddest part was my
emotional reaction immediately tears started rolling down my cheeks as if I
didn't have control over my own crying maybe it could have been the light from the thing only it didn't seem
to be all that brilliant so this really perplexed herself and Mary who was driving slammed
on the breaks she yelled for the others to look and all four Witnesses watched
this classic Flying Saucer Glide smoothly overhead at low level they
described it as a silver disc with a dome on top they could see an antenna
protruding from the top of the Dome the bottom of the disc they said had three little Landing legs and they said the
craft had two flashing lights one red and one blue though the entire craft
itself also glowed with light they really weren't sure how big it was or
exactly how high but they said it appeared quote about as big as an
airliner and it did seem quite low in fact as they watched this subject tilted
downward and descended in a smooth gliding motion right over the Treetops
of a nearby mountain and they actually thought it was about to land and this quite frightened all of them and it was
Mary who was driving she decided that it was best that they just drive away as
Mary says we had just started the car and driven a few hundred feet when my
sister screamed oh my god look back so Mary and the others all looked back and
as she says quote the woods on the mountain were lighted up like a football
stadium now that was enough for all of them they fled the scene afterwards Mary
dropped off Pam and Teresa and they returned home with Shelby so they did
tell their family what happened uh who were quite skeptical as it turns out and the sisters wanted to return the next
day and climb the mountain where they had seen this UFO to investigate but
nobody in their family would accompany them so they didn't go and as Mary says
I suppose the reason we didn't ever investigate was that all of us were just two chicken that fascinating case for
sure daylight sighting multiple Witnesses very close up and of course
the strange emotional reaction I think when somebody sees something that
appears suddenly and is completely out of their world viiew it's no surprise
that you might react in very strange and strong emotional ways so yeah while it
did frighten them she also had that really interesting reaction of just suddenly
weeping uh it's a big deal when you have something that suddenly confronts you
that changes the way you think about everything so I suspect that's what was going on there but yeah an absolutely
interesting case as is this next one I think I call this one a box shaped UFO
with humanoids I love this case because the witness seems to be such a sincere sweet
innocent and intelligent child and while she is the only witness she described it
in such vivid detail that the W the investigators were certainly convinced
it's an absolute genuine encounter it occurred in November
1978 at West Bank British Colombia in Canada of course this is very near Lake
Okanagan the location of many other encounters and coincidentally a lake
monster Ogo Pogo who is quite well known not saying there's any connection there
but I do find it interesting and yeah this is a fascinating encounter involving humanoids this case was
investigated by researcher Bill Allen and it was about 6 a.m on November in
November of 1978 and the main witness is Don Smith pictured here she's a Plucky independent
9-year-old girl and she laid down in bed because as it turns out her mother had
just left for work and Don was hoping to get a little more sleep but she didn't
not this morning instead something very strange outside her window caught her
attention and I'll just quote Dawn directly as she says I saw a big light in the sky and a
little one moving up and down the big light was like a shoe box it had green
lights down one side the other light was white and and it was swaying as it went
up and down it stopped for a while and then it went up and down again then The
Shoe Box opened a door like a garage door and This little light went inside
the door closed and the shoebox went behind a raincloud but I could still see it because the cloud only half covered
it now she says this object appeared box shaped was quite large she says about
half the apparent size of a full moon it had green lights on one side and the
other was outlined with what looked like red lights she was looking up at it from a 45 degree angle and was amazed to see
two dark figures humanoids standing like quote guards at each side of the
door now she didn't get a real good look at him but they looked human and as Don says quote I was scared because I didn't
know what the thing was I thought it was going to come down and get me it was halfway down to my house and I thought
it was looking at me now she does say that the interior of this object was lit
with a dim light and although she couldn't see much detail she believed
that these figures were wearing dark uniforms but the encounter wasn't over
yet because as she watched and this object came out of the cloud again and
it did something that absolutely amazed Dawn as Don said says again in our own
words it came back out and opened the door again and a flying saucer came
out when it went in it was just a little round light and when it came out it was
like a flying saucer with lights going around it they were red and yellow and orange it had a little hook on top
perhaps a little Dome either way these little lights were revolving around the
rim of the saucer or the craft itself was spinning Dawn really wasn't sure
which but seeing this saucer emerge her curiosity overcame her fear and she
rushed to the window to get a better look but at this point the saucer was suddenly nowhere to be seen as Don says
was getting light and the lights were gone she did immediately call her friend Sandy and told her what happened
researchers confirmed this they spoke with Sandy as well as Don and Sandy confirmed that Don had in fact called
her and sounded very frightened by her experience UFOs do seem to come in all
shapes and sizes and I think a lot of that is probably due to perspective
perhaps misperception overlaying of our own belief systems or you know not great
observation I don't know it's very hard to say because this witness said it was
very close right over the house below the Cloud layer she got a very good look
at it and what's also interesting is one UFO came out of this other one so that
is something we do hear fairly often but yeah a super interesting case of a UFO
with humanoids and here's another there's always another case uh so any Skeptics
who say ah there's nothing to this I me you're just dead wrong there are far too
many cases to explain away as misperceptions or hoaxes or
hallucinations as our governments would have us think it always surprises me when people are so skeptical because
really they're just victims of the UFO coverup we' have been made to think that way when really there's every reason in
the world to believe that these encounters are happening because again a lot of them do have evidence a lot of
them have multiple Witnesses and this next case has some really interesting
Landing Trace cases I call this next case the odense landing and humanoids
this is one of my favorite in the bunch just because it's so unusual the witness
was able to walk right up to this UFO saw the humanoids very close up and this
one was professionally investigated as well there's a lot to it it is somewhat
brief in terms of the information we have but I think you'll find it quite interesting it occurred on July 16
1982 just outside of the small town of odense Denmark and yeah it's quite a case it
was around 4:45 a.m. again on July 16 1982 as a 15-year-old young man who has
insisted upon anonymity he was employed at a local gardening company and he was
bicycling to work from the town of odense to bro
along the soo Road and he says coming out of the woods
coming around the corner he noticed a bright light about 150 ft away in the
field to his right so immediately thought this this was unusual so he got
off his bike and walked partway into the field to investigate and to his absolute
astonishment He Came Upon a classic Flying Saucer landed on the ground
and he estimates it was about 6 feet wide maybe six feet high it glowed
bright white and had no markings at all except for this doorway on one side and
no sooner did he see this object when he immediately noticed Five Short humanoids
standing nearby about 30 to 45 ft away
he said they were not human they were only 3 ft tall they had big bald heads
Long Point Ed ears broad chests but very narrow hips and very short legs now the
grass in this field was growing thickly and it looked to the witness that four of these humanoids were walking quote on
top of the grass you could see that they were apparently taking soil samples and
putting them in these small bags that They Carried now the fifth humanoid he
stood apart and he appeared to be supervising or standing guard over the
others this was the witness's impression but it was this fifth humanoid who
suddenly noticed the witness approaching Now by this time he's about 6 feet away
from the object itself and this apparently alarmed these
ETS because instantly they all rushed into the craft which took off with a
loud whoosing sound which the witness had almost sounded like growling but at
this point they entered the object the door closed the object flared up and a
brilliant light that was so bright it forced the witness to Shield his eyes with his hands and then this object flew
off over the electric wires towards the town of odense now looking at where the saucer
had rested on the ground the witness saw that the grass was depressed and perhaps even a little bit
darkened he immediately finished this 15 M bike ride to the town of broby where
he worked and told his boss what he had seen unfortunately his boss was
skeptical and said he must have been dreaming dreamt the whole thing naturally this upset the witness
and fearing ridicule from others he initially told nobody else until a few
months later after he attended a UFO lecture now he did tell his parents who
absolutely believed their son as they knew he was not the kind of person who fantasized but after going to this UFO
lecture the witness did file a report with the
sfoi the Scandinavian UFO research information organization and he was put
in touch with investigator in h Swain nowain and other researchers
interviewed the witness and they found him to be credible and trustworthy uh
the witness did not want to give the name of his employer that was the only thing that puzzled the investigators but
the witness insisted at any rate they did examine the landing spot which showed no evidence of crushed grass or
anything like this though that's probably because several months had elapsed since the investigators were
able to get onto the scene seems pretty clear to me that in that case the
witness just happened to be in the right place at the right time time given that it was so so early early in the morning
the ETS probably weren't expecting anybody to be around but there was the witness driving right up to them on his
bike an amazing case and here's another Super interesting case which actually
comes from a scientist so a credible witness for sure and I call this one the Badlands
UFO this is a really interesting Encounter of a landing in a remote area
very close-up encounter with humanoids and apparently photographic evidence
though as often happens in these cases we just don't get to see the photographs
it's so frustrating but what are you going to do I think it is a legitimate case given
that the witness is so credible this one occurred in February 1983 in Barber County this this is in
South Kansas and as you'll see it's a really unusual encounter this last and
final case comes from researcher Aon Milan and it first appeared in Timothy
Green beckley's publication UFO review the sole witness to this event is
an independent petroleum geologist by the name of Tom briol and at the time he
was working for an outof State oil field development company to explore the Badlands area of South Kansas this is
west of Medicine Lodge it's a remote plane but crisscross with gullies it's
largely flat but has these you know steep gullies in it and it's very much inaccessible to vehicles and really
unusable for farming or grazing certainly at that time it was not easily
accessible so it was a cold Misty night again February 1983
as Tom was in this area getting ready for bed and he climbed into his tent and
I'll just quote the main witness Tom directly as he says it gets dark early
out there at this time of year I fired up my Coleman lantern and worked on the day's reports for a couple of hours then
I crawled into my sleeping bag at probably 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. there's just
nothing else to do out there so you sleep there was not a sound of any kind
outside the tent the drizzle had been falling steadily since midm morning and
now the entire landscape was cloaked in Fairly heavy fog as well you could look
outside and see absolutely nothing was spooky and to tell you the truth I felt
just a little bit uneasy now he eventually did fall asleep but in the middle of the night something
woke him up as Tom says I had the strangest Sensation that someone was
watching me was still eily quiet outside but as the sensation of being watched
grew Tom doused his Coleman lantern opened the tent looked outside and got a
huge shock because coming from the East he saw a strange glow penetrating
through the fog and trees and along with it he could hear a low humming noise so
again I will just quote Tom directly as he says I probably sat crouched in the
doorway 5 minutes or so I'm not really sure why but I threw the camera strap
over my neck before I ventured outside I must have gone about a quarter of a mile
or so the light and sound kept getting stronger suddenly I came to the edge of
a sheer drop off and there it was maybe 100 feet away down inside this rather
large gulie was a huge round apparatus with orange lights pulsating first
bright then then Dim All Around the circumference the sound was much louder
by this time and I could feel the soft Bank vibrating beneath me I was scared
but I was fascinated almost hypnotized at the same time my first impulse was to
run away but I couldn't I just couldn't turn my back on such a phenomenon as
this the low vibrations seemed so soothing and peaceful I can't explain it
so Tom estimates that this craft was quite large about 50 ft in diameter
maybe 10 ft tall in the center and tapering off towards the edges but was definitely saucer-shaped and he had his
camera with him so he opened it up this was a Polaroid
sx70 and he snapped a picture now this kind of camera is a pretty loud camera
and he says that in the silence it seemed to make a lot of noise and he was
about to take another pict picture and this was when he noticed two glowing blue forms in the camera's
viewfinder and as he says in his own words they were solid objects because they blocked out the lights on the craft
behind them they were roughly the size of 10-year-old kids I don't know whether
they were alien beings in space suits or robots or local farmers playing weird
costume games or what but I went ahead and snapped the picture anyhow
so he's clearly puzzled as to what these figures were and he says that as soon as
he snapped the figures he felt his body being hurled down the side of the ditch and as Tom
says I don't know whether I got scared and fell or whether the wet Bank just
gave way at that moment or whether someone or something made me fall I
don't know whether I hit my head and knocked myself out during the fall or whether some Force caused me to lose
Consciousness all he knows is that the next thing he knew he was awaking up out
of asleep and it was now beginning to get light so he's really not sure how long he was unconscious but he was happy
to see that he had sustained no serious injuries by this time there was no sign
of any object no humanoids nor were there any Landing traces that he could
see he says that there were no other After Effects other than the shock of the encounter itself as Tom says I can
almost convince myself that it never happened except for the pictures unfortunately what the pictures
show Tom doesn't say the researcher did not provide any other details and Tom
apparently has provided no further interviews about his experience so
that's where it remains hopefully the photographs will one day surface I
honestly don't think so most of these cases they're reported if at all and
then this kind of slip Into Obscurity it's one of the reasons I do this research just to record all of this for
posterity so people know that encounters are happening all over the world and
this case is a good example I also find it interesting that this UFO is landing
in an area which has some very interesting geological features
in fact that's why the witness was there I also find it interesting because the witness describes the Oz factor that we
often hear about with an eerie silence and he had the distinct sensation
someone was looking at him or watching over the area which is what Drew him out of his tent so yeah a lot of interesting
features to that case which tell us a lot about the UFO phenomena and frankly
ourselves our ability to sense these things so an interesting case I think all
around that's it for today 10 cases from all over the world stretching a number
of decades cases with multiple Witnesses cases with all different types of ETS
cases with all different types of evidence and just super
interesting we still have so much to learn about UFOs ETS and ourselves and
these kinds of cases really provide us an opportunity to think outside the box
to consider new paradigms to really expand our world view and they are a
strong reminder that we are not alone that we are just
one uh one people here on this planet when there are many other people out
there people very much like us more alike us I think than different so that's it for today I want
to thank you guys once again for watching I truly appreciate it it's because of you I do these presentations
so I truly hope you've enjoyed it thank you thank you thank you until next time
keep searching for the truth keep asking those hard questions and most important
of all keep having fun I know I am till next time. bye!
