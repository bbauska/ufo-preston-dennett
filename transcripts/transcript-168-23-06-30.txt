Saved by aliens! Helped, healed, rescued, there are many cases on record where ETs have intervened to help those in need. While a close encounter can be scary, it can also be a Godsend to those who are in trouble. This video presents a dozen cases in which UFOs and extraterrestrials showed up just in time. These include sightings, face-to-face encounters, landings and onboard UFO experiences. The cases reach back decades. They come from all over the world and have occurred to many all kinds of people. With all the fear and confusion surrounding ET contact, these cases are profoundly important and show that some ETs do have our best interests in mind.

SEP 27, 1959: COOS BAY, OR. Leo Bartsch had been suffering from an undiagnosed problem with his arm, causing pain and numbness. Then, in the middle of the night, he found himself floating above his bed, and sensed that a UFO was over his house. Moments later, he was lowered to his bed, and realized to his delight, that his arm was healed!

1960s: TN. The head of Project Blue Book, Edward Ruppelt reveals that the Blue Book office received a letter from a mountaineer in TN who says that a strange round glowing object came into his living room and healed him of chronic arthritis.

APR 1971: VA. In a letter to NICAP, a prisoner in the Southern Correction Facility in Lucasville, OH related an amazing story of how a UFO may have helped him. The man was being chased by the police when a UFO dropped down from the sky and hovered 150 feet over his head. The prisoner felt a telepathic rapport with the UFO and had a sense of being watched. Then the UFO began to follow him.

SEP 22, 1972: DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. While driving along a remote highway, Virgilio Gomez was flagged down by a gentleman. Exiting his car, he was shocked to see two other tall, strange-looking figures, and behind them along the road, a landed UFO. The man who flagged Virgilio down said his name was Freddie Miller, and that he had been lost at sea 13 years earlier, but was rescued by the ETs.

1979: SOUTH VIETNAM. A soldier and his fellow soldiers had become separated from their main unit and pinned down by a group of Vietcong soldiers. They had given up any chance of getting back to their unit when, without warning, a massive blue saucer hovered over the Vietcong soldiers, causing them to scatter.

1980: THE CARIBBEAN. French singer, Antoine, had moored his boat on a small island. Waking up in the middle of the night, Antoine was horrified to find that his anchor had broken loose, and he was now at the mercy of the waves. He was lost and heading for a coral reef. That’s when a UFO appeared right over his boat, grabbed ahold it with a strange force and pulled it to safety.

APR 10, 1982: COOKE CITY, MT. Snowmobiling in the mountains, Mr. H. was overcome by a blizzard. Looking up, he saw a bright blue sphere overhead. Unable to hear it over the storm, he thought it was a rescue helicopter, especially when it began to lead him out of the wilderness. Instead, it led him to a group of snowmobilers who were lost and needed help.

APR 1983: ALICE SPRINGS, AUSTRALIA. Maggie Hite (age 73) had suffered from arthritis for years when a UFO landed in her backyard. Out stepped short humanoids who escorted her onto their craft and healed her. Her physician was shocked to find her totally healthy.

AUG 1985, MILBANKE SOUND, BC, CANADA. Randy Morrison and Leonard Egolf were sailing in the ocean and got caught in a fierce storm which capsized their boat. They clung to the hull until the waves threw them into the sea. Leonard was never seen again. Randy was on the verge of giving up when a glowing object appeared overhead, giving him encouragement to hang on a little longer.

DEC 1988: WATSONVILLE, CA. When Ann Desoto and her boyfriend encountered a landed UFO, they didn’t realize that they had missing time until they returned home. But Ann did notice a strange mark on her hip. And strangely, the arthritis in her hip had disappeared. Later, under hypnosis, she recalled an onboard experience where she was healed by the grays.

OCT 1989: USA. Retired military officer Dolores Galvin was shocked to see a tall dark figure enter her bedroom and lean over her bed. In his hand he held a strange silver pencil-shaped object, which he applied to her arthritic shoulder. Dolores felt a floating sensation and then passed out. When she awoke, her arthritis was gone.

SEP 27, 1993: CORDILLERA TAJSARA, BOLIVIA. Lost in the mountainous wilderness, hiker Robert Suarez Molina thought he was a goner. Little did he know, rescuers were searching for him and kept seeing unexplained lights. Then Robert himself saw a UFO land. A humanoid exited the craft and let him know he was about to be rescued.

These cases reveal a friendly side to the ETs that is often overlooked and ignored. But the cases speak for themselves. The proof is in the pudding. People do have benevolent encounters.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
I call this episode, "Saved by Aliens: 12 Benevolent Encounters". Now I know there's a lot of fear and 
confusion surrounding this subject. Some people do have very scary encounters they don't like it 
but having researched this field for many years I really don't think ETS are here to hurt us scare 
us or take over our planet or anything like that in fact I think the first-hand cases show 
the opposite that they're here to help heal guide teach wake us all up and these cases 
I think really illustrate that very well I've got 12 cases I'd like to present to you today 
these come from all over the world they reach back to the 1950s all the way up to the 1990s 
we're occurring to both men and women some of these involve multiple Witnesses and these 
are not just sightings they're sightings they're face-to-face encounters their Landings and in at 
least one case an onboard experience so really I think these cases have some very important 
insights into what it is like to have ET contact and that's really why I wanted to present these 
cases to you today because I think they reflect the truth of what it's like to have contact with 
ETS I mean some of these Witnesses were quite scared especially initially during their encounter 
until they realized the ETS were not there to hurt them in any way they were in fact there 
to heal them help them save them it's amazing that many different ways ETS are intervening 
they're leading people out of the wilderness they're saving them during a war-torn situation 
they are healing them of very serious illnesses and helping them in a wide variety of ways as 
we shall see so I've got a lot of cases I want to present to you today so let's just 
get started the first case I'd like to cover occurred in April of 1971 in Northern Virginia 
this is a pretty unusual case because it this comes from a gentleman who is actually 
being held in prison in the southern Correction Facility in Lucasville Ohio 
he wrote a letter to nightcap that's the national investigative committee on aerial phenomenon 
and he had a very interesting story of how a UFO may have helped him elude the police 
or so he believes and I'll just quote him directly because it's a pretty interesting testimony 
as this Anonymous prisoner says and I quote I was a fugitive from the law and had just eluded 
the police after a lengthy Chase after running through the woods for a short period I stopped 
and looked back down the way I had come to ascertain if any police were on my trail 
far in the distance five or more miles away I spotted a light flashing in the sky 
at that time I assumed it was the police spotlights against the clouds seeing no immediate 
danger I squatted down to rest and figure my next move within seconds I had a feeling that I 
was being watched I glanced upward and in the air approximately 150 to 200 feet directly overhead 
I could see a motionless thing whose shape was rectangular and approximately 20 by 80 feet so 
that's quite low he's seeing this UFO right over him after just a moment ago is off in the distance 
and I'll just continue with his testimony as he says it was just a motionless featureless 
rectangular object it appeared that I was viewing the underbelly of the object and at no other time 
was I able to see the sides or top at first sight I was scared into jumping up as I thought it might 
be the police just to be on the safe side I took off running again thinking it might be some type 
of tracking device the police were using I kept one eye upward and the object immediately moved as 
I did staying directly overhead so at this point it's actually following him it's clear there's 
some sort of communication going on because as the witness says I did have the distinct feeling 
and impression that someone was watching me the full distance that I ran was more than 10 miles 
total and during that time it was in a wooded area Fields And across a shallow body of water 
towards the end of my journey as I was thinking of stopping and resting the object suddenly 
seemed to swell and in less than two seconds had completely disappeared its root appeared 
to be straight up but my impression was not of it going up but of it dwindling away sort of 
an implosion rather than a going out needless to say I did elude the police and did make my getaway 
now was this help from an ET The Prisoner says he isn't sure but as he says is it possible that 
whoever was in it if anyone was knew that I was a fugitive and didn't want to give my location away 
what I am getting at is the possibility of telepathic interference to this day I am constantly wondering what the object was and why it hung over me that way 
so yeah maybe it was guiding him or maybe perhaps it was helping the police 
either way it appears it may have been helping someone I don't know it's an interesting case 
either way you look at it but now the prisoner is in fact in custody so I guess he has plenty of 
time to wonder about what happened this next case occurred on September 22nd 1972 in the Dominican 
Republic and it comes from researcher writer Sebastian Roble and it's printed in his book 
UFO Manifesto it's a really unusual case that God of a lot got a lot of attention 
and the main witness is virgilio Gomez he was driving down the highway near La Granja in the 
Dominican Republic we saw a figure by the side of the road who was flagging him down 
so he comes to a stop and this man walks up to him and introduces himself as Freddie Miller 
now Freddie Miller is a gentleman who disappeared at Sea 15 years earlier was a quite well-known 
accident at Sea Freddie Miller had been sailing on May 5th 1959 from Santo Domingo he was on his way 
to Boca Chica when the boat disappeared and no one ever knew what happened to him and these two other 
guys so here is this guy Freddie Miller saying that this is him the man who'd been lost at sea 
and he told virgilio Gomez that he had been rescued from drowning by an alien craft or quote 
what you call a UFO he said I was rescued by those two persons over there because of my knowledge of 
radio technology and my intelligence so virgilio Gomez looks over there and sees two other very 
strange figures and of course a landed UFO and when he first saw this he hesitated to get any 
closer because as he says I thought it's prudent to avoid it but as I approached I realized that 
the man was dressed entirely in green and had two more standing five or six feet away from the first 
thinking it might be a military checkpoint or accident I decided to slow down gently I stopped 
10 meters from the first person and I kept the engine running so he had a short conversation 
with allegedly Freddie Miller and these other ETS he says were very tall more than six feet in 
height slender with short brown hair and yellowish skin basically human looking but quite different 
but Freddie Miller and the other ETS were all dressed the same in a gray form-fitting uniform 
and this UFO this craft was egg-shaped and sat there in the background 
and seeing all this virgilio of course became understandably concerned he held a very short 
conversation with this alleged uh Survivor Freddie Miller before the man uh bit him farewell 
and departed with his alien friends back into the UFO which took off so this is the story 
that virgilio Gomez shared with Sebastian robiu in his book UFO Manifesto it's quite an unusual 
story if true it's pretty amazing because Freddie Miller was a very well-known person 
but yeah it's a pretty interesting case apparently of someone who is rescued at sea 
by ETS this next case occurred sometime in 1979 and the location of this case is very interesting 
it's in South Vietnam during the Vietnam war now this case was reported to apro the aerial 
phenomenon research organization headed by Jim in Coral Lorenzen and they received a letter from a 
young soldier who had an incredible story of a UFO rescue according to this Soldier and they do 
have his name but did not print it the soldier was with a few other soldiers and they had all 
become separated from their main unit and were pinned down by a large number of Vietcong soldiers 
they had all given up on any chance of getting back to the unit when suddenly the area was 
illuminated by a bright blue saucer-shaped object which came out of the shallow Valley separating 
the soldiers from the Viet Cong now this saucer hovered just a few feet above the top of the hill 
and apparently scared the Viet Cong badly enough that they ran screaming in the other direction 
now after they had run away the soldiers were in fact able to make their way to their unit 
but they didn't report the sighting to their superiors out of fear of being disbelieved they 
absolutely believe this saucer showed up to rescue them and allow them to get back to their unit 
and Carl Lorenzen found this case quite impressive as she writes and I quote because of the fact that 
the principal witness is not in touch with his former comrades we have not been able to check 
and verify his story however because of the way it is written and other information given 
he does not want to be identified we tend to believe that the incident did indeed take place 
the foregoing appears to illustrate that at least in two cases one which I'm going to quote later on 
in this presentation the UFOs decided to intervene in situations which would otherwise have meant 
certain death for some of those involved it's a very unusual case now here is another case 
which I'm pretty sure you haven't heard of it was absolutely a surprise to me this occurred in 1980 
in the Caribbean and the main witness is super famous as it turns out he is known as Antoine 
he's a famous French singer his full name is Pierre Antoine Yura chioli and yeah he's a famous 
French singer that says a UFO saved his life in 1980 when he was boating in the Caribbean islands 
now he's an accomplished sailor he sailed more than 17 000 miles solo all across the world in 
his 42-foot steel Schooner he calls om now this very incident this really interesting incident 
took place when he had anchored his sailboat in a creek on a small island in the Caribbean 
and he was just sleeping quietly in his boat when around 2 A.M he awoke suddenly to find 
that the anchor to his boat had broken off and he was now drifting at the mercy of the waves 
in the ocean itself and even worse he was heading for a coral reef which he knew could shatter his 
boat as any boater knows coral reefs are very dangerous so at this point he was lost he had 
no idea where he was when suddenly he says a big yellow light appeared above the Mast of his craft 
and it moved along with him he says almost as if it was connected by an invisible chain or rope 
and to his amazement he felt the glowing sphere start to actually draw his boat away from The Reef 
to a shelter that was protected from the winds and currents allowing him to Anchor It securely 
so it's actually moving his vote that's really remarkable now before becoming a super successful singer Antoine was actually a scientist he 
had immersed himself in scientific studies at the well-known acole sontrol in France 
so after this encounter it changed his whole outlook on life as he says a UFO saved my life 
following this incident he began to read all the UFO books he could find he bought a really good 
camera in hopes that on his next boating trip he would again encounter this strange UFO which 
he believes saved his life and he really wants to capture a photograph of it as far as I know 
he hasn't yet but yeah what an interesting case involving a French singer by the name of Antoine 
this next case is one of my favorite in this compilation it occurred on April 10 1982 in cook 
City Montana the main witness is called Mr h he has requested anonymity because he is quite well 
known in cook City he is a World War II veteran pilot and on April 10 1982 he was attending a 
snowmobile Festival in Cook County this is at the northeastern corner of Yellowstone Park again in 
Montana and actually cook city is rated as one of the best places in the entire United States for 
snowmobiling it's also rated one of the snowiest locations in all of Montana which is saying 
something because that's a very snowy state but it is also one of the most dangerous there have 
been quite a few snowmobile accidents in this area fatal ones so I think that makes this story even 
all the more interesting it was around 11 A.M on April 10 1982 when Mr H arrived at Cook City he 
unloaded his snowmobile and enjoyed a long day of snowmobiling he's quite practiced at it and it was 
around today's end he was crossing Saint Joseph's pass when he encountered a sudden raging blizzard 
and it was so thick such a furious blizzard that it was pretty much a total whiteout 
but he knew the area well and he was heading home when he noticed a strange blue light in the sky 
above him just peeking through the blizzard now he first assumed this was a rescue helicopter and he 
began following it the light moved very slowly sometimes even more slowly than his snowmobile 
normally he would have guided himself home by following the long Willow rods that are set 
into the snow so that the spring cleanup crews are able to discern the location of the roads 
but assuming that this light above him was in fact a rescue vehicle which apparently it 
was human or not as we shall see he depended on it to lead him in the right direction now 
he heard no sound coming from it but this didn't really concern him at first because the blizzard 
itself was so Fierce it was pretty much strong enough to blot out any sounds of a helicopter 
so after some minutes of traveling and following this amazing blue light he could just make out 
a large Granite outcropping ahead of him he recognized it he knew where it was but 
next to it he saw the outline of a couple of snowmobilers and when he reached it he 
discovered two men and one woman taking Shelter by the outcropping and they were 
in trouble particularly the woman she had a space blanket wrapped around her and the two men were 
walking around it was clear to the witness Mr H that the woman was on the verge of hypothermia 
so he talked to them he learned that the woman's name was Janet one of the men was named Paul and 
they told Mr H that all three of them were from nearby Billings Montana and they'd come to the 
snowmobile Festival to go snowmobiling and were quote just playing around in their snowmobiles 
and this is when they were struck by this raging blizzard and they had become lost and in trouble 
now Mr H told them not to worry that the rescue helicopter above them would lead 
them out but looking up he saw that this strange blue light was now gone but luckily he recognized 
this Granite outcropping he knew the way home so he guided them back to cook City 
and he decided to do some investigation and I'm glad he did because he learned some interesting information the next day he reported the incident to law enforcement and that's when he learned that 
there had been no rescue helicopter sent out and it became clear to him that this object was 
probably a UFO so the case was sent to apro the aerial phenomena research organization 
and coral Lorenzen heard about this case and as she says to date it appears that Mr 
H was dealing with an unknown or seems to have guided him to the stranded Trio and then left 
it has been established that there definitely were no aircraft of any kind in the area that night 
no conventional aircraft that is it's a great case of a UFO leading people 
to safety here is another case that I really love it's just so darn interesting and really 
encouraging kind of poignant it occurred in April of 1983 in Alice Springs Australia 
the main witness is 73 year old Maggie height who you can see here she suffered for 40 years 4-0 
from arthritis and was hobbling from her house in April of 1983 to her Woodshed when she noticed in 
all enveloping strange silence settling over the area and as Maggie says in her own words 
then I noticed that two of the funniest looking little men I ever saw were walking towards me 
they were about the size of Aborigines but that was the only resemblance 
these little people were wearing metallic suits that looked like they were painted on their bodies 
there was no hair on their heads their eyes looked like goggles 
now the beings didn't talk verbally to her but Maggie says she did get the mental impression 
that she was supposed to follow them which she did and as she says I don't remember leaving I can 
just recall lying on an operating table and these little Fellers were all around me sticking wires 
on my arms and legs lights were flashing and there was a throbbing sound like something Electric 
I looked around and I realized I was in some kind of flying saucer 
now the next that's all she really recalls the next thing Maggie knew she was waking up on the 
steps of her home kind of lying down there which quite alarmed her as she says I ran inside the 
house and I locked the door and that's when I realized I hadn't moved that way in 40 years 
so they had cured her of her arthritis she told her neighbors and they didn't believe her at first but they decided to look around and then they found proof that even Maggie height 
herself hadn't noticed as Maggie says I could tell that they thought I had been spending too 
much time alone and was going a little balmy but just to humor me they walked around for 
some distance in the back of my shed and what do you think they found there was a large circular 
area where all the dirt and rocks had been blown away and a couple of little bits of scrub brush 
brush that was growing back there was all burned and scorched then there was these strange hulls 
scooped out of the Rock and Sand three sets of them were the legs of that thing set down 
it wasn't nothing that did that but a UFO so this case got a lot of attention locally she 
was visited by many researchers who expressed great interest in her story and as Maggie says 
again in her own words one of these fellas that came said he was from a university in New Zealand 
and he told me he thought those UFOs have been flying around the Outback for hundreds of years 
he said the Aborigines know all about them whatever those funny little folks done it's okay 
with me I've been feeling so good that I ordered a bunch of baby chickens I don't have any trouble 
getting around like I used to and I can take care of them now and besides they'll be good company 
now this isn't taken on just Maggie's word again there are landing traces but Maggie was 
in fact examined by Dr Rubin dingard an expert in degenerative diseases who said and I quote 
frankly when I first heard the story I assumed she was a senile old lady who had lived with 
pain for too long and was having delusions but after examining her talking with her physician 
and studying her records I am absolutely amazed she is completely free of arthritis which she 
has suffered from for years she could easily pass for a woman 20 years younger and I simply 
have no explanation for what's happened well I think the explanation is obvious she was 
taken on board and healed of arthritis and there are quite a few cases just like that 
and in fact here's another this one occurred in December of 1988 in Watsonville California 
the main witness in this case is Anne DeSoto and she was driving with her boyfriend Cole near their 
home along West Beach Road this is near Pajaro Dunes in Watsonville it was one afternoon as I 
said in December of 1988 and suddenly their car they said was enveloped in fog and suddenly they 
saw a bright orange globe of light hovering over a nearby Field this began quite an amazing encounter 
as Anne says in her own words regarding the UFO it was like a round shape in the fog and we could 
see this orange puddle of light on the ground a thick fog came down around us without any warning 
it wasn't something that crept up it was just there at the same time we both felt very 
strange and uncomfortable so when this started happening her boyfriend turns to Anne and says 
that's funny and Ann agreed she said yeah that is funny so as Anne says we looked 
into this field and saw burnt orange lights we continued to feel strange as if we couldn't move 
and the next thing I know were both blank we are both completely blank we're like automatons 
this is conscious I remember just sitting there at the same time we're both turning looking into this 
field the fog is about two feet off the ground and about eight feet off the ground and shrouded in 
the fog is this humongous gigantic circular thing in fog totally surrounded by this orange light 
we just kind of look at it and turn our heads back on the road now Anne had seen UFOs before she was pretty much interested in them 
so they pulled a U-turn and headed back towards the light but it was gone it just wasn't there 
and as Ann says we're just looking at each other like explain this to me 
so at that point they weren't aware of it yet but they had in fact experienced a period of 
missing time about five hours because their next memory is walking into their boyfriend's house 
her boyfriend's house nearly five hours later they both went inside and fell into a deep sleep 
as Ann says at the time we had no feeling of having lost several hours but her boyfriend 
Cole was so frightened he refused to talk about it the next morning they found that they had 
blood stains on their bed sheets and Anne noticed that she had a strange looking mark on her hip 
and even more incredible she realized that she was healed of arthritis for years she had carried 
arthritis in that hip and it had completely disappeared so it's very clear to them both that 
something really remarkable had happened and was four years later that she went under hypnosis and 
recalled being taken on board a large craft as she says a huge craft bigger than a football field it 
had smaller parts on top and bottom and was thick in the middle there were many lights all around it 
so she's standing there right next to this craft and she sees the door open up and she 
says you can't see a door it just opens there are about five beings standing around the door 
and it's like they know me and they're waiting for me there's this one being with really long 
fingers he's reaching out to touch my hair and I remember going in it was dark cool 
she says she smelled a really interesting odor which she couldn't quite identify but it was somehow comforting for her and as she says there were these pretty lights I see a table I'm 
really scared and the next thing I know I'm on the table it's like pewter metal it was just one piece 
I'm just lying on this table I remember the beings on both sides of me doing something over my middle 
I remember these metal things like something from the dentist sort of reminded me of a spider with 
long legs I don't remember this metal thing that is blinking and it has something on the end of it 
like a round thing that almost had a different colored light in it and I remember them just 
putting this thing in my nose I was crying and sobbing because they were pushing this thing in 
my nose so this wasn't particularly Pleasant for her and she doesn't remember much else 
but under hypnosis she also recalled that these strange beings came again that night 
visiting her trailer and she says five beings came straight through the wall they were hairy 
all over with large eyes I felt one of them recognized me from childhood and she recalls 
being taken on board along with her friend Cole She says he was so terrified he couldn't speak 
she says these were in fact Grays some of them at least and it's quite an involved encounter 
but yeah they healed her and she is absolutely thankful for that and she says I know I didn't 
make this up it's totally changed my whole life it makes you realize how much you really don't know 
were an infant Planet like two-year-olds we think we know everything we're just in daycare so yeah 
an interesting case and here is another case which occurred on September 27 1959 in Coos Bay Oregon 
this involves a real estate salesman by the name of Leo barsh who does believe he received a healing as the result of an apparent UFO encounter 
now for some time Leo had been suffering from pain and numbness in his left arm 
and the doctors were not able to find any cause this condition had persisted for a number of weeks 
and as Leo says the trouble extended up my arm it felt dead as if blood did not want to enter it 
and then in the middle of the night on September 27 1959 something very strange happened as Leo 
says I was at home in bed and at about three o'clock in the morning I woke up and I was 
weightless I was floating it was the greatest sensation I ever experienced and he also had 
the distinct impression that quote something out of the universe had just passed over me 
so Lee as Leo says when it stopped I woke my wife up and asked her if she'd been weightless too 
she thought I'd been drinking but my arm it was healed so Leo was delighted he realized that all 
the numbness and pain was gone you could move and control his fingers again and he absolutely 
believes he was cured by a UFO as he says I hadn't seen nothing but I told her right then and there 
that it was a UFO that had come low over the house and done that to me I told her we'd hear about it 
so it had a profound effect on his life it not only healed him it completely changed his Outlook 
and Leo ended up publishing his own UFO newsletter and holding UFO meetings in his area for many 
years and as he says I've gotten ridiculed but I've had story after Story told to me about 
UFOs over the years people are experiencing these things now here's another very brief case which I 
don't have a whole lot of information on other than it occurred in October 1989 to a retired 
military officer by the name of Dolores Galvin and she says that she was also cured of arthritis by 
the ETS and I'll just quote her directly she says I felt the presence of someone in the room with me 
and she saw this tall dark figure leaning over her with a silver pencil-shaped object 
you pressed it down on her left arthritic shoulder and as she says at first it felt pretty good 
but then she started to feel real pressure and then a floating sensation and she blacked out but when she woke up the next morning she saw this weird rash on her shoulder which did clear 
up but most importantly as she says her arthritis was gone now I don't have any more information on 
this case but I thought it was interesting because there's so many cases like this and I just want to 
quote one final case of an arthritis cure which very interestingly although it is uninvestigated 
comes from major Edward rupelt of Project Blue Book and during an interview major rupout said 
that he receives lots of letters Blue Book does from people reporting UFOs from all over the world 
and he had a really interesting letter involving what an apparent arthritis cure 
as he says we had one a letter from a mountaineer in Tennessee sitting before 
his fireplace and a wheel of fire went through his front room and he got over his arthritis 
now rupelt and his team did not investigate this I think probably because it was in fact a really 
good case in Project Blue Book was really more about debunking the UFO phenomena which is such a 
shame because that would have been really good evidence and as you can see there are lots of 
cases of people being healed now here's another case of an apparent rescue it's somewhat ambiguous 
but the person involved believes it might have been a UFO and this occurred in August of 1985 
in Milbank sound this is off Vancouver Island in Canada and in fact this was written up 
in the newspapers with the headline UFO saves fishermen another did call it a ghost light so 
yeah there's different ways to interpret this but the main witness was Randy Morrison who shared his 
incredible story from the hospital room at Bella Bella Hospital in Vancouver Canada he was the sole 
survivor of the trawler the Pacific traveler which had actually capsized in a fierce storm 
it was a powerful Gale that actually caused 11 boats to radio for help 
Randy Morrison said that it was the worst storm he had ever seen as he says it was screaming out 
there I had never seen waves like that the captain of the boat the Pacific traveler was Leonard egolf 
and when this boat started to capsize he was unable to get his survival suit on this is 
something Sailors wear when the water is really cold it's kind of like a wetsuit but Randy put his on not long before this boat capsized and the boat capsized and as 
Randy says we hung onto the hall I got washed away a couple of times and Leonard pulled me 
back then he got washed away and I pulled him back at one point he told the captain 
we are both dead men Leonard both of us the only difference is maybe you will go a little faster 
than me I'm in a floating body bag because again he's wearing a survival suit and Leonard wasn't 
and Randy describes this horrific experience as he says then a series of three or four waves hit us 
and we both got washed away the next thing I knew I was 40 feet away from the boat and I was alone 
now he could no longer see Leonard and in fact Leonard was never seen alive again 
meanwhile Randy was beginning a long struggle for Life Z says the rain and 
the spray were coming at me so hard it felt like someone was sticking pins in my face 
I'm a strong swimmer and I'm a former lifeguard but I had resigned myself to death 
it was so darn cold he actually urinated in his survival suit to help keep him warm 
and this just went on and on to the point where he was starting to hallucinate he would see boats 
and it immediately evaporate and he knew death was coming soon and this was when he saw a light 
and unlike the hallucinations he was seeing which quickly evaporated and were really sort of Mercurial and changing this light was constant it remained there as he says 
I saw the light that wouldn't come near me it was either a ghost boat or some kind of animal 
or sea life but I swear it was real so whatever it was it remained for a while soon he was so 
far gone that even his vision had begun to fail but he says this light gave him hope it gave him 
the encouragement to hang on a little longer he felt like someone was out there watching over him 
and he made it through the night miraculously morning arrived and that's when he heard the sound of an aircraft and shortly later a boat coming to rescue him 
as he says it was the most incredible feeling you have no idea what it's like to think you 
are saved when you have given yourself up for dead I just couldn't believe it I was alive 
so how do UFO saved him Randy can't say for sure but he's convinced that something was out there 
as Randy says they said that nobody was out there it was impossible to get a boat out but I swear 
there was a boat out there I Saw the Light so I don't know Ghostlight Phantom boat UFO you can 
make up your own mind about it but he certainly considered the possibility that he had been saved 
by a UFO and now we get to the final case which occurred on September 27 1996 and this is in 
the mountains of Bolivia more specifically the cordiera de toshara the main witness is Roberto 
Suarez Molina age 28 and he had become lost while hiking in this rugged mountainous area 
and it was during the search that air rescue units reported seeing strange glows around the 
snow-covered peak of Nevada coral Coral Quay this was on the western edge of the tajara range and on 
Friday Roberto saw a light with a weird appearance he says it crossed the sky stopped for a moment in 
midair and then turned red before disappearing and later this bright bright light lit up his campsite 
and looking up he saw this brilliantly lit tube of light this tube of light turned from a horizontal 
position to a vertical position then slowly descended actually landing on the mountain trail 
near his campfire so he's completely lost this UFO is coming in for a landing and he suddenly found 
himself face to face with a luminous humanoid form that quote told him things and in fact this entity 
told Roberto that he would be rescued by the Bolivian Air Force around noon time on Saturday 
and it was a short encounter that's all that was reported about it but apparently the humanoid was 
right because sure enough on that day Roberto was in fact spotted by a Cessna Aircraft and 
was picked up by a helicopter and saved from being lost in the wilderness it's another amazing case 
of apparently a UFO rescue this one involving humanoids there you go those are 12 cases of 
ET benevolence and I can tell you with full confidence there is a lot more where that came 
from this is really just the tip of the iceberg there are many many cases like this and in fact 
I did do a previous episode on this channel called rescued by aliens which presents a bunch of cases 
and I can tell you from experience that most people do not report their encounters so I know 
there are a lot more like this where these you know where people have been helped healed saved 
in a variety of ways so I find these cases super interesting I think they're very important to 
recognize and let people know that yeah ETS are often intervening in people's lives in 
a very benevolent way so I really want to thank you for watching I hope you've 
learned something and found this interesting and I really appreciate you all watching and 
coming to this channel so thanks very much for that until next time keep searching for 
answers keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye now
