Summary:
Jan 3, 2021
Every location on Earth has their own unique story of UFO encounters. The state of Colorado has contributed many cases which have profoundly affected what people believe about UFOs. 

This video presents a compilation of Colorado's top twenty most outstanding UFO encounters. These are the cases that earned national headlines, or have something important to add to our knowledge of this subject, or are unique to the state of Colorado in some way.

Sightings, landings, photographic cases, face-to-face encounters, onboard UFO experiences, UFO crash/retrievals...Colorado has them all. Starting with Case Number Twenty and moving to Case Number One, these encounters from Colorado provide a fascinating and comprehensive look at the complexity of a phenomenon that continues to become a growing presence on our planet.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and the title of today's presentation is the top 20 ufo 
encounters in colorado i've studied colorado's ufo history in depth and i've come up with a list 
of what I think are the top 20 best encounters these are cases that have gotten the most publicity 
perhaps or have something important to contribute to our understanding of ufos or are unique to 
colorado in some way along those lines another researcher might have come up with a very 
different list but this is mine and i'm super excited to share it with you and I'm going to 
start with number 20. and the case I chose for number 20 is a very early ufo sighting 
this actually occurred on september 7 1917 over the town of salida colorado where numerous 
residents of that town saw multiple objects which they called quote vehicles of the air 
circling and hovering over the town in the surrounding area they were often seen over 
tender foot mountain and over mount shivano and around the city itself some of the witnesses were 
mr and miss oakley uh the husband was a reverend  good witness and they actually observed these objects through a telescope so that increases the 
chances that uh they were able to identify it and they could not identify this thing as any plane 
nor could the bode family or the woody family or many other residents of solida colorado 
it's a very interesting case it was reported in the salida record  and remains a very well documented early case which took place in colorado i'm sure there are 
other cases earlier than that certainly there are accounts of native americans and flying canoes 
and things like this but this is a well-documented modern case and that's why I gave it the number 20 
spot and for number 19 for number 19 I chose what I believe to be colorado's first ufo photograph 
this was taken in the town of ward colorado it was a very small town really 
had sprung up around a sawmill and in april of 1929 a sawmill worker by the name of edward pline 
was working at the sawmill with a bunch of other uh workers when this loud quote thunderous roar 
came zooming down over the workers and what the weird thing was they couldn't see anything however 
edward had a camera and he took a photograph several photographs as this weird sound sort of 
traveled over head and uh when he got the photo developed it showed what clearly is some sort 
of solid object in the sky a round almost saucer-shaped object it's very strange it's 
not the only case in which ufos were appeared in photographs but were not seen with the naked eye 
that's actually fairly common but for this to happen that early in history yeah this is a really 
truly amazing case and I think might be colorado's first ufo photograph and that's why I gave it 
number 19. all right number 18. we got a lot of cases to cover for number 18 I chose a report from 
cheyenne mountain this comes from an anonymous witness who reported his case to I believe it was 
national ufo reporting center says at age 19 he was employed at cheyenne mountain the u.s military 
underground installation used to protect the security of the united states and in may of 1970 
he was a rookie employee 19 years old he said he was working the night shift monitoring 
the early warning radar stations and they began to receive reports of four objects 
at an altitude of twenty five thousand feet moving at two thousand five hundred 
miles per hour over the bering sea down the coast of alaska and down to british columbia 
two fighter jets were launched from alaska but were unable to intercept the objects 
and upon reaching vancouver the objects which each was about the size of a bomber according to 
the radar blips moved straight up and beyond the range of the radar scopes and over the next week 
the employee learned that the ufos had come back and put a repeat performance and that's when he 
learned that this thing was not unusual and that ufos were seen or detected regularly from the 
cheyenne mountain base as he says and this is a quote I was 19 at the time and naive all the old 
timers who were mostly radar techs and for my radar or system techs let me in on the secret 
this kind of thing happened all the time but you learned to never report it in written reports 
and to never question it he finally did report it to newfour saying I have never reported 
this to anyone or put this into writing before knowing all the truth will never be out there 
in print well it's out there now thanks to this witness reporting what he saw and I suspect that 
cheyenne mountain is still detecting these unknown targets on a regular basis now to case number 17 
for case number 17 I chose senator sees a ufo and whenever a highly placed government official 
goes public for third mission of seeing a ufo that's definitely news and this case was not 
well known and I still I don't think it is well known but there are only a handful of government 
officials who have come forward and admitted to having seen a ufo and state senator sam t taylor 
is one of them he in 1955 senator taylor was a state senator for the state of colorado and on 
november 25th he had an incredible sighting over the town of la veta according to senator taylor 
he observed a dirigible shaped object which glowed blue green and had a jelly-like or gelatinous like 
appearance it dropped down out of the sky moving at a 45 degree angle and appeared at first to be a 
shooting star he estimated maybe about 15 000 feet elevation but it leveled off and then it started 
arcing upwards at a 30 degree angle over mount mastis so he knew at this point it clearly was 
not a shooting star of any kind and it made no sound had no exhaust he estimates he saw it for 
just about five seconds and then it was gone but he was impressed enough to report it to the fbi 
and to the air force it was routed to project blue book blue book officers and interviewed senator 
taylor and could not come up with an explanation and labeled this case unexplained it's case number 
3869 definitely an important case and that's why I gave it number 17. and now to number 16 is another 
blue book uninvestigated or unidentified case rather in the blue book case 5852 
and this is a very interesting report from a trained observer the main witness is orville 
r foster he was a airport weather observer and a meteorologist for the u.s weather bureau and 
at 10 46 a.m this is morning daylight on june 14 1958 he was stationed at pueblo memorial airport 
and was on duty observing a weather balloon with a theodolite a theodolite is a telescope attached 
to a compass and other measuring instruments which allows the observer to triangulate an object and 
ascertain its distance its size its elevation and so on allows you to make accurate measurements so 
he's observing this weather balloon when suddenly an object appears in his viewfinder and uh 
as according to uh the witness orville foster this object was silver white saturn shaped and 
tilted forward at an angle he estimates it was at least 30 feet in diameter and moving in excess of 
500 miles per hour clearly not a weather balloon he watched it for somewhere between five to ten 
minutes as it traversed from one horizon to the other uh using the theodolite and uh says that it 
its shape was very sharply defined and it was definitely not a balloon so it's an important case 
uh by a trained observer and the air force offices officers from project blue book were unable to 
identify it and labeled it unexplained and now we go to case number 15. I like this case because 
it's a very early report of a strange humanoid humanoids seen before 1950 are extremely rare 
and yet this case states to 1931 and it comes from a ranch about eight miles southwest of the town of 
holyoke so I call this case the whole yoke humanoid and as the witness says and i'm quoting 
in the winter of 1931 I saw a flying machine as I was riding on a horse in a draw of a pasture 
i was 17 and I was checking on cattle after a snowstorm I went over a small hill and down to 
a draw that was about 25 to 30 feet deep I looked up to the west and saw an elongated oval-shaped 
flying machine in the air it was aluminum in color and a door was transparent like glass opened 
a man appeared that looked human but was not as tall he looked down at me and he had a uniform 
on that was darker than he was at this point the witness says that his horse stumbled and he was 
forced to look away and when he looked back the object was gone and in 2004 more than 70 years 
after this incident he realized or concluded that he had probably seen a ufo on an occupant 
and reported his case to the national ufo reporting center  the director of new fork peter davenport spoke with the witness and as he says we i'm quoting 
we spoke with the witness at length and he seemed to us to be exceptionally reliable and credible 
so there you go a very early case of a strange humanoid very rare and that's why I included it 
here and now we go get to case number 14. and this is a case i've actually covered before in 
another video about ufos over prisons but I had to include it here because the state of colorado has 
a you know the colorado state prison and it has been visited four times on four separate occasions 
which is remarkable we know ufos are attracted to nuclear installations air force bases missile 
silos anything that's technological so that seems to be what's drawing them in here 
and this is just a remarkable series of encounters that sort of reveals I think the agenda 
of these ufo occupants first case I want to talk about occurred on august 2nd 1965 this 
was actually during a nationwide ufo flap and two tower guards at the colorado state penitentiary 
this is in canon city I saw something which they could not explain one of the guards 
donald steitz says he first noticed the object at about 2 15 a.m so the middle of the night 
and it was hovering between somewhere between colorado springs and the town of pueblo and it 
appeared to be a bright glowing white object which remained stationary but would dim and brighten and 
after a period of about 30 minutes it suddenly winked out and was apparently gone and that's 
how it all started the next case occurred just two years later in september of 1967 
and this involves multiple witnesses uh the main report comes from a gentleman 
i'll call nathan that's a pseudonym but nathan was camping with two of his cousins 
on the western side of the crestone mountains in the san luis valley when all three of them 
saw this very bright object come zooming down out of the sky it split into three different pieces 
and uh then changed directions and moved to the east over to the eastern side of the creststone 
mountains which is where the colorado prison is and this is where it gets very interesting 
at this point they thought the objects were gone you know they did some inquiries and 
called the local sheriff station couldn't find any other witnesses but found a  newspaper report the next day there was an article in the newspaper about the sightings 
over the colorado prison and it turned out that on that same night that they saw these ufos
the colorado highway patrol and local police saw three lights hovering over the colorado prison 
and they had chased the lights for more than two hours at some point they feared there might  be some weird prison break and they called in off-duty guards and according to the article 
says nathan more than 300 police officers observed these strange lights on that night 
and the prison officials were so concerned they actually contacted nearby peterson air 
force base to report the ongoing sighting as it was occurring and peterson told them that 
they located the objects on their radar scopes and also had visual confirmation 
and so at the request of the highway patrol they launched two f-106 interceptors and as 
the interceptors approached the target the lead pilot radioed back to uh the base for permission 
to shoot at the objects uh to fire his weapons and at that exact moment the three objects 
zoomed upwards at high speed the jets tried to follow but could not keep up 
and the objects disappeared straight upwards and presumably into outer space so nathan and his 
cousins each got a copy of the newspaper article which they since have not been able to locate 
but as nathan says none of us have ever taken drugs or had enough alcohol to impact our judgment 
even though we are all over 50 now I have a security clearance and still work for the uso u.s 
air force one of my cousins is now a lawyer and the other is an emergency inhalation therapist and 
an ex-green beret so these are all pretty credible witnesses who at least now do have uh training 
in terms of identifying aircraft and that's just the second case there are more to follow 
some 11 years later or so in august of 1976 there was another sighting a correctional officer was 
performing tower duty at colorado state prison when he saw an oval shaped disc about 100 feet 
in diameter arrived from over the nearby mountain ridge about 200 yards away he said it made a low 
pitched humming noise and moved at a very slow 20 miles per hour so clearly not a plane or balloon 
or helicopter satellite or anything conventional this was quite close 200 yards away is not far 
the officer marked the event down on his shift report and afterwards reported it to 
the cannon city police department and he says that it physically and emotionally affected him 
for some time afterward and as he says this took a while to process as it was strange to see 
the sighting did leave me somewhat disoriented and with poor sleeping for about two weeks 
and once again it's not the last case in this area another case occurred uh much more recently 
on january 10th 1998 when a corrections officer at the canon prison was returning the inmates to 
the tool shed so they could return the tools and then he would return them to the prison population  and he had an inmate right next to him when they both looked up and saw something very strange 
it was as they said a very large sphere chrome in color with three brown spots on the side 
this report actually comes from the prison guard and he says it hovered very high up  there it appeared to be about sixty thousand feet he's estimating and gigantic it had to be 
at least the size he says of 10 full-size jet airliners so extremely large and as he says 
the inmate and I just looked at each other and said what in the hell is that to this 
day I have no idea what it was so this is a very strange and kind of revealing cluster of sightings 
which I think have something to say about the ufo phenomena and that's why I included it here 
and now we move to case number 13 which I call the denver ufo wave and this was in august of 
1965 again during a large wave of sightings on august 9th 1965 the mile high city was 
treated to a tremendous display of ufo activity involving what appears to be multiple objects 
over a period of several hours all across the city and viewed by dozens of witnesses 
and i'll just go over some of these uh witness reports for you because it's truly incredible 
the first report came in around 5 50 p.m from 17 year old bill lamberton who was driving with two 
people down mississippi avenue when he saw they saw a silver cylindrical shaped object 
it stopped hovered momentarily then darted upwards and to the west over the mountains they saw it for 
about six seconds uh three and a half hours later at 9 15 pm the ufo was back randy holmes a 16 year 
old saw what he described as a bright yellow cigar-shaped object going along the horizon 
he viewed it from his home on everett street as it moved off to the northeast and vanished 
40 minutes later at 9 55 pm don stores age 81 observed an object from greenwood boulevard 
he says it came at a high rate of speed and went straight north it covered three  fourths of the sky in just a few seconds and disappeared in a bright red glow 
by this point the local newspaper the denver post was receiving a flood of calls from people who 
were seeing these weird objects one report came at around 10 05 pm from miss lawrence osdale who 
said that they were able to view the ufo using binoculars and uh it went to the right came back 
stood still in place for just a few minutes at which point they could through the binoculars 
see that this was a dome-shaped objects with red and green lights along the circumference 
like headlights on a car is how they described it but very bright five minutes later 
another resident of denver barbara fisher she watched three objects hovering over 
buckley field and she says there were three lights and the first two appeared to be moving 
faster than the third 15 minutes after that another resident dan turkins watched 
uh an object from his home on independent street and he described another type of object he said 
and i'm quoting it was a cone-shaped object with a dome on top and lights changing from yellow to 
red to green so we're getting a wide variety of objects described here which is very interesting 
this object clearly wanted to be seen as it was crisscrossing the entire city  making sure that a lot of people saw it it appears five minutes later at 10 25 pm a gentleman by the 
name of ci speaks was on tennyson street and along with several other neighbors 
saw this very strange object as he says and i'm quoting me and my wife and our neighbors saw a 
light streak by the north star and disappear over the mountains towards boulder 
a half hour later 11 p.m miss william mccall and her two daughters observed three glowing red dots 
that were clustered together in the sky she says they then separated and circled over the city 
from southwest to south east there was no sound of an engine 
and 10 minutes before midnight the last report came in and this comes from a high school math 
teacher by the name of von andel and he said that he was doing his nightly running exercises 
around the high school field when he saw a very bright flash of light and as he says 
it was considerably larger than any commercial aircraft more like the size of a football field 
so after interviewing all these witnesses the denver post actually called up norad the north 
american air defense command space detection and tracking station at colorado springs 
and the duty officer told them that they had no explanation for the sightings and quote were not 
in the ufo business he told the the denver post that witnesses probably saw the echo 
2 satellite I personally think this is a flat out lie and a cover-up they clearly must have 
seen this object it was all over the city of denver seen by dozens of witnesses at least 
probably hundreds if not more than that and uh based on the descriptions that witnesses gave 
there is just no way that this was a satellite so that's pretty disappointing again how our 
military and our government is reacting to this situation and there are so many other cases so 
let's move on to the next case the case I chose for number 12 is actually a ufo healing case 
this was investigated by the j allen heineck center for ufo studies kufos richard hall was one 
of the investigators he reported this on in his book uh the ufo evidence but this case was also 
investigated by a number of researchers actually including linda moulton howe and richard sigismund 
so this case created quite a bit of uh interest for sure because of its unique and interesting 
details and how it all occurred was on november 19 1980 when two witnesses michael and mary 
those are pseudonyms were driving from denver to their home in longmont colorado 
it was late at night 12 minutes before midnight and along a lonely highway they heard a loud 
whooshing noise and suddenly this beam of light came down in their car a bright blue beam of light 
immediately their car radio filled with static and their headlights failed  and seconds later the car was lifted up off the highway and into the sky they were very 
frightened and blacked out next thing they know they're driving along uh the highway they're not 
farther along the highway in a different location and over an hour has passed an hour and 10 minutes 
is missing from their lives upon arriving home michael finds something else very strange 
he was suffering from skin cancer at the time he had several large cancerous melanomas on his legs 
and when he examined his legs he was shocked to see that these melanomas were greatly reduced 
in size and color it appeared as if he had been healed at least to some degree they were both 
pretty traumatized and eventually sought out ufo researchers who put them under hypnotic regression 
the husband was put under regression first and he recalled a really incredible story he recalled 
being pulled into the object with his wife they were separated put into different rooms by 
what you would just we would now describe as gray type ets with large heads large dark eyes 
no hair they were wearing shiny gold jumpsuits and spoke telepathically 
they took michael to one room he said it was very bright they laid him out on a table and he  was examined by this floating light and they then began to extract memories from his mind from his 
brain is what he said he felt was happening he did not think that this was a fun experience by 
any means it was pretty scary and traumatic at least as he recalled it under hypnosis 
and later his wife mary also underwent hypnosis and record she recalled the same thing and she 
also felt that this was not a positive experience for her as she says the examination left her 
feeling very violated and that they were treated very much like uh lab rats I guess is how you 
would put it uh so yeah not a particularly benevolent encounter despite the fact 
that uh they both or uh michael was apparently at least partially healed of skin cancer this 
is one of many cases of people who have been healed and there are others in colorado actually 
so that's why I included this case I think it's a pretty important case 
and now we move to case number 11 and this is a very interesting case in which a meteorologist 
photographs a ufo this occurred on march 22 1967 the witness is robert rinker he's a professional 
meteorologist and he was working on chalk mountain he worked at a weather station on chalk mountain 
as a field technician and this is located near the town of climax colorado and the station is 
located at 11 000 feet so pretty high up there and he didn't see anything unusual when he decided to 
take a photograph of the weather station but when he developed the photograph he was shocked to see 
a very very large metallic disc with a dark center ring hovering next to the station 
it was clearly artificial and not an aberration on the photograph and he had no idea what to 
make of it so he reported officially and this was reported to blue book and 
the disc appeared to be hovering about a hundred feet above the ground and covers at least a 
quarter of the view the field of view within the camera so it's an important case for sure 
of a ufo that appeared in a photograph and once again we see that it wasn't visible 
when the photograph was taken at least not to the naked eye which brings a interesting corollary to 
our next case now we get to the top ten things are getting exciting for case number ten I chose 
a case which I call the invisible ufo and this actually comes from major donald kehoe one of my 
favorite pioneering researchers who really worked hard to end the government cover-up 
and reveal the truth about ufos wrote a series of best-selling books and uh it's thanks to him 
that this case is being talked about today I don't think it's super well known but it 
should be because it has some very interesting and profound implications about the ufo phenomena 
this what's really interesting about this case is it appeared in the files of blue book and 
the content committee which really surprised air force officers because they were sure that they 
had marked it secret so somehow it slipped through the cracks and got reported to the public and 
i can see why they wanted to keep it secret and you will too once you get these details  this occurred at the colorado springs airport and how it all began was on the evening of may 13 1967 
radar operators at the colorado springs airport were startled when their scopes at two 
different radar stations showed that an aircraft was approaching the airport however visually 
no aircraft could be seen the rare scopes showed solid images of this craft of some sort as it flew 
right over the airport at a height of only 200 feet very much like an f-100 or an f-104 
jet interceptor would come in for a landing except not actually touching down and as major 
donald kehoe writes about this case according to the radar track the ufo came to within one 
and a half miles of the control tower but the tower operators could not see it  even with binoculars to the radar expert who investigated this case this was the most 
baffling radar case on record he admitted he could not find an explanation but for the air 
force it was far more than puzzling their own radar experts had reached the same conclusion 
some unknown high-speed aircraft had maneuvered over the airport absolutely unseen could the 
technically advanced ufo aliens have developed a means for making their spacecraft invisible 
it seemed fantastic but what other answer was there if true they could be  in serious trouble in case of ufo attacks so this was a sighting or a non-sighting 
that was causing high waves and big waves at high levels of government it's causing great concern 
and this did make it to the continent committee a ufo study project the guy who was responsible 
for studying radar reports was dr gordon thayer and he was normally extremely skeptical of radar 
reports and calling them consistently echoes but he was not able to do that in this case 
there was no object visually seen yet the radar clearly showed that there was an object there 
and as he says and i'm quoting this must remain as one of the the most puzzling radar cases on 
record and no conclusion is possible at this time so yeah because of these 
important implications showing that a ufo can turn invisible and still appear on radar 
i think this is an important case and certainly deserves inclusion on this list who knows how 
many ufos are out there above us right now that we can't see because they have their 
shields their cloaks on uh ufos can turn invisible that's what this case shows us 
and now we move to case number nine and this is a really interesting ufo event it's not a sighting 
uh in particular it's but it has to do with ufos and this is one of the first times anyone has 
tried to politicize the investigation of the ufo phenomena and make ufo invasion investigations 
an official part of the open government not a secret government study but one that 
we all know about and uh this was spearheaded by political activist and former candidate former 
political candidate jeff peckman in november of 2008 jeff had done a bit of research 
and had come to believe that the ufo phenomena deserved further study in an official capacity 
and decided to see if he could get some actual movement within official government policy 
and he introduced a referendum to the city of denver to create a seven member commission 
to handle extraterrestrial affairs this is called the denver extraterrestrial affairs commission 
initiative 300 was was aimed for a budget of 75 000 
none of which would be taken from municipal funds from city funds but rather would depend solely on 
grants and donations and therefore would not impact the city's fiscal budget 
its goal its purpose was to help legitimize the ufo subject and to create transparency and 
cooperation between citizens and government the initiative needed at least 3974 figures or 74 uh 
signatures rather to be considered for inclusion on the ballot and jeff peckman was 
able to get that number of signatures and more and succeeded in getting initiative 300 on the ballot 
and so on november 2nd 2010 citizens of colorado voted on initiative 300. 
and the results were absolutely one-sided it's very interesting the number of those voting yes 
was 31 108 which is an impressive number for sure the number of those voting no was 145 
020 so more than 80 percent of people in colorado decided that they did not want to 
have an extraterrestrial affairs commission but 20 did and that's a pretty significant number 
and I think this is a really important step in the history of ufo research because it's one of the 
first real attempts to uh open this up to an uh open official municipal investigation of the ufo 
phenomena and it's unfortunate it didn't succeed but hopefully someone else will try again and we 
can start investigating ufos openly officially and transparently that's why I include this case 
and now we get to case number eight for case number eight I chose the case of stan romanek 
uh many of you probably have heard of stan's uh case it's very well known actually I think 
and has got some controversy surrounding it if not for this controversy I probably would have 
given it a much higher ranking but after much thought I decided I needed to include this case 
despite the controversy because it has had a profound impact on the field it created 
an enormous amount of attention when it first came out it's still 
getting a lot of attention and there are many researchers who are think it's absolutely valid 
i spoke with stan romanek and his wife lisa romanek firsthand I believe them to be 
honest people they were very kind and described their encounters I think as best as they could 
and uh so yeah I think this case may very well be genuine uh despite the controversies which 
i'll get into in a bit but anyway let me just tell you how this case unfolded uh because it's 
a very complicated case it all began uh really in earnest on september 20th 2001 at that time stan 
romanek was working at a as an assistant manager at a retail store one of the customers came 
some customers actually came running in from outside saying that there was a weird object  hovering over the building stan and several other people ran outside and sure enough 
there was this weird glowing sphere hovering uh just a few hundred feet over the building 
it looked to be about 30 feet across when suddenly it shot straight up so stan was amazed because 
this was not his first ufo sighting just recently he had had a couple of other sightings 
in less than a year just a few months earlier he was with a group of other people at red rocks park 
uh he was driving along and he saw people pulled over looking at these this shiny metallic object 
up in the sky rotating spheres is what it looked like he looked at them and kept driving 
and one of these spheres broke formation and came and started following his car 
and he quickly pulled over and tried to videotape it when it shot upwards and disappeared 
it was just a few months after that when he was on a cross-country road trip with a couple of friends 
and a ufo appeared again and followed them across two and a half states  appearing disappearing coming in and out of the clouds playing kind of a cat and mouse 
peekaboo game until finally darting up and disappearing and uh 
so then came this third sighting and he was beginning to wonder what was going on and it 
was that evening on september 20 2001 that he had his first abduction experience it was around 2 30 
a.m he woke up to hear knocking on the front door and walked into the living room his sister stood 
there in the living room paralyzed and in a trance apparently sleepwalking or something 
and he saw three figures at the front door who quickly came inside he thought at first that they 
were wearing masks because their faces looked very strange and realized that no these were not 
masks these were just not human people and he became extremely frightened and blacked out 
and woke up the next morning and found strange scoop marks on his back  and marks on his abrasions on his ankles and his wrists as if something had held him down 
he was pretty upset he talked to his sister his sister reported that she had had a  very strange dream she dreamt that three people knocked on the front door 
and she answered it and they were strange figures dressed in pinstripe 
suits is all she remembers next thing she remembers it's the next morning so this is a very 
strange case for sure and this is how it all sort of began for stan romanek and uh 
it was clearly not a dream because he had physical marks and his sister also remembered part of it 
so following this more strange stuff happened two days later a strange ball of light went through 
their house one week later he saw a ufo following his car he pulled over and began filming it 
a crowd of people were gathering and were also watching this object until it finally darted away 
stan really released his footage to the news media  and it wasn't long after that you know they played it and uh he started receiving phone threats 
and uh when weird activity continued he eventually went under hypnosis  and uh to that initial ufo abduction event in his bedroom and under hypnosis he recalled being 
taken into what appears to be a craft and physically examined by what we would call 
gray type ets he was clamped down by his wrists and ankles on this table and the ets 
physically examined him he asked them a bunch of questions but they told him you know 
everything's okay uh you need to calm down and after examining him they said that something 
significant is about to happen to our planet and that he needed to know what it was and they 
filled his mind with images of horrific natural disasters of hurricane force winds so strong that 
they scoured the roads and highways off the earth of tidal waves that would cover entire cities 
fires burning all over the planet to stand it looked like the entire planet was in convulsions 
of disaster after disaster so it was a pretty scary message which sort of shook him to the car 
it was not long after this that stan began waking up to find that he had written long complex 
mathematical or algebraic symbols uh on p sheets of paper or on the wall and uh he had no memory 
of doing this he apparently did it in his sleep he was also observed by his family doing it in trance 
so this was very strange and he later found out that uh these were not meaningless symbols they 
were accurate actually and related to astrophysics or represented actual chemical elements so 
that was strange and at this time his wife lisa began receiving secret letters from an informant 
more balls of light were seen darting around their house  I began writing more equations more abductions began to occur on november 17 2002 he woke up 
locked outside of his home he had to bang on the door to get in um and uh he had 
a lot of pain uh he had a bloody nose and scoop marks on his back there was weird 
impressions in the grass he went to the doctor the next day and the doctor was shocked he says 
it looked as if his rib had been cut and reset but there was no sign of any incision 
stan and his wife took samples of the soil where this object had apparently landed because they 
could see where this weird circle mark and they sent it off to a scientist who said that 
it appeared as if the soil had been exposed to high levels of a microwave like energy
so in the months that followed they saw more ufos in april 2003 things moved up to a new 
level when stan saw a figure peering in through his window each time he looked it would dart away 
and after it happened three or four times he decided to set up some cameras and 
let cut let them just go running while he wasn't there and after reviewing the  footage he was shocked to see what appears to be a gray tight e.t peering into his window 
so this is when he started to get some really impressive photographic evidence videos in this 
case of actual gray aliens uh later he will get further photographs of et's tyrion windows or 
you know outside his deck and uh things like this one very strange incident occurred when 
his camera went missing for like two weeks and when he got it back and developed the film he 
was shocked to see a couple of photographs on it that he was sure he hadn't taken and each of these 
showed a gray e.t very close up very much as if the gray himself had taken a selfie so you can 
make up your own mind about these photographs but they're very interesting to say the least 
so the evidence the physical evidence was beginning to  uh increase and just add up and stack up very hard for them to ignore that something 
very strange was happening to them his family his friends were involved it was not just him 
on one occasion stan woke up in his bed to find that he was no longer dressed in the clothes 
he had gone to sleep in instead he was wearing a woman's nightie this happened on a second occasion 
it appears if the et's have a sense of humor I find it hard to believe that they don't know what 
his clothes are or maybe they just don't care or maybe they did it on purpose it's very hard to say 
uh but this has certainly happened in other cases for sure and many strange things happened 
there was an implant that romaneck found in his body and he decided to have it removed and studied 
and it had some very unusual properties probably the weirdest was it had this weird sort of protein 
coding and the doctors who examined or the scientists who examined this  implant said that it appeared to be very similar to an amino acid that's used to coat 
artificial joints and heart pacemakers so that the body won't reject them 
i find that interesting because these implants are not being rejected even though they appear to be 
artificial and a stanzan plan apparently according to the scientific study that had 
an internal structure that was only discernible using in an electronic or an electron 
microscope so more and more evidence piled up more photographs of et's lurking around 
outside his house in may 4th on may 4th 2006 stan fell from a ladder and damaged his leg very badly
but that evening he was taken on board and apparently healed he came back he had four 
puncture wounds in his lack leg uh he had gone to the doctor the doctor said he's gonna need an 
operation but he went to the doctor anyway and the doctor says that no operation was now necessary as 
his leg appeared to be almost perfectly healed and uh yeah he had no more problems with it afterwards 
so he had all kinds of problems stand with government surveillance  phone threats and his case was beginning to garner more and more attention 
many ufo researchers have declared his case genuine dwight connolly published it in his book 
the world's best ufo cases and uh there he's not without his debunkers some who think that stan has 
faked these videotapes and photographs uh but none have been able to prove it none have been able to 
find any evidence of a hoax so the case is definitely got a lot of evidence to support it 
in terms of landing traces medical evidence multiple eyewitness evidence photographic 
evidence both still photos and video tape and more so this case is hard to just dismiss away 
uh stan began receiving channeled messages warning again of future disasters et's told him at some 
point there's going to be a dramatic shift in human consciousness in the way we actually think 
so that's kind of interesting stan ended up writing three books about his experiences 
and his wife also wrote a book about her uh point of view and her experiences with stan 
and his encounters and uh it's truly an amazing case but not without controversy there 
is I believe a video tapes circulating on the internet which shows what appears to be stan 
faking throwing an object and then saying that it moved by itself i'm not  sure about this you'll have to make up your own decisions on that one but it definitely sort of 
creates a little bit of a question mark there but of even more concern  is what happened in 2014 when stan romanek was arrested by the department of homeland security 
for child pornography according to the case that went to trial he had in his possession 20 images 
which were illegal stan denies this and uh his family his wife his friends all support him and 
believe him when he says that this was not done by him they believe he was framed they believe he's 
part of a smear campaign by the u.s government to discredit him and to discredit his ufo encounters 
at any rate it had the desired effect it pulled him out of the ufo scene 
and he was found guilty on one count the other was dismissed and he was sentenced 
to a halfway house and I believe served out his term last I heard his health is suffering badly 
and he is withdrawn pretty much entirely from the ufo scene 
so whether or not you believe this case is genuine if the photographs and videotape are real or not 
you would have to explain the multiple eyewitnesses the physical evidence the healing  evidence the implant evidence I suspect the case is probably genuine i'm not really in the perfect 
position to make that a conclusion solidly uh so I would suggest if you're interested in this case 
yeah check out his books they're very interesting for sure and I think this case is definitely worth 
checking out and deserves inclusion on this list despite the controversies that do surround it 
all right now we move on to case number seven and case number seven is not a ufo sighting or landing 
or a crash retrieval but it's about a ufo crash retrieval I call this case a very unusual ufo 
lecture and how this all began was when frank scully a mainstream journalist 
decided to tackle the ufo subject and wrote one of the first books about ufos 
it's certainly one of the first ufo best sellers in the united states and uh it's largely about 
uh you know ufo sightings but mostly about ufo crashes according to frank scully he 
befriended a gentleman by the name of silas newton who was friends with a group of 
scientists and one scientist in particular who had worked on a ufo crash at aztec new mexico 
frank scully's book behind the flying saucers was the first book to mention ufo crashes 
and covered the details of what he had learned from this scientist who 
was involved in this ufo crash in new mexico so why is it on this list uh here in colorado 
it's because of what happened on march 8th in 1950 at the university of colorado in boulder
so what happened was uh george kohler a nearby radio guy had coordinated to 
get this scientist to speak before a group of students at the university of colorado this 
was going to be a science lecture for a group of about 80 to 90 students and
the witness would talk about what he had done in his research with this 
crash saucer and the only reason they were going public is because uh silas newton in this science 
we now know the scientists who we now know to be uh dr lee jibaur believed 
that the government was going to go public with the ufo phenomena and disclose what they knew 
in just a few months so that's why they agreed to do this lecture right before the lecture 
was due to take place however the scientists pulled out and silas newton agreed to go in 
his place and give the ufo lecture the lecture which was designed for less than 100 people 
100 science students ended up attracting more than 350 students from all across the campus word had 
spread and a large number of teachers professors showed up as well there was standing room only as 
this lecture began nobody was given the identity of silas newton his identity was left a mystery 
but he described how he had coordinated closely with who he called dr g dr jabaur 
and talked primarily about the aztec ufo crash and uh according to silas newton you know as 
reported by frank scully and dr g this was a very interesting ufo uh crash probably not even 
the ufo crashes we think of it in this lecture silence newton talked to actually about three 
saucers that have been captured by the government according to him 
these three saucers held a total of 34 humanoids each about three feet tall with fair complexions 
all bald except for a light peach fuzz they had perfect teeth and each were identical 
uniforms and caps that had no insignia or markings a uniform from one of the 
or a uni one of these uniforms they were able to take a thread away from it and test it and it 
was able to take 450 pounds before breaking the thread and one of the craft which we now believe 
to be the aztec ufo craft held 16 burned bodies the second craft also held 16 bodies and the 
smallest craft held two scientists believed that the humanoids found inside were extraterrestrials 
but could not determine their exact origin uh the metals of the craft also eluded them 
one was very light and stood more than 10 000 degree temperature and could not be penetrated 
by a diamond tipped drill and on board the saucers were all kinds of weird instrumentations which the 
scientists believed were used largely to measure or channel magnetic lines of force they believe 
that's how the craft was powered the aztec craft was largely undamaged it had only one small hole 
in a porthole a sort of a pencil sized hull which apparently caused explosive decompression 
and forced a controlled landing but the craft itself was not damaged in any other 
way while the other two were damaged but they found many strange things on board 
they found what appeared to be a sleeping quarters what looked like a bathroom they found containers 
containing heavy water ionized water and what appeared to be highly concentrated food tablets 
the smallest craft held only two seats in a small instrument panel and so this is basically what 
silas newton related he talked about the thomas mantell incident as well silence newton said that 
the largest craft was 99.9 feet in diameter the second was 72 feet and the smallest was 36 feet 
they didn't find any evidence of weaponry aboard any of these craft and uh
that was pretty much the gist of what silas newton related 
but as uh frank scully says in his book behind the flying saucers silence newton quote delivered what 
was probably the most sensational lecture about this earth or any other planet since galileo said 
it moves he gave the whole inside story of a flying saucer which he said had landed within 500 
miles of where he was now talking and he described the spaceship and its personnel in such detail 
that the undergraduates and faculty members left the lecture room with their heads spinning 
following this lecture the students and teachers were pretty evenly divided some were skeptical 
and some were very impressed that the speaker the unidentified speaker was telling the truth 
uh but uh silas newton immediately took off said he had a flight to catch 
and he left and went undercover and according to frank scully the air force was pretty upset 
about this ufo lecture because it hit the uh media waves a tape of the lecture was circulating 
frank scully listened to it and other people allegedly heard uh this tape 
the notes that silas newton wrote on a chalkboard were actually preserved and you can see a copy of 
them today in the book the aztec incident by scott and susan ramsey who have studied this incident in 
detail and there were several articles published in news newspapers about this lecture because 
it was creating a furor within the campus and beyond so there's no doubt that this lecture did 
actually happen at the university of colorado and apparently the air force was not happy according 
to frank scully they spared no effort in trying to track down the identity of silas newton and 
did eventually figure out who it was but they were taking the passenger lists of every flight that 
had left every airport that day in their efforts to figure out who this could be so I think they 
viewed it as a security leak and that this I mean this may have been a controlled sort of 
step towards disclosure but the air force was not behaving that way and according to frank scully 
uh they were very upset about it in fact ed rupelt told frank scully direct directly that the details 
in his book were extremely accurate and caused a huge headache for the air force because of it and 
this is certainly the first public lecture about ufo crash retrievals as far as I know on record 
and for that reason I think it's super important the entire lecture lasted about 50 minutes 
and then there was a 15-minute uh question and answer session and it was over but the 
waves continued to uh bounce back and forth as I said this got out into newspapers and uh
frank scully was able to talk to silas newton directly and uh get a really a lot of detail 
about all of these things that had gone on in this ufo study uh but here's where the story kind of 
goes south uh following this whole incident frank scully's book was viciously attacked 
and sort of panned by debunkers and because what happened was silas newton was arrested for fraud 
he claimed to be able to find oil deposits lose using advanced technology and 
apparently this technology was completely bogus or so according to this lawsuit 
however now researchers are taking a second look at this supposed uh fraud 
and it appears that silas newton may have been the target of a smear campaign and certainly that's 
what he claims himself silence newton says and i'm quoting as to my talk it wasn't long before the 
finger of persecution began pointing my way and they've scorched my hide but I haven't recanted 
so today I mean for years following this people ufo researchers would not examine 
ufo crash retrieval reports and believed that frank scully had been duped today many 
ufo researchers are taking this very seriously people like timothy good or lyndon moulton howe 
and other major researchers are taking a second look at this case and others  and now crash retrievals are I would say fairly well accepted certainly within the ufo community 
as being valid events considering the fact that there are several hundred whistleblowers of high 
rank and high station within military or industry or science reporting and attesting to these events 
so this must have been an amazing lecture to be able to see and unfortunately uh it was viciously 
attacked and it had the desired effect of sort of suppressing research into ufo crash retrievals for 
decades really until the roswell story broke in the 1970s and finally people started taking 
a second look william steinman was the first he wrote a book about the ufo crash at aztec 
and researched the whole silas newton controversy in depth and presents a very compelling case 
to say that silas newton was in fact framed by the government in an attempt to discredit 
his case hard to say but at any rate definitely we can say that ufo crash retrievals 
are at the forefront of ufo research and there are several hundred such cases 
that are now reported coming from across the united states and the world and this case 
this uh ufo lecture at colorado springs college uh or at the university of colorado rather 
is really the first major security leak as far as I know involving these crashed flying saucers 
other than the whole roswell ufo fiasco so that's why I included this case and now we move to case 
number six for case number six I decided to uh include the case of dr r leo sprinkle phd 
back in 1949 ron lee ron leo sprinkle was a college student 19 years old at 
the university of colorado in boulder and he and his friend joe wagoner they're both 19 years old 
uh saw flying saucer as leo he likes to use his middle name as leo sprinkle says we watched a 
flying saucer or a daylight disc moving over the campus but at the time he thought only kooks 
saw ufos and he and his friend although they knew they saw something I mean they were there together 
never talked about it with anyone else except each other they were too nervous about ridicule  and had no idea what they had seen so they kept it private but this is what sort of sparked leo's 
interest in ufos and would eventually lead to him becoming one of the leading ufo investigators 
in the united states and perhaps the first to use right to regularly use regressive hypnosis 
to recover missing time in patients who suffer from amnesia in association with a ufo encounter 
so some years uh later after his first encounter that he had a second encounter 
and it was seven years later a summer evening in 1956 uh and he had graduated from college he had 
had four years in the army and had returned to the college to complete graduate school 
he had married his wife marilyn and uh one summer evening in 1956 he and his wife were 
driving from denver to boulder when they saw a brilliant light moving between them 
and the flat irons in the rocky mountains as leo says we watched it for several minutes 
it would hover then move hover then move it had no sound and no features that I could observe 
but I knew something was going on because I could hear the honking of the horns below us  in boulder eventually the object moved off and disappeared leo and his wife were expecting 
it to be front page news the next day but it wasn't there was no mention of it in newspapers 
at all so that puzzled and concerned him and uh this sighting really changed leo sprinkle's life 
he became utterly convinced that ufos were real and felt that they deserved greater study and 
more attention and he decided to get his doctorate in psychology and before long  he became a leading investigator and as I said one of the first researchers 
to really regularly use hypnotic regression to recover lost memories he was the one who 
investigated the case of carl higdon a hunter from wyoming he did hypnosis on 
a lot of the very early ufo cases that we now consider to be classic cases in the ufo field 
so his influence cannot be understated he also started the rocky mountain ufo conference this 
is a ufo conference that was held annually and became a very important place for ufo researchers 
to share what they had learned in their research into the subject so again leo sprinkle is very 
impor an important figure in this field a real pioneering figure there were few real scientists 
who were investigating ufos at this time there was you know jl and heineck and who else james 
mcdonald atmospheric physicist from the university of arizona but really there were not a lot of 
scientists looking into ufos and leo sprinkle was definitely one of them and he's been doing it for 
decades upon decades upon decades he has written a book about ufos and unusual experiences as well 
so he's very influential in the field and what really why I really wanted to include this case 
is because uh I don't think most people know this but dr leo sprinkle has come out of the closet and 
said that he is actually a ufo contactee that he has had an onboard ufo experience 
as a very young child and after you know going through all these repeated ufo sightings he 
realized he had had a very unusual incident as a young child and decided to go under hypnosis 
to explore it and to his shock found out that he had had an on-board ufo experience 
he believes he was taken into a craft and had a conversation with intelligent friendly humanoids 
and these humanoids had a message for him they told him that he had an important mission 
and that he had to learn to read and write very well to educate himself because he was going to 
as an adult he would help a lot of other people become aware of their purpose in their lives 
and then they did something which I find amazing is they kind of gave him a little tour of our 
solar system and showed him the planet saturn and I know how this sounds a little kid being taken 
on board a ufo and shown the planet saturn but this is not unique I know of several other cases 
where this has happened in fact one gentleman I interviewed by the name of joe gardner had this 
exact experience which I wrote about in my book on board ufo encounters in fact he was also a 
young kid and was taken on board a ufo by friendly human looking e.t same thing told to study hard 
and shown the planet saturn it's very strange and this is what happened to dr leo sprinkle who is 
a towering figure in the ufo field and deserves all the accolades that have been heaped upon him 
he's written many many articles many encyclopedia entry entries he's very well educated and 
definitely deserves uh his place on this list as the number six case of ufo encounters in colorado 
all right now we move to number five and for number five I chose the greeny mountain ufo 
incident and if not for the work of researcher christopher o'brien who is a very prominent 
colorado-based ufo researcher this incident probably would not have ever been revealed 
but he was there on the scene and had actually coordinated with police in this area so he was 
able to get information about this directly from the people involved and how this all began 
was in late december of 1993 there was a wave of sightings over the greeny mountain area this is in 
the rio grande county of colorado and there was weird fireballs being seen strange glowing orbs 
inexplicable sonic booms and it was going on all through december of 93 into january of 1994 
the actual incident in question occurred on january 12th 1994 
and how it came to light was when under sheriff brian norton at the rio 
grande county sheriff's office received a call from a norad official about a heat source an 
explosion and a heat source that they had detected by satellite on the north face of greeny mountain 
the norad official told under sheriff brian norton that this satellite wouldn't have registered 
for anything less than a three acre fire and asked him to investigate and in fact as sheriff 
norton says this guy from norad quote told us to expend all efforts to find out what it was
so that's what he did he drove off in his cruiser and searched the area of greeny mountain in 
question and was not able to find anything unusual unknown to him however there were witnesses 
there was in fact a colonel a lieutenant colonel jim lloyd a retired fighter pilot who was driving 
along state highway 67 around the time of this incident this is 40 miles east of the san luis 
valley when he saw a group of six or seven unidentified objects race overhead heading in the 
direction of greeny mountain so meanwhile sheriff norton began his investigation he started calling 
local airports asking if there or any airplanes in this area any missing aircraft all the 
airports in the area denied any information about this sighting and he started calling 
local air force bases they also denied it spokesman jim eckles of white sands 
said that they knew nothing about the colorado phenomena and that they had no missiles 
missing and every air force base he called denied any information about 
any aircraft in this area or any information about any aircraft in this area 
uh so he was just hitting dead you know brick walls and uh decided he would call norad again 
so he phoned norad and he was rooted oddly to a supervisor from fema 
who told him to just forget about the entire incident and when sheriff norton asked for 
more information this officer became extremely belligerent and they ended the conversation
so this was not going well and meanwhile the next day  people started seeing more weird activity there was a soft green light seen by witnesses 
falling towards the sky and falling from the sky towards greeny mountain and one of the witnesses 
said this green ball of light actually struck the mountain itself or appeared to and following this 
uh military aircraft started being seen over greeny mountain which is very unusual 
not only I mean of all kinds there was a b-52 bomber flying low over the site which 
then moved away that was very unusual there were groups of helicopters very closely spaced 
uh clearly looking for something uh judging from their you know grid-shaped 
flight patterns uh some of these er helicopters were black helicopters without any insignia 
and this was seen by not only sheriff brian norton but by other deputies and other 
officers within the police station none who were able to identify where these helicopters might be 
coming from and they not only saw helicopters and the days followed they saw ufos as well and were 
able to use binoculars to observe weird glowing objects which would hover in place over this area 
and they were not able to identify them even with binoculars  so following all of this you know and more weird explosions and sightings 
he called norad back sheriff uh brian norton decided he was going to call norad and see if we 
can get some more information about particularly the military aircraft in the area and he asked 
the officer who answered the phone what are all these helicopters we're seeing up here 
and the norad official responded that's confidential information and refused to 
disclose anything and sheriff norton was puzzled by all the activity he 
you know contacted christopher o'brien he talked to reporters um he went public i'm glad he did 
and as he told reporters and i'm quoting it's strange I really can't make heads or tails of it 
something was there the vet this valley is not known for choppers we don't have 
any in the valley and i'd like to know where these are coming from and what they're doing here
so nobody seems to know what crashed here and nobody was talking and this was 
really causing some concern for sheriff norton and as he says at first 
we were just thinking it was a downed plane or something then the longer it went the  story kept changing we tried to come up with our own conclusions in this matter 
but we didn't have any we just kind of stood around scratched our heads and looked at the sky 
so as january rolled around into february most of the activity stopped but information was still 
coming out about this incident christopher o'brien was digging in a little bit see if you could get 
some more information and uh he certainly did uh there was a lot of reports of ufos following this 
incident for the next uh year or two actually there was quite a number of ufo sightings 
and christopher o'brien was eventually able to locate a source uh quote close to norad close to 
the nord event and who told him that in the two weeks following the original incident some very 
strange things happened one in uh particularly involving suspicious deaths of people who were 
associated with investigating this incident one involved a newly promoted captain at the base who 
was found in her garage dead of carbon monoxide poisoning allegedly she had committed suicide uh 
but christopher o'brien wonders about this because uh he learned out learned that there were other 
suspicious deaths associated with in this incident uh this is what this norad source told him
this source told him that two other people involved in the case also died under suspicious 
circumstances and as christopher o'brien asks what could be so secretive as to warrant death 
well we have seen that in some cases the government is ruthless in their cover-up  there are some suspicious deaths and certainly death threats involved in the roswell ufo incident 
and with other ufo researchers and other people within government 
so this is something that apparently sometimes happened if they can't smear you or discredit you 
uh sometimes they will take more drastic methods  so whether or not that's true I can't say i'm just reporting what I know about this case which 
should be much more well known than it is and that's why I gave it the number five spot 
and now we move to case number four and again this is not a proper ufo incident but a very important 
event in ufo history that had an extremely profound effect on how our government handled ufos 
and how the public perceived ufos and we're still suffering from the effects of this incident today 
for number four I chose the condon committee the counting committee is an official ufo 
government study project which was started by the u.s air force interestingly the u.s 
air force already had official government ufo study body which we now know is project 
blue book unfortunately blue book wasn't really the where the real government studying was going 
on it was going on at much higher levels and project blue book was just a whitewash  it was a publicity stunt dr jayann heineck who was the astronomical consultant 
said as much in his books and he eventually defected from it and was very disgusted because 
whenever blue book would get a case particularly in the later years that was inexplicable 
a good case they would not investigate it in any case that was clearly venus or had a prosaic 
explanation they would spend a lot of effort on it good cases they would try to discredit the witness 
bad cases they were all about spending attention on so it was clear that this 
was not a true investigative body and they just wanted out of ufo research at least from a public 
open official uh point of view perspective and that appears to be why they contracted the air 
or the university of colorado to do an official ufo study the continent committee was headed by 
edward condon he was chosen for uh this study to head the study because he was a nuclear physicist 
a pioneer in quantum mechanics who worked on the super secret manhattan project and was chosen 
not only because of his eminent position as a scientist but because of his alleged lack of 
any stated position on the ufo phenomena publicly he was an agnostic at least this is what he said 
initially also heading the project was dr robert lowe and uh it wasn't long before the condon 
committee started running into problems uh it was the reason the kind of committee 
uh was formed really was because there had been a widespread sighting in dexter 
michigan at hillsdale college and the public was asking for an explanation from the air force 
and so the air force decided they would form this condon committee  they would examine all the reports they'll examine the all the cases from blue book 
and they would come up with a conclusion about the nature of the ufo phenomenon whether ufos 
were real or not and whether or not they deserve study or were any threat to national security 
and uh so that's what they did they collected all these reports from project blue book 
they were funded with 313 000 and were supposed to spend about two to three years studying the 
ufo phenomena they ended up spending 500 000 uh which today's dollars equates to 
almost 4 million dollars so they were spending millions of dollars on this 
ufo subject to study cases that blue book had already investigated so from the very beginning 
pretty much the continent committee revealed itself to be a complete farce and not a true 
investigative body at all this was a years long investigation but just a a year into it or so 
dr edward condon's objectivity became seriously questioned when he announced 
before the investigation was complete that my and i'm quoting my attitude right now is that 
there's nothing to it but i'm not supposed to reach that conclusion for another year 
so this kind of let the cat out of the bag and people even within the condom committee itself 
realized that this was not an objective study and this is when a secret memo was leaked out 
turned out robert lowe had written a memo an internal memo to dr edward condon revealing 
that this investigation was pretty much bogus and that between the two of them they knew that ufos 
weren't real and let me just quote a brief excerpt from this controversial and infamous memo as a lo 
wrote to condon and i'm quoting the trick would be I think to describe the project so that to the 
public it would appear to be a totally objective study but to the scientific community would 
present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to be objective but having 
almost zero expectation of finding a saucer so at this point once this memo leaked several of 
the insiders were fired from the project and a number of the other scientists just flat out quit 
and the whole study pretty much fell apart one of the people who left was dr robert saunders 
who was so disgusted with what happened that he ended up writing a book himself called ufos yes 
which sort of outlined what happened with the conning committee and the congressional ufo  investigations that followed shortly after that partly I think because of 
the failure of the continent committee to address this subject seriously and 
so needless to say the whole thing was a complete disaster and uh the condon committee 
folded on december 17 1969 the condom committee stopped and concluded officially that quote 
nothing has come from the study of ufos in the past 21 years that has added to scientific 
knowledge careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that 
further extensive study of ufos probably cannot be justified we have no evidence of secrecy 
concerning ufo reports so they basically said that ufos aren't real they're no threat to national 
security there's nothing to it uh we should just forget about them pay them no attention 
they don't exist and to put the nail in the coffin of all this they wrote and again i'm quoting a 
related problem to which we wish to direct public attention is the miseducation in our schools which 
arises from the fact that many children are being allowed if not actively encouraged to 
devote their science study time to the reading of ufo books and magazine articles therefore 
we strongly recommend that teachers refrain from giving students credit for school work  based on their reading of the presently available ufo books and magazine articles so yeah I mean 
they were making no bones about it they were saying these ufos are not real and stop studying 
them it was clear they wanted the ufos to go away and people to stop talking about them almost 
immediately this study came under widespread attack from numerous levels of science and 
government actually there was an article in look magazine which was very scathing and 
people all all across the u.s really began to question the objectivity of the content committee 
in fact the american institute of astronautics and aeronautics formed their own committee to 
study the results of the continent committee and after a year of study outright rejected 
condon's conclusion stating we find it difficult to ignore the small residue of well-documented but 
unexplainable cases that form the hard core of the ufo controversy jay allen heineck himself pointed 
out that nearly 30 percent of these sightings that were investigated still remained unidentified 
researcher john g fuller who wrote the ufo or the interrupted journey about betty and barney hill 
and incident at exeter about a wave of sightings in new hampshire he called 
this condon committee a flying saucer fiasco another vocal critic was dr james mcdonald 
atmospheric physicist at the university of arizona and a prominent ufo researcher 
he wrote and i'm quoting in all I believe the contents of the content report failed dismally to 
support the strong negative recommendations which condon has presented in his own summary analysis 
so many people I mean here's john northrup from northrop aircraft in lockheed you know a 
towering figure in the aeronautics industry also bashing the condom committee and as he says 
it was quote one of the most deliberate cover-ups ever perpetrated on the public so he's not mincing 
words uh he's saying they're lying and I have to agree look magazine a very popular magazine 
printed an article about this study given and basically criticizing the condom committee and uh 
this really upset reportedly dr edward condon and robert lowe but it also upset several congressmen 
fact u.s congressman representative roosh wrote regarding the story and look as he 
says the story in look raises grave doubts as the scientific profundity of the project 
i am recommending that we launch a congressional investigation 
and he wasn't the only congressman to say that congressman william h bates agreed and as he 
says and i'm quoting I think it would be good to get another group of scientists to  take a look at this matter so we can be more certain of the decisions which are being made 
and the other was actually a congressional investigation not long after this 
but unfortunately the damage was done counting committees negative conclusions about the 
ufo phenomena were adopted officially by the air force who following that used the content 
committee's conclusions as an excuse to shut down project blue book and this basically shut down all 
public investigations of ufos in regards to you know the public and the air force uh it's certain 
i mean we now know from freedom of information documents that the government was still studying  ufos and very interested in them while at the same time they were telling all of us using millions 
of our tax dollars that nope you're wrong what you saw doesn't exist and you're either lying 
hallucinating or misperceiving that's our own tax dollars at work so the condom committee is a real 
dark spot in human history in terms of the whole ufo movement and I think we'll be looked back on 
uh with a lot of regret uh because this was really the wrong way the wrong direction to approach this 
phenomena and it's very unfortunate because it caused a lot of people to not take ufos seriously 
and to this day we deal with the ridicule factor largely because of the content committee and other 
government ufo studies such as the robertson panel or project blue book so it's very unfortunate 
thankfully now the truth has come out and so that's why the content committee although 
it wasn't a good chapter in ufo history definitely deserves its spot on this list 
all right uh it's been a long journey but now we've made it to the top three cases i'm 
wondering if you can guess what they are but once you hear of it I think you'll probably 
know about these cases because they certainly had a huge huge impact on the ufo field 
and the case I chose for number three is the mutilation of lady the horse 
throughout the mid-1960s ranch owner harry king I was having troubles with ufos and 
military aircraft hovering over his property which was located in the san luis valley 
outside of alamosa near the base of mount blanca uh not far actually from the great sand dunes 
national monument it's a beautiful place I definitely recommend visiting there 
i've been there myself climbed the great sand dunes but so what happened is truly 
incredible he had been seeing ufos for a number of years throughout the mid 1960s 
flying saucers moving very low level over his ranch b-52 bombers all kinds of helicopters 
and he complained to the air force about it but that had no effect this activity continued 
and in may of 1967 harry king was driving along a road on his ranch when a ufo emerged from a group 
of boulders and uh rose up and began to follow his car staying about 150 feet above 150 feet 
behind his car and he stopped his car the object stopped he began moving and so did this ufo 
and he says it followed him for about a mile before suddenly darting away he later learned 
that there were two other people in the area who had also observed what appears to be the same  object and it was a few months later on september 8th 1967 uh something very strange happened 
harry was examining the horses at his ranch to make sure everyone was all right and that they had 
shown up the water hole for their morning feedings and one of the horses was missing 
this is a horse by the name of lady and lady was nowhere in sight she was a perfectly healthy mare 
and uh he had no idea where she was he did not actually own this horse this horse was 
owned by two other ranchers who went by the name of burl and nellie lewis and we're keeping lady 
at harry king's ranch this is where lady spent most of her time so harry was concerned and 
he began crisscrossing the ranch looking for lady and it wasn't long before before he found 
her carcass it was about a quarter mile from the ranch and he was baffled by what he saw 
lady's head was stripped of flesh and uh the brain was missing as were her spine and internal organs 
strangest thing was there was no evidence of any blood  uh he couldn't find any tracks around the animal either about 40 feet away he saw a small bush 
and there was these weird indentations as well surrounding the bush eight strange circular 
depressions in the ground in another direction about 150 feet away another bush also looked like 
it had been flattened and surrounding it there was a 20-foot circular area which was completely 
swept clean of sticks dust and debris as if another object had landed there 
so something had clearly landed on the ground next to lady's 
body he was very puzzled by the lack of tracks surrounding the carcass and so he began exploring 
normally the horses all travel in a tight little herd there and he found their tracks and 
actually followed these tracks and it appeared that this group of horses including lady 
were all running in some sort of a panic at high speed towards the ranch when suddenly lady 
veered from the other animals and began ranting running solo and at some point her tracks which 
were all by it themselves just disappeared and it was as if she had been lifted up into the air
uh the tracks of the other two horses she was with continued to the ranch where they were found  but lady that appeared yet have been lifted into the sky and her body dropped several hundred yards 
beyond where the tracks ended which is where they found her so king immediately uh contacted the 
owners pearl and nelly lewis and they arrived and were also shocked they examined the area 
and nellie lewis reported smelling a strange kind of sweet odor and investigating the area she saw 
a little piece a tuft of lady's mane on a nearby bush about 150 feet away 
where she also found a small chunk of apparently her horse's flesh just cut out of its body they 
called him the police to investigate the police didn't want to they were very skeptical and 
they were not able to get the police out there initially  they ended up contacting dwayne martin of the forestry service who was able to obtain 
a civil defense geiger counter and after testing this area and the surrounding area 
duane martin found that the area where lady was mutilated contained radiation readings 
well above normal so this is some pretty scary physical evidence uh and a pretty good indication 
that this is not normal certainly not predators or anything like that it wasn't long before news 
of this incident reached reporters in the press who arrived in droves along with ufo researchers 
from particularly apro the aerial phenomena research organization  was also very interested in the case they showed up articles started being printed in the newspaper 
some were believing and just kind of reported the facts and others were very skeptical saying 
oh maybe it was predators maybe lady was eaten by ants many of these articles got details wrong uh 
a good number of them called the horse snippy snippy was actually lady's mother but the name 
stuck and this incident became known as the mutilation of snippy for a number of years 
this is how it was reported in several books and in articles about this incident but in fact 
the horse was named lady and uh no one was able to explain what happened to this poor horse uh 
one of the researchers was don richmond uh from apro he came there uh within 
10 days of the incident or so and uh was able to sort of record the landing traces
so uh more researchers arrived ten days following this incident uh 
dr john altschuler was contacted to see if he could provide some answers 
dr john alt schuler was a professor of medicine and pathology at the university of colorado health 
services or sciences and he went to investigate the carcass first hand he was shocked by the 
surgical neatness of ladies wounds and looking at the edges of these wounds he concluded that it had 
been done with some type of surgical cottering blade but unlike any he had ever seen and years 
later when lasers became available for surgery dr alt schuler was struck by the similarity 
of how laser knives laser surgical tools affect tissues it was the same thing 
but what really impressed dr altschuler was uh the lack of blood surrounding the carcass 
as he says and I quote most amazing was the lack of blood I have done hundreds of autopsies you 
can't cut into a body without getting some blood but there was no blood on the skin or on the 
ground no blood anywhere that impressed me the most how do you get heart the heart out without
blood dr alt schuler would later become a prominent figure investigating cattle mutilations 
because he was one of few scientists willing to  look at this phenomena and try to determine its causes and it looked to him like it was 
being done with an advanced technology and he was persuaded that yeah it might be connected 
to all the ufo activity that had been going on in this area and certainly this is what 
burl and nelly lewis believed as did the owner of the ranch himself harry kane
so dr altschuler decided he was going to investigate ufo activity in this area he had heard 
about recent sightings over the sand dunes and so he stayed up in the middle of the night to see if 
they would arrive and sure enough they did as he says and i'm quoting I saw three very bright white 
lights moving together slowly below the sangre de cristo mountain tops at one point I thought they 
were coming towards me because they got bigger then suddenly they shot upwards and disappeared 
so this shook him up badly and he when he realized that this was probably the cause 
of the phenomena of cattle mutilations and he realized he was putting his entire 
career at risk as he if he moved forward but he decided to move forward anyway 
as he says I was unbelievably frightened I couldn't eat I couldn't sleep I was so afraid 
i would be discovered discredited fired no longer would have credibility in the medical community 
my experience in 1967 was so overwhelming to me I denied the experience to everyone even to myself 
it wasn't until years later that he went public and uh or not years later but sometime later uh 
that he went public and started investigating this stuff more openly  and becoming a more prominent figure in this field
he also found out that his sighting was actually more than a sighting he went under hypnosis and 
was shocked to see that he actually had an onboard ufo experience and was confronted with grey type 
or what kind of gray type ets he's described them as having huge heads uh with a very small body
and wide open eyes so yeah this completely changed the course of his life uh afro investigator don 
richmond did his best to record the landing traces but this was some four weeks after the whole 
incident they were still there and in fact there was traces of this for months after the incident
at one point two students from the university of colorado showed up  because they had heard about this incident they had heard about ufo activity in the area 
and they wanted to see if the whole incident was true so they went to see if they could 
locate harry king the owner of the ranch and they did and he confirmed the entire incident to them 
one of these gentlemen actually was would later decide to join the army and army intelligence 
this witness is raymond ingrah ingraham and about three years following this incident he applied 
for army intelligence and to his surprise they began questioning him about his visit 
to the ranch to the harry kane ranch and the whole ufo explanation and it was only 
after he assured them he had nothing to do with apro and was not interested in ufos 
that they agreed to hire him unfortunately he ultimately was not hired due to a medical 
condition but it shocked him that he was being watched so closely that they knew 
that he had actually visited the carcass or I mean the area where a lady had been mutilated 
so this is a very important incident the bones of lady are still on display today 
you can see them and no one has ever been able to explain this and there was a lot of activity 
following this incident and following this is when a rash of mutilations really began to occur across 
the state of colorado and new mexico in particular but really across the united states and the world 
the mutilation of lady is as far as I know the first widely publicized animal mutilation incident 
and caused quite a bit of you know made national headlines  this was a huge incident at the time it's appeared in many many books and has never been explained 
and I gave the top three spot because it marks the beginning of the cattle mutilation phenomena 
in colorado which is a huge huge problem and has yet to be explained 
cattle mutilation phenomena involves mutilation usually of cows but all different kinds of animals 
and follows the pattern we saw with lady of the horse involving the removal of organs eyeballs 
tongues udders blood in an inexplicable way ufos are often seen in conjunction 
and sometimes black helicopters as well ranchers have lost thousands of head of cattle 
and worth millions of dollars and this has gone all the way up to top levels of government to 
try and figure out what's going on and how to deal with it and it is still going on today and 
has not been solved so that's why I included this case and gave it the number three slot
all right now we move to number two and for number two I chose the san luis valley ufo hot spot 
this is a large desert uh valley located sort of central south colorado it's about 40 miles 
wide or so and really beautiful it's a very dry area but has some forested areas it's got mount 
blanco the town of salida is located uh in the center of the san luis valley or in it 
and uh it's well known certainly among locals and has been known for decades as a ufo hotspot 
in fact the native american population has talked about ufo activity in this area for centuries and 
called them you know sky canoes so apparently this has been going on for a very long time 
but was known really only among locals and people who are familiar with the 
area are people who had actually seen it it wasn't until really july of 1989 
when a young man by the name of christopher o'brien decided to move to the san luis valley 
and uh he got a small home he's a musician and a construction worker it wasn't long before he moved 
there that uh he started seeing ufos first it was just a couple of unexplained lights first one and 
then another and he's like wow I wonder what's going on he talked about it to a few people and 
they're like oh yeah yeah ufos are often seen in this area and he began hearing more reports and 
he became increasingly interested but it really wasn't until a few years later december of 1992 
that he went to a party and the buzz of the party was the local sightings over uh I believe it was 
cresttown a bunch of people had seen these weird objects from multiple locations and he became 
really fascinated and started asking people about it and one thing led to another and before he 
knew it he was collecting ufo reports he started officially doing interviews and uh recording them 
and before long he had collected several hundred cases of ufos in the san luis valley it was 
clear to him and to everyone there that this was a major major ufo hot spot and he wanted to know why 
that's not a whole you know it's not super mineral rich though there is a swath of mineral rich 
area running through uh colorado  so perhaps that's a draw but for whatever reason this area is extremely active with 
ufos and thanks to the work largely of christopher o'brien but several mufon investigators really 
this area has now become very well known as a ufo hotspot and the cases include the entire 
gamut of the ufo phenomena it would take hours to cover them all i'm not even going to try 
but they include orb like objects sparklers or weird sort of firecracker-like objects 
large classic saucers cigar-shaped objects v-shaped objects all kinds of objects many 
cases of ufos landing there are a bunch of cases of ufos chasing cars down the highways a couple 
of cases of cars being lifted up off the road very much like what happened to that couple in longmont 
michael and mary so just many many cases these this activity particularly throughout the 1990s 
was very active and there would be fleets of ufos sometimes seen in large numbers 
sometimes there'd be small waves over a period of weeks but christopher o'brien dutifully documented 
all of these many of these can also be found on ufo reporting centers christopher o'brien ended up 
writing a couple of books about all this activity and his investigations they're excellent books 
highly recommended one is called the mysterious valley the other is called enter the valley and it 
turns out it's not just ufo activity there's all kinds of weird ghostly activity or weird cryptid 
activity cryptozoological animals uh other weird unexplained paranormal events 
uh so it's definitely something about this area that it's like it's a a portal perhaps 
very similar to the sedona area in new zealand in arizona the sedona ufo hot spot 
so uh christopher increasingly got drawn into the investigations of animal mutilations and 
unusual animal deaths uads as he calls them and that became 
for some years of I would say his primary focus or one of them certainly and uh he 
after investigating many many cases of mutilations he became perhaps one of the leading 
mutilation investigators certainly in colorado if not the united states 
so yeah I mean there's something going on in this area and it's not just christopher o'brien and 
move fund investigators and reports coming into new fork  there are a lot of reports and more evidence that this area is a truly active hot spot 
comes from what happened to a lady by the name of judy messaline this is such an interesting 
story that I had to include it judy had a home in the san luis valley not far from the town of 
hooper and she knew this was a ufo hotspot she had had several sightings herself over the years 
and she also noticed that uh it was gaining in popularity more and more people were knew this was 
a ufo hot spot and were coming to this area just as kind of tourists to see if they could see ufos 
and in fact peop she had this problem with people camping on her property which was 
a little bit frustrating and uh unable to stop people from doing it she finally just to you 
know if you can't beat him join him she decided maybe she can capitalize on this literally and 
she contacted the local government and asked if she could build a ufo watchtower she contacted the 
sagash county commissioners and asked them if she could build a watchtower which would be 
about 10 feet high or so with a 50 person capacity would have a little gift shop a little garden 
she sent the design plans for her idea to the commissioners and to her delight they approved it 
and she built it and it was an instant and huge success the press loved it they started 
doing reports on it this brought in more visitors and very shortly she was receiving upwards of a 
hundred visitors per day to come and stand on the watchtower either during the day out or at night 
camp out there and see if they could see a ufo and it was successful it was remarkably successful 
month after month year after year people went to the watchtower and began seeing ufos 
it's really quite incredible uh one witness candace nolan she actually lived in the area she 
went out there with a group of people one of them had a 250 000 candlewat power flashlight and they 
were actually able to communicate with this light which would blink back at them in time with the  blinking of their flashlight and this is the sort of thing we're seeing a lot on this watchtower 
people going up there and seeing ufos uh judy messeline has recorded many dozens of cases
throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s on september 2001 there was a sighting over 
the watchtower and uh following that it was pretty regularly january 5th 2002 february 23rd 
may 13th june 10th july 21st uh all throughout the year people will go up there and see usually 
anomalous lights sometimes metallic craft but it was just an idea that she had kind of started on a 
lark and turned out to be hugely successful and has allowed a number of people from across the 
united states in the world to come to the san luis valley and see ufos it's still active today and 
just for a small nominal fee you can camp out at the ufo watchtower and have your own ufo encounter 
so that is the san luis valley sightings uh it does come in waves it seems sometimes active 
and then it falls off a little bit and then it flares up again much as in other areas but 
it is absolutely colorado's most active ufo hot spot and perhaps one of the most active 
in the united states and for that reason I think deserves inclusion on this list 
and because of its contribution in terms of the number of cases it earned second place I 
mean the case number 20 and several cases actually within this list took place in the san luis valley 
and that includes where we're going to next the number one case in colorado 
the case I chose for number one are the salida sightings 
salida is located in the san luis valley and uh in august of 1995 there was a wave of sightings 
late august and uh centered around the town apparently of salida 
how it all began was on how it actually you know got publicized and it sort of became a 
nationwide story and earned its spot here on the on this list is number one was on august 27 
1995. at that time a young girl by the name of brandy edwards was outside and saw this 
cigar-shaped object in the sky she's only six years old just a little girl but she could tell 
it was strange and she's like daddy daddy look there's something in the sky her father was 
tim edwards he owned a little cafe in selita uh he was outside working and so he he ignored 
his daughter at first but she was persistent so finally he looks up and gets the shock of his life 
his mouth drops open and he can't believe what he is seeing it's an enormous cylindrical kind 
of a cigar-shaped glowing object hovering pretty high up but it was massive and it would hover and 
it would dart around smaller objects were coming out of it he quickly uh grabbed his went inside 
grabbed his video camera alerted his wife and his whole family observed this object 
for about 15 minutes tim used his video camera and through the video camera uh he saw
sort of just this uh cylindrical shaped object glowing with a pulsating light which is what his 
video actually shows however his wife and his child were looking at the object through 
binoculars and they got a lot more detail they could see that this object really looked more 
disc shaped to them and it had colored lights on it and they could see these smaller objects coming 
in and out as well so this absolutely electrified tim edwards in fact as he's looking at it 
he started to get almost a message he felt like the ets were showing themselves on purpose were 
communicating perhaps directly and wanted everyone in the world to know about them this 
is the feeling he got as he says and i'm quoting they put some feelings in me i've never had before 
when I was looking at the main craft I got a like an electrical impulse through my body it was very 
important for the world to know the truth now i'm convinced we're not alone I felt deeply at 
the time that I was witnessing something of great scientific and historic importance for the world 
i believe that the august 27th craft was sending a message to the world and wanted to be photographed 
that its appearance was somehow just the beginning of more to come and that I was really fortunate 
to be a part of it so tim edwards released his footage to the media and it went off like the 
explosion of an atom bomb I mean people were just entranced they could not believe what 
they were seeing this was really good footage and it went not only national but international 
it appeared all over news what and actually got onto uh several ufo programs such as 
sightings and encounters so tim found himself the object of a lot of attention 
a lot of people came to visit him reporters and investigators all wanted to know the story and 
it turned his life upside down for sure as he says the first three weeks I was an emotional wreck 
everything seemed so trivial my family couldn't understand my obsession with it
so it wasn't long before this footage found its way to scientists who wanted to scientifically 
examine it and a very well-known image analyst and someone who specializes in ufo photos and 
videotapes is dr bruce mcabee and dr mcabee examined the footage and he was very impressed 
and was not able to identify it and as he says he calls it quote some of the best ufo imagery 
ever recorded in history and he's not the only expert photo analyst to say so 
another photo analyst is jim dillateso of the village labs in tempe arizona 
for many years he had been testing ufo footage and he was also very impressed by the images in tin 
edwards uh videotape and as uh he says jim de la tesso and i'm quoting it is definitely a very 
large solid and three-dimensional possibly cylindrical object at high altitude we don't 
know how large it is yet but the object is clearly emitting brilliant white and colored 
lights is demonstrating unusually rapid darting movements in the sky and we have confirmed on the 
tape the presence of smaller objects coming from it which confirms the witnesses visual accounts 
so they were never able to really determine the size of this object without  you know knowing its size but it was clearly
very large half mile in length a mile in length very hard to say but ultimately they concluded 
that it was at least at about 60 000 feet in altitude and would dart around at a speed 
sometimes in excess of 10 000 miles per hour it was totally silent of course this whole time 
and uh just a very impressive videotape of ufo activity at the time tim edwards thought 
that he and his family were alone with the sighting it wasn't until later he found out  that there were some 20 30 sightings which had occurred around this area around this same time 
some much closer to selita um but really all around colorado there was quite a bit of activity 
in this general area and as the ufo fights  I mean that's significant because the ufo can dart across a state in seconds 
so this was a huge huge sighting when he found out that there was a lot of other witnesses 
he felt a lot better as he says I feel a lot better about the whole situation 
there's a certain amount of relief involved I put our lives and reputations on the line 
when I came out with this and it's nice for someone to tell me i'm right  I never gave much thought to ufos before this happened and when something this unusual happens 
your life is completely changed in a moment it's been a very emotional and stressful time but i've 
never felt better about life i'm totally honored to be a part of what's transpiring 
so what what's amazing about this is not only the footage and that it was a multiple witness  sighting but that there were so many other witnesses who saw what appears to be the same 
or similar objects at this time there was a disc jockey who said that he saw a strange object at a 
colorado national monument following edward sighting there was more reports pouring in 
julie perez of fisk planetarium at the university of colorado said that 
she received several reports and in her opinion these are all different witnesses 
from different locations reporting the same thing that tim edwards himself saw
another witness saw a huge cigar-shaped object over poncha pass 
sheriff al king reported seeing a giant cigarette-shaped object over highway 
285 people all across colorado and leadville and glenwood springs and colorado springs 
observed unexplained objects in the sky so yeah I mean this was not a single sighting this was 
a wave of sightings which seemed to be designed to convince people of ufo presence of ufo reality 
this is what we would call I think a ufo display and it's something we see 
fairly regular and appears to be an agenda on the et's part to announce their presence and 
certainly this is the message that tim edwards got loud and clear as he was videotaping this object 
so it's an incredible case it's never been debunked there's never been any allegations 
of a hoax no no evidence of a hoax to this day brandi edwards still gives interviews on 
it unfortunately her father passed away some time ago but this still remains an extremely 
influential case in the ufo field and I think has convinced many people of the reality of ufos 
and certainly one of the more important colorado events if not the most important which is why I 
gave it the number one spot and that's my list of the top 20 cases in colorado again another 
person may have come up with a different list but that's mine I studied colorado's ufo history 
in depth as I said I actually wrote a book about it called ufos over colorado which 
covers all of these cases and more it's one of several books i've written about various states 
and I picked colorado because I think it has some very important cases that have shaped 
what we believe about ufos and how we think about the ufo phenomena uh so yeah that's it 
these are the cases I chose you know there were many other cases I wanted to add in there there 
was a case involving a move fund investigator who saw a landed ufo that was on june 8th 2005. 
there was an incredible multi-witness case involving a humanoid seen at a park 
in april 7th 1966. there was another case involving a family who owned a ranch 
uh in colorado who have had multiple sightings landings bigfoot encounters animal mutilations 
electromagnetic effects the whole deal but honestly there's so many  cases I could have included but just didn't have the room so I picked the ones I could 
and uh I hope you enjoyed this presentation and happy new year and keep having fun
