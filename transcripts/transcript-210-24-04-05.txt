TEN VERY STRANGE ALIEN ENNCOUNTERS
Apr 5, 2024

Summary:
Apr 5, 2024
It’s one of the strangest and most fantastic experiences a person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an actual ET. And yet it happens more often than you might think. This video presents ten cases in which people have experienced humanoid encounters. These include all different types of humanoids, from short three-foot-tall childlike ETs, to beings almost fifteen feet tall. These cases come from all over the world. Many of these cases are supported by multiple firsthand eyewitness testimony and a wide variety of physical evidence. Are you ready for contact? Because as these cases show, it can happen when you least expect it.

THE ALIENS IN THE FOREST. It was 7am one morning in the Summer of 1956 as MME L took a walk near her home in Vitry-les-Nogent. She was entering the Marsois Forest, right next to the famous Dolmen Pierre Alot when she saw what she thought were two children. But as she approached, she realized they wore jumpsuits and helmets. They were not human!

UFO LANDS IN DRAKESTOWN. Around 7pm on December 30, 1957, George Chowanski stepped outside his home in Drakestown, NJ to chop some wood. His dog began howling as a buzzing sound filled the air. The sky filled with a glowing light and suddenly a flying saucer landed in his backyard. Out stepped three humanoids who apparently found something of interest in his backyard.

ETS ABDUCT A FIR TREE. One night in 1961, Valborg Agren and her friend Tilda were outside the town of Hallviken, Sweden when they noticed a strange light in the field just off the road. Stopping to investigate, they were amazed to see three short figures holding devices that sent red sparks up the trunk of a fir tree. After watching for several minutes, it slowly dawned on them that these figures were not human.

THE VIOLET-YELLOW GIANTS. In the middle of the night on January 14, 1969, the Vas family of Childers, Australia woke to their dog barking and a buzzing noise outside their home. Going outside, all four family members saw a large craft overhead. Suddenly three giant figures in boxy suits exited and began to pick the plants and take soil samples from their yard. Then one of the figures approached!

OFFICER GEORGE WHEELER AND THE UFO. On the evening of April 6, 1975, police officer George Wheeler of Elmwood, Wisconsin was shocked as a fiery oval UFO flew right over his cruiser. He was so shocked that he hoped to have another encounter. One year later, it happened: he saw a structured craft with a humanoid looking out the window. His life was never the same, especially when people in town began reporting their own encounters.

ANOTHER MICHELIN MAN ET. On the night of March 14, 1976, a couple was driving outside of Valencia, Spain when they noticed a strange glowing object in a field off the roadway. Moments later, they saw a strange humanoid figure which looked like the famous “Michelin Man.” He did not appear to be human as he was floating above the ground. As they passed by him, their car’s electrical system failed.

A FAMILY ENCOUNTER. At 10am on August 6, 1976, Freddy Chiasson, his wife, Claire and their two teenage sons drove through Gaspesie National Park in Quebec, Canada. It was very foggy as they saw a beam of light ahead of them on the road. Next, they saw a craft zoom towards them and land. Going to investigate, they saw two 7-foot-tall humanoids. They fled back to their vehicle and the UFO departed.

THE ETS IN THE GROCERY STORE. On September 10, 1978, three boys were watching TV in their home in Burruyaco, Argentina. Suddenly, their TV stopped working, as did their record player and radio. Then they heard a noise in their father’s store which was attached to the house. Going to investigate, they saw two 3-foot-tall humanoids who had trespassed into the store. 

THE MINIATURE UFO & THE 6-FOOT-TALL ALIEN. On the night of September 15, 1978, following a wave of sightings over Carpentersville, IL, a secretary living in the suburbs was awakened by a loud buzzing noise. Going to investigate, she saw a tall silver-suited figure standing outside her home. Even stranger, she saw a tiny flying saucer (3 feet wide and 2 feet tall) sitting right next to her home. She woke her husband, and they tried to call the police, but their phone wouldn’t work.

THE ETS BY THE LAKE. On August 10, 1979, two witnesses saw a strange object on the lake near Czluchow, Poland. One of them ran to investigate more closely and saw two humanoids float into the forest. Shortly later, he and several other witnesses saw the craft rise and dart away. Two dogs who ran up to the humanoids later suffered a strange illness.

The time for skepticism, ridicule and disbelief is over. How many cases will it take before the world recognizes that we are not alone? The evidence speak for itself. UFOs and extraterrestrials are real!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode I
am calling 10 very strange alien encounters as you I'm sure you know by
now I love talking about humanoids these to me are the most interesting aspect of
this whole subject sightings of course are very interesting onboard encounters
are even more fascinating but really whenever any anyone has a humanoid encounters I think it has a lot to teach
us and certainly not only about the ETS but about
ourselves and these cases are just endlessly interesting and have some
really strange aspects and that's what I'd like to highlight in this particular episode some of the stranger types of
encounters strange ETS some of the strange things they do weird sequences
of events so much to learn yeah I love these humanoid cases and I've chosen 10
for you that come from all over the world I do like to highlight that because people sometimes say oh this is
only happening in the US no no no this is happening all over the planet and has
been going on for a very long time the cases I'm going to be talking about today occurred from the in the 50s the
60s and the 70s over three decades and
some really really interesting cases involving of course multiple Witnesses a
wide variety of evidence including Landing traces electromagnetic effects
physiological effects uh animal reactions you name it
there's all kinds of evidence in support of these encounters and the cases I'm covering
today have taken place in areas like Canada across the United States
Argentina in South America all across Europe including let's see France Sweden
Spain and Poland and I'm covering one case from Australia as well so yeah
quite a wide geographical area this one is going to be about an
hour I'm estimating lots of cases to cover let's get started and the first
case I want to talk about today I call the aliens in the forest this took place
way back in the summer of 1956 in a little town called vintry Le
noan this is in France and this is apparently a single witness case but boy
is it interesting uh these little humanoid that this lady saw while taking
a walk in the forest this case involves a lady by the name of Mademoiselle L
she's anonymous she shared her story with French researcher Lionel Danelle
only upon the guarantee of absolute anonymity which of course he granted and
it was about 7 in the morning as madmoizelle L was taking a walk from her
home in nearby vitri Le noan this is a small village and she was going into the
Marsa Forest which was nearby in order to collect mushrooms and grasses to feed
her rabbits and as she was walking down this pathway which leads into the forest
and also leads directly to a famous archaeological site which is known as
the dolme of Pierre alot you can see it here so as soon as she started down this
pathway towards this site about 300 ft in front of her she saw two little
figures walking calmly one behind the other along the edge of the forest and
they were coming in her Direction At first she assumed that they were two young children and she continued to walk
towards them with no concern but it was weird cuz it was early in the morning
and these were quite young children to be out alone and as she got closer her
concern mounted because she realized they didn't look normal and in fact she says they didn't look human now at this
point she had just passed this famous archaeological site the dolman of Pier lot and she stopped in her track
they also stopped and began to stare at her fixedly they were now about 30 ft apart
and she could see that they were just over 3 feet tall they had compact bodies
and short legs they were wearing tight featureless white jumpsuits black
mittens boots and a belt and both had round helmets which totally encased
their heads now these helmets did have reflective visors where the face would be but she could not see their faces so
this was weird and she asked them who are you and it got stranger because
these figures made no response other than to continue to stare at her fixedly
now she said they made no hostile actions they showed no sign of any agitation but they did start moving
their heads up and down as if studying her she said with this indifferent
curiosity they then moved her arms slightly and then turned around and quietly walked into the bushes and
disappeared into the forest she could hear them moving away she could hear their footsteps crackling on the leaves
and branches so this kind of frightened her she didn't panic but she say she felt
tense uneasy and said her heart was beating quite hard because these guys
did not look human they not only looked strange their clothes were strange and they behaved strangely they didn't
respond to her at all so she became convinced this was very unusual she did
calm down quickly finished picking food for her rabbits and returned home now at
no time did she see any UFO so she can't say for sure that they were ETS but she
thinks they probably were she certainly does not think they were children or even human so she eventually contacted
UFO researchers and reported her very strange encounter
what I like about that case is she got really close to these little humanoids
was very interesting the way they stared at her so fixedly to me the most interesting aspect of this case is where
it took place which is right next to a very famous sort of
geological structure some archaeological site with this dolman which nobody knows
apparently who made or quite how long it's been there I am not sure that there's a direct connection to it but
there are a number of cases where very interesting UFO encounters have occurred at
significant archaeological sites so maybe there is hard to say but certainly
an interesting case and so is this next one really fascinating to me this one is
a multiple witness case I call this one UFO lands in drakestown this took place
on December 30 1957 in drakestown New Jersey this is in a fairly rural area
fairly small town and it is somewhat of a brief encounter but boy this UFO lands
in this guy's backyard little humanoids come out and do some very interesting
things uh just all around an interesting case I think you'll
agree this case comes from reporter Enda slack of the do Lake
news and again it occurred on the evening of December 30 1957 right outside the home of George
and Stella chowansky their home is located on schoolie Mountain this is in
drakestown New Jersey and George at the time of his encounter was a 36-year-old
mechanic and the father of three children he did not believe in UFOs and
he admits that he used to scoff at people who reported them needless to say he's not scoffing
anymore around 700 p.m. he stepped outside his home onto the back porch to
cut wood for his stove and suddenly his two dogs began to bark and howl and at
the same time he heard this loud weing noise which he said was quote like the
electric shaver the barber uses on the back of your neck so this caught his
attention and looking up he saw a luminous glow and as it came closer he
realized it was in fact a saucer-shaped object about 15 ft wide 5 ft thick and
as he watched it moved in a sweeping curve coming towards him through a Grove
of trees and landed only about 100 ft from the back porch of his home now he
said it didn't actually touch the ground but seemed to hover about 2 feet above it he immediately called out his wife
Stella who was in the kitchen she came outside took one look at the strange craft panicked fled back into the house
and locked the door now George he stayed outside to watch and was amazed to see
he says three individuals emerg from the bottom of the craft now they were apparently unaware
that they were being observed or didn't care because these three figures proceeded to walk around in this small
clearing and George watched as one of them bent down and picked something up off the ground he couldn't see what it
was but as George says he or it seemed to carry a heavy object into the craft
the whole incident was pretty short lasted he estimates about 2 or 3 minutes
at which point they re-entered the craft the craft rose slowly and spiraled through the tall trees and moved out of
sight so at first George told nobody but his wife wife he was stunned by what he
saw and he really wondered how people might react but he worked at the mechanic's garage nearby his boss Carl
Derby noticed that George who was normally very talkative and cheerful was
strangely quiet so Carl asked him what was wrong and George revealed his story
now it was Carl Who convinced George to speak with reporters George didn't want
to and as George says in his own words I suppose people will think I'm crazy I
suppose there will be lots of sightseers and government men here asking a lot of
questions if I had read it in the paper I'd think the guy was crazy too but I
know what I saw and I wish I hadn't seen it I know it sounds corny Little Green
Men and woring noises but that's what I saw I sure wish I hadn't and his wife
Stella was not happy either and she said I didn't want to talk about
anything I want to forget about it and in fact she refused to talk to reporters
at all now unknown to the chowansky only about 20 mil away to the
Northeast at 461 Longwood Lake Road on the same evening as their
encounter Miss Frederick terpstra looked out her kitchen window and saw what she
described as quote the most awesome site what she said was the most awesome she
had ever witnessed now at first she thought what she was looking at was a reflection of
light but as it began to move to the right she realized it was something much more
extraordinary as she says it was luminous I know it was no plain I
watched it for 30 minutes until it disappeared I don't see how anybody could have missed it so she said said
this object was traveling sort of Southwest along the rim of a mountain about A4 mile away from her house and
initially she didn't tell anybody for the same reason as George and Stella didn't talk for fear of ridicule but
then she read about George chansky's citing in the newspaper and she decided
to come forward because as she says I can verify Mr chansky's story I like
that case because the winess did have a very closeup look at the ETS and the
craft unfortunately it was quite dark so we didn't get a great description and it
is a shame his wife just took one look and said nope I'm going back inside and
I can't blame her for that that's got to shift your hold world view in a split
second and I'm certainly not going to judge someone who says you know I think
I'm just not going to go there I'm going back inside oh it's an interesting case
as well because there was corroboration after this witness did go public
reluctantly uh another witness stepped forward makes you wonder how many people
are actually seeing various aspects of these encounters some do see it land and
are right up close to it but others all around the area are probably seeing this
and I do encourage people to come forth and speak about it because one person's
report can be very much bolstered by another person who comes forward says
yeah I saw it too so an interesting case now here's a
case which occurred in Sweden which is really unusual this is a multiple
witness case and I don't think I've ever heard of a case quite like this one I
call this one ETS abduct a fur tree and I say that because apparently this tree
disappeared following an counter you can make up your own minds about it but it appears to be a legitimate case occurred
in 1961 in Hall Vin hammerd doll
Sweden and it's a super interesting case because the Witnesses were quite close
to these apparent ETS who were doing something very unusual never heard of
anything quite like it the Witnesses were very reluctant at first to label
this as anything extraterrestrial and kept trying to put a military
explanation over it though it didn't hold water and further research showed
that no this probably wasn't military the main Witnesses in this case are two
ladies by the name of valberg agran and her friend Tilda it was a clear night one day in
1961 as these two ladies were walking and noticed some strange light about 450
ft on the left side of the road near the house that they had rented in halvin
Sweden and I will just quote volborg directly as she says closest to the road
was a flat surface a large field interrupted by small Groves here and
there with the nearest Grove as a background we saw two figures standing
very still they had some kind of helmets on their heads and fairly shiny dark
coats some of them looked like they were wearing oil cloth in front of them on the ground were a lot of hoses that
coiled around like when you turn on too much water pressure on a water hose and
these hoses seemed to have dead ends and from them came a rain of Sparks so this looked very unusual to
them and while these two figures Stood Still a third figure was jumping with
weird long strides back and forth between what looked like hoses now it
was too dark to see very clearly but it looked to both volberg and Tilda as if
these figures were wearing something like gas masks so these hosik devices were aimed
at a particular fur tree whose trunk began to Glow with a reddish light and
the figure which was moving back and forth would approach the tree and do something which they couldn't quite see
at which point this weird red glow would rise to the top of the tree trunk
increase in brilliance and a bright white round glow about 3T wide would
appear at the top of the tree and then it would fade and this happened over and over again four or five times as the two
women watched so this took them a long time to come forward um she didn't want to do it
to convince anyone she says people can believe what they want she just wants to know if anyone else had experienced
anything like this now she knew that there were some skiers from the military in the area and wondered if the light at
the top of the tree might have been a a light to guide skiers but everything was
so strange uh they as they watched this they considered leaving the area to find
a better vantage point but instead stayed there and continued to watch and
as it just went on and on they finally decided to move a little closer along a small Road and although they did get a
closer view they still couldn't understand what they were seeing so they started to walk closer but seeing that
this was becoming increasingly strange and hard to explain they became frightened they were two middle-aged
women that's how they described themselves and they were afraid to approach this group of strangers doing
something mysterious in the forest and there was nobody else in the area so
they finally just left and went home this point they're still thinking it might be military but they're confused
because it did not look normal and by the time they returned home it was almost midnight and valberg tried to get
her husband to get dressed and return immediately to the scene but he refused
so the next day he she did convince him to return and they went to this spot and
they got a shock the figures of course were gone but so was the tree it was
just no longer there and she then began to wonder if it was even a tree that she saw cuz if it was why didn't burn up
what were these Sparks she was still trying to explain it as some kind of military exercise but there wasn't even
a stump or any evidence of a tree having been there and she wasn't even thinking of ETS at this point but she became even
more puzzled when she decided to report this to authorities and authorities went to
investigate and they did a thorough investigation they told her that no there were no skiers in the area the
farmer who lived right near this hadn't seen anything they said the military weren't doing any exercises there that
they were aware of nor could they find any sign of any tree or any sign of any
fire so she now became convinced that she had seen very unusual ual figures
perhaps ETS and she wrote a letter to a newspaper reporter who had covered
previous UFO stories she doesn't remember getting any response from him
she never did get any satisfactory explanation for what she and Tilda saw
that night I know how unusual this case sounds of a tree disappearing though I
do know of other cases like that I do recall a case in Arizona where a
gentleman swears up and down that he and his friend saw a UFO
basically take a cactus and there are quite a few cases of ETS collecting
leaves and plants of all kinds Twigs dirt samples and of course animals as
well so it does fit the pattern but yeah I mean it's undeniably a very strange case which is
why I included it in this collection and here's another case which is so
interesting to me and it does fit the pattern that I've seen in other cases I
call this one the Violet yellow Giants and the Witnesses in this case
it's a whole family so definitely a multiple witness case with some interesting animal reactions and
physiological effects but really it's the appearance and behavior of the ETS
in this case that caught my attention this took place on January 14 1969 in
Australia more specifically in the tiny little town of Childers this is in Queensland
Australia and I think you'll find it a really interesting case this absolutely
astonishing report comes from Australian researchers Colin Norris Keith
basterfield and Bill Chalker they all reported on it and it was reported in
newspapers as well researcher Bill Chalker called it a strange story indeed
even by UFO standards the main Witnesses are the vas
family including George Voss a repairman his wife milanka you can see them here
and their two daughters who were age 14 and 13 at the time their names were Olga
and Maria family had immigrated from Romania to the small town of Childers Australia
which is located about 200 M north of Brisbane it was around 4:30 a.m. on
January 14 1969 when the family was woken up by The
Barking of their dog eeka they lived in this little trailer at the same time
they heard this loud buzzing sound quote like a big swarm of wasps and as George
says in his own words I heard a noise like a big swarm of wasps only much
louder I rushed round the side of the Caravan but could see nothing then Maria
who had been sleeping near the window yelled that she could see something above the trees when I got to the other
side of the Caravan the others were outside too we all saw the
spaceship so they had exited their small trailer to investigate this noise and were shocked to see this huge craft they
said it was about 75 maybe 90 ft in diameter and was shaped much like a
Mexican sombrero pretty much a classic Flying Saucer was hovering at Treetop
level about glowed a brilliant violet color and there were other sort of
opalescent colors swirling around it now suddenly a beam of light was emitted
from the center bottom of the craft and another craft came out of it it had the same shape but much smaller and out of
this smaller craft came three beings which the family said were quote about
three times as large as humans and had blocky arms and legs and shapeless
bodies now these three figures all glowed with this bright violet and
yellow light and as the vast family watched these three beings paid no attention to
the family but began to collect samples of sugar cane and other plants were
growing in the area at one point as these figures gathered these samples now
this went on for 10 minutes one of the beings came very close to the family and
George Voss called out in alarm but this giant humanoid paid him no attention
whatsoever just picked up several rocks and moved back towards the other humanoids and the craft and it's weird
because as these samples were gathered the samples seemed to be sucked up through a trans parent funnel that led
directly into the main craft so after about 10 minutes they
re-entered the smaller craft which took off vertically into the larger one and
the larger one took off and as it did so the family said that their own body hair stood up quote as if affected by a form
of magnetism and as George says they took off so quickly going straight up
even after it had gone we could could still hear a faint sound like a single
wasp so later they reported to researchers and George Vos admitted that
in fact he had been visited twice before once in 1918 while living in Romania and
a second time in 1946 in Belgrade so apparently it looks
like it he is a contact D hard to say for sure but what an unusual case I
think there's a lot to learn from that case it's a really good example of people being drawn outside by The
Barking of their dog this weird buzzing sound coming very close to these gosh
must have been 15 feet tall they didn't say that directly but they said that these ETS
looked three times the size of a normal human so I guess I'm being conservative
you know putting a normal human at 5 ft could make these ETS 15 ft tall I guess
it might be hard to estimate for sure but they were quite close to these humanoids and as I said one of them did
come right up to them it's unfortunate they didn't get any real communication but yeah it's another
example of ETS collecting samples it's really interesting the way these samples
were being just sort of sucked up right into the craft and I like this case cuz
there are four Witnesses and when you have so many witnesses describing the same thing
lends an extra level of credibility to it I also found it interesting how they
described that when this craft took off they felt their hair literally standing
on end so there's some kind of electromagnetic field being emitted from
this craft that's a very common detail which I don't think certainly back then
a lot of witnesses would have been able to make up so yeah another really
interesting case come from all over this planet and here's another one you may
have heard of this case it did get a lot of publicity at the time it occurred I
call this one officer George wheeler and the UFO all of these cases do involve
humanoids and this one does as well though he didn't have necessarily a face
Toof face encounter he did see them through the window as we'll see this took place on April 22nd
1976 in Elmwood Wisconsin this is a tiny little town but this encounter turned
out not to be a oneoff uh in fact the officer had
another encounter and it turns out that many many people in this tiny little
town are having encounters there's something about it and I think I might
know what it is because there's some talk about why ETS are drawn to this town in particular
but it certainly as I said put this town on the map in a big way and there was an
enormous amount of publicity and the repercussions from officer Wheeler's encounter are still being felt today as
we shall see this very strange and unusual case caught the attention of many prominent researchers such as
Robert Pratt Jack bastra Jim enoro Lorenzen and others this case does invol
multiple Witnesses but primarily police officer George wheeler who at the time
of his encounter was 70 years old he was a former state trooper a combat pilot in
World War II he was not a Believer at the time of his Encounters in terms of believing in UFOs as he says before I
more or less Shrugged them off of course this all changed on the evening of April
6 1975 and George at the time was working as a relief police officer and he was on
patrol just north of this very small town of Elmwood Wisconsin which then had
a population of about 730 people it's still a really small town actually but
suddenly he saw what looked like a huge airplane in distress which was coming
over a hill to the Northeast and pretty much heading right towards him he
immediately stopped his car and watched and it became clear to him that it was coming directly towards him so he exited
his car and dove into a nearby ditch and he expected to hear the Roar of jet
engines as this object passed over him but instead there was just complete
silence and this object instead of being a plane had the appearance of a fiery
sort of cigar-shaped object with rounded ends he estimates it was no higher than
50 00 ft and huge about the size of a football field and it moved over him and
off into the distance now he wasn't really thinking UFOs at this point it was too shocking
he was wondering if it still might be a 747 or another large aircraft about to
crash or in the process of crashing so he got back into his Cruiser and drove
in the direction that this object had disappeared and moments later he came upon it but this object was not crashing
it was now hovering motionless apparently in full control just sitting
there in the sky but no sooner did he watch this when it suddenly accelerated at he says tremendous speeds making 90°
turns without slowing and it took off to the West as he says I snapped my fingers
and it was gone couldn't see nothing the sighting would end up having
a huge impact on his life life not only by convincing him in UFOs but there were
some pretty severe consequences as George says I just didn't believe in them but
now I do what is so fantastic about it is that it could turn on a dime without
slowing but what saved me is that as soon as I knew what I was seeing was not
an airplane indress I called the sheriff department and the dispatcher told me
not to get excited that they were seeing it too what saved me is that several
other respected persons in Pierce County saw the same thing so afterwards he went home his
wife knew instantly that something was wrong he told her what happened words
spread quickly and the story became printed up in several
newspapers George quickly realized his life was never going to be the same as he says
I realize that it is difficult for someone who never has seen one of these things to get excited about it but when
it happens it can change your whole life so it not only changed his viewpoint but
he began to suffer from unexplained unexplained headaches and a general
feeling of Mala and unwellness and as George says nobody
seems to be able to determine what my ailment is I'm reluctant to say it but I think it
is possible I got a good do dose of radiation from that
UFO so this changed everything for him following the encounter he couldn't stop
thinking about what happened he found himself constantly searching the skies and hoping for another sighting as
George says I'm a firm believer that they are coming back that I will see
them again I'm dying to get another chance at seeing one I'm ready now so
little did he know he would soon get his wish but he would regret it he retired a
few months later and was working as only a Reserve officer and it was one year
later around 11: p.m on April 22nd 1976 and he was in his squad car on
patrol when he saw a strange glow so he wasn't thinking UFO he
thought there might be a fire and he drove to to the top of a little area
known as Tuttle Hill to investigate and instead of a fire he saw
a structured silver craft roughly saucer-shaped with six blue white lights
or Port holes perhaps uh you can see his drawing here
he said it hovered about 500 ft away maybe 100 feet off the ground right next
to a limestone Quarry he saw what looked like Landing legs and what looked like a
Hos likee device on the bottom of this craft extending down into the trees but
most shocking was he saw Shadows of movement inside the craft as if a person
or persons were moving around inside he said the top of the craft
glowed with a blindingly Brilliant Orange white light which George said was
quote like looking into the sun this was a big craft he estimates 250 ft across
and as large perhaps as a twostory building so huge and as he's watching
this object suddenly began to rise up at high speed at the same time emitting a
blue flash or perhaps a beam of light right at him he's not sure but it caused
the lights and radio in his squad car to fail there was a loud whooing noise and
that's all he really remembered the next thing he remembered is that his radio was coming to life and someone was
asking him if he needed assistance but he was actually talking to the police at this time he just
doesn't fully recall that apparently because this quite traumatized him but
George told the police my God it's another one of those UFOs or
spacecraft so he's dazed he's very much confused by what just happened he's sort
of sitting there in his squad car trying to recover when David moots an Elwood an
Elwood Dairy Farmer who lives in the area Came Upon George shortly after this
incident now David described George as very much dazed later researcher Jack bastra
interviewed George and others in the area and learned that there were other
Witnesses the O'Brien family who lived by the Quarry where this object was hovering said that their TV quit working
very briefly but exactly during the time of this sighting also a nearby Farm
family uh the O'Brians reported that their dogs were
barking and did not respond to being called which was very unusual there was
a firsthand witness to the object Miss miles werland and she said that exactly
11:00 p.m. she looked out the kitchen window and saw quote a bright orange
moon-shaped object hovering directly above ptle Hill another witness was Paul
fredericksen who actually received a call from the wife of the chief of police who was concerned about this
strange glow and asked Paul to go look outside he did and he saw quote an
orange glow like a moon or a half moon hovering over the hill so he saw what
was apparently the same object now police chief Jean Helmer was
monitoring the police scanner when George called in to say he was watching this UFO and George was actually
describing it George does not remember this part when the radio went dead repeated attempts to contact George on
the radio failed so Chief Jean Helmer who was about a quarter mile away drove
directly to Tuttle Hill and this is when he found both George and David moots the Dairy Farmer sitting there Chief Helmer
said that he had never seen a man as frightened as George was George was rushed to the hospital given sedatives
but he ended up remaining in the hospital for 3 days this is how badly
this experience frightened him uh in fact he was released but returned
shortly later to the hospital and remained for 11 days because of persistent headaches and really bad
nightmares about this incident his wife said he would wake up screaming so police chief Jean Helmer
did take down a written statement from George and they found out something else
after the incident George's patrol car which had recently been serviced and tuned up it needed to have all the spark
plugs replaced the starter also began to malfunction but yeah this affected
George pretty badly as police police chief Helmer said I've seen wheeler
under all kinds of conditions relating to police work and I've never seen him shaken up like he was on that
night but the weirdest aspect is that following this incident George's memory
of the event largely disappeared he couldn't remember any of the details but in further support of his
encounter however was that others were reporting sightings both before and
after George's encounter in fact over the years there would be at least 40 or
50 documented Encounters in and around this tiny community of
Elmwood I mean if there was a lot of encounters that this town began to receive a lot of attention from UFO
researchers this had big consequences the town eventually organized an annual UFO Festival which
is apparently still being held to this day each July they also tried to fund and build a UFO
landing pad that never materialized but yeah this town of Elmwood has now become
very famous as a UFO hotspot there is a little sign commemorating George
Wheeler's encounter poor George wheeler he's not happy about it he takes a
pretty dim view because he did become ill following his encounters and he
later told reporters I don't know what I saw but all I know is that I don't want
that experience repeated ever again a sad end note is that he did pass away
about six months after his second encounter again he was 70 years old old
but yeah the city of Elmwood has embraced the UFO subject and now holds
these annual UFO festivals so how about that makes you want to move to this
little T of Elwood Wisconsin doesn't it I certainly would like to visit it's
very interesting because these events had such a profound impact on this tiny
little community that they have this annual UFO Festival that there's a sign
a little Memorial plaque put up commemorating this encounter I mean 40
50 Encounters in this one small town that's no joke something is clearly
going on there so maybe it is this uh electromagnetic you know electrical
station that they're drawing electricity and that's what's drawing these craft there's a quarry there as
well we have seen a lot of cases of UFOs hovering over mines and quaries and
places of geological interest I don't know I honestly think when one person
comes forward with their encounter it encourages others to and there can be a snowball effect that makes an area look
like it's a hot spot when really all over the world people are being visited
encounters are happening but they just slide under the radar because most people aren't talking about it the fact
that this witness was a police officer and went public and that there were other people who saw what he was seeing
lends a lot of credibility to his account and when you combine that with the physiological effects and the
electromagnetic effects and so forth well it's undeniable something clearly
went on in Elmwood and apparently has been going on for years so what an
extraordinary case and now we move to the next case which I wanted to include because this
keeps happening I call this case another melin man ET the melin man of course
being the advertisement for tires the melin man dressed up in this costume
that if you look at it does look very eish and there are accounts coming from
all over the world of people describing ETS that look just like the mitchellan
man and that's what's true in this case which occurred on March 14
1976 in Valencia Spain this is a very brief encounter but certainly super
interesting because of this aspect and I don't know you can make up your own mind
about it but I find it fascinating this case from Spanish researcher ignasio
benvenuti cabal is again quite brief but really interesting it was around 9:45
p.m. on March 14 1976 as an anonymous couple from
Valencia Spain were driving on the road between Lia
andoa as you can see here this is just a s short distance of about 7 miles or
around 11 km and suddenly they noticed a bright oval-shaped object hovering off the side
of the road now they really didn't think much about it until they drove another thousand feet or so down the road and
saw a strange figure facing them walking in their Direction along the left side
of the road and they immediately noticed several strange
details now it was dark but they could see that this figure had lights on the side of its head it was quite tall was
wearing a dark shiny suit which was very bulky and rounded and as they drove
right up to him they could see that this figure looked very much like the famous mitchellan man used in advertisements
for automobile tires he appeared to be wearing a helmet though they couldn't be
sure about this because it was dark they couldn't see its face but they did notice that that this figure's arms were
not moving as he walked and looked almost as if they were glued to its body
and had firm fists they said and not it didn't wasn't walking in a normal
fashion they said instead it appeared to move with the feet together kind of waddling and they said it actually
looked like it was floating along the side of the road because they could see what looked like a cloud of dust below
it now as they passed by it their car's lighting system
dimmed According to some it actually went out some of the reports say this
but they did later discover that their electrical system was permanently damaged and actually had to be
replaced but they quickly drove off did not look back and that was the end of
that until they reported it to researcher ignasio Ben venuti Cabra
convinced that they had seen some kind of ET and its craft there are so many
cases of people who are just driving along and see some strange ET walking along the road probably they would never
have thought anything of the UFO they had just seen moments earlier if they had not seen this strange melin man type
figure I suspect that this is some sort of what we would call a space suit I
don't know but it's a fascinating case because there are so many reports of this type Ty of appearance of an ET and
that's why I wanted to include it it's fascinating but moving along and this
next case is just a wow case I call this one a family encounter this one occurred
on August 6th 1976 in gaspe National Park this is in
quec Canada it's a super fascinating case in a very rural area where this
family is driving along through this park and have an encounter that I am
sure they will never forget very unusual looking ETS and it's quite unusual what
happened to them as a result of this encounter this case comes from French Canadian researcher jeene Ferguson who
wrote about in his book titled Le human noad which means of course the
humanoids and it was around 10 a.m. as Freddy shazone his wife Claire and their
two teenage Sons Morris aged 19 and Ronnie age 15 were driving through gaspy
Park this is a large nature area and they were heading towards the town of
Matan when suddenly a brilliant beam of red light penetrated the fog and Shone
down from above onto the road in front of them now again this was 10 a.m this
is morning it's very foggy but this light is making a shape of a Sharp edged
Circle that's very small about 6 in wide and for the next several miles this
circle of light stayed right ahead of them apparently pacing the car until
suddenly it broke up into several sections then came back together and
sort of Rose upwards so after the light retracted the family of four looked to the left
and they saw this dazzling white light about a half mile away this light
immediately began to approached them and stopped directly over the road ahead of
them all four members of the family could now feel a very strong heat coming from this object this of course caused
Freddy to stop the car and at the same time he stopped the car the car
headlights and radio actually went out and the engine died Freddy cried but was
unable to restart the car they all four noticed also an unusual quote acid odor
which they said irritated their nostrils so they were very curious about
what was happening and all four of them exited the car and began to approach this intense but sort of fuzzy white
light ahead of them and walking just a short distance they were amazed to come
upon a sort of scallop shell shaped object pretty much a flying saucer about
40 ft wide 15 ft High resting on Landing legs directly on the road they said it
was actually wider than the road itself it appeared to be made of dull metal it
had four 3ft wide squarish Windows around the perimeter and these windows were
apparently the source of the light that they were seeing but as they approached they became dimmer they heard a strange
sound which they described as like wood rubbing on wood and this was being emitted by the object at regular
intervals so it was Claire the mother who looked up into the window and she was the first to see a quote massive a
face with large eyes staring down at them so she screamed and pointed to the
window they all looked up Freddy looked up and he saw this face which he said
made him feel like vomiting he also noticed something strange the window was not normal he
said it looked like it was made of a quote a soft material kind of reminded him of looking through water but this
quite frightened them all four of them retreated back to the car but after a
few moments they became curious again and the two kids the teenagers Morris
and Ronnie got out and their father followed them and they began again to
creep forward to investigate and they got pretty close about 10 or 20 ft from
this object which was still there they now saw that the port holes were dark
but there were two beams of what looked like blue green light coming from The Far Side of the object shining down
towards the witnesses Freddy's eyes he says immediately began to water and he
promptly vomited then the beams of light became extinguished and now all three of them
could see these figures Three Strange humanoids and they were quite tall about
7 feet tall they said bald no hair with kind of yellowish faces very large round
eyes with no apparent eyelids they didn't see or notice any ears or nose
but they said that the beings did have again yellowish skin what appeared to be thick red lips kind of squarish chins
and their bodies were very stocky with wide High shoulders rounded bodies they
were wearing what looked like cocky Brown uniforms sort of quote like a
policeman's but close fitting now Freddy described them as very ugly and he says these weird
emotions began to pulse through him which he likened to Terror and rage so
this he had a very strong emotional reaction to this they did see that both these humanoids
were holding one end of what looked like tubes or hoses about 3 ft long which
were resting partly on the road leading to the craft they believed actually that
these tubes might have been the source of the light coming at them moments earlier they're not sure but these
beings were standing still but did turn their heads to apparently examine the
witnesses and there was a little bit of a hand off here these figures stayed
there and the three Witnesses also stood there for about 5 minutes after which
they finally decided to retreat back into the car the father again vomited
they all retreated into the car suddenly the road ahead of them blazed with intense light another wave of unbearable
heat filled the car getting hotter and hotter to such a degree that they all C crouched down to protect themselves so
this heat was increasing and just getting more and more intense when suddenly the light went out the heat
gradually went away and then the four of them looked back up over the windshield
and saw that the thick fog was now almost completely dissipated of course
the object and humanoids were now gone all that was left was a slight luminous
Vapor where the object had been and here's the weird after effect afterwards
for about 10 hours they said they all suffered from intense itching all over
their bodies I'm very happy for the witnesses that they you know this wasn't just a single witness encounter which
can be quite stressful for a person but no this was a whole family um father a
mother and their two uh Teenage children and not just a simple UFO
sighting but this craft Landing block them their path forward on the road two
very tall humanoids their car getting knocked out in terms of you know the
engine uh very strong sense of heat uh the fog disappearing as a result of this
apparently this craft just an interesting allaround encounter with a very unusual type of humanoids as well
and yeah quite frightening clearly for the witnesses I suspect that the father
you know vomiting twice might be as a result of his fear rather than anything
particularly physiologically affecting them hard to say for sure only they would know but yeah was professionally
researched as most of these cases are by experienced investigators to me one of the most
interesting aspects of this encounter is that they all experienced severe itching
for 10 hours uh it's not unusual for people to have a reaction on their skin
or you know after effects on their retina or something along these lines so
perhaps the exposure to this heat source is what causes this itching but
apparently they all recovered and are no worse for the wear but certainly a
fascinating encounter as all of these are I mean I just love these humanoid cases and here's another one which is
really strange I don't know that I've heard of a case even remotely like this
this one I call the ETS in the grocery store and yeah the store was closed at
the time of this encounter this is not ETS walking around during shopping hours
but a very interesting case which occurred on September 10 1978 in
Argentina and actually the name of the town is Boko Argentina Ina this is a
well researched case it's interesting cuz it does have multiple
Witnesses uh the description of the ETS is very unusual there are some
corroborating Witnesses in the area who saw activity
so pretty credible I think and really unusual for sure definitely fits the
theme of this episode of being very strange this case from Argentinian
researcher Jorge Eduardo ktoa definitely qualifies as a strange
Alien Encounter this took place along the lelas Route
305 near the town of buru yako uh this is northeast of tucuman
again in Argentina there were three Witnesses Miguel anel
Carvajal and Miguel lzma both who actually worked at carbajal's father's
store and also their friend Jose contras was with them he was
handicapped now Miguel carbajal and Miguel lezma they both have the same
first name were watching an action movie with their friend Jose when the picture on the television
screen suddenly became distorted started shrinking down and becoming totally unwatchable
now they assumed that there was a drop in power so they just turned off the television and tried playing the record
player but the record player also malfunctioned in a weird way spinning too fast so persistently they tried
turning on the radio to listen to a football game but they couldn't do that either because the radio was giving off
all this static and this is when they heard a noise in the store now this
store was connected directly to the home so they immediately thought there might be a thief in the story and they were
quite frightened by this they quickly helped their handicapped friend Jose out
of the house and put him in a safe location and then then returned to the
store to investigate and upon entering into this little convenience store they
saw that a wine bottle and a jar of mayonnaise were lying broken on the
floor they noticed a few other things had been Disturbed a scale was broken
and the store calculator had been moved from its original position and of course they immediately
saw two strange figures who were immediately recognizable by them as not
human as Miguel C says I was afraid because I saw them all of a sudden I
could not speak I thought they were martians they were dressed in a bright blue suit
like that used by frogmen so by that he means divers so these figures were also
wearing blue helmets shiny blue boots what looked like shiny black gloves and
these were short little guys both about 3 feet tall uh they could see their
faces they had Brown sort of freckled or Pock marked skin now Miguel had read
about UFOs and aliens in the local newspaper Miguel C and he he realized
very quickly that they were probably looking at ETS and in fact he noticed that one of
them was holding a device which looked to him a little bit like a hair dryer he
immediately assume assumed this might be a weapon though he doesn't have any direct evidence of
this but uh Miguel said that the ET spoke
telepathically saying that he was going to take them to the saucer do not shout
or we take you to the saucer this was what he believed the ET told him now the
investigators questioned this because the boys admitted they were quite frightened and they weren't sure they understood this perfectly uh cuz they
were very much in fear and shock but at this point one of the ETS did something
peculiar as Miguel carbajal says one of the beings raised his hand putting his
index finger to his nose and they disappeared appeared now how they left the witnesses don't know as the store
doors were closed they did however hear a very strange noise when the beings
disappeared Miguel immediately grabbed the keys from the cash register and Was preparing to leave they were heading for
the door when the beings reappeared in the same place that they had just vacated so both of the Miguels returned
back into the store but this time they armed themselves um holding an iron bar
and a knife to confront the humanoids should they prove to be hostile they weren't the ETS promptly disappeared
again and reappeared at a slightly different location still in the store
but as Miguel L says I approached slowly the beings threw a case of cigarettes at
me immediately I started running towards the exit door which carbahal had managed
to open so the boys had had enough they were frightened they fled and
immediately went to Miguel carbajal's father and told him that thieves were in
the store so together they all went to the police and the police returned with
them to the store to find that nobody was there uh they did find the wine
bottle and the mayonnaise on the floor and the other details but there wasn't any money missing so really it was just
the boy's word about what they had seen however later researchers did learn that
there were sightings seen at the nearby Salt Factory earlier and this Factory is
only about 600 ft from the store and whether it's related or not there was a nearby Home who said that
they had a poltergeist outbreak of some kind where Stones were being thrown at
their house from no discernible source so yeah some strange details there but
certainly an odd case so what do you think strange yeah definitely I'm not
sure why ETS would enter into a little convenience store like this move around
some of the stuff knock over a wine bottle or a mayonnaise I think uh jar
but it is what it is I mean I don't think these Witnesses are lying uh it caused quite a bit of
attention and it's a super fascinating and very unusual case
now here is another one which I had to include in this episode because it's
another case that just makes you scratch your head and go hm what is going on
here I call this one the miniature UFO in the 6ot tall alien and you'll see why
I call that when we get into the details but this case occurred on September 15
1978 in Carpentersville Illinois I like this case because while the
primary incident is a single witness case it does have some interesting apparent Landing traces and quite a bit
of activity going around in this area around that same time so you can make of
it what you will here are the facts this very strange and unusual case was investigated by alen
Henry he is part of cuos the center for UFO studies founded by Jay Allen heinik and this
case was later published in their journal the international UFO reporter now it was about August of 1975
when more than a dozen a dozen residents of Carpentersville Illinois including
police officers began to report seeing a fast moving UFO over the town now
descriptions of this UFO varied some said it appeared as quote red green and
white lights others said that no it had a whitish glow inside and an orange glow
around it still others described it as an orange glow surrounded by three lights so whatever its appearance it was
unusual enough that many people felt compelled to call the police number of the witnesses came from
one area San Juan Street in Carpentersville and they said that not only did the object look strange it was
maneuvering in strange ways it was moving in One Direction and made a horseshoe movement then hovered and
then shot up vertically one of the witnesses was Scott pinchuk age 18 he lived at 143
Adobe Circle and he told the police quote my friends and I saw two rotating
objects in the sky as we were going north on Tulsa Avenue we stopped the van
and watched it through my binoculars as it hovered overhead head it was disc shaped and looked about 4 and 1/2 in
Long through the binoculars so there were other witness Witnesses including Michael R lump
Michael G zarbok Melody Howell they called the police who also observed the
object through binoculars and they told the police that they had been seeing this object for the last 10 days that
there were more of them and sometimes they were flying in formation so this was a series of
sighting which caught a lot of people's attention but it was 3 years later actually when this very strange
encounter occurred in this same town of Carpentersville
Illinois a 26-year-old secretary said that she was awakened around 4 a.m. by
this strange weing noise so she looked out her west facing window where this
noise was coming from to see what it was and as she approached the window the noise suddenly stopped
but she kept looking outside anyway to investigate and was concerned and amazed
to see the silhouetted form of a 6ot tall humanoid figure she could clearly
see him although he did stand behind some bushes so she couldn't see his entire body but she saw enough to see
that he was dressed in this strange silvery suit and looking around she then
saw something even more strange to her left and down on the ground right next
to her house at the edge of her lawn she saw a very small silver domed
saucer it was clearly uh a metallic object it was
sharply defined opaque perfectly smooth and as she looked at it she could now
hear that it was making a soft weing noise so she believes this was the
source of the sound she had heard and yeah tiny she said it was no larger than
3 feet wide and 2 feet tall so she went
back inside her dog at this point a Britney spaniel was started barking furiously she woke up her husband and
quite frightened told him let's get out of here but they decided to call the police they first called the operator to
get in touch with the police but weirdly their phone went dead it was just
briefly they tried again and they got a recording this time that said can't complete call as dialed which is also a
little strange but shortly later the dog stopped barking they called the police
again this time got through the police arrived quickly but by then the humanoid
figure and the saucer were both gone however the officer did investigate
and said he found something very odd there was a mark on the ground which
looked like it had been made in the soiling grass ass by a single bicycle
wheel sort of pressing down it sort of traced an unusual pathway that curved
right up to the witness's window and then doubled back again now later after this incident
researcher Alan Henry heard about it interviewed the witness this witness
lived in a crowded Suburban section of Carpentersville and the saucer should
have been visible and the figure should have been visible to anyone who l though admittedly it was 4 a.m. and
probably nobody was up however anyway he checked with all the neighbors and
nobody saw anything but one did tell alen Henry that they their dog did start
barking at the exact time of this encounter now there was no evidence or
Landing traces where the tiny little saucer had landed but he did see this
Mark which you know this little Trail and took soil samples from it where this
strange gouge was and tested them for radioactivity uh there were no evidence
of rad radiation he put this soil under a microscope and examined it that way
but didn't see any visible amnor abnormalities so there you go a tiny
little UFO landed right next to this lady's house and a six foot tall ET who
presumably came in that UFO really hard to say you know T size
makes no difference sometimes in these encounters because people have described going inside a UFO and it's much bigger
on the inside so perhaps that's what's going on here or perhaps the ET expanded
in size or the UFO shrunk down uh maybe there was another larger craft in the
area that the witness did not see that's entirely possible given that there were so many witnesses in this town were
seeing a lot of activity so I don't know but gosh what a strange
case and now we move to the last one of this collection tonight and this one is
a super fascinating case which took place in Chuka Poland I call this one the ETS by
the lake I like this case cuz it has multiple Witnesses it occurred on August
10 1979 it was professionally researched
it's quite an unusual series of events and has some quite
poignant uh animal effects so let's just get right to it
this last and final case comes from researcher Brunos R peki and Kristoff
pichota and this occurred again in zucha Poland and was reported in their book UF
foes over Pand it's an amazing case involving multiple Witnesses and strange
animal effects it was a beautiful evening on August 10
1979 a man was docking his boat on one of the lakes in the area when he noticed
an oblong shaped dark object moving on the water's surface now he first thought it might be
a fishing boat but it was moving very quickly in complete silence and also
wasn't making any waves so this really puzzled him and he was watching it for
just a few seconds as it passed behind a small Peninsula jutting out from the
side of the lake and as it disappeared he called out to a man on the beach not far away and this other witness also
watched this object scoot across the lake and lost sight of it when it went behind some bushes along side of the
shore of the lake so he decided to investigate he thought it looked strange
too he called his dogs and together they went to the Shoreline where he assumed
this strange boat would be docking but he took only about 20 steps and he was
about 60 ft away from where he had seen this quote boat mve to and this is when
he noticed two figures were wearing dark clothing and heading into the
forest now at this point they were he says about 15 feet from the shore of the
lake he didn't see any craft not at this point but his two dogs immediately
apparently sensed smelled this these strangers and took off running in their
Direction barking furiously and as the dogs got close the
two figures turned towards the dogs and at this point the dogs were only about 5 to 10 feet away from these two figures
and when these figures turned around both dogs reacted very strangely they
immediately stopped in their tracks stopped barking turned around and ran
back towards their owner in total fear meanwhile the witness got a pretty good
look at these two figures and he immediately realized that they were not normal both were only 5T tall both were
dressed in skin tight what looked like diving suits with a clear mask where the
eyes would be he said their hips looked very strange and bulky they had weirdly humped backs from the knees down he says
their legs looked kind of blurred or out of focus that was strange but even more
strange was the way they were moving because instead of walking they were gliding or floating across the ground as
if it was a level surface which it wasn't was very uneven and the witness also noticed that
both beings kept their hands on their hips and were not swinging their arms which also seemed a little strange he
called out out to them at which point the two figures started moving faster quickly disappearing into the forest now
the witness who was about 300 ft away from them continued to watch this area where they disappeared and he was
rewarded by his persistence and amazed to see a bright glowing object floating
just above the trees says it was about 100 ft in altitude it stopped briefly
giving the witness a good view of it uh he could quite tell its shape but it
kind of looked rectangular to him with rounded edges he said it was 24t long 9
ft wide maybe 7 to 8 feet high it had a smooth surface he said and it was
glowing blue green on the sides and bright white in the center and as he
watched it flew off into the distances and was gone now there were two other Witnesses
weisl K and Wanda who also saw this object and they said that there were
three orange circles on one end of it apparently where it was being
propelled so the next day the witness with his dogs went to the location where
the object had risen out of the trees but found no markings or Footprints of
any kind however he did discover something else because following this
incident his dogs started to become sick this weird creeping paralysis came over
their front legs and it didn't get better it got worse and after 6 months
with no improvement his two dogs had to be euthanized yeah a bit of a sad end note
to this case but I I guess these things do happen it's certainly a fascinating
case with multiple Witnesses a gentleman who came very very close to these
humanoids saw the craft with his own own eyes other people saw the craft this is
apparently a Uso if it's landing on the water so it's another example of the
many Usos all over the world but yeah I think there's a lot to
learn from each of these cases uh about not only the ETS but
ourselves these cases show once again that contact is taking place worldwide I
think there's a lot lot lot lot more cases than what we hear about because most people don't come forward and each
time someone comes forward yeah it does encourage other people to come forward this is why I'm doing this research by
the way to basically counteract the cover up that
has made people skeptical of something that's going on that they shouldn't be skeptical of it's absolutely absurd to
think we're alone in this universe and the evidence is showing us really really
strongly that we're not and you know week after week I'm reporting on cases of these
humanoids you'd think you'd run out of these cases but I'm telling you there's
not just thousands of these there's tens of thousands hundreds of thousands and the more research you do
the more cases you find it's extraordinary how common this is and I
think it shows a lot about us as well uh people do have a strong fear reaction
and I think that's largely the fault of our own governments and the media who
are putting forth an ET threat narrative a very fear-based
media uh we've become scared of anything that looks a little bit different and I
think these cases show that we don't need to be afraid for the most part uh but I'm just presenting the
facts as near as I can determine uh the reality of these cases
and yeah it's clear they are taking place there's far too many to ignore so
that's it for today I really appreciate you guys tuning in week after week so
thank you so much I love all of you and I really really am thankful for your
