THE ULTIMATE UFO ENCOUNTER: SIX ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
Jul 12, 2024

Summary:
Jul 12, 2024
There are many different kinds of UFO encounters, but the ultimate experience is being taken onboard a craft and meeting ETs face-to-face. And it happens more often than you might think. In 1991, the Roper Poll Survey found that as many as 1 in 50 people may be UFO contactees, which means that millions of people are having this kind of encounter! This episode presents just a small sample of six cases from around the world. These cases involve both single and multiple witnesses and contain some very compelling evidence such as physiological effects, healings, implants and more. Even more importantly, they answer some of the many questions surrounding this subject.

THE CASE OF BETTY STEWART DAGENAIS. In 1925, when Betty Stewart Dagenais of Ontario Canada was only five years old, she was taken onboard a craft and examined by gray ETs. A few months later it happened again. As an adult she had three more encounters. These were primarily recalled under hypnosis, and all she could remember was being physically examined and apparently given an alien implant. This turned out to be true, because later her implant was surgically removed by doctors here on Earth, and it turned out to have some amazing properties that defy conventional explanations.

THE CASE OF SHARON KEEFE. Sharon’s first UFO sighting occurred when she was only 11 or 12 years old. Years later as an adult living in Gallup, NM, she started having missing time. In 1975-76, while driving with her daughters along the highway at night, she was followed by a UFO and experienced another episode of missing time. She decided to seek hypnosis, and recalled that she and her daughters were taken onboard a craft and examined by tall gray beings. They told her that they were there to test her endurance and give her gifts. She felt love and compassion for the beings and felt that her experience was benevolent.

THE CASE OF HERMINIO & BIANCA REIS. On the evening of January 12, 1976, while driving along a remote highway near Paraibuna, Brazil, Bianca Reis saw a glowing orange object in the sky. She alerted her husband, Herminio, and the next thing they knew, it sent down a beam of light onto their car and sucked them both (with their car) into the craft. Inside they met tall human-looking beings who spoke telepathically with them, engaging them in a long conversation about deep, philosophical subjects. They gave them information about how to teach people to advance their own psychic abilities and learn astral projection. Soon more contacts occurred and even more people became involved and even healed!

THE CASE OF GHULAM REZA BAZARANI. It was April 2, 1976, the day of “Sizdeh-Bedar,” an Iranian holiday when Gholam Reza Bazargani (age 19) went walking in the forests near his home in Chalus, Iran. Gholam was from a wealthy family, and when he went missing, police organized a massive search. Two days later, Gholam was found hundreds of miles to the south in the city of Isfahan. He had an amazing story to tell. He said that a silver flying saucer appeared overhead and he suddenly found himself inside it being examined by non-human entities. He recalled being examined by instruments with colored lights, and then lost consciousness. When he awoke, his watch was missing. On the day of his return, many people in the area saw flying saucers.

THE CASE OF MIGUEL HERRERO SIERRA. Early on the morning of December 18, 1977, Miguel Herrero Sierra (a 37-year-old driver/entrepreneur) left his home in Alcala, Spain to go fishing at the Buendia Reservoir. He never made it. Half-way there, his car engine mysteriously failed. Then he saw a landed flying saucer in the field next to him. Two human-looking figures dressed in white jumpsuits approached and pulled him onboard. The ETs told him that they were contacting many people on Earth and told him many other things before returning him back to his car. While Miguel remembered at least 15 minutes of being onboard, the entire experience lasted three hours. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled more incredible details.

THE CASE OF HELEN. On January 24, 1992, “Helen,” (age 50) was with her husband in their home in Mezobereny, Hungary. Suddenly a strange apparition of a woman appeared in her kitchen. Later that night, Helen felt compelled to go into her backyard where she saw a landed flying saucer. She went onboard where she saw many other women and young children. Over the next few nights, she had the same experience. Then she woke up in her bed to find several strange dark marks on her abdomen. Doctors were unable to diagnose or explain them. Then, to Helen’s surprise, she found herself cured of two chronic medical conditions!

These six cases are just a tiny portion of the actual number of cases of this kind, and yet they provide a representative sample of what it’s like to have the ultimate UFO encounter, an onboard experience and face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials.

Hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode is called
the ultimate encounter six onboard UFO experiences I love talking about all
kinds of UFO encounters whether they're sightings or Landings or face-to-face encounters with humanoids but when
people are taken on board to me these are the cases that have the most potential to really answer all of the
many questions surrounding UF contact these are the cases that have the most
information and to me these are the cases that are the most interesting by far and I've chosen six cases that I
think you probably haven't heard of before and they're certainly interesting because they reach all the way back to
the 1920s up through the 1990s they come from many different locations including
Canada the United States South America more specifically Brazil but as well as
Europe including Spain and Hungary and one case from Iran which is really
interesting because we don't get a whole lot of information about UFOs in that country and of course these do involve
many different types of ETS humanoids and also some really interesting and
compelling evidence two of these are multiple witness cases the others are
single witness cases but certainly compelling each case adds another piece of the the puzzle to what's going on
here and I hope that you will find these cases interesting so let's just get
started and the first case I'd like to talk about today I call the case of Betty Stewart
Dean her case is really interesting because it involves several encounters
they reach back all the way to the 1920s up through the 1970s and took place primarily in
Ontario Canada and her case is particularly compelling because it's one of the best examples of the so-called
alien implants that we hear so much about Eddie Stewart dejan's case was
investigated by a team of UFO researchers from the Canadian UFO Network and she reports at least five
onboard UFO encounters and the first occurred all the way back in
1925 when Betty was only 5 years old it was a summer night and was in her
parents home in Port Burwell Ontario and as Betty says in her own words I woke up
and felt compelled to go outside in the backyard I was stricken with Terror as a
train approached and I knew it was coming for me now Betty had never heard of UFOs so she kind of perceived this
object as a train she did not know what to think it was years later after having
other experiences that she elected to go under hypnotic regression to recall her EXP experience and she was taken to this
event and she remembered hearing a quote throbbing or pulsating whining hum as
this weird light approached her from over Lake Erie she said it hovered briefly overhead and was wobbling in the
sky as she looked up towards it and the next thing she knew she was floating up into this object inside this craft and
as Betty says everything is very white and light things come towards me small
and gray the eyes are large and far apart I'm sitting on a bed so she
described these beings as having very large heads small faces with large bulging eyes pale white gray skin and
very slender bodies he said they wore skin tight coveralls that look like quote stretchy
satin now at this point one of the beings called her name and said Betty
you're a little girl and floated her up onto a table they removed her night gown
she says one of them touched the skin on her bottom apparently as she says trying to see the texture of my body and they
then began to float her around the cabin and as Betty says again under hypnotic
regression there are instruments on a panel three of them I feel as if I'm Dreaming I want to put my night gown
back on one of them has a long steel needle it has things that come out of it things
that drop down now the next thing she knew she was being escorted out of this craft and
floated back down to the ground and as she says still under hypnosis I'm
standing on the grass I hear a call from my mother they had floated me back I go
in the back door our Collie dog is lying there and won't move I'm back in my bed
I'm going to sleep so that's what she recalled under hypnosis but consciously she did
remember parts of this so the next morning Betty ran outside to see if there was any evidence of a train coming
through her backyard of course there wasn't but she vividly remembered the strange humming sound and in fact
anytime she heard anything similar to that sound she would feel a profound anxiety sweeping over her and she did
notice one other strange after effect of the encounter as bet he says the
experience left me with precognitive abilities Clairvoyance Clare audience CLA sensient and what is now referred to
as telekinesis or control over matter so that was her first experience
and it wasn't long after that one that she had her second experience and in fact it was that same summer and again
she recalled much of it under hypnotic regression by researcher David gotlib as
Betty said says in her own words I was lying on the grass it was daytime the
grass was moving and I saw the ship the craft is on the ground there are beings
here they have yellow skin and it's wrinkled I think they have a sense of humor they have dark eyes piercing it's
another type of craft the craft is pointed at the ends flat like a saucer
they don't stand up in the craft they have to use Bays to lie down to go into
flight the craft is very flat it has Contours domes but the sides are
ellipses they just fit into areas which Contour to their bodies when they lay down they look as if they're
comfortable so Betty doesn't recall a whole lot of what happened once she was taken on board she did see that they
were flying high above the Earth at one point one of the ETS seemed to show an
interest in her hair and started touching it and as Betty says I didn't want them to do that the next thing she
knew she was returned home she heard her mother calling and that was it now there are some interesting
aspects to Betty's life because at age 16 she developed a very strong interest in electronics and actually built a
transformer in the basement of their home this is something a number of contes have experienced her next
encounter occurred many years later it was July 12th 1959 or 1961 thereabouts
that he was now about 30 years old and living in the York Mills area of Toronto
at 29 Upper Canada Drive next to what was then the St Andrews golf course now
a park now the encounter began with her being floated along the ground and suddenly up into a brightly lit craft
which was hovering outside her balcony this was a small craft she estimates about 7 ft wide four squarish port holes
a dome on top she saw a small ramp she suddenly found herself inside a wedg
shaped room she saw a shiny instrument of some kind on the wall with red green
yellow blue and white colored squares kind of reminded her of a calendar she
saw a number of things that she found very hard to describe as Betty says
there's a doorway with funny looking things across it in a horizontal pattern they look like fibrous rods I think you
could walk right through them and you wouldn't feel them just in front of the door there's a mat it looks like it's
part of the floor it's only about a foot wide and about 3 ft long it's dark brown
and fuzzy she saw other things something she described as an index wheel with a
handle and small beige pouches a fixed to it other rooms could be seen she says
the gray type ETS wore gray robes they put a bib likee covering on her and then
placed her on a movable steel table and proceeded to examine her with a strange
cylindrical shaped instrument at one point she says the table tilted upwards so that she was
almost standing they told her look the other way and when she did she so saw a small
box filled with quote tiny pellets and they began to put these pellets into a
device shaped kind of like a parking meter she said it was quote a creamy
white color now she believes that these pellets may have been implants given
what happened next and I'll just quote Betty directly as she says they're
putting a pellet on the end of the instrument the instrument looks like a combination of pliers and
Pinchers one of them pushes the end of the instrument with the palm of his hand and the pellet is firm held by the
instrument the pellet has two prongs sticking out of it at one end one of
them is adjusting the handle of it someone says this one won't need any
help they put it on the outside of my left ear on the cartilage back of my ear
I hear a buzzing sound from it it has lights flashing on it it's cold when they put it in my ear it's done one of
them says they just took it out took off the bag B I felt no pain during the
operation now one of them says home now and they are taking me by the elbows
we're floating they're taking me out of the ship we're going through my balcony
door into the living room there's a large solid light on the balcony I'm in
the bed now so this again was all recovered under hypnosis but Betty woke
up the next morning with no memory of being taken on board but she did find that her ear was red swollen and itchy
and she just assumed that she had been bitten by an insect now it was some years later
1966 that Betty had her fourth encounter she was unable to remember how
the experience began but she recalled being floated up into a craft which was hovering above what she thinks might
have been Lake Ontario and as Betty says in her own words there are two beings on on board
one was facing me while the other had his back to me as he worked on the dials on the panel in front of him they had
large squarish round heads with no obvious neck the eyes were spaced far
apart they had large noses the skin was gray white they had no hair their hands
were five digited with stubby fingers and 3/4 in
webbing between the fingers the most remarkable face feature was the nose
with nostrils ending in two little elephant-like trunks about 3 or 4 in below the collar bone she says the ETS
put something on my neck which looks like a combination lock it burns a little so she had trouble describing
some of this but the next morning while taking a shower she noticed a small round burn-like mark about the size of a
silver dollar at the base of her neck and it faded away after 3 days
now what she believes was her Fifth and final encounter occurred on December 22nd
1979 it was a foggy night as she and her brother drove along Highway 9 between
Upper Canada Mall and Highway 400 this is north of Toronto you can see the spot
here on a map it was a trip which normally took about 15 minutes but
inexplicably took almost an hour so there was a period of at least 20 minutes of Miss in time and during this
trip she consciously recalled that they had entered into this dense black cloud
and upon coming out there were strangely no more cars ahead of them whereas before there had been so years later
under hypnosis she went back to this incident to explore it and recalled that their car had been stopped by human
looking figures dressed in gray green coveralls they pulled her out of the car leaving her brother behind they took her
into a room which she said was kind of green colored she said she was examined by a strange instrument she doesn't
really remember a whole lot but she was then returned to her car where she saw her brother sitting rigid and entranced
in the car seat they then drove off all memories of the UFO and the onboard
experience were erased from her conscious mind now in
1986 having had all these strange incidents bet he did elect to go under
hypnosis this and she recalled these five onboard encounters and believing she had an
implant behind her left ear Betty agreed that upon her death doctors could remove
her implant but she ended up having it removed in 1988 possibly ' 89 there's
some confusion here but it was 3 years before she actually passed away in
1992 and she was pretty sure that this was an implant of some kind giving what she recalled
and this thing did apparently show up on some medical tests and she could also
hear Morse like codes coming from it so this alleged implant was in fact removed
at York County Hospital in New Market and was kept safe until
1994 until it was able to be studied by an engineer by the name of George
hathway now this object was about 1 mm in diameter and an an analysis by an
electron microscope revealed that it was composed of various elements such as aluminum titanium and silicon with
traces of other elements just a little bit of iron potassium calcium sulfur
chlorine chromium and sodium now Lawrence J Fenwick the editor
of the qorn bulletin who studied the implant writes that the deun implant was
either a transmitter or a receiver possibly both now this is pure
speculation but it's based on the fact that these elements that were found in the implant are used for similar human
constructed devices certainly a compelling case and in fact Betty's case
is one of the best investigated best confirmed cases of a contacte from
Canada and certainly a really interesting case involving an ET implant
which was very well studied and turned out to be quite unusual so an important
Case by all counts and now we move to another case which is not very well known I call this one the case of Sharon
Keefe she's had several encounters but she really only talked a lot about one
of them this occurred in 1975 or there about in Gallop New Mexico while driving
along a lonely Highway late at night with her three daughters this is a multiple witness case and a very
interesting one in a number of different ways as we shall see faen Keef's first
sighting of a UFO occurred when she was only 11 or 12 years old but as she grew
up she began to have more contact in 1975 through 1976 she was living in
Gallop New Mexico and she says it was here that she experienced several episodes of what she calls time losses
and each of these were about 1 to 2 hours long and having all these missing time experiences finally she decided to
get some help and found Dr Leo sprinkle PhD and she went under hypnot hypnotic
regression to explore the missing time so as one evening again somewhere
around 1975 or 1976 that she was driving with her three young daughters across the Zuni Indian
Reservation this is about 65 miles outside of Gallop New Mexico and I'll just let Sharon describe
what happened next as she says I learned through hypnosis about one experience
which I will relate to you a light appeared behind the car suddenly and I
knew there were no other cars here I couldn't find out where the light came
from but it was tailing me very closely I told my daughters to turn around and
see if it was a truck so she asked them what is that her
daughters had no answer Sharon was aware that there was a lot of alcoholism was a
problem in the area she wondered if it was perhaps a drunk person who was tailgating her and needless to say she
was quite concerned about it so she accelerated her vehicle finally reaching speeds of 85 M hour but still this light
whatever it was remained right behind her in fact was so bright that she had
to adjust both her side mirror and her rear view mirror to block the light now
this is where her conscious memory ends the next thing she remembers is arriving in Gallup New
Mexico so under hypnosis she recalled what happened she recalled being pulled
on board a craft she's not sure how this happened she just suddenly found herself inside a strange room and again I'll
just let Sharon describe this as she he says I know I was in the spaceship and
doors appeared instantly in White Walls the aliens seem to get where they want
to go instantly and they tend to move non laboriously and when they were going
to take me through it an opening appeared the wall would be a wall for
instance I can't explain this fact very well either in this round spaceship the
beings appeared to be about 6 feet tall and were very pale gray white they have
heads that are similar to ours only a little bit rounder in the cranial area
their eyes large their noses are small and narrow their ears aren't formed like
ours their mouth their mouths are very like a line and small they communicate
mentally they don't talk with their mouths like we do but you can understand what they are saying and what they are
telling you I was in a separate room from the girls it was like a pie shaped room with one chair which was very
comfortable and warm there were some windows from which I was being viewed by other beings about 15 ft in front of
this chair I couldn't see them very well because the glass was a smoky color the
being who guided me had a close-fitting suit similar to what we know of as tights but the material was of a smooth
texture they had cloaks on that were clasped at the neck with a bright round
nuclear symbol with the Star of David in the middle and a hood that was also attached I was worried about my
daughters so one alien took me to two other rooms just like the one I was in
and showed me that they were all right both girls appeared to be asleep in chairs just like the one I had been in
my guide then took me back to the room I had previously been in and they did some
kind of testing to me that felt like my body was being pulled apart now Sharon says a lot more
happened there was a lot more detail to this she didn't really want to share it but at some point the next thing she
knew she and her daughters were back in the car arriving in Gallop and it was now 1 and a half hours later Sharon does
say that the encounter changed her life immensely and that ultimately it was a very positive
experience as Sharon says my religious beliefs have become much stronger
because I know that the universe is so enormous you know that there are other galaxies other planets and other life
they are not here to harm us I feel a lot of love in my heart and compassion for many people anybody that I can help
my attitude towards life has changed drastically since my experience I'm much more positive I know I can accomplish
anything I want to and the Supreme Being is my guide it is nice to see everybody
here and know that I am not the only one who has had strange experiences with UFO
people so Sharon revealed this all publicly at the Rocky Mountain UFO
conference organized by Leo sprinkle a lot of people who are having experiences spoke there and Sharon decided not to
undergo any further hypnotic regressions not because she was afraid or anything
like that she said her life was just too busy I have to give kudos to Sharon
Keefe for going public at a time when this subject was receiving quite a bit of
ridicule uh she did allow her real name to be used a really interesting series
of events I do wonder what happened with her other encounters but I certainly
understand if she wants to keep those private and yeah I'm glad she did step forward uh I think so many people are
having these experiences a lot of them have no recourse they feel quite alone but the fact is this is a lot more
common than most people realize and now let's move to our next case which did actually receive quite a
bit of attention certainly in the country where it took place of Brazil and I call this one the case of hermino
and Bianca reys you may have heard of it before I don't know but I think if you
haven't you will certainly find it compelling this took place the main incident on January 12
1976 not far from matius Barb Brazil this is another one of those
encounters that occurred while they're driving along a lonely Highway late at night it's certainly a compelling case
involving multiple Witnesses and a whole lot of information and of course not
just one encounter but many this next case involves a married couple by the
name of hermino Reese he's an an Evangelical pastor and his wife bian de
oliviera they woke up early on the morning of January 12 1976 and while eating breakfast decided
that they would drive from their home in minus jerus Brazil and travel to Bell
Horizon to sell their old car was a sporty carmenia so this ended up being
an all day trip they were returning home along the Rio de Janero Bellow Horizon
Highway it was around 11:30 p.m. they just passed through peruna when hermino
who was driving began to feel strangely and excessively tired and sleepy so they
decided to pull off the highway while hermino dozed and biano stayed awake smoking a cigarette and keeping watch to
make sure nothing happened and it was after about 15 minutes that bian noticed
a light moving from one side of the sky to another at the same time she said
this weird All In encompassing Dead Silence fell over the area so she's
looking at this light and she thought at first that it might be a balloon of some kind but it was glowing this intense
orange and it was moving in and out of the clouds it seemed pretty far away at first so she didn't think too much of it
but then it disappeared and it suddenly reappeared much closer and very suddenly
it looked like it was an aircraft about to crash into them so she screamed out
to her husband hermano hermano wake up a plane is falling on our
heads so he woke up just in time for them both to see everything around them
become completely black to the point that they couldn't even see themselves or each other their car seemed to move
and shake a little bit and then very suddenly a blinding bright beam of blue
white light appeared around them and the couple felt as if they were being quote
absorbed up into it as if through a chimney moments later they found
themselves in a brightly lit round room which they described as a quote kind of
circular garage about 70 ft wide they were still sitting in their car they did
see another car inside by the way so as soon as they found themselves there this
little kind of door or opening appeared in the ceiling above them and two tall
men appeared and floated down to the the car they were human looking they had
slanted green eyes black hair darkish skin were quite tall about 6 feet maybe
6 in they were very similar looking almost like twins they said and they
were both dressed in seamless white jumpsuits these two figures were very
cordial very friendly and smiling and they began to help hermano out of the car Bianca didn't want to get out but
they got her out as well the couple was understandably surprised and quite frightened the two men were
speaking to them in an incomprehensible language and both Bianca and Herman Neo
started to panic Bianca started screaming at them what do you want what do you want while her husband hermano
kept saying it's a mistake it's a mistake he said he felt almost as if
they were in some kind of crazy dream and in fact he tried to call on Jesus to
make these figures go away and did this for quite some time it didn't work uh
the ETS did not react to it they just kind of stared at him it took quite some time to calm them down but they did calm
down at which point uh one of the men stepped on this little button on the
floor and the staircase or elevator type device appeared and the med the men led
the couple up into another room now they gave them these small silver headsets or headphones to put on
one of the other men also wore one of these devices and seemed to attach it to another instrument of some kind adjusted
a few dials and then suddenly the man began to speak in their language and said I am Karan calm
down now this is a very complicated incident A lot happened according to the
Reese's this small craft reportedly went into a larger Mothership which the
couple exited they saw other craft the same size and this being began to
explain that they were from a distant planet they called cler actually showed them a star map of some kind which
showed their planet and others and this being began to discuss very deep
philosophical Concepts to them so all about religion creation contact with
humans all kinds of topics they said that on their world they had overcome the problem of Aging which was treated
like a disease that when they died they just left the body and retained all their memories and moved into a new body
they said they had no religion no money no Wars at one point one of the beings
asked Bianca if if she would submit to being physically examined what she did she was
placed in a box-like device which turned red and became filled with kind of the static Electric charge this caused her
to temporarily lose Consciousness she said they proceeded to examine her skin
her ears her eyes when she woke up she was then taken out of that and put into
a formfitting chair where she said actually would convert to a sort of table or
bed at some point they were offered this soft tasteless bread they were asked to
drink a thick green liquid which they said had a a unpleasant taste
at one point more entities appeared all of the same general appearance one was a tall female with dark hair and large
dark eyes now hermano asked Karin why the ETS
didn't communicate with the people of Earth and help them with their problems and Karin pointed to himself and said am
I not here and then he gestured at the craft and the other entities around them and said are we not here so Mano asked
many questions and asked if Kar could teach them something that could be shared with all of humanity that would
help alleviate all the suffering that is taking place on Earth and Kar explained
what he called quote conscious unfolding techniques and these
involved three main steps now the first is hyperventilation
breathing exercises which Kar said would help aid cellular and cerebral
regeneration the second he said is to develop the pituitary and pineal glands
to increase self-awareness and psychic awareness and the third was to awaken
specific points in the brain to allow for conscious astral
projection now as the experience came to an end they were told not to speak about their experiences to other people who
would likely think they were crazy and the ET said that they did have a method that would cause them to
forget Bianca said that she wanted to remember and asked the ETS not to make
them forget and this was a request which they granted the couple was then taken
back to their car and returned to the highway they drove home in silence bit by bit they began to talk
about the experience uh this took a couple of weeks they shared it with others later
and as they got more comfortable with it they began to appear on radio and TV and they actually began to teach the
techniques to others that were taught to them by the ETS now Bianca believes that the ETS did
implant her which allowed her to remain in communication with Karen and
apparently she was the focus of contact not so much her husband and she started
to get telepathic messages to go to certain areas and sure enough the craft would arrive and she would be taken on
board so this happened a number of times on one occasion she asked to bring
friends and the being told her well you can bring some friends but not the ones you're talking about they're not your
friends they're trying to take advantage of you and gave her some advice on this
so at some point yes she was able to take a couple of other friends on board one who was allegedly
healed she said that she also met one of the ETS who was living at least
temporarily on Earth but looked very much the same as the other beings she saw she said at some point she was given
a major revelation of some kind which apparently she has not yet talked about
but their case is quite extensive and in fact researcher Wendell Stevens ended up
co-authoring a book on the case called UFO contact from claror how amazing is
that it's so interesting to me that in so many of these cases people talk about the after effects of having
having experiencing a bunch of psychic events uh so that I think is a really
important takeaway from cases like these an encounter is often somewhat
spiritually enlightening to some degree that's certainly the pattern we see in so many cases and now we move to another
one that's super interesting primarily because of its location Iran we just
don't get a lot of cases from there and I suspect there are many we just don't hear about them but this one is called
the case of gulam Raza bazani and it took place on April 2nd
1976 near Shalo Iran and got a lot of attention because it turns out the
primary witness came from a pretty upstanding family and there's some
really unusual elements to this case as we shall see it is somewhat brief
compared to the other cases we don't have a whole lot of information but it certainly deserves to be known this very
unusual case occurred on April 2nd 1976 which at that year was actually an
Iranian holiday called sday badar this marks the end of the Iranian new year
and it's all about celebrating nature the main witness was a 19-year-old
teenager by the name of Golam Raza bagani he's the member of a wealthy
family in chalu Iran and he had gone hiking into the nearby woods and
suddenly disappeared Without a Trace naturally his family called the
police there was an huge search organized to find him but they could not
find him anywhere and then 2 Days Later Golam was found some hundreds of miles
to the south in the city of Isfahan and Golam had quite a story to
tell he said that while he was walking alone in the forest a UFO appeared overhead flew directly towards him
stopped right over his head he was unable to move as four beings appeared
According to some sources they had big noses and kind of greenish lips could not confirm that but he says they came
out of the craft on a sort of a silver ladder and pulled him on board and Golam
now found himself inside an oval shaped room in front of a strange instrument of some kind he couldn't really describe it
he says they passed various colored lights over his body as these strange beings scrutinized him after just a few
moments of this he lost Consciousness and as Golam says in his own words the
next thing I remember is that I woke up back on Earth early in the morning not in the Lush Caspian forests but
surrounded by Barren lands so he didn't know where he was he had to hike his way
back to civilization and found that he was in fact in Isfahan this is about 285
Mi south of Chalo where he was taken so he immediately contacted the local
police he was taken to the Red Lion and Sun Hospital in Isfahan and examined by
doctors and psychologists after one day of this he was given a clean bill of health both
physically and mentally and he returned back to his home in Chalo now there were some people who are
skeptical of his account but authorities said that on the day of golan's return
numerous people from The Villages of marbin and lenan which outly the Isfahan
City they called the police to report their sightings of a flying saucer quite a few of
them now the only lasting symptom that Golam reported was that his wrist watch
which he had been wearing at the time he was taken on board was missing after the
encounter I do wish there was more information in that case but certainly compelling and I think quite a good
amount of coroporation given that so many people saw UFOs in the area at the
time that he was being apparently returned to a location somewhat distant
from where he was taken which is also quite unusual a really interesting case and I
have to wonder what happened to his watch if it's still up there on a craft somewhere I don't know but it's a
fascinating detail and now we move to the next case this one definitely deserves more
attention it's a really interesting case this I call the case of Miguel Herrero
Sierra it's a fascinating onboard experience which occurred on December 18
1977 in a rural area of tendia Spain again another case of some one being
taken along a highway that's somewhat remote and a fascinating case with a lot
of information to it the sole witness to this case is Miguel Herrero Sierra he's
a 37-year-old driver an entrepreneur who on December 18 1977 decided to take a fishing trip
fishing is one of his favorite hobbies at the time of his experience he lived in Alcala Spain this is not far from
Madrid it was around 5:30 a.m. that he got into his pickup and began the long
drive to the buendia reservoirs this is his favorite fishing spot so after driving for over an hour
he was near tendia and he was actually the intersection of the penalver road as
you can see here when suddenly the headlights radio and engine of his vehicle all simultaneously shut off he
did manage to pull over off the road he got out and checked his truck couldn't find anything wrong it was
still dark so he decided to wait until dawn to see if if he could get help so
as he's sitting there in his truck this is when he noticed a huge shadow in the field next to him about 300 ft away and
he wondered briefly if it could be a house but the thing is he knew this area he knew there was no house in that
location and this is when suddenly a brilliant beam of light came from that object and Shone directly on his car and
at the same time he heard someone shout out hey mister the one with the
pickup so this confused him a little bit he wondered if perhaps there had been an accident of some kind so he exited his
truck and began to slowly approach this object and as he got closer he said he
smelled this very strange penetrating piny odor that grew very strong stronger
as he approached and became so strong at finally caused him to become nauseous
and dizzy so much so that he fell to the ground he was now dazed semiconscious
unable to move he says when he saw two men approaching him from about 150 ft
away he noticed immediately that they were dressed strangely in what he described as a divver
suit now these two men spoke to each other in an incomprehensible language
they then grabbed Miguel's arms tightly and led him into the
craft he now saw that this craft was floating just a few feet in the air it did have what looked like a cylinder of
some kind extending out from the bottom center and leading to the ground and what happened next actually
took him a few weeks after the experience to consciously recall but he did remember he remembered that he was
led inside this cylinder into a doorway and suddenly found himself inside a room
which was quite large about 45 ft wide says the walls look quite strange almost
Crystal or plastic like he saw a circular Central area which he believed
might have been the cockpit or the control center he saw transparent looking counters a bed area what looked
like small metal cabinets some consoles with lights and levers a computer-like
screen a lot of stuff that he had difficulty describing and he found out that the ETS
were able to turn the walls of The Craft transparent so I'll just quote Miguel
directly as he says two men dressed in white were coming towards me I didn't
lose Consciousness but I was unable to walk until they took me by the arms I
remember that just before entering a sort of sliding door opened the entire
underside of the artifact lit up in a deep white light once inside nothing and
no one held me but although I was already strong and the tension was through the roof I could not move or
articulate any word amazingly when I was inside I understood everything they were
talking about so inside he saw a lot of these figures about 16 of them which he
said quote had such a similar appearance to us that if they had been dressed
differently they could have gone unnoticed anywhere on Earth and for the
next 3 hours he communicated telepathically with the ETS as Miguel says I hadn't really
spoken a word since I left the car and they were not emitting any sound either
yet I could hear their words in my ears as if we were having a normal
conversation so he's talking about telepathy here didn't quite understand what that was apparently but as he says
I also remember that at a certain moment when I was was trying to assimilate everything that was happening and an
endless number of questions invaded my mind one of them turned around and looking me in the eye said without
saying a word don't make an effort to understand cuz if no one explains it to you you will never understand it so they
were just trying to calm him down because he was becoming mentally overwhelmed then suddenly with no memory
of how he got there he found himself outside the craft he did notice a small
puncture in his arm as if he had been given a blood test though he had no conscious memory of this the entire
experience he learned lasted about 3 hours and while he did have some memory
of the onboard experience come back to him naturally he could only recall about
15 minutes of it so there was still much that he couldn't recall and later after talking to
researchers he did elect to go under hypnosis to see if he could recall more detail
and he did he says that the ETS told him that the Great Pyramids of Egypt were in
fact designed by extraterrestrials they told him that there was an old abandoned ET base in
the Bermuda Triangle they told him they could make their ships invisible at will
they told them that they did not need weapons of any kind as they could create a magnetic field around their ship which
would prevent anyone or anything from getting too close anything that could bring any danger to them they said that
they had been visiting Earth for thousands of years and that they were sharing genetics with Earth
humans he did see a weird panel on the ship uh consciously recalled that but
under hypnosis did see what looked like weird Russian like symbols on them and
he also recalled something else quite odd one of the crew members looked almost exactly like himself so that
really confused him he tried to reach out and touch this man but the others warned him not to do that uh but it was
at this time that Miguel says he became so overcome that he felt his nerves were
going to explode and this is when one of the ETS turned towards him and told him not to make an effort to understand at
this time so that's basically his experience the only other real after
effect is Miguel says that following his encounter he started to develop all
kinds of psychic abil ities so many interesting details in that case the
fact that he says the ETS looked pretty much exactly like us and could have walked undetected if dressed in
different clothes and there we have that pattern again where he comes away from his experiences starts having all these
psychic events happen super interesting and now we move to the final
case of this little collection here I call this one the case of Helen we don't
know her last name she has elected to be anonymous certainly understandable this
uh case occurred actually it's a series of events through January and February of
1992 in MSO beri Hungary and this is a fascinating case
with some really interesting physiological effects because apparently this witness was healed I love these
kinds of cases it's very encouraging and I think you'll find this case quite compelling this case was investigated by
llo Kiss of the Hungarian UFO research Network or hufman the main witness is
Helen this is apparently a pseudonym now on January 24 1992 Helen
who was 50 years old at the time of her encounter she was in the kitchen when she saw something very strange a dull
black kind of egg-shaped quote something was blue gray on top it had a vertical
orange striped down the center it seemed to vibrate she had very much difficulty
describing this but she said it made a quote strong snorting sound as it moved across the kitchen and into another
room now next to this orange stripe that she saw Helen did see the face of a
woman looking out at her and Helen's husband was with her during this time
but he was looking in the other direction and when this thing appeared Helen found found herself unable to
speak to alert him but after it moved into the other room she followed and there was nothing there she told her
husband but he did not believe her but weird events had just begun CU it was that night around 6:30 p.m. that she
suddenly became overcome with tiredness and decided to go to bed early her husband was watching TV in the same room
when suddenly Helen heard a woman's voice say lift your arm what she did she
says she immediately felt a strong twinge of pain on her elbow it was following this she felt compelled to
walk out into the backyard what she did she was dressed only in her night gown
she went outside and saw a large egg-shaped object which had landed in her yard and she went inside of it she
was surprised to see a wide gray room there was nothing in it it was completely empty of any furniture or
people though she did see a door way at the far end she apparently had a lapse in Consciousness cuz the next thing she
knew she was in this same room only was now filled with people she said there
were about 10 or 15 children all young about age 10 to 13 they were all
standing on the right side of the room on the left side of the room she said were about 8 to 10 women who were all
around her age and in fact Helen recognized one of the woman from her
neighborhood all of the people in in the room including Helen had no clothes on so she does not know how this happened
but at this point Helen walked to the doorway at the end of the room and that's the last thing she consciously
remembered her next memory was feeling a pain in her stomach and laying down in bed and getting up she saw it was now
9:30 p.m. 3 hours later than it had been her husband was still watching TV he
noticed nothing unusual when Helen woke up the next morning she said she felt my
pain and pressure on the upper part of her belly didn't think much of it went to work and the next night went to bed
early and that night she said she had a repeat on board encounter with pretty much all the same details and the same
thing happened on the third night but it was on Thursday night that Helen
examined her body and was shocked to see several round spots each about the size of a silver dollar on her abdomen and
upper chest you can see a photograph of them here she said there was no pain no
itching or sensitivity of any kind she did find what looked like four needle
marks on the outer part of her elbows which did exhibit some minor pain and
burning Sensations she said she also had a little bit of trouble breathing for a short time but after 7 Days these marks
were still there so she was concerned and went to the doctor told him what happened showed him the marks on on her
body he was very much puzzled and sent her to see a dermatologist who was also puzzled he
could not explain the marks but he just prescribed a medical cream but here's where it gets really
interesting there was an amazing and very positive development Helen found that her General Health began to
approve began to improve in a few areas at the time of her encounters she was
suffering from varicose veins and and very poor Hearing in her left
ear but following her encounters her vericose veins disappeared and she
regained her hearing in her left ear so that was it her encounters were over there was one final strange event 2
weeks later at 3:30 a.m. on February 11 1992 Helen woke up to see her husband
standing in a very odd posture he was holding one arm up he was using his
other arm to hold his sleeve up as if he was waiting for an injection in his arm
this puzzled and concerned her she tried to wake him up but he was in a trance of some kind she could not wake him up she
was able to get him to put his arm down and that was it so there you go true not
a whole lot of information to that case still many questions surrounding it but she was apparently healed of both
varicose veins and partial deafness really interesting I have to wonder if
her husband was involved just given what she described though he has no memory of
this it's certainly interesting and it makes you wonder how many people have these events and just never talk about
them because the closer the encounter the less likely it is for a witness to
come forward because of all the ridicule and skepticism and disbelief surrounding
this subject such a shame but as you can see you cases have
occurred all over the world for a very long time I think you I understand
skepticism I was skeptical for many years but if you just leave your beliefs
behind your preconceptions and take a look at the evidence I think you'll find
it extremely persuasive I mean there's no doubt something is going on I think
the evidence is at this point conclusive we are being visited we are not alone
the universe is not empty uh many many people are being taken on board craft and having all
kinds of amazing experiences so that's the episode for
today I really want to thank you for watching it's because of all you guys out there that I do these episodes do
all this research working so hard to find these cases but I'm having fun I
hope you are too so until next time keep asking those hard questions the answers
are there keep searching for the truth it's up to you to find it and most important of all keep having fun cuz
that's why we're here and I will see you next week until then bye for now.
