Humanoid and alien encounters! They are perhaps the most fascinating aspect of ufology, and have so much to teach us about the ET agenda. This video presents ten cases from all over the world involving a wide variety of extraterrestrials. There are human-looking ETs, little dwarfs, frog-like beings, flying humanoids and more. Many involve multiple witnesses and startling physical evidence such as landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions and electromagnetic disturbances. There are too many cases to ignore, deny or explain away. Something very profound is happening here.

TEN LITTLE ALIENS. One evening in January 1931, cattle-herder Helge Eriksson was walking to his home in Eslov, Sweden when he saw a crowd of ten little men coming towards him. They were only about four feet tall, with oversized heads and long beards. They wore one piece robes with hoods and seemed to float across the ground. They paid no attention to Helge and moved up to a brilliant light source and were gone.

THE ET IN THE PURPLE CAPE. It was a sunny afternoon on February 29, 1964 as David and Ken (age 10 and 9) saw a saucer land near their homes in Plympton, South Australia. To their shock, a door opened and out stepped a human-looking ET with copper-red skin and a big nose. It wore a strange suit with a purple cape. As soon as it saw the boys, it fled back into its craft, which promptly took off. Interestingly, not far away, another lady in Gum Tree, South Australia saw a very similar-looking ET.

THE ALIENS ON THE HIGHWAY. Around 4am on August 23, 1967, Stanley Moxon was driving near Joyceville, Ontario, Canada when he saw a glowing green craft descending alongside the road. He turned off his headlights, drove up to it, and flicked on his headlights. To his shock, it had landed, and two short ETs were outside picking plants. Surprised, they flew back into the craft which took off straight up.

THE FLYING HUMANOID. One night in 1967, Patricia K and her fiancé were driving near Wolstanton, England when she saw a classic flying saucer. It flew away before her fiancé could see it. But eight years later, their 8-year-old son was drawn to look outside by a loud buzzing noise. To his amazement, he saw two 3-foot-tall humanoids flying past his window mere feet away.

I WOULD NOT HARM A HAIR ON YOUR HEAD. Around 3:15 am on January 8, 1974, John E Justice was driving to his home in Springfield, Ohio when his car stalled and his lights went out. Instantly, a brilliant rainbow-colored light appeared, transforming into a small craft. Inside, he was shocked to see five female humanoids, each about four feet tall, with super-long hair. The craft darted away after a few moments, but one year later, he had an even more startling encounter with a humanoid.

I WAS REALLY AFRAID. On the night of November 17, 1975, two college students, Dave Vardeman and Suzanne Erenberger watched a brilliant light descend to the ground near Cedar-Rapids, Iowa. Suzanne was amazed to see a metallic craft with two humanoids inside. But strangely, Dave didn’t remember seeing any craft or humanoids. All he recalls is that they were both frightened enough to flee the area and call the police.

FIFTY FROG-LIKE ETS. At 9pm on May 2, 1976, Dominique Menuge was driving near Matton France when reflections off the side of the road caught his eye. To his shock, he saw about fifty 4-foot-tall frog-like humanoids standing motionless in the field. Terrified, he fled the area, but not before he saw one of the humanoids standing only a few feet away from his car.

ALMOST ABDUCTED BY ALIENS. On September 9, 1976, Hermelindo Silva was walking home with his dog when a UFO appeared overhead. Suddenly it sent down 4 cables with hooks. Short little humanoids came out of the craft and managed to grab him, hook his ankle and pull him up towards the craft. Hermelindo fought with them and freed himself, but not without sustaining some serious injuries.

UNNATURAL EYES. On the night of March 13, 1977, 17-year-old Stephen Taylor was walking to his home in Pembroke, Wales when he saw a brilliant orange craft. He ran away, but shortly later, he came upon the craft, now landed in a field. Then an odd humanoid with frog-like eyes, wearing a jumpsuit walked right up to him. Stephen swung a punch, missed, and ran home in complete terror.

THE ALIEN WITH A MUSTACHE. On the night of December 1, 1977, Emilio Ruiz woke to find the bedroom of his home in Puente San Miguel, Spain, filling with light. Looking out the window, he saw a tall figure approach and peer inside. To his shock, it wasn’t human. He screamed and the figure walked away. Later, he discovered that numerous people in the town had seen unexplained lights.

Ten cases, from across the planet, all involving a wide variety of humanoids and aliens. These cases show that contact with ETs can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. The evidence cannot be denied. We are not alone!

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. Welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. Thank you very much for
joining me tonight. I think I've got a pretty good episode for you today I love talking about humanoids and that's what
I want to talk about tonight I call this episode 10 startling cases of humanoids
and Aliens so these are cases which come from all over the world including Canada
the United States Brazil austral Australia England Wales Spain
Sweden and France so quite a wide variety of geographic areas the cases
I've chosen today start all the way back in the 1930s up to the 1970s so quite a long
period of time as well most of these are multiple witness cases as well not all
of them um but definitely most of them in some quite a few Witnesses
actually and some of these cases do involve very compelling evidence of
various kinds such as Landing traces physiological or medical effects
electromagnetic disturbances and animal reactions those are the most common
types of evidence and we definitely see that here so yeah I've chosen these
cases because these are really unusual humanoids um really startling cases in some ways
I've said it before but each case adds to our knowledge of what's going on here
I love doing this research I think this subject is super important and everyone
deserves to know about it so let's just get started in the first case I'd like
to talk about today I call 10 little aliens this is a very early case
starting in January of 1931 and this one took place in eslov
Sweden this is a really unusual case now this one is a single witness case so
largely rests on Purely anecdotal eyewitness testimony but nevertheless I
found it quite compelling the witness seems very honest and sincere and his
story is really unusual I don't think I've heard anything quite like this one
this case comes from Swedish researcher Anders lilagan
and it originally appeared in the Swedish UFO magazine UFO information this was in the March April 1973
issue and the sole witness is helge Erikson at the time of his encounter he
was 65 years old and worked as a cattle herder on a farm outside of
eav he had gone to visit a friend for a few hours and late in the evening this
was just after New Year's in January of 19 31 he was walking home and had an
experience that would remain etched in his mind for the rest of his life and as hellga says in his own words I was not
far from the farm where I was working when I saw 10 or 12 small grown men
walking towards me I spotted them about 50 m away and they approached rapidly
they were so small they came up to my knees about and I remember feeling
Heavenly afraid at the remarkable sight now it was a moonlit night there was a
layer of snow on the ground so helge could see clearly as The Little Men
passed right next to him literally only a few feet away from him and he said
they looked human except they were extremely short they had long beards and wore dark green robes they were marching
together at a quick walking pace talking loudly to each other in some unknown
language now he said their heads were disproportionately large in relation to
their bodies and he noticed that their robes had hoods that the entire uniform
was one complete piece no markings on it at all and they were walking in two rows
kind of like a formation of geese he said one after the other talking sometimes clapping to him it almost
looked like a military force they walked in a strange way quickly purposefully
and very easily seeming almost to float he said though they were making quite a
bit of noise and again as Helga says in his own words I was extremely scared and
had to really steal myself not to run away from the place I was there only a
few meters from them the old men so I could count them I concentrated on the
faces which I thought seemed harsh and cruel somehow they were dark in
complexion and their beards seemed very long now hell gave felt certain that
they saw him as he watched them but they paid no attention to him at all seeming
not to care that they were being observed by him but he did notice A peculiar and strong chemical type odor
coming from them and as he says I could smell it for a long time after they
passed now they did not leave any tracks though this is not too unusual because
it was a very hardpacked snow and the men marched past him toward
an alley that led up to the farm where he worked and he watched them move up this alley and saw that there was quote
a strange blue violet glow now this was surrounded by a kind of as he says mist
or kind of fog now this light was extremely intense and it was flashing in
blue violet and yellow and at the same time he could hear a strange whining sound and as Helga says they disappeared
into that glow in a Flash they disappeared as if by a machine I heard
just a whiff of air and they were gone so after that happened Helga went
home and remained in shock he didn't sleep at all that night he later did
tell people about what he experienced some believed him others did not he
really doesn't care either way because he knows what he saw and as Helga says I
never experienced anything like that and when it happened I was completely clear
in my head they were No Ordinary People I met I immediately thought that these
must be people from another world yeah I like that case for a number of reasons
it's just a really unusual testimony it starts very early in time
1931 not a lot of cases of humanoids at that time it does appear that these are
ETS given that he saw this huge bright light heard a weird noise associated
with it I can't say for sure because he didn't actually describe a structured
craft of any time any kind but the witness himself is convinced that these
were ETS of some kind people from another world but so unusual these short
little bearded guys not a lot of cases like that and now we move to the next case
which I wanted to include because the way this this ET is described uh I mean
in terms of humanoid form it's not that uncommon but how he is dressed that's
very weird and I call this case the ET in the purple cape there are two primary
Witnesses but apparently a bunch of people did see the UFO as well this is a landing case during daylight hours
pretty unusual a very close-up sighting of a humanoid this one took place on
February 29 1964 in the crowded suburb of Plimpton
in South Australia it's a pretty compelling case this case was researched
by Keith basterfield it's a very unusual and little known case a rare daylight
case of a UFO landing and a very unusual humanoid there are at least two
witnesses two young boys David and Ken their last names are mathlin and Jensen
though it's unclear whose last name belongs to who but one boy was about 10 years old and the other nine it was 2:30
p.m. again February 29 1964 and the boys were outside playing
near their homes in the suburbs of Plimpton now they were their homes were
located very near the wall oval playing field which you can see pictured here of
course back in 1964 the area was less L developed than it is now but still a
pretty crowded suburb and according to the two kids David and Ken they were out
there playing when they suddenly heard a soft swishing noise and looking up they
saw a glowing disc-shaped object descend towards the nearby field and then
land and amazed at what they saw they rushed forward to investigate but
decided to remain at a distance hiding behind an old abandoned car about about
200 ft away from this craft now this craft they said was kind of saucer shaped or bell-shaped it had large Port
holes surrounding the upper half though according to One Source was actually a clear dark transparent Dome on top but
either way it was quite large and they watched breathlessly as a door opened up
and a 7ot tall figure exited he was so tall he actually had to stoop through
the doorway and according to the boys he looked human he had a large nose but
had copper red skin which reminded them of a fresh sunburn but most unusual were
his clothes he wore a tight fitting blue black tunic and a purple cape he had
shiny black boots which the boys said looked almost metallic in texture he had
a belt around his waist with a device fitted on the front which he continuously operated with his fingers
and on his head he wore a sort of pointed leather cap which was fastened
with a strap to his chin and on his wrists he wore these silvery chain-like
gauntlets or bracelets one of which apparently had a thin tube which led up
one nostril of the man's nose so very unusual David and K in fact were so
amazed that they stood up forgetting that they were hiding at which point this strange humanoid apparently saw
them and in response he immediately turned quickly and faced the craft and
looked at one of the port holes at that exact moment another figure dressed
identically to the first one appeared briefly at the port hole and then was gone seconds later the craft began to
make a humming noise and the outer rim began to Glow meanwhile the first figure
walked quickly back to the doorway again stooping to get in and went inside and
at this point the craft the door closed the craft rose slightly making sort of a
fluttering Falling Leaf motion going back and forth it then tilted at an
angle of about 10° and shot upwards at very high speed now both boys said that
they did hear a dog barking apparently disturbed by the presence of the object so the boys rushed home and
actually didn't report it to their parents until two days days later and then the parents called the police both
boys were interviewed by the police and showed no contradictions or any faults in their story in fact both boys were
Boy Scouts and they said that they would swear an oath of Honor on the truth of their story and all the details they
related they said the whole encounter lasted about 3 minutes and was actually very frightening to
them now according to researcher Colin McCarthy who wrote an article about the
incident for flying saucer review there were about 20 other Witnesses who saw
the object as it Departed the area so this case doesn't realiz solely on the
testimonies of these two boys now there are of course a few detractors and Skeptics but those who
researched the case firsthand do feel it's legitimate and it was interesting
because there does seem to be some corroborating cases occurring around that time
on February 3rd 1964 in Gum Creek which is about 100 miles to the north an
anonymous woman of a farm household said that at 2 a.m. she woke up to find her
bedroom lit up with light and standing about 30 ft away from her in the backyard was a 5 foot 4 in tall man
holding this long rod and apparently also an 18in wide box
and he pointed it at the backyard now her description of the figure's clothes is remarkably similar
to that of the boys she said it wore a blue green outfit a brown jacket with
three buttons down the front a brown balaclava helmet a cord going down from
his left shoulder but like the boys she said this figure had a red face and a large nose he wore flared elbow length
black gloves now as she's watching this thing it's
there's this light coming from above so she speculates that it's from a craft hovering above the house and she watched
as this man held this box-like device and pointed it at various plants in the garden and would make clicking noises so
she speculated he was recording or studying her plans and did this for a
few minutes then apparently noticed her looking through the window and pointed the dev device at her she became
frightened when he clicked the button or whatever how he operated it but nothing
happened and shortly later she's uh in bed and a ring of light kind of appeared
and she fell asleep now she would later report further contact events with this
same figure and also over the next few weeks numerous people in the area began to report UFOs over her farm and the
surrounding areas and importantly some years earlier her husband and their two sons did see
an object hovering at very low level over the tool shed so as I mentioned the wife did see
the same figure on a number of occasions and once she says she smelled the strong
unpleasant pungent odor which reminded her of burnt Bake Light there you go so
that's actually two cases in one little segment there which I wanted to include the second one because it might be
related given that the descript of the ET is so um
similar so yeah really unusual not a lot of cases of people describing ETS and
capes but it does turn up and I like the fact that there's so many witnesses in
both these cases I find that really compelling another interesting detail to
me was the odor that the witness described which we saw in the first case as well so that's another interesting
detail that I think we can learn something from and it shows once again that these are physical events are not
purely psychological as some Skeptics would like to say so let's move on to the next case
because there's a lot of them and this one I call the aliens on the highway
this is a really interesting case which is primarily a single witness case
though there's outside corroboration in Witnesses who apparently saw UFO activity in this area on the same night
and this case also has some really compelling physical evidence as well it took place on August 23rd
1967 just outside of joyville this is in Ontario Canada and I think you'll find
it an interesting case that definitely deserves to be more well known this case
got considerable press attention and attention from researchers the witness was Stanley moxen a
20-year-old salesman and it was around 400 a.m. on the morning of August 23rd
1967 and Stanley was driving to his home in Toronto and he was about 40 mil
Southwest of Smith's Falls between joyville and Glen Grove Road and had
just passed the town of joyville when he noticed an odd green light um to the
right it was sort of at Treetop level and ascending towards the ground and he said it looked as quote big as a
house so this was coming for a landing into the field and as Stanley says the
light was so bright it was like daylight I've never seen anything like it so as
he gets closer he decides he's going to turn off his headlights which he did and he drove onto this little side road a
little gravel road towards this object he drove very slowly and drove pretty
pry much right up to this object and as he came up to it he suddenly flicked his
headlights back on to get a closer look and to his shock and amazement he was
staring right at an enormous Flying Saucer was green in color 30 ft in
diameter and it was landed on the road itself on three legs but even more
astonishing than this is that directly beneath it were two 3 to 4ft tall
figures he said they had bulky bodies they wore white uniforms and helmets and as
Stanley says they seemed to be walking around picking up specimens of Earth and
plants they looked white with bubbles over their heads they seemed to be at work around the
machine now P Stanly the figures appeared to be very surprised to have been suddenly discovered and they
literally flew back into the craft which immediately took off at incredible speed
and and in total silence in seconds it was gone as Stanley says the ship looked
like an upside down Bowl it was on three legs it didn't make a sound just zoom
and it was gone you tell yourself this can't be happening so he was totally amazed and
drove immediately to the police station at Smith's Falls and reported his
encounter he assured the officers that he wasn't tired and seeing things he
hadn't been drinking now he learned from the police that hundreds of other people in the
area had reported seeing strange lights at and around that same
time so after giving his report Stanley and one of the police officers Constable
Steve Whitten returned to the site of the encounter and according to some of
the sources on this case they did in fact find burn marks on the road and
three Impressions which indicated that thousands of pounds of pressure had been
exerted onto the ground now here's another interesting detail because Stanley says that within
12 hours of his experience he was visited by two Air Force investigators
from the United States who conducted a lengthy quote
interrogation and after talking to him for a long time they told him that they would report their findings to him and
then advised him that he should keep his mouth shut about the sighting now of course he never saw them
again never heard back from them but to his credit he didn't keep his mouth shut
and he spoke to reporters about what he had seen I think you'll agree that's a very interesting case and I have to give
kudos to the witness Stanley moxen for stepping forward and courageously going to the police and Reporting his
encounter most Witnesses do not especially if they've seen humanoids or you know been
taken on board or anything like that I mean it's one thing to see a UFO and talk about it quite another to talk
about humanoids and it's an interesting case because many people do describe ETS
walking around their craft and picking plants and taking soil samples which was apparently what was going on here I
found this case also interesting because of the landing traces and the fact that so many people on that night saw UFO
activity and that he was approached by apparently uh Air Force officers
Intelligence Officers from the United States and this is England or uh Canada so that's unusual too bad he didn't hear
back from them but again I'm not surprised about that uh so certainly an interesting case
that deserves to be more well known and that's why I included it in this collection and now we move on to the
next case which is also super interesting I call this one the flying
humanoid this one took place in the Midlands in England Central England and
it took place over a period of time it started with a really close up sighting which took place in
1967 68 thereabout but the humanoid encounter took place in
1976 now the Witnesses are Anonymous in this case but it is a multiple witness
case in terms of the UFO and as you will see it's a really interesting
observation of a flying humanoid and there's so many cases of this that I
think people need to recognize that this sort of thing does happen this very
interesting and unusual case was investigated by English researchers Steven Banks and Martin katman and was
published in the March 1981 issue of Northern UFO news the main witness is a
31-year-old mother known only as Patricia k and she was driving with her
fiance it was around midnight one evening in 1967 or 68 and they had
stopped at a traffic light in Wilston after a night of dancing the her fiance was driving and
she was looking out the window when suddenly right over the rooftops very close just several feet away she saw a
huge domed disc she said it was silver blue gray in color it was a classic
Flying Saucer with a dome on top she said around the central perimeter there
was a stripe with sort of regularly spaced Port holes around the
circumference and these Port holes were glowing with yellow light it hovered for
about 5 Seconds it was very clear and distinct she said and just as she cried
out to her fiance to look this object shot up very quickly and out of sight so
unfortunately her fiance did not get to see it and that was it or so they
thought because it was some 9 years later in the Autumn of
1976 there was a second possibly related and far more dramatic incident the
couple was now married they had an 8-year-old son and he was in his room at
around 9 or 10 p.m. when he heard this odd humming noise coming from outside
and he was an inquisitive child so he climbed up on the storage heater to peer out the window and saw two quote objects
which were moving at a slow kind of walking pace at low level in the sky
approaching in his Direction and as they came closer this woring humming noise became louder so it
was clear to him that the noise was in fact coming from these objects and as
they got real close he saw that these objects were actually two humanoid
figures flying in a horizontal position sort of Superman style with arms
outstretched and legs together behind them facing downwards and they were both
quite short about 4 feet tall he says and dressed in white jumpsuits which the
way witness said kind of quote like babies wear so a onesie full body white
jumpsuits from head to toe he said they also had white helmets with dark visors
over the face and they were low enough to be perfectly illuminated by the street lights as they passed by and the
witness said that they were extremely close within just a few feet of them they did not make any movements other
than to move across the sky but he did see that there was a strange quote
machine type device on their backs it was white like the rest of them but this
device whatever it was was rectangular fitted onto their backs and had another
additional structure like a box on top with a little button-like knob on top of
that and he watched them for a full minute as they moved off into the
distance and even after they disappeared he could still hear the buzzing coming from them for a few seconds after
that now researchers Steven Banks and Martin kman spoke with him directly and
said his story remained consistent as he described the details and interestingly
his mother Patricia his parents had never mentioned their own encounter so the investigators do
speculate that the mother's sighting of a saucer and her son's very closeup sighting of these two 4ft tall white
suited humanoids could very well be connected somehow but they have no direct direct evidence of this
nevertheless they call it quote an intriguing case I totally agree so how
interesting is that can you imagine looking outside of your window because you're hearing this buzzing noise and
seeing a humanoid that close and these there's details to that
case that make it sound very much credible to me given that the witness
describes how this humanoid had this weird box-like device on his back he
didn't know that his parents had had a very close-up encounter as well it's an interesting case and here's another one
one of my favorite in this Bunch cuz it's so unusual the description of the ETS and the events that occurred I call
this one I would not harm a hair on your head and that's a direct quote from one
of the humanoids involved in this case given to the witness this one took place
on January 88th 1974 and also on August 1st 1975 it
involves two separate events which took place in Springfield Ohio actually at
the person's place of employment it's a really fascinating case of a very
closeup sighting with humanoids and some direct interaction as well one of my
favorite UFO researchers Leonard Stringfield is the primary investigator of this case and this case involves a
single witness primarily a man from Springfield Ohio who initially requested
anonymity but we now know him to be Mr John E Justice an employee of the Ohio
Masonic Home for the age in Springfield Ohio and it was about 315 in the morning
on January 8th 1974 that John Justice then age 50 had left his place of
employment this is located at 2655 West National Road in Springfield
Ohio and he began his drive to his home located at 429 North Jackson Street a
very short distance away but he was still on the service road of this Ohio
Masonic Home for the Aged and was about to get on Highway 40 pictured here when
something strange happened and as John says in his own words the first thing
that happened was that my lights went very dim then the lights went out and
the car stopped I couldn't figure out what happened all of a sudden I saw
these very beautiful lights in front of me now these lights were flashing
brilliant rainbow colors of yellow orange red purple blue and green as he
says quote like a rainbow and he's watching this absolutely transfixed by
the beauty of them when these colors transformed to a blinding quote steady
white light and then to his amazement was a strange craft hovering only about
6 feet ahead of him and 4T above the road glowing with This brilliant bright
Golden Light and as John says it was an oval-shaped thing I was shock Ed pretty
bad at the time I couldn't figure out what was happening I would say it was about 6 ft long the whole thing looked
like it was made of plain glass everything was lit up you could see everything the trees the road everything
was lit up and inside my car it was light enough to clip my
fingernails so John could clearly see inside this object cuz it was
translucent and to his amazement there were some very strange looking humanoids
and again I'll just quote John directly as he says inside of this thing as far
as I could see there were five women they were very small maybe just 3 or 4
feet tall they had very long and beautiful hair they had red yellow blue
and green dresses on and the color of the seats that they sat on and the
upholstery matched each one's clothes this is is something I've never seen in
my life the interior of the ship looked like gold to me it was very shiny the
carpet that ran up the center of the aisle like those in airplanes it was a goldish color too I've never seen
anything like it in my life so John wasn't able to see exactly what these beings looked like because as
he says I wish I could I'm not sure because their hair was so long and it
covered part of their faces they were all alike so he's pretty sure they were
females but can't be sure but John says that the hair on these figures was so long it actually was touching the floor
of the craft now John watched this object for just a few moments as far as he can remember when as he says quote it
went dark inside the ship at this point the craft then suddenly flared up with
these same beautiful rainbow lights blinking real fast and as he says it
flew away moving up and away at an angle very fast and I didn't see any more of
it so John needless to say was very much impressed he drove home and when it got
light that same day he called wri Patterson Air Force Base and he tried to
report his encounter but the operator who answered the phone didn't want to hear it and told him that officials at
the base had discontinued their study of UFOs and were no longer taking reports he then tried calling the Clark
County Sheriff's department but they again showed no interest either so
finally he called the newspaper he spoke with a reporter by the name of William Connor and William Connor contacted
researcher Leonard Stringfield so together they went to John and
interviewed him and investigated the whole incident and they learned something very interesting cuz it turned
out that another employee at the facility a maintenance man by the name
of Nelson Ray Fields said that on the same night as John Justice's encounter
the call radio which he carries with him at work at all times started acting up
in fact it went on all night and that he said he could hear quote nothing but
static on it he told them quote my paging radio wouldn't work in the
hospital that night and he didn't just give up on it he tried changing the battery no less than four times but it
still wouldn't work now John Justice the main witness told Conor and Stringfield that quote I
wouldn't mind seeing it again I was scared though little did John Justice
know he would soon get his wish it was about one and a half years later this
time on August 1st 1975 it was about 1 p.m. and John was
again driving away from the Masonic Home for the Aged and was still on the actual
company grounds when he suddenly heard a deep guttural voice coming from the
passenger seat and it said out loud let go of the steering
wheel now this naturally shocked John he ignored the command at first but it
repeated saying let go of the steering wheel and added the word friend so this
time completely shocked Jon obeyed the command and let go of the steering wheel
and to his amazement the car continued down this long driveway so John as you might expect
looked over at the passenger seat and there was no one there not that he could see but he did see that there was a
depression in the seat just as if somebody invisible sat there so John asked a question he asked
you know if he was going to be harmed and the voice replied friend I would not
harm a hair on your head John asked what they wanted from him now there was no
response but then the voice said that he was a Spaceman that he had been inside the object that John and his friend had
seen a few nights earlier as it turned out just a few few nights earlier John and his friend had seen an anomalous
star-like light in the sky but hadn't really thought much of it then the voice
said that John would be able to see him when he left the car and then told him
to look up above the power lines ahead of him and when John looked he was
amazed cuz he saw a male human figure floating in the air 10 ft above the
ground right in front of his car this figure was male human looking about 6
and 1/2 ft tall and according to John very handsome he was glowing with light
and John said he wore this tight fitting silver outfit with a belt boots and
gloves and he was holding his arms outstretched in front of him the voice
then said that John would be visited again and he promptly disappeared from view at which point John now very shaken
took took a hold of the steering wheel and drove home and that's where it ends
if John was ever visited again he didn't report it yeah I love that case I'm glad
the witness did come forward we know who he is we know exactly where it took
place I love the fact that there's another witness who was able to confirm this case to a small degree in terms of
there being electromagnetic disturbances coinciding exactly with the time of the
encounter I think that's significant and it was interesting that the witness hoped for another encounter and sure
enough it happened but to me the most interesting aspect is the description of these ETS short little humanoids with
hair so long it reaches down to basically their feet I mean I don't know
that I've ever heard that before just goes to show there's a wide variety of
humanoid types out there and here is another case which which is super fascinating I call this
one I was really afraid and this took place on November 17 1975 outside of
Cedar Rapids Iowa it's a fascinating case with at least two
witnesses but what's really interesting about it is they both have slightly differing memories of what happened and
there's some interesting insights into this case about how a UFO encounter is
recalled and how how it affects a person this case comes from longtime researcher
Kevin D Randle perhaps best known for his work into Roswell and it was
published in the international UFO reporter and again it's a very interesting case which illustrates how
some close encounters with humanoids can involve weird memory issues which is a
common feature of many UFO cases was November 17 1975 as two
college students Dave vman and Suzanne arenberger were driving near the
Palisades Kepler State Park this is near Cedar Rapids Iowa Dave was driving when
they both noticed a quote starlike object which was hovering in the southwest Sky now as they watched this
object began to descend and it was clear to them that this was unusual so Dave
slowed down and then pulled the car over on a Side Road and they both exited the
car to watch this thing and as Suzanne says in her own words we watched it come
down and as it hit to about 1 to 200 ft this bright white light came on there
was a big red light on the bottom we were very close to it maybe about 30 ft
away it was about 25 ft off the ground it looked like it or at least the top
part was made of glass we could see it quite well so according to Suzanne this
craft was about 30 feet in diameter and the interior of the top Dome glowed with
light and inside she could see two dark figures behind the light that looked
like people though she couldn't really see much detail really only a torso and
a head couldn't make out any facial features or anything like that but to her they look like humanoid figures
now as they watched this craft moved and went behind some trees as if coming in for a landing at that point a second
object appeared further away and also began to descend and as it came down a
third object appeared and also began to descend and looking up she says she saw about a dozen other star-like objects
now no point did either of them hear any noise coming from these objects now here's where it gets kind of
interesting because the other witness Dave reported that despite suzan's testimony of a structured craft with a
clear Dome and apparent humanoids inside of it he did not remember that he could
only remember seeing strange lights in the sky he was really quite surprised by Suzanne's assertions but also made a
very important admission he told researcher Kevin Randall she remembered
more than I do so this could be an sign of a much
closer encounter that he can remember only Snippets of and Suzanne remembers more now in fact when Suzanne first drew
a sketch of this craft she did not draw in the humanoids she either recalled
this later or perhaps was reluctant to report humanoids as many witnesses are
for fear of being disbelieved or ridiculed but after seeing this both
Dave and Suzanne were very frightened they went back into their car they drove
to Mount Vernon and called the police an officer returned with them to the site
now these objects that had come very low to the ground of course were no longer there though Suzanne pointed out these
star-like objects overhead the officer thought that these were just normal stars but he did admit that both Dave
and Suzanne were clearly frightened so while Dave only remembers seeing lights
he was quite frightened apparently by them and Suzanne herself according to
the officer was nearly hysterical he had to kind of talk her down from her fear
and it was absolutely clear to him that they were telling the truth uh the police did check with local airports who
said that there were no known aircraft in the area but that there was allegedly
a fire near the location of the sighting so they speculated perhaps they had seen that which of course makes no sense
because she saw a structured craft 30 ft away Suzanne did share her story with
newspaper reporters and said that she was not happy with the police's attitude
and as Suzanne says it really upset me because they took it so lightly I was
really afraid too and I told them hey look this thing is real we know what we
saw and as it turned out there were other Witnesses a gentleman by the name
of Richard Manson a Civil Air Patrol employee was driving near this area on
that night and saw an object with bright red and blue lights now he didn't think
much of it until he heard Dave and suzan's story in the news but the Mount Vernon Police did say
that they also received two calls from Witnesses reporting strange objects in
the sky in the same area which was about an hour after Dave and Suzanne's
sighting so this is some pretty good additional corroboration now researcher Kevin
Randall suspects that Suzanne may have quote confabulated her memory of the
humanoids given that she didn't initially draw them however I think it
personally that it's much more likely that this is another example of witnesses having varying levels of
memory of an encounter because Amnesia and memory problems is very often reported with very close
encounters and Randall to my surprise ultimately concluded that the witnesses
had seen quote traffic at the airport and nothing unusual which really surprises me
because Suzanne very clearly said that this object was 30 feet away it had a
structured uh metallic texture a clear Dome on top it was a classic Flying
Saucer and also let's face it there were multiple Witnesses who thought that the
activity that they saw was strange enough to call the police this certainly doesn't sound like planes to me but you
can make up your own mind about it yeah I found that to be a very compelling multiple witness case I know Kevin
Randall is skeptical but he's skeptical of a lot of UFO reports I don't think
this was an airplane given that they saw it so close up so close to the ground
transparent Dome humanoids it's not at all unusual for people to be very
reluctant to discuss the humanoid aspect at first so that could be what's going on here or perhaps she just remembered
it later would love to talk to this witness and get more clarification but I think it's a legitimate case because
again there's a lot of outside corroborating Witnesses who saw UFO activity in that area at that
time now moving on to the next case this one's very unusual I'm warning you I
call this one 50 frog likee ETS now it's pretty unusual to see one
humanoid or two or three and I don't know of a whole lot of cases where people see large crowds of humanoids
perhaps on a craft that's one thing but on the ground not so much and that's what happened in this case which took
place on May 2nd 1976 in maton France
uh the witness is known he's identified he has given interviews it's a pretty
compelling case and what's so unusual about it is the description of these
apparent ETS he saw hard to say whether they were ETS or not because they didn't
actually see a craft but you can make up your own mind about it the main witness
in this case was 21-year-old Dominique minj he worked as
a butcher and it was around 900 p.m. on a hot overcast dark and stormy night as
Dominique drove his Ral automobile between the towns of maton and leang du
banel this is near ardan France and he was driving through a wooded area known
as laa de and he reached the intersection where the roads lead to dub
banel and du V heading towards leang and this is when some lights or Reflections
in the field caught his eye and looking out the window of his car he saw an
incredible sight I mean he could hardly believe his eyes because standing Motionless in the field were about he
says 50 little green men that looked very much like frog likee
humanoids now this field was level with his car it was just getting dark but he says he could clearly see these little
men some were facing towards him others were in profile he said they appeared to
be green in color though admits that this might have been a skin tight jumpsuit of some kind he couldn't say
for sure but he did notice that they had long arms that reached halfway down their legs he could clearly see that
they had webbed hands and webbed feet he said their heads looked like they were covered in some kind of mask kind of
like a diver's mask or perhaps a helmet but he could see that each of them had
two large round red eyes big about 4 in wide that seemed to reflect light but
weren't actually emitting any light he said their bodies were somewhat fat
though their arms and legs were very thin they're quite short he estimates about 4 feet tall and so many of them
now these beings stood perfectly still making no movement that he could see they did not seem to notice him or pay
any attention to his presence whatsoever he saw nothing in their hands or anything like this nor did he see any
craft or object on the ground or in the sky but seeing how many of them there
were and their strange appearance he did become quite frightened and he
immediately pulled onto a side road turned around and began to head back in the direction he had come but as he
turned around he saw another one of these little guys and this one was was standing very close to him only about 10
ft away so he got a good look at him and he drove straight home returning to his
brother's house and told him what happened he was so frightened he says that he nearly suffered a nervous
breakdown and only got a few Winks of sleep that night now French researcher
Miss spingler who wrote about the case in the French magazine lumier donu which
mean means lights in the night he interviewed the witness only one week
after the incident now spingler encouraged Dominique to make a police
report which he did and then the witness the investigator and the police returned
to the location to look for any evidence Unfortunately they found no Landing
traces or Footprints or anything like that but I'm glad he did make a police
report because this I think argues towards the credibility of his case it's
unlikely that someone who is hoaxing this would go ahead and call the police so this is the kind of case that is
really hard to investigate because there was no apparent Landing traces any
electromagnetic effects no real physical evidence of any kind it's simply an
anecdotal story resting on one person's eyewitness testimony but nevertheless
super interesting because there are many other reports of people seeing figures
very much like he describes and it's hard to believe that he would just make something up like
this out of the blue most people do not seek attention certainly they're not going to get the kind of attention you'd
think uh most people are subject to extreme ridicule and again this is one
of the reasons most Witnesses keep silent now let's move to the next case
and this one is a doozy I and I have not heard a case quite like this this one I
call almost abducted by aliens this took place on September 9
1976 in the small town of varum Grande this is outside of minus Garis Brazil
and it's a really unusual case it is a multiple witness case it does involved
some very well verified physiological effects and some Landing traces as well
but it's a very dramatic case not super welln really unusual in terms of the
description of the ET and the UF UFO itself and what happened to the primary
witness this case comes from Brazilian researcher Alberto Francisco do Carmo
and it's exceedingly strange and unique do Caro wrote a letter to Jay Allen heck
informing him of the case and the main Witness is hermelindo Da Silva who works
as a farmer and Trader and is a bar owner at the time of his encounter he
was in his late 30s he's married with six children so it was around 2:00 a.m.
on September 9 1976 and hermelindo accompanied by his
dog was walking to his home on the outskirts of the small town of varam
Grande in Brazil and he noticed that his dog started to act very agitated
and he was only about 200 ft from his home right near the bar that he owned
when the area around him suddenly became illuminated with a brilliant light and
at the same time there was this loud humming noise surrounding him and looking up he saw a bright glowing
object which he estimates was about 12 maybe 13 ft in diameter and it had a
dark opening in the bottom at this point hermal lindo's dog immediately began
barking non-stop at this object in an extremely aggressive manner then
suddenly seemed to receive some kind of shock and then turned and ran away in
absolute fear now without warning this glowing object darkened hermelindo was badly
shaken but thought that or hoped that the object had left but still very
concerned he ran immediately to the back door of his bar which again was just a a
few hundred ft from his home and he tried to take shelter there he tried really hard to open the door but he was
too nervous to unlock it so instead he crouched against the wall and looked up to see if the object was still there and
it was it lit up again again making a loud buzzing noise and now thoroughly
panicked hermelindo reacted by taking a piece of wood off the ground and hurling
it at the object which was hovering at this this point only about 25 ft
overhead and he made a direct strike he heard the wood actually hit the object
which again the lights on it went out the buzzing noise stopped but it was
instantly replaced by a loud hissing noise at this point hermelindo felt
something struck his shoulder actually knocking him down so he was beyond afraid at this
point he jumped up and began to run towards his house and he said the object
moved staying above him and get this it released four cables from the bottom
side which had apparent what he described as hooks on the end and a
small being appeared from the opening in the bottom of the object descended down one of the cables and actually struck
hermal Lindo physically knocking him down again now this being he said was
humanoid 3 ft tall T wearing a shiny gray uniform with a helmet and this
began a sort of 15minute long struggle as this being from the UFO tried to hook
hermelindo and pull him into the craft while hermelindo himself fought to
escape now when hermelindo ran away the being keeping its arms bent like a boxer
sort of pushed him towards these cables these Hooks and hermelindo was not
having it he grabbed the being bodily and lift it up off the ground he said it
was quite light but its body was hard as steel he said it seemed to shake a little bit when herlindo grabbed it but
finally this being did succeed in hooking one of these hooks around Herm lindo's left ankle and immediately raced
up the cable back into the craft and at the same time this cable was drawn upwards pulling herlindo off the ground
this point he's dangling upside down towards the craft he says and as he got closer to the Craft's opening he could
feel this very intense heat coming from it now no surprise at this point he's
screaming for help and Herm lindo's brother-in-law who lived with him heard
Herm lindo's screams and looked out of the window of the home and saw hermelindo being pulled up upside down
into the craft now as hermelindo reached the opening he wedged his right foot
against the bottom of the craft and managed to free himself he fell about 18
F feet down into a large yucka Plant cutting himself pretty badly all over
his body yucka plants are very sharp he quickly extricated himself and ran
directly into the house his family saw that he was covered with cuts from the sharp yucka plant his left foot was
already swelling up his knee was badly bruised his eyes were also swelling up
but as hermer Lindo says I hit him I hit him a lot I did everything with him HT
heavy punches so this UFO remained there hovering over the home for a few more
minutes seen by everyone in the family before suddenly darting away now hermal
Lindo never got a good look at the object he only saw the bottom side but his brother-in-law got a good side view
from the window and said this object had a conical structure with a round top
giving it a bell-like appearance so this was investigated afterwards they did to find a footprint
left by the being but unfortunately it rained shortly later and the footprint was washed away but reportedly hermal
Lindo was ill for several days following this extraordinary encounter what a case
that is I mean can you imagine having a UFO come down that low over you and
these cables with hooks on them trying to grab you most people are just sucked up a beam of light seems kind of
primitive to me but there are are other cases like this so I suppose ETS have
different methods of how they operate I don't know it's a very unusual case but I think we have to take it seriously
because this was well verified it was investigated by professional researchers
there was an outside witness there were physiological effects that certainly would not be easy to fake and why would
you I mean the witness was ill for days afterwards so I think it's a legitimate
case but so unusual and now we move to another case
which I call unnatural eyes this is something a lot of witnesses describe
almost without exception when someone sees a humanoid it's really the unusual
eyes that capture their attention because they're so large or hypnotic or
very wise but this is another closeup case of a landed UFO with a humanoid
and yes this is a single witness case though it does have some interesting animal reactions the kind I've heard
before but still really unusual and this one took place on March
13 1977 this is near penbroke in Wales and
this one's for you Roy you asked for a case in your area so I found this one
for you cuz there are cases all over the world and I think you'll find this one very
compelling this next case was investigated by UK researcher Randall
Jones Pew it's a briefcase but very interesting involving a young man by the
name of Steven Taylor who was 17 years old it was around 900 p.m. again on
March 13 1977 that Steven had just visited his girlfriend and was walking back to his
home near Penny Kum in pen Brookshire Wales
now looking up he was surprised to see a sharply defined kind of pear-shaped
object in the sky which was glowing with a bright orange light he was very much
intrigued by what he saw so instead of going home he ran to a friend's house to share his sighting but his friend
unfortunately did not believe him so Steven left and continued his
walk back home he thought his encounter was over but of course it wasn't he had
gone about a half mile when he noticed that something was blocking out the lights on the horizon ahead of him it
was about 9:30 p.m. at this point and Steven says he felt this strange wave of
fear he wasn't sure why but as he approached closer he saw that the lights were being blocked out by a pretty large
dark object which was landed on the ground in a nearby field and as he got
closer he saw that yeah this thing was big about 20 ft wide 30 40 ft long and
he could discern a sort of faint glow coming from underneath it so he stood there and looked at it he
lit a cigarette and stood there watching it and this is when he heard footsteps
he could hear it walking on leaves coming towards him and looking towards the source he saw this 6ot tall figure
coming right up to him he said it wore a strange onepiece kind of semi-transparent
jumpsuit and came right up to him in fact Stephen was close enough to see that this strange humanoid looked human
but had very high cheekbones unnatural looking eyes which were very large and
very round kind of resembling fish eyes he said over its mouth he said was a
box-like device with a tube leading over its shoulder and Steven said it looked quote
like a skinny human 6 feet tall like an old man so he was filled with fear at
the sight of this figure and actually swung a punch towards him didn't actually strike this figure instead he
turned and ran straight home and once he got home another odd thing happened his
dog began snarling and barking viciously in a way he normally did not do and in
fact had to be put outside the next day thankfully the dog was back to normal
but the behavior was really out of the norm and clearly connected to this case
so again this case was investigated by Randall Jones Pew and published in the
buor journal and really interesting is that Taylor's sighting was just one
month after the very famous broad Haven Primary School UFO landing which
involved not only a UFO landing but a human as well such a shame the witness
was not believed when he described the initial UFO sighting in this case cuz
his friend could have gone out with him gone looking and they both would have seen it and this would have turned into
an anecdotal case into one with multiple Witnesses I also find the animal
reaction Super interesting in this case because I've heard the same thing before someone can come back from a very
intense encounter and their pet who is normally very friendly does not react
that way almost as if they don't recognize the witness makes me wonder if they're smelling something on them or
sensing this these ETS in some way that we don't understand now the case is
really interesting because the witness did try to actually punch the ET and
didn't but I can tell you that there are a few cases where people have laid a punch right on an ET so that does happen
yeah it's an interesting case and now we move to the last case in this collection and I wanted to include this
one because this ET is described in a in a way that I've never heard before so
many different types of ETS and this one's unique I call this one the alien
with a mustache and this took place on December 1st 1977 in the small town of quente San
Miguel in canab Bria Spain it's a really really interesting
encounter uh with with a very closeup face-to-face encounter with a humanoid
and I like this case not only because the humanoid described as very unusual but all the people throughout this town
I mean not all of them but many of them saw UFO activity on that night at the
time of the encounter which brings a whole new level of credibility to this
case this last and final case first appeared in the Spanish language book UFO encounters by AER himz and it was
about 4:50 a.m. on the morning of December 1st
1977 the main witness is emelo Ruiz who worked as a minor and he was sleeping in
bed on the first floor of his parents home in pente San Miguel now he shared a
room with his younger brother Christal whose bed was right below the window leading to the street outside side this
detail is important as we shall see now suddenly yeah 4:50 in the morning
without warning the dogs in the area began to howl loudly when the howling
persisted amelo annoyed stuck his head out from underneath his blankets to
investigate and to his surprise a bright light was streaming in through the small
bedroom window and as emelo says at first I thought it was already daytime
time and that we had slept late but as he continued to look out the window he
realized that the light was not sunlight and in fact it was this pure white light
so brilliant that it was blinding emo actually had to cover his eyes with his
hands and when this light started flashing strangely he knew that something very odd was happening outside
so he sat up fully in bed and started to prepare to go outside and investigate
when he suddenly saw that someone was approaching his bedroom window in a very determined manner with no
hesitation so this frightened him he pulled the blankets up around him and continued watching and very quickly
whoever it was came right up to the window and peered inside and boy did
emelo get a shock because he saw that this face was not human the figure
itself had to be very tall he estimates about 9 feet judging from the way it was
hunched over to look inside the window but as me emelo says in his own words it
was horrible a chill ran through me the face seemed dark black and hairless and
the truth is that I felt a deep fear he had a very light whitish mustache and
large round expressive eyes and I'm sure he watched inside my brother was right
under the window but he was still asleep without realizing anything so emelo was absolutely Frozen
in fear and watched as this tall figure stepped back from the window and Amelio
could now see that it was dressed in the sort of cocky like tunic and had a white
belted stripe going vertically down the right side of its chest he saw that its body was very thin but as it stepped
away from the window and into the darkness emelo began screaming this immediately woke up his
younger brother Christal and by the time the being of course was no longer visible but there
was still this very brilliant bright white light next to the house so it was
Christa ball who rushed outside and as he says when I reached the door
everything stopped as if going off so morning came shortly thereafter
and they found out that the whole town was a Buzz with this because it turned out that many people in the town had
also seen this brilliant glowing light and one of the witnesses a lady by the
name of Bina Nora said that she actually saw a structured object take off from an
open field Emilio's window faces a little area known as El Plaza de Javier
Erza and an examination of this area did show strange footprints apparently from
the being that had looked inside ao's bedroom window so how about that what an
unusual ET I'm really glad that the witness did have corroborating Witnesses
who saw UFOs over that town on that night and of course there's some
apparent Landing traces in terms of footprints being found but a really
compelling case overall can only imagine what it would be like to have your room fill up with light
and look out the window and see a strange figure approaching and then have him look right into the window at you
and realize wow this is not a human so there you go 10 cases from all
over the world from the 1930s up through the 1970s some involving many witnesses many
involving compelling evidence of various kinds I'm always surprised that there
are still people who are skeptical of UFOs and humanoids because there are so many
cases so I really appreciate you guys watching that's pretty much it for today I do want to add one thing there are a
number of you out there who are watching who have asked me to cover certain areas
so that's what I'd like to do I'm going to put out a little request here a challenge if you want me to cover a case
in your area your hometown or whatever yeah let me know put a comment in this
video name the town or the city you live in or which you'd like to see an encounter from and I'll see if I can dig
one up so this will be a By Request future episode if I get enough reports
and responses of that because I keep saying it these encounters happen all
over the world I think pretty much every location on this planet has a long and Rich history of UFO encounters if you
dig hard enough so we'll see how that turns out thanks guys I really appre
appreciate you watching I consider you my friends so just much love to you uh
and as I always like to say when I sign off keep searching for answers they're out there keep looking for the truth
it's important and most important of all keep having fun and I will see you next
time bye for now
