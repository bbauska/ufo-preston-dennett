THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING UFO ABDUCTEE
Nov 28, 2020

Summary:
Nov 28, 2020
UFOs appear to represent a very advanced technology. The extraterrestrial craft can move at 
dazzling speeds, turn at right angles, change into various shapes and even turn invisible. 
Another incredible talent of UFOs and extraterrestrials is their miraculous ability to change 
their size. They can make not only make themselves and their ships large or small, but they 
can also do this to human beings.

This video features twenty UFO cases in which extraterrestrials display their seemingly 
magical technology, causing bizarre spatial anomalies of many kinds. UFOs that are bigger 
on the inside than the outside, miniature UFOs with tiny aliens, people who are struck by 
mysterious UFO beams of light that cause them to shrink or grow in size -- something very 
strange is happening here. The ETs' ability to manipulate space and time is undeniable. 

As these cases show, extraterrestrials have a technology that allows them to do things 
that are boggle the imagination. It's important that people know how truly advanced these 
beings are.

Here: Volume Two."

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. The title of today's presentation is "The Incredible  
Shrinking Abductee". I've got 20 cases. I want to present to you which show how dazzlingly  
advanced et technology is particularly in their ability to control space itself there's been a 
lot of research into time anomalies associated  with ufos but not as much research into spatial 
anomalies so that's what i want to talk about here  there are many different types and the first type 
i want to talk about is what is known as a tardis  a tardis is a time and relative dimension in space 
or basically an object that's larger on the inside  than the outside a tardis was popularized first 
in the dr who uh the television series with  with the uh interdimensional fourth dimensional 
telephone booth used by doctor who to traverse  various dimensions and this object was 
larger on the inside than the outside this is  something that we see quite a bit in literature 
and film certainly we see it with mary poppins  and her handbag in which she carried all kinds of 
plant lights and house plants and what have  you we see this in the dungeons and dragons 
game with the secret bag of holding we  see this in quite a number of places 
certainly in the harry potter series super  fans will of course know it as mr perkins tent 
so this these are objects that are larger on the  inside than they appear on the outside and there's 
turns up in a bunch of ufo cases a couple  of cases i'd like to talk about come from 
jacques valet a very well-known ufo researcher  and the author of many many books on ufos 
and he's run across a couple of cases in which  ufos are much bigger on the inside than on the 
outside one such case occurred on november 2nd  1975 outside of the town of happy camp there were 
five witnesses who came driving along and came  upon a fog bank saw ufo had missing time one of 
the witnesses helen white was taken on board and  she definitely reported this weird spatial anomaly 
as jacques vallee writes and i'm quoting the most  puzzling fact in the experience was the size of 
the object the craft into which helen white was  abducted was much larger inside than outside 
jacques filet was particularly intrigued by this  report because he had run across it before he had 
a case in gilroy california this was reported in  his book confrontations as was the previous case 
this next case from gilroy california took  place in august of 1973 and involved quite 
a few of witnesses in the area about 20 witnesses  from different locations one of the witnesses was 
miss victor who later was actually taken on board  this craft and she reported the same thing she was 
very confused about the size of the craft because  from the outside it appeared to be about the size 
of a house but inside it had multiple levels and  appeared to be much much larger and jacques villa 
found this all very intriguing particularly in  regards to what this might imply about the ufo 
phenomena and the origin of the these objects and  as jacques valet writes in his book confrontations 
although aeronautical engineers  will scoff at this bizarre detail   the topologists among my readers may be intrigued 
as i was by the possible interpretations it opened 
if there are more than four dimensions as  many theoretical physicists now suspect 
it may be interesting to speculate a  hypercraft capable of topological inversion 
into our space-time continuum could indeed  be larger on the outside than on the inside 
so by topological inversion uh jacquesville  is basically saying that space can be 
transformed sort of inside out inverted and  an object that is small in appearance on the 
outside can actually appear to be much larger  on the inside and actually contain greater space 
because it's moving into another dimension  and quite a few ufo cases reflect this 
an excellent case involving this bizarre  detail comes from sergeant charles moody 
his case was investigated by jim and coral  lorenzen it occurred on august 13 1975 outside of 
alamogordo new mexico when sergeant charles moody  went outside to watch a meteor shower that evening 
and came upon a landed ufo this object  just dropped down out of the sky near him 
he was approached by humanoids  and dragged forcibly into a craft he said that this craft from the 
outside appeared to be about 50 feet long and 20 feet wide he was 
taken inside to a room about that size he thinks  and physically examined he was then treated more 
in a different manner i guess when he overcame  his fear and uh the et's then proceeded to 
take him out of the large examination room  into what appeared to be the engine room 
and this really shocked uh charles because  the end room itself was also very large 
it had these weird crystals in it all lined up  next to metal rods ets were explaining how they 
use electromagnetism to power their craft there  was a weird black box he saw a bunch of other 
stuff the ets gave him various messages so that  they had a larger craft rotating the earth and the 
other bases and would one day reveal themselves at  any rate important here is the size of the craft 
which really perplexed uh charles moody and  also jim and coral lorenzen as coral lorenzen 
writes moody was later very perplexed about this  because the first room was as large as the second 
and he didn't see how the two would fit into  the craft as he observed it from the outside 
that's a wonderful case which has never been  disproven and there's other cases that have 
this same exact feature another excellent case  is that of carl higdon of rawlings wyoming 
carl higdon was a hunter and on   october 25th 1974 he was out hunting elk he  spotted a 
herd of elk and took a shot at one when 
his bullet stopped and fell to the ground that's  when he noticed a strange figure approaching him 
this figure invited carl higdon aboard a  craft carl looked and saw this very small 
object metallic rectangular in shape uh not too  far away i said it was actually not that large at 
all as carl higdon says it was a transparent  cube-shaped object resting on the ground  
no sooner had the being invited carl hidden  on board when he found himself inside  
and as carl higdon says it was much smaller  than any of our commercial or military planes  
in fact you're going to think i'm crazy but this  thing couldn't have been more than five feet high  
seven feet long and fourteen and a half feet  wide tiny is the only word i can think of to  
accurately describe its size before i was  able to move a muscle i found myself inside  
this contraption it was instantaneous how i was  able to fit inside remains a riddle they must  
have shrunk me that's the only explanation that  seems plausible uh yeah this really puzzled him  
he knows it was larger because he could see the  five elk on one side of the room in a glass cage  
he was taken to a room and physically examined  at some point he was apparently taken to another  
planet it's a long complex case it's got an  enormous amount of physical evidence in support  
of it carl higdon's truck was found some distance  away from where he parked it in the middle of a  
field with no tracks to how it got there at  the time higdon had his abduction experience  
there were other people in the area who  actually witnessed a ufo uh carl hugton  
himself did not remember his on-board segment  until some time later he was severely traumatized  
and recalled it under hypnosis with the help  of leo sprinkle who hypnotically regressed him  
that's just a very interesting case in fact carl  hogden reported two healings as a result of his  
encounter he was healed of kidney stones and also  of scars on his lungs caused by tuberculosis but  
what's important here is the size of this  craft on the outside compared to the inside  
as carl higdon says this craft was five feet  high seven feet wide and about 14 feet long  
but inside it was much larger and  as carl higdon says and again i'm   quoting rationally i know that in order for  me the aliens and the elk to get in there  
we must have been shrunk there's no other way i  wouldn't venture how they accomplished this feat  
so carl higdon doesn't remember being  physically shrunk but this is what he   thinks is happening here it didn't even occur to  him that the object might be bigger on the inside  
but maybe he is being shrunk because there  are as we'll see there are cases that lean  
towards this theory but a number of cases  seem to show that these objects are just  
very simply larger on the inside than they are on  the outside there was a case that i presented in  
my book ufos over colorado this case occurred on  april 9th 1955 the main witness is marty minetto  
he lived on a ranch with his family at the  time he was just a little kid age five when  
he had this experience with his grandfather one  evening his grandfather took him out purposefully  
for a pre uh arranged appointment with the ufo  and they met these friendly looking ets they were  
walking along this little dirt road near their  home when a craft dropped down out of the sky  
according to marty it was about the size  of a small house you know could cover   the width of the road or so his grandfather  approached first talked with two human-looking  
humanoids and then marty was invited on  board and given basically a tour of the craft  
and inside the croft was absolutely huge as marty  says it appeared to be about as big as a football  
field and filled with human looking people it  was he estimated on the inside 40 feet high and  
at least 120 feet long with two decks lit up in  a white pink light so very large from the inside  
at some point marty asked the et's where they  come from and they gave him your sort of typical  
enigmatic answer they replied that we come from  between my time and yours we come from a place  
here on earth but beneath your time in a different  phase so this sort of points towards their  
ability again to control space and if they can  control space they can certainly control time  
but here's another very interesting case involving  someone who's been on taken on board a craft and  
reported that it's much bigger on the inside than  the outside this case comes from barry littleton  
i talked to him personally he's a  very interesting and very kind man   he's quite well known within the ufo field  he's got his own facebook group it's called  
tardis actually which again is an object  that's larger on the inside than the outside  
he also has his own uh very well received youtube  channel i highly recommend checking it out  
because there's this one video on there called  ufos and temporal displacement where barry  
littleton speaks about his own encounters  with being taken on board a ufo that was  
larger on the inside than the outside it was just  a small little craft but he was taken from room  
to room to room which seemed to form as he went  into them as if it was sort of fourth dimensional  
so it's just another very interesting  case that speaks towards this   and there are others one gentleman i interviewed  for my book on board ufo encounters is joe gardner  
a really nice man from huntington west virginia  uh he had this experience actually with his  
family this was in the summer of 1974. they  went out to go pick wild blackberries this  
was a fun family activity that they did  each year and they were driving down the  
roads and actually went across the border into  kentucky when they passed what appeared to be a  
spaceship house is what they called it it was  this saucer-shaped metallic structure on very tall  
stilts and it looked like a house that's what they  thought it was at the time and they actually got  
out of the car and approached this thing long  story short they ended up having missing time  
and being taken on board the entire family of four  again this object was about the size of a house  
but once on board joe reports that it was  absolutely much larger on the inside he was taken  
through several rooms which were very large  in fact one room was so large he couldn't  
even see the wall so again there appears to be an  inter-dimensional aspect to the interior of these  
ufos or they can change you know they're  bigger on the inside than on the outside  
so that's one category another category that's  just as interesting as the et's ability to change  
the size of their craft there's countless cases  in which ufos have changed shape from circular to  
triangular to cigar shaped to what have you weird  blobs ufos not only change shapes they can expand  
in size or contract sometimes appearing as little  balls of light and growing into mother ships or  
starting as giant ships and shrinking down  sometimes they just turn transparent and disappear  
turning at right angles they do all kinds of  things that are interdimensional and this appears   to be related to their ability to control space  and they can definitely change the size of their  
craft one very interesting case that points  towards this comes from abductee bill foster  
he wrote a book about his experiences called the  black triangle abduction on november 16 1996 bill  
and peggy foster were driving with two friends  through the town of yadkinville north carolina  
when they saw a very large triangular shaped  ufo they had missing time didn't realize the  
time that they had actually been abducted but  later you know realized that they had had missing  
time and went under hypnosis and under hypnosis  recalled a long drawn-out onboard ufo encounter  
and what was really interesting is how big this  craft was according to bill foster it was quote  
at least a city block in diameter so following  this incident and several hypnosis sessions  
bill foster realized he was a lifelong abductee  he started having fully conscious encounters he  
finally got over his fear and would often converse  with the ets they were usually very tight-lipped  
and would say nothing other than don't be  afraid and would refuse to answer his questions  
but one time bill wouldn't take no for an answer  and he got some very interesting information about  
the size of their craft one day he was taken  on board they were physically examining him  
and he turned to one of the gray et's and said  and i'm quoting i want to see more of this place  
i am sick of this same room every time how big  is this place the e.t didn't answer so bill  
repeated his question and finally the e.t looked  at him in what bill foster perceived as amusement  
and this grey actually smiled at him as  bill foster writes now that's the first  
time i ever saw this guy smile and he  said it's as big as we want it to be  
so the et's told him that they have the ability to  control the size of their craft as it suits their  
needs and this is exactly what other witnesses  have reported i investigated one case personally  
involving a gentleman by the name of kevin cammon  his account appeared in my book inside ufos  
he's a navy corpsman who in 1982 was stationed  in the navy and was with his friend out in the  
philippines in the atlantic ocean and uh he had an  encounter his friend was a contactee and basically  
invited him on board the ufo to kevin's shock this  actually worked long story short he found himself  
aboard this very large kind of diamond shaped  craft it was hard to tell what shape it was  
because it was dazzlingly bright and at least as  large as the navy ship itself which was about 600  
feet anyway he finds himself in this room and  he was visited with praying mantis type ets he  
describes him as being about 15 feet tall there  was a chest high console running along one edge  
of the room the floor was like a metallic great  he had a long conversation with these ets but uh  
important here is he started to notice that the  room was changing in size sometimes it would be  
smaller 20 feet across at one  point he asked where they were from   and the room seemed to expand in size to at  least 50 feet and they showed him this star chart  
so they had this apparent  ability to control space itself
so this is apparently something  they have the ability to do   the most interesting case in my humble opinion  of this kind comes from researcher john lear  
who has done a lot of ufo research  and john lear talks about a case  
which occurred in 1973 to a army  photographer by the name of mike  
mike was just a petty photographer and suddenly  his security clearance was upgraded to top secret  
and he was shipped off to norton air force base  in california which by the way has been implicated  
in a number of ufo cases involving ufo crash  retrievals and that's certainly what happened here  
mike was driven to a hangar and inside the hangar  there was this very large silver saucer shaped  
object metallic and he said it appeared to  be about 35 feet wide was hanging from cables  
some height in the air there was a small opening  and it was mike's job to take photographs of  
the inside of this object so he they lifted  him up and put him inside and this is when  
mike got a real shock as mike says and i'm quoting  the inside looked to be about 10 times the size  
of the outside i could have thrown a football  as hard as i could and not hit the other side  
so leonard stringfield is also a researcher  specializing in crash retrievals and he was  
able to interview this witness as well and once  again the witness reiterated how struck he was  
by the difference in the size from the inside of  this thing in the outside as the witness uh told  
leonard stringfield he poked his head back outside  to check the size which still appeared to be about  
35 feet in diameter as before in other words he  had to do a double take because this darn thing  
was more than twice as big on the inside more than  10 times is big on the inside than on the outside  
and uh this is something that's sitting here  in a military hangar so this is incredible and  
it doesn't even stop there these uh spatial  anomalies take different types of variations  
another variation we see are tiny little ufos  miniature ufos certainly there are a lot of  
cases of tiny balls of light but sometimes  people see what appear to be miniature  
flying saucers with miniature little ets coming  out of them a very interesting case comes from  
respected researcher john keel this occurred in  august of 1965 during during a nationwide ufo flap  
this particular case occurred  in seattle washington   to a young lady who woke up in her bedroom  she was unable to move when suddenly  
this tiny ufo flew in through the window and i'll  just quote john keel directly as john keel writes  
a football sized dulgray object sailed in through  an open window and landed on tripod legs on her  
floor a tiny ramp descended from the craft and  five or six little people dressed in tight fitting  
clothes climbed down it to work on repairs  their job finished they stepped into the craft  
and flew away only then was the witness who was  certain that she was wide awake able to move
yeah miniature ufo with miniature aliens and it's   not a unique case there was a wave of miniature  ufos in the 1970s in the country of malaysia  
the real case that started it all and caused sort  of a furor in the press occurred on august 21st  
1970. what happened was this student by the name  of kay wigneswaran was missing from this classroom  
a search was conducted and they found this  kid who was 10 years old unconscious in the  
brush outside the school they revived him  and the student had an incredible story  
he said that a tiny ufo about the size of a  football landed a little alien about inches high  
got out it was dressed in a little suit it had  a little weapon apparently because the student  
ran towards the being and tried to capture it and  this little tiny humanoid pulled out what appeared  
to be a little blaster as the kid said some sort  of laser gun and shot at the student striking  
him in the leg and causing him to black out and  that's where they found him and the kid pointed  
to his leg and there was a wound where this uh  being had apparently shot him a little burn mark  
so that seemed to be evidence of his encounter  and further corroboration came in the weeks that   followed when more than six other students and  several separate independent incidents reported  
seeing these tiny ufos with tiny humanoids  next to them and there was a wave of sightings  
across malaysia involving these tiny ufos another  incident occurred two years later in april of 1973  
when several children and one adult actually at  the ipo parrick primary school saw a very small  
ufo land on the playground as they watched these  very small entities got out they were dressed in  
shiny white suits the adult and students ran  towards this craft the little beings immediately  
returned to their tiny little ship and it took off   so i know there are other cases like  this it's very strange perhaps ets have  
the ability to shrink down their craft too and  as further cases show there's these abilities  
extend to not just craft but to people as well  what's really interesting is there is a long  
sort of i mean it's not a new idea this idea  that people can be shrunk down we see this  
in one of the first novels ever published which  was gulliver's travels and involved a gentleman  
who traveled to various mythical lands where  he saw giants as well as tiny little people  
and this idea has always fascinated uh humans and  we see it all over film and literature we see it  
in a lot of films actually like the very popular  film the borrowers which has been remade at least  
twice alice in wonderland as well alice goes down  the rabbit hole and she keeps changing in size  
we see in the movie the incredible shrinking  man or in charlie and the chocolate factory
in which a little kid was shrunk down in  size fantastic voyage with isaac asimov both  
a novel and a movie uh inner space there's so many  movies that feature this uh most recently perhaps  
would be downsizing with matt damon or honey i  shrunk the kids that's another popular one so  
again this is not a new idea but apparently this  is something the ets do have the ability to do  
a great case comes from abductee betty andreason  she's a very well-known figure in the ufo  
community she's from ashburnham massachusetts  and has had ufo encounters her whole life ufo  
researcher raymond fowler has worked closely with  her and written a series of books about her case  
and betty had a really interesting incident  involving ufos displaying in this technology  
where they have the ability to shrink  not only their ships but people too  
uh betty was outside her home with the gray ets  there was another man and a woman there several  
greys there was a fairly large ship about 48 feet  wide but it's actually small compared to a very  
large craft that was hovering overhead and i'll  just let betty describe what happened when this  
very large craft hovering overhead shrinks this  smaller craft as betty says that man over there  
they're telling him to get up or something  because he's getting up and he's following   the beings into the craft that they came out of  they're going inside and that lady's getting up  
they're taking that lady too they're taking her  over to the craft that the man was brought into  
that big big craft or ship and and it's just  hovering now over the smaller one now suddenly the  
lights on the circular part of it went on and lit  the whole bottom up the bottom of the top craft  
they're shrinking that craft that ship is  getting smaller from those lights around the edge  
in the bottom of that big ship the craft was  shrunk down to the size of a car with the man  
and the lady in it and the beings that big one  had shrunk it down to about the size of a car  
and that man and that lady and the other beings  in it left that small craft left so what betty is  
saying is that very large craft that was hovering  over the 48 foot wide small craft shrunk down the  
48 foot wide small craft to about the size of a  car which is what you know six ten feet in length  
with people and grays in it and that really  freaked her out because suddenly there was   another craft that was now parked again below the  larger craft and they were escorting her inside  
as betty says and again i quote we're going to  go inside but that big craft is right above us  
i wonder if they're going to shrink us too we're  getting in line and swooping in and oh it feels  
so strange just cool moving upward and into the  craft we're all inside and the door is closing
betty andreason doesn't describe if  or i'm not sure if she even knows   whether she was actually shrunk down in this  particular case but the et's did at one point  
explain to her that they do have this the  technological ability to shrink or enlarge both  
their craft and people and objects they called it  deopulating or opulating that's the word they used  
and they said this is their ability to  shrink objects or to enlarge them in size  
it's very strange there are some very strange  spatial anomalies of sort of even a more bizarre  
kind in which ufo abductees change size uh one  case that shows this comes from denise and burt  
twiggs they wrote a really interesting book  called secret vows about their encounters  
they were in malala oregon uh when they started  having repeated encounters with ufos and missing  
time at first it was very scary they went under  hypnosis and recalled being physically examined by  
what appeared to be gray type ets but uh as they  continued to have encounters they had less fear  
and they started to be treated differently and  had more interactive and friendly encounters and  
it sort of became this incredible uh contact case  which was actually very benevolent they reported  
several healings they reported being taken aboard  a mothership seeing all kinds of things alien  
animals strange plants being grown engine rooms  sleeping quarters and just had a lot of encounters  
and one strange thing they kept noticing was that  when they were on board the craft they would be  
different heights they know their own height  but sometimes they would be shorter than the  
ets themselves sometimes taller or sometimes  even shorter taller than their own family and  
it took him a long time to figure out what was  going on as denise twiggs writes and i'm quoting  
one reason for the apparent variance in heights  comes from the astonishing fact that the andromes  
can manipulate in size they can shrink themselves  and others as well it took several meetings  
and recollections of other contactees for this  twist in their technology to get through to us  
they call the ets the andromes the androme  say they come from the andromeda galaxy and  
do have this apparent ability to change people  in size and they actually put on a demonstration  
for denise twiggs using her friend elizabeth as  denise twig twiggs writes and again i'm quoting  
it was a meeting in which they had elizabeth  participate that finally proved their point  
i knew from a conscious point of view how  my height compared to elizabeth's elizabeth  
and i began our meeting in a shrunken  condition but she was returned to her  
original height in front of me that showed me  what was happening elizabeth also retained a  
part of that particular memory shrinkable people  what next in this incredible incredible universe
so yeah this is what denise and bert twiggs  say that the et's have the ability to shrink  
people this is what betty andreasen says  this is what carl higdon thought he had  
happened to him so maybe it did  another case comes from researcher  
jenny randalls this is a really interesting case  this occurred in 1976 to the sunderland family  
of flint north wales the main witness is really  gainer sunderland the daughter she was about 12  
years old and her little brother darren in 1976  they had this incredible encounter outside their  
home where their silver saucer landed in the  field and uh both gaynor and darren saw this  
darren was actually a little closer and he  reported something very strange he saw these uh  
the saucer land and he looked inside  through portholes and inside he could   see that everything looked really small he saw  these beings that appeared to be about three  
feet tall but this door opened up and there was  this ramp and as these beings came down the ramp  
they increased in size they actually grew so  there was this weird spatial anomaly where
the space on the inside of this craft was  different from the space on the outside  
and gainer saw this as well she was from  a different vantage point she saw the ufo  
she saw the beings and following this incident  uh the whole family started having encounters  
there was a number of sightings gainer had  missing time she recalled being taken on board  
a craft with her brother darren it was a long  drawn-out encounter they were physically examined  
they were taken to what appeared to be  like an alien zoo where they saw different  
strange animals uh they were given warnings  and messages about possible future disasters  
just as many abductees have been given so a  very complicated case which is supported by  
multiple family members uh interesting here  is a very strange incident that happened  
at one point gainer sunderland watched her brother  getting taken on board and before he was taken on  
board her brother darren was struck by a beam of  light which shrank him down to a diminutive size  
to just a time a few inches so very strange and  i'm not sure why they're doing this i do know one  
lady who has regular contact and before i did this  video i called her up and asked her about this  
and just gave her an open-ended question have you  heard of et's ability to change the size of people  
and she says oh yeah you know if she did have  an experience involving this and she was taken  
into a craft and she saw a gray type  e.t and another man a human being  
being shrunk down in size to just a tiny little  size and she became very concerned and alarmed  
because she thought they might be being injured  and the gray she was with told her not to worry   everything was okay that the man was being shrunk  down and that he was fine but that he needed to  
um do this because there was something he needed  to experience and something he needed to see  
so apparently they do have this ability to really  shrink down people in size and not only that to  
actually grow them in size because of course it  does go the other way as the twigs family said  
sometimes they're they would be taller than their  would normally be but there are other cases that  
are even more dramatic than that you may have  heard of the television science fiction or the  
feature film the attack of the 50-foot  woman was remade in with daryl hannah  
what's interesting about that film is that effect  of being enlarged was actually caused by a ufo  
and that's what happened in an actual case it's a  very interesting and well-known case it attracted  
quite a bit of attention from ufo researchers such  as jim and coral lorenzen as well as from project  
blue book officers as well a very interesting case  it occurred on april 29 1964 the main witness is  
sharon stahl she's a 12 year old school girl  who is actually at school at the time at lowell  
elementary school in new mexico and albuquerque  new mexico she saw this egg shaped object  
it wasn't very large appeared to be metallic it  was hovering above the playground and this weird   sort of yo-yo pattern her sister saw it as well  sharon washed it for about 20 minutes and then  
returned to her class and began to feel unwell  because her face was burning she went to the nurse  
and had to be rushed to the hospital where she was  diagnosed with second to degree burns to her face  
and neck and chest it affected her vision  and caused her you know some pain for sure  
and she had some very alarming symptoms in the  weeks that followed afterwards she actually grew  
more than five and a half inches and gained 25  pounds and that was just the beginning as her  
mother says a while ago she was just a child  who liked to play with dolls and paper cutouts  
now she is suddenly mature and grown up cooks  meals by herself cleans house and takes care  
of the younger children so she was not only  physically grown but she was mentally uh grown  
so i'm not sure what's happening here but it's  a very interesting case to say the least and uh  
the effects continued before the encounter sharon  was four feet in eight inches tall and weighed 85  
pounds and late by the uh one month later she was  five feet eight inches tall and weighed 110 pounds  
and according to her mother was still growing  as miss stahl says my daughter has outgrown  
all her clothes and quickly outgrows new  garments and shoes i'm so confused i don't  
know what to believe i know my daughter saw  something in the sky that day but i don't   know what it has been a nightmare ever since  i wish i had just let her play hooky that day
so yeah it appears that the et's do  have the ability to enlarge people   and another case that might speak towards that is  that of john hunter gray also known as john salter  
or john hunter bear john hunter gray is a very  well-known social activist fighting against  
racism and also very well known in the ufo field  particularly for an encounter he had on march 20  
1988 with his son they were driving through  richland center wisconsin when they came upon  
a ufo they had missing time and in the weeks  that followed they recalled what happened  
and what they recalled was just your typical  onboard ufo experience they were physically  
examined john hunter gray remembers being given  several injections in various parts of his body  
like near his glands and stuff and following this  encounter he started to have some very interesting  
health improvements about 20 of them he counted  including as this is just a partial list  
uh his cuts started healing faster his bruises  his wrinkles started disappearing old scars  
disappeared he started getting five o'clock  shadow he quit smoking he gained weight uh  
he had a hair growing faster stopped getting  sick all kinds of really wonderful physiological  
improvements sort of a health upgrade and what's  really strange is he grew like three inches in  
height and it's not clear whether this happened in  the weeks that followed or perhaps instantaneously  
but it definitely happened because it wasn't only  his height that increased but his shoe size also  
increased and more than what just one size  so this was a dramatic physiological change  
and perhaps he wasn't actually you know  growing but had been uh enlarged so to speak uh  
hard to say and the reason i say that is  because another gentleman contacted me  
because i had you know written about this  previously in my book not from here volume  
two i was studying cases of this kind people  who've you know been shrunk down or enlarged  
and uh yeah i wrote about it in that book and he  read that chapter and contacted me because he had  
had this experience and he said after he would  be returned from an encounter he would sometimes  
be shorter than his normal height and sometimes  be taller it was always just a couple of inches  
but he's definitely noticed it and it  was a very very interesting side effect  
which was directly related to having this ufo  encounter and a guest being taken on board a craft  
so again i'm not sure what's happening here that's  kind of why i want to explore it in this video  
but what it does show is ets have definitely  got a very advanced technology they've mastered  
the ability to control not only time  apparently but space itself and are able to  
have these ufos that are larger on the inside  than on the outside they're able to shrink down  
their craft to tiny little things and actually  shrink down people as well so it's just an amazing  
display of their technological ability i think  it has something to do with their understanding  
of the electromagnetic spectrum and their use of  light because that's what we're seeing in a number  
of these cases people are shrunk or enlarged  using light beams we do know their beams of light  
have the ability to not only paralyze a person or  perhaps cause them to forget but also to uh injure  
or heal them there are many cases people being  burned people being healed uh paralyzed as i said  
uh also has the ability to render solid  objects invisible or permeable such as the  
wall of a person's house they pull a person  right up through the wall in a beam of light  
all kinds of abilities these beams of light have  to communicate to levitate people as well so these  
are incredible beams of light that apparently  have the ability also to shrink and enlarge  
and uh that's what i wanted to talk about  today there this incredible ability of the et's  
so thanks once again for listening i hope  you found it interesting and keep having fun
