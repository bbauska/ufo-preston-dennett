Can humans fly?

As strange as it sounds, the answer is, yes! Humans do have the ability to levitate and fly through the air without the aid of any device. In fact, there are hundreds of accounts of human levitation on record. Cases reach back thousands of years and come from all across the world.

This video presents the top twenty best verified cases of human levitation. In part one, we cover cases twenty through eleven, each involving a person who has undergone the profound experience of human levitation. While many cases rely solely on the word of the person who experienced it, these accounts are different. These cases not only involve outside witnesses, some of them involve photographic evidence, or were proven in a scientific laboratory setting. These cases prove that humans have super-human abilities that we have only just begun to discover.

What is it like to levitate? How is it done? Can anybody do it? This video (and part two) will answer all these questions and more. Levitation is real! Humans can fly! This is not a matter of speculation or belief. The evidence speaks for itself. The proof is here. And now is the time to rise up, discover who we really are and what we can do. 

And if you think these cases are exciting, just wait for Part Two. The adventure has only just begun!

Intro
hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and welcome to another episode of ufos and  
the paranormal i have a very special episode  for you today which i call the top 20 cases of  
human levitation yes humans have the ability to  fly i know how that must sound to someone who's  
skeptical of this sort of thing but the truth  is human levitation is very well documented  
it's occurred all across our planet for more  than a thousand years there are many cases  
of nuns and monks levitating saints and  sorcerers medicine men holy people witches  
normal people yogis many many different accounts  of human levitation all across our planet now i'd  
like to do is present what i think are the  top 20 cases of people who have levitated  
i'm going to start with number 20 and go down  to the number one best case of human levitation  
so starting with number 20 i chose angelo  faticoni throughout the 1920s angelo faticoni of  
TWENTY ANGELO FATICONI
jacksonville florida publicly displayed his talent  as the human cork without the use of any devices  
angelo also known as the man they could not drown  was able to stay afloat in water indefinitely  
he could assume virtually any position lying  on his side his back or curled up in a ball  
he was even able to sleep on the water he was able  to swim great distances with metal weights tied to  
his body during one experiment he was observed  to float in the water for a period of 15 hours  
with a 20-pound lead weight tied to his  ankles on another occasion a 20-pound  
cannonball was lashed to his legs he was then  sewn into a sack and thrown into the water  
angelo remained motionless floating on the surface  of the water for a period of eight hours angelo's  
fame grew quickly and he attracted more and more  people who wanted to study his case his abilities  
intrigued doctors at harvard university who  agreed to examine him they theorized that a  
peculiarity in his physiology would account for  his unnatural buoyancy however a thorough medical  
examination by doctors and students failed to  reveal any physical abnormality a photograph of  
one of the experiments shows angelo floating  in the water while tied to a weighted chair  
his arms lay on his chest his head rests just  above the water with a calm expression on his face  
according to angelo he acquired his ability as  the result of a traumatic childhood incident he  
often promised to reveal exactly how he became  the human cork but eventually unfortunately  
this was not to be on august 13 1931 the new  york herald tribune announced the death of angela  
faticoni with the headline human cork is dead  is secret unrevealed so that's case number 20.  
it's not levitation in the sense of flying but  i think certainly is some sort of levitation  
and is very similar to the several  accounts of people walking on water  
the next case i'd like to talk about  is case number 19 the case of ted owens  
born in 1924 in bedford indiana ted owens grew  up in a family where psychic events were accepted  
NINETEEN TED OWENS
and even encouraged as a kid he was very  interested in the paranormal and often  
gave psychic readings to his friends he first  worked as a store clerk interested in learning  
more about psychic powers however he next worked  with j b rein a pioneer in psychic investigations  
it was here that ted first began to  display powerful psychic abilities  
after working with jb ryan and showing these  abilities he quit and joined the us navy and  
after that he worked as a psychic and became very  well known he soon had a group of followers who  
helped support him and he went on to experience  numerous other kinds of paranormal events  
he claimed to be able to control weather events  cause power outages manipulate sporting events  
and even call down ufos he would conduct spiritual  healings predict earthquakes and many more unusual  
events what's amazing about ted owens is he has a  surprisingly strong track record of being accurate  
as the number of his hits mounted investigators  were forced to take notice and study his case  
one researcher who was impressed with ted owens  is researcher colin wilson who wrote i think  
there seems to be no reasonable doubt that he had  astonishing capacity for causing changes in the  
weather another researcher who looked into ted's  case was author robert mishlov phd who documented  
many of these paranormal events and hundreds  of other incidents in the life of ted owens  
in his outstanding book the pk man ted owens  also ended up writing his own book about his  
experiences in which he claimed that his powers  came to him as the result of an extraterrestrial  
encounter during which he was given surgery  and endowed with these psychic abilities  
one paranormal event he experienced at least  three times in his life includes levitation  
and the first occurred at a very young age as  ted owens says i was only four years old and  
was playing out in the yard i was standing  outside of the house when suddenly i began   to float up the side of the house way up to the  top of the house then i floated back down again  
of course back then i had no idea of time so  i don't know how long it took but i definitely  
floated up in the air when i got back down  again i knocked on the door and told queenie  
his grandmother about it and she  laughed and thought i was making it up  
ted's second levitation occurred when he was  a young teenager and unlike the first episode  
this one involved an outside witness as ted says  i was about 13 years old i was at the country club  
that was just outside of bedford where there  was a swimming pool it was in broad daylight  
i climbed up on the 10 foot diving board and i did  a swan dive up into the air spreading my arms out  
but then i didn't come down i was so astounded and  amazed i couldn't believe it but i kept my arms  
out outstretched and it was the most wonderful  exhilarating feeling i've ever had in my life  
i stayed up there for what seemed like a long  time then finally i went down into the water  
i might have thought it was my imagination  because i couldn't figure it out   i knew that what goes up comes down  but when i climbed out of the pool  
barb bob armstrong came up a redheaded  kid with freckles and he said to me  
i knew you could do tricks but how do  you stay up in the air all that time  
ted had no explanation he didn't know how this  occurred it was purely spontaneous and it happened  
again in 1943 at age 23 ted experienced his third  and final episode of levitation at this time he  
was in the u.s navy aboard a ship in the pacific  on this occasion there were scores of witnesses as  
ted says one day i was outside in the ship's deck  i climbed up on a hatch there must have been 50 to  
60 men up there lying around looking at the ocean  i gave a little jump to go down two or three feet  
off the hatch and instead of coming down i went  into the air and just sort of floated all of the  
sailors were pointing and saying look look at that  i was just floating finally came down near the  
rail some distance away it was really weird i'll  never forget it it was definitely a levitation  
but i don't know what caused it the sailor's  eyes were all bulging out i lost all sense of  
time just as i had done what happened in bedford  regarding these levitation events mishlov writes  
admittedly these accounts of spontaneous  levitation stretch owens's credibility  
this is probably because such a phenomenon  is extremely rare but it is not unknown in  
the annals of psychic science if the great saints  could levitate there is no logical reason to doubt  
that some of us living secular lives could  similarly be endowed with the same ability  
ted owens died on december 28 1987 leaving  behind an enduring legacy of mystery  
so that's case number 19 and that one involves a  seemingly normal gentleman who although was gifted  
with psychic abilities and there are many many  other cases a truly astonishing case is number  
18 involving a yogi by the name of luang pu ween  uh this event occurred in 1971 near the may pang  
EIGHTEEN LUANG PU WAEN
mountain in thailand luang pu wein was born in  1887 and began his religious studies at age 12  
soon became an ordained monk specializing in  the sayawet or magical knowledge and practices  
originally formulated by indian brahmins  wayne soon gained a reputation in the area  
for being able to chase away wild animals  that were terrorizing local villages  
but it's his levitations which really caused a lot  of attention in 1971 a royal thai air force pilot  
received the shock of his life during a practice  flight he clearly saw the form of a monk sitting  
in serene meditation on a cloud the pilot  was forced to swerve to avoid a collision  
and later he identified the monk as luang  poo ween according to wayne's biographer  
stanley javarja tambiya several  other pilots had the same experience  
and also traveled to wien's monastery to  identify him as the one they saw levitating  
several thousand feet in the air which might be  the single highest recorded levitation in history  
although he didn't like feign this incident did  make him the the most popular monk of thailand  
in that decade he attracted the royal patronage  and king bu mipol of thailand became a close  
devotee of this monk in the latter period  of his life the abbot of his resident  
monastery had to limit and control the number  of people who came to visit luang po wayne  
he was very popular and crowds just came to visit  and talk to him one day a doctor got the rare  
chance to ask the monk about this incident  involving the air force pilot and luang poo  
wayne's response was do you think i'm a bird so he  didn't really want to talk about it luang pu ween  
lived to the age of 98 years and died in 1985.  it's an incredible case but certainly not unique  
case number 17 i chose the experiments  of sven turk sven turk conducted some  
SEVENTEEN THE EXPERIMENTS OF SVEN TURCK
remarkable levitation experiments in  the mid-1940s in copenhagen denmark  
sven turk was a cyclical researcher and a  professional photographer and he headed a project  
which had the specific goal of photographing  levitation as sven turk writes i subjected most  
of our mediums here in copenhagen to critical  investigation and afterwards organized a little  
group of 10 members of the highest capacities  we got together twice weekly at my laboratory  
investor bro our intent was to make a completely  technical attempt to bring about telekinesis and  
levitation two groups of phenomena  which are well suited to photographing  
the first few sessions produced few results  however as the meetings progressed the phenomenon  
began to grow in strength and after several months  of regular meetings with these mediums the group  
had successfully levitated several heavy pieces  of furniture and they were able to record these  
events on a trio of cameras that they had placed  at strategic locations to capture any activity  
after one year of experimenting the group  finally succeeded in levitating a human being  
during one of these sessions one of the members  of the group a mr borg nicholson suddenly found  
himself rising up to the ceiling as sven turk  writes he circled around up there above the table  
and fell to the knees of madame maloney softly  without the least bump the damn maloney scarcely  
felt the force of his fall the three cameras  had flashed and presented us with proof that  
we had not been the victims of a hallucination  i succeeded in photographing five such air rides  
well-known psychic medium olaf johnson was a  member of seven turks group and as olaf writes  
big heavy tables lifted themselves to  the ceiling in spite of several persons   on board as passengers one medium who sat  in our group was named mikkelsen and he was  
able to bring about a veritable flights to the  ceiling sven turk's experiments and especially  
his photographs sent shockwaves through  denmark's scientific community as psychic  
researcher brad steiger writes who interviewed  and wrote the autobiography of olaf johnson  
the series of photographs taken during turks  experiments in copenhagen were carefully examined  
by five of denmark's foremost photographic  technicians among them the director of the danish  
photographic professional school theodore andresen  who had full access to the photographic negatives  
each of the photographers agreed that no  manipulations whatsoever had been worked  
upon with the negatives so yeah that's case  number 17 and it involves numerous levitations  
some of which were actually photographed very good  evidence the next case i want to talk about is  
case number 16 and that involves saint  catherine of siena a very well-known saint  
SIXTEEN SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENA
saint catherine of siena was born in 1347 and was  an extremely influential spiritual leader she gave  
counsel to popes princes priests soldiers and the  common man she was credited with helping to heal  
the great schism which had divided the western  church for 40 years and when the black death  
swept across europe she became famous for caring  for the sick and dying and often treated those who  
nobody else would help or touch including victims  of leprosy saint catherine was the 23rd child in  
her family and devoted her life to spirituality  from age six when she had a vision of the lord  
by age 12 she built a hermitage in her backyard  and around that time started to fall into  
ecstatic trances and would feel herself  levitated until her head hit the ceiling  
her parents tried everything they could do  to dissuade her from her religious obsessions   but it was no use they finally gave up and gave  catherine her own small room in which she spent  
most of her time praying intensely she also fasted  and slept on hard wooden boards this is a process  
known as asceticism as an adult saint catherine  continued to have regular mystical experiences  
usually following communion or her  practice of depriving herself of food  
sleep and comfort her numerous levitations  were often witnessed by her fellow nuns  
who verified the miracles by placing their hands  between the floor and the floating catherine  
her biographer jorgensen gives a vivid  description of one of catherine's levitations  
as he writes beginning to pray she found  herself in a new and strange state where  
everything disappeared around her and she had the  feeling of hovering in a world of bright light  
she had the impression of being lifted up  little by little from the ground higher and   higher finally her head hit the ceiling which  woke her on august 18 1370 following communion  
catherine remained levitated above her bed  which was witnessed by three people one of the  
witnesses to this reports that her levitations  sometimes exceeded several meters olivier  
leroy who wrote one of the first books on human  levitation considered saint catherine's case to  
be particularly reputable another researcher  herbert thurston wrote that the evidence for  
saint catherine of siena's levitations seems  quite overwhelming during her ecstasies catherine  
occasionally gave long spiritual discourses much  in the manner of today's trans channelers many of  
these discourses were later published as the  dialogues of saint catherine and are today  
considered spiritual classics interesting here are  the comments catherine made regarding levitation  
like many channelers catherine  spoke as if she were channeling god  
as saint catherine says in her own words the  perfect soul lives in constant union with god  
many times the body is raised from the ground  because of this perfect union that the soul has   made with me as if the body had lost its weight  in order to become light actually it lost none  
of its weight but as the union of the soul with  me is more perfect than the union between the  
body and the soul the force of the spirit fixed in  me raises the weight of the body from the ground  
catherine of siena died at age 33  and was canonized as a saint in 1461  
and her case remains one of the best verified  cases of human levitation and now we move to case  
15. for case 15 i chose a young gentleman by the  name of indridi indridison who became iceland's  
FIFTEEN INDRIDI INDRIDASON
most famous medium indridi was born in 1883 by  1905 at age 12 indridi created a furor in his home  
when a poltergeist repeatedly pulled him out  of bed and threw objects around in his presence  
this activity began shortly after he attended a  seance during which she displayed unusually strong  
physical mediumistic abilities soon this  haunting activity escalated to the point where  
indridi himself began to levitate one memorable  incident occurred when he was dressing himself in  
his bedroom finding himself flying uncontrollably  through the air he screamed for help his guardian  
a gentleman by the name of mr thorlickson came  running and saw indridi in full levitation  
as mr thorlickson writes indridi is lying in the  air in a horizontal position at about the height  
of my chest and swaying there to and fro with his  feet pointing towards the window and it seems to  
me that the invisible power that is holding him  in the air is trying to swing him out the window  
i don't hesitate a moment but grab the medium  and push him down onto the bed and hold him there  
but then i notice that both of us are being  lifted up mr thorlaxon screamed for help and  
another member of the household came running in  and the two men together were just barely able to  
hold this young boy and pull him back onto the bed  so at this point indridi realized that something  
very very strange and profound was happening  to him and he agreed to sit at further seances  
his abilities quickly grew in strength and  he became iceland's single most influential  
psychic medium producing the entire  range of physical mediumship phenomena  
including powerful levitations and in fact during  his early levitations he rose so quickly that his  
head often struck the ceiling sometimes during  senses injury himself would not only levitate  
but so would the chair or the couch on which  he sat sometimes several feet into the air  
injury was usually only able to levitate in  darkness or near darkness so scientists had to use  
elaborate and clever controls to verify his  levitations as one researcher wrote professor  
nielsen he was a prominent preacher who studied  the case writes nielsen in order to substantiate  
these phenomena we placed him in a basket chair  which creaked conveniently upon the least movement  
we placed this at one end of the  room and tight rows of chairs   all across the room so that any passage  between the chairs was impossible then  
the sitters and it must be remembered that we  were sometimes more than 50 or more in number  
all sat down in the chairs the light being  put out very soon the medium was levitated  
in the basket chair at a great distance from  the floor creaking in the chair being heard  
while it glided above our heads and was rather  noisily deposited on the floor behind the chairs  
the light was immediately lit and there set the  medium unconscious in a deep trance in the chair  
indridi also displayed a number of other abilities  including something known as supernatural agility  
he was able to perform complex  gymnastic feats while in a trance  
a professional gymnastic instructor from iceland  a gentleman by the name of olafur rosenkrans  
verified these feats and reported that they were  well beyond his own considerable ability abilities  
indridi was able to perform these supernatural  agility feats in bright light so this caused  
a lot of attention to be put towards him and  numerous scientists and high level officials  
examined indridi including a future supreme  court judge uh and hal grimer svensson the bishop  
of iceland one prominent scientist was dr gumundir  hansen a physician and the founder of icelandic's  
scientific society and president of the university  of iceland gudmundir was present during several of  
hinduity's levitations during which the medium  was drawn up into the air with his feet turned  
towards the ceiling and his head downwards at that  time the medium's hands were held by another man  
who reported that indridi was levitated with  such force that he was barely able to hold on  
to his hands this happened on many occasions and  as the witness said i myself while continuing to  
hold the medium was thrown with him into the  air so that we crashed to the floor violently  
in his notes on the various seances with indridi  gundamendir hansen remarked upon several other  
levitations of the of indridi of one instance he  wrote the medium's chair levitated a few times  
but not with so much force that it could not be  held down with one hand damage or a scratch from  
the medium's chair in the corner indicates that  the chair is levitated at least 35 centimeters
on january 18 1909 uh one of the researchers a  man by the name of mr nielsen was present when  
indridi experienced a levitation  during a sense in a darkened room   and as mr nielsen writes this time i and  two others remained alone by the medium  
in a kind of semi trance he said where are you  taking me a little later we three heard his  
voice coming from close to the ceiling next all  three of us clearly heard the medium being drawn  
along the ceiling of the room and made to  knock his fingers on it after a while he  
was taken down and we asked for the light he  was lying on the table still being in a trance  
during another seance mr thorlickson asked if  the spirits were able to levitate him personally  
and as mr thorlaxon writes immediately  just as i finished the last word i felt  
as if something covered me completely but did  not grasp me in any particular part of my body  
at the same moment i crashed down on the floor on  my hands and feet this happened at such lightning  
speed that i had no time to realize the route i  had no awareness until i fell down on the floor
later dr loftur gusherson and dr erilander  haraldson of reckjevic later studied in judy's  
case in minute detail and actually wrote a book  about it concerning his levitations they write  
levitation of a human body has sometimes been  observed at sciences of various celebrated mediums  
but such reports have often been hotly debated  indridi's levitations must be considered an  
important addition to these reports indridi  died in 1912 at the very young age of 29.  
it's an incredible case and only one of again many  many reports many of the cases of well-verified  
levitations involve psychic mediums and often  these do occur in low light levels or in darkness  
but scientists are able to use very ingenious  methods to verify them another such case is case  
FOURTEEN WILLY SCHNEIDER
number 14 involving a young austrian median  by the name of willie schneider this case  
comes from cyclical researcher baron albert von  schrenknotzing who lived from 1862 to 1929 and  
baron albert shrink nazing was a german aristocat  aristocrat and a prominent physician and he used  
his considerable wealth and influence to undertake  a series of well-controlled scientific experiments  
with the leading physical mediums of his era  including willie schneider and his younger  
brother rudy shrink natsing's rigidly controlled  experiments with willie schneider in particular  
created a shock wave among local scientists  and prominent among these were professor holub  
professor burst and dr gele and  the well-known writer hans mueller  
all of who conceded that shrink experiments  with willy schneider have proven that levitation  
is a true fact shrank nazing's approach to the  subject was only part of what made his experiments  
so popular the other reason was because his  experiments actually worked time after time  
under very controlled laboratory conditions shrank  nazing and his associates were able to provoke  
levitations in willy schneider as one of  the witnesses to these experiments writes  
schneider rose horizontally and seemed to  rest on an invisible cloud he ascended to the  
ceiling and remained five minutes suspended  there moving his legs about rhythmically  
the descent was as sudden as the uplifting the  supervision had been perfect dr gillay in his  
last journey to vienna also witnessed  the levitation of willie at dr holavs  
and he told me he felt absolutely sure  of the genuineness of the phenomena
because these levitations only took place in  red light or near total darkness shrink nutsing  
ingeniously stitched schneider's clothes with  phosphorescent pins thereby allowing the witnesses  
to carefully observe schneider's movements and  by 1927 baron shrink nazing had recorded no less  
than 27 separate levitations of willy schneider in  front of numerous reputable witnesses as leading  
paranormal researcher nander fodor writes the  conditions of these experiments were very strict  
and the records unimpeachable in the electrical  system of control made the phenomenon fraud proof  
the best evidence of this is the statement  of a hundred profoundly skeptical and  
often hostile scientists who witnessed the  phenomenon in 1922 and declared themselves  
completely convinced now here baron shrink natsing  describes the process involved in the levitations  
as shrink nutsing says willie gradually entered  into an autohypnosis state accompanied by a very  
rapid contraction of his body as if the subject  was suddenly frightened often the passage to this  
state of somnabilism was so rapid that willie  didn't have time to finish the sentence he began  
sometimes when the medium wakes up he continues  the sentence and the conversation he began when  
he was awake one has the impression  that a strange and irresistible force  
takes control of the young man the bodily state  changes all of a sudden the muscles which before  
were in a state of normal tension become  hypertonic and rigid producing clonic jerks  
in the arms and and the spasms amplitude increases  regularly before the appearance of the phenomenon  
his entire body was agitated run through  with cramps and often the medium jumped  
from his chair and groaned like a  man who wanted to lift a heavy weight  
schneider's levitations usually began vertically  once a height of about five feet was reached  
his body would suddenly swing to a horizontal  position and move back and forth about 10 feet  
and the duration of the levitations was  generally about 30 seconds interestingly  
willie schneider lost his ability to  levitate after going through puberty  
his younger brother rudy also showed similar  abilities though in a less spectacular fashion and  
another curious detail was that the levitations  were most successful when the group of sitters in  
the seance numbered about 10 people and were  evenly divided between men and women baron  
shrink-natsung continued to continue his  influential experiments until his death the age  
of 67 and afterwards both brothers continued to  work as mediums into adulthood at this time there  
were some allegations of fraud but nobody has been  able to debunk the original experiments by shrink  
natsing involving the levitation of willie  schneider in particular so it's an excellent case  
and i think is a wonderful example of how this  phenomena has been proven in a laboratory setting  
proven enough to make many skeptical  scientists declare that levitation is a reality
a truly astonishing case is what the case  i chose for number 13 and this is the case  
involving saint padre pio padre pio was born in  1887 in benevento italy he joined the franciscans  
THIRTEEN SAINT PADRE PIO
at age 17 and at age 21 he began to experience  terrible pains in his hands and feet which  
doctors were unable to diagnose three years  later padre pio collapsed from the pain  
and his fellow priests found him unconscious  bleeding from the hands and feet pio had  
become what we now know as a stigmatic someone who  displays the wounds of jesus christ on the cross  
bleeding from the hands and feet following this  padre pio began to perform a number of very well  
verified miraculous healings including healing  a girl of blindness another man of blindness  
several people of cancer a man of paralysis to  name just a few of the many healings he performed  
and that's not all there is a astonishingly  astonishingly wide variety of miracles attributed  
to padre pia he provided all kinds of prophecies  and for example he predicted in 1947 that pope  
john paul would be the second would become the  next pope padre pio often had visions of angels  
and says that he was also often attacked by  demonic spirits who would assault him and leave  
all kinds of bruises and all over his body  padre pio always remained uh in his uh  
location in italy but what was really interesting  is he was often seen all over the world in various  
cities and he people started to realize that  padre pio had the ability of by location he  
could be in more than one place at once which he  would do to administer to the poor and the needy  
he reportedly was able to give accurate  details about people's lives people he  
had never met and would often counsel them and  tell them all about their lives and give them  
very powerful spiritual advice on  one occasion he was able to rid   an orchard of terrible pests and  actually cause this orchard to bloom  
he also reportedly emitted a flowery scent  this is what uh we know is the odor of sanctity  
which is reported in many saints but also reported  with uh saint padre pio so the list of paranormal  
events surrounding this man number in the many  hundreds and are very well verified and some of  
these accounts involved levitation uh one witness  to a levitation was padre ascanio who writes  
we were waiting for padre pio who was coming  to hear confession of his penitence the church  
was crowded and everybody watched the  door through which padre pio would enter  
the door stays closed but suddenly i saw father  pio walking above the heads of the people  
he reached the confessional and then disappeared  after some minutes he started to receive the  
penitence padre escanio later approached pl and  asked him how he was able to walk in the air  
padre pio responded i can assure you my  child it's just like walking on the floor  
padre pio also had the ability of multiplication  of food he once walked into his chambers and came  
out with a handful of loaves of bread which by all  accounts had not been in there before he walked in  
and used these to feed the poor another amazing  levitation event occurred during world war ii the  
american commanding officer for the united states  was leading a squadron of bombardiers to destroy  
german war materials and this was at the san  giovanni rotunda situated near the monastery  
where padre pio resided two of the american  pilots were at the point of triggering the  
mission when they saw padre pio floating before  them in the air admonishing them to turn around  
these bombs which should have destroyed  the rotundo released themselves without  
any serious effects they fell into the woods  and apparently did not go off and the airplanes  
turned around or the pilots turned around and  reversed their direction from this area uh court  
reportedly the pilots had no manual control over  the aircraft so word of this event spread quickly  
and uh it was reported that uh padre pio had  saved the sen giovanni monastery from destruction  
so one of these pilots a general went to the  monastery to see if he could find this monk  
that he had seen floating next to his plane and  he went to the monastery and was looking at the  
various monks and found padre pio and recognized  him instantly at that point padre pio walked  
toward him and as he approached him uh padre pio  said are you the one who wanted to kill all of us  
and relieved by the look of padre pio in the words  of the father the general knelt humbly in front  
of him and as padre pio usually did he spoke in  his own language but the general was convinced  
padre pio had spoken in english this was  apparently another one of padre pio's  
amazing abilities he could make himself understood  to anyone regardless of the language they spoke  
the general was so impressed by meeting  with padre pio that he changed his  
religion from protestant to catholic this is  an incredible modern case of human levitation  
padre pio died in 1968 and was  canonized in 2002 as a saint
another truly astonishing and well verified case  is the case i chose for number 12 involving a  
young girl by the name of janet hodgson she  also went under the pseudonym of janet harper  
TWELVE JANET HODGSON
initially this case is particularly compelling  because the phenomena surrounding her was observed  
by so many people it occurred in modern times many  people actually saw her levitation and provided  
first-hand testimonials and she herself  also talked about what it was like  
to levitate and finally and most amazingly some  of her levitations were actually photographed  
this case is known as the enfield haunting and it  began in 1977 when the hodgson family suddenly and  
without warn any warning uh realize that their  house was severely haunted violent poltergeist  
activity seemed to center around one of their  three children janet hodgson who was just entering  
puberty the haunting started out innocuously with  small objects moving doors opening and closing  
and little things like this however it soon  escalated to furniture being tumbled around  
and objects thrown at people's faces  this activity was very brazen uh  
very public and the activity was photographed  and new photographed and witnessed by numerous  
credible observers including scientists and  police officers and psychic investigators  
one year later in 1978 janet began to fall  into trances she was rushed to the hospital  
but doctors were unable to diagnose these trans  states and that's when she started to levitate  
the levitations began when janet and her sister  rose started to get thrown out of bed by an unseen  
force and this soon escalated into levitations  which often occurred when janet was asleep  
while asleep janet would repeatedly float  out of bed across the room and be deposited  
on a dresser where she would wake up with no  knowledge of how she got there by this time  
investigators were on the scene nearly constantly  and were documenting the activity as it occurred  
janet kept getting pulled out of bed on one  occasion she was floated asleep into the corner  
of the room a distance of more than 14 feet on  another occasion janet was actually awake during  
a levitation she walked next door knocked on  the neighbor's door which opened by itself  
and as janet says in her own words peggy's front  door opened on its own i looked behind and there  
was no one there and it just shut i looked in the  front room and no one's in there when i came in  
someone lifted me upstairs i got lifted halfway up  the stairs and i came rolling down i nearly found  
dead when that happened it frightened the life  out of me a few days later it happened again janet  
woke up out of a sound sleep and was levitated or  dragged down the staircase as janet says i was in  
bed asleep when all of a sudden i felt something  palm me by the arms out of bed and i tripped over  
and i went there and it lifted me up and the door  opened and i went flying downstairs janet's mother  
observed this incident and as she says i saw the  door open it seemed as if she was being pulled  
along the floor investigator maurice gross  was also there and caught the tail end of the  
incident and saw janet lying head downwards on the  staircase slowly sliding down it still half asleep  
by this point the activity was escalating to a  fever pitch and the investigators were actually  
able to engage the poltergeist in communication  first through automatic writing and then by using  
direct channeling through janet and many of  these uh voice recordings these conversations  
were recorded on audiotape and during one such  uh incident investigators asked the poltergeist  
will you do some tricks for us leave  the room the spirit said through janet  
so the investigators left the room and janet  suddenly called out i am being levitated there was  
a loud crash as the investigators found that the  mattress had been flung across the room blocking  
the doorway although the investigators didn't  actually witness this levitation they could see   that janet herself was convinced she had a total  a look of total astonishment just kept repeating  
i've been floating in the air i've just been  floating investigators were intrigued and  
they were determined to get proof and a few days  later janet reported that she had been levitated  
and pulled through a solid wall into the adjoining  bedroom as she says i was sitting on the bed and i  
sort of sprang into the air and started whizzing  around the room then i went through the wall oh  
that may sound amazing but it's not the only  case of someone moving through a solid wall  
so it wasn't long before other people began to  witness janet's levitations and one such witness  
was hazel short a neighbor who looked inside  janet's bedroom from the sidewalk outside the  
house and saw her floating as hazel short says in  her own words i was standing there looking at the  
house when all of a sudden a couple of books came  flying across and hit the window it was so sudden  
i heard the noise because it was so quiet and  then after a while i saw janet she was going  
up and down as though someone was just tossing  her up and down bodily in a horizontal position  
as if someone had got a hold of her legs  and back and was throwing her up and down   i definitely saw her come up to window height  but i thought if she was bouncing she'd bounce  
from her feet she wouldn't be able to get enough  power to bounce off her back to come up that high  
my friend could see her as well and we both could  see her it was as though her arms and legs were   going everywhere i mean if you were doing it to  yourself you definitely keep your arms and legs  
to your body if you know what i mean but she was  definitely lying horizontal coming up and down
another witness was so upset he insisted upon  being anonymous but he did give a first-hand  
testimony of what he saw as he says i saw  this child whom i now known to be janet  
well inside the room and in the first  instance i saw her head bobbing up and down  
just as if she were bouncing up and down on her  bed but then articles came swiftly across the  
room towards the window they were definitely not  thrown at the window as the articles were going  
round and round in a circle hitting the window and  then bouncing off to continue at the same height  
in a clockwise direction these articles appeared  to be books dolls and linens there were five or  
six articles and by their movement they acted as  though they were attached to a piece of elastic  
they appeared to be traveling with considerable  force and were going around at the same time  
the child then appeared on two occasions  floating horizontally across the room  
and twice her arm banged forcibly against the  window i was frightened at the time that she  
would come right through the window at the same  time as the articles were going around the room   the curtains were blowing upward into the room  i was very upset and disturbed by what i saw  
so investigators at this point decided to set up  a remote control camera in an attempt to catch  
janet's levitations on film and to their amazement  they succeeded in getting several clear photos  
of janet levitating in the center of her room  one particularly impressive photo shows janet  
hovering in a kneeling position in mid-air in the  center of the room leaning forward with her arms  
outstretched in front of her in the background you  can see her sister looking on in stunned amazement  
so this was a very famous case which attracted a  lot of attention it was published in newspapers  
crowds of people came to watch the haunting  activity police were called on numerous occasions  
was investigated by many paranormal researchers  one researcher guy lyon playfair wrote a book  
about this case entitled this house is haunted uh  many years later there was a tv series uh which  
presented this case in detail a dramatization  and uh janet hodgson herself gave an interview  
and she says i know it happened and i know  it was real so it's a really amazing case  
of human levitation which was observed by  multiple witnesses and also captured on film
and now we get to case number 11 which i call  the levitation experiments of hearward carrington  
ELEVEN THE LEVITATION EXPERIMENTS OF HEREWARD CARRINGTON
hereward carrington was a prominent and pioneering  psychic psychical researcher and he decided to do  
some research into human levitation uh he  used an ingenious and yet simple experiment  
which she designed and it involves the  use of breathing in the common school yard  
game known as finger levitation hereward  carrington's repeated experiments proved  
conclusively that rhythmic breathing can  in fact reduce the weight of a human body  
this experiment involved five people a wooden  chair and a very large sized self-registering  
weight scale the wooden chair was placed in the  center of the scale and one person sat on it  
the other four people also stood on the scale  on each side of the person sitting in the   chair and at this point their combined weight  including the chair measured exactly 712 pounds  
then under here we hear word carrington's  instructions all five people were instructed  
to inhale and exhale deeply several times in  unison and on the fifth count everyone was  
instructed to retain their breath and the four  lifters would then quickly insert their fingers  
beneath the arms and legs of the sitter and  lift him up with their fingers to carrington's  
shock and delight he was able to scientifically  prove that levitation was occurring as he writes  
and i quote on the first lift the recorder  stated that the dial had fallen to 660 pounds  
a loss of 52 pounds on the second lift  there was an apparent loss of 52 pounds  
on the third lift of 60 pounds and on the fourth  lift 60 pounds and on the fifth lift 60 pounds  
no gain of weight was at any time  recorded invariably a loss which  
however slowly returned to normal as the subject  was held for some considerable time in the air  
i have no theory to offer as to these  observations which i cannot fully explain  
so yes human levitation has been proven  repeatedly in a laboratory setting  
and hereward carrington's experiments are among  the best as researcher nander fodor writes  
hereward carrington's experiments with the lifting  gain finger levitation have actually proved that  
for some mysterious reason rhythmical breathing  may considerably reduce the weight of the human  
body amazing so many cases of human levitation all  right those are the top twenty best cases of human  
levitation part one i had to break this episode  up into two parts because it was just getting  
way too long so i want to thank you all for  watching i hope you enjoyed it and don't forget  
to stay tuned for next week when i present the  top 20 cases of human levitation part 2 which  
will be cases 10 through 1. until then thanks for  watching i hope you enjoyed it and keep having fun
