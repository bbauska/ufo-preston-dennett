Peter and the UFOs: A True Story of Contact
May 15, 2024

Summary:
May 15, 2024
It was 1968, and 13-year-old Carter Welles walked to school with his best friend, Jackson Groves near his home in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Jackson had just experienced a spontaneous out-of-body experience, and both boys were amazed by the event. Together they vowed to learn how to achieve astral projection. For the next two years they read everything they could find on the subject and meditated daily, but were unable to get out-of-body. Then one evening, Jackson walked home along a remote country highway outside of Toronto when a truckdriver offered him a ride. Jackson accepted. The driver introduced himself as Peter and said, “Well, Jackson, how’s it going with the astral travelling?”

Jackson was shocked because he did not know this man, and Jackson had told nobody but Carter about their attempts to have OBEs. Jackson asked Peter how he knew his name and about the OBEs, and the man just smiled and said, “Oh, you know, we’ve been keeping an eye on you guys.”

After speaking with Peter for an hour or two, Jackson was amazed. Peter showed telepathic abilities, could call forth the wind, and said he worked with extraterrestrials and had been onboard UFOs. He even offered to take Jackson onboard a craft. Jackson was too scared to accept the invitation, but he continued to meet with Peter and learn about spirituality, psychic abilities, and UFOs.

After a few visits with Peter, Jackson told Carter about him. Carter was excited and asked to meet Peter too. Peter agreed, and Carter, Jackson and a couple of friends met with him. Peter repeated that he worked with the aliens, displayed his ability to call forth the wind, read their minds and showed other incredible abilities. The boys hammered him with questions, all of which Peter answered with great wisdom and humor, often bringing the boys to tears with laughter.

Shortly after this visit, the boys were staying at Carter’s parents’ cottage in Rosedale, Ontario. Carter was alone in the house when his friends came running in and announced that they had just seen a Martian at the docks along the nearby Rosedale River
 
Says Carter, “They described it, and it was exactly like what we think of today as a gray. A little guy with a big head, big eyes, a skinny little body. And they saw it. They saw this thing. And we have never experienced anything like that before. So, we were very excited.”

A few days later, Carter and his friends were walking over the Rosedale bridge. Carter got ahead of the others, and looking over the bridge into the parking lot, he saw a strange figure. He knew instantly that it was the “Martian.”

“I saw this little being,” Carter said. “It looked like a little gray alien…and when I first saw it, my body reacted and I kind of jerked. And it mimicked me! And I saw what it did, and I kind of shook my head and looked at it. And it did the same thing. It was kind of playing with me. It was really playful. I had this whole little interaction with it. It was like mimicking me and bouncing around, kind of over-exaggerating my movements. It was very playful. The energy coming off this guy was so fun and playful.”

The met with Peter a few days later and told him what happened. Peter just smiled and showed no surprise. Peter promised to meet them again, but suddenly he disappeared from their lives. All the boys, but especially Carter, were devastated. Peter was like a long-lost friend, or an enlightened Master, and now he was gone.

A few weeks later, Carter and his friends had a dramatic UFO sighting over Rosedale. Then, one of Carter’s friends saw Peter at a fast-food restaurant in Toronto, and tried to get up and talk to him but found himself unable to move until Peter left. 

Carter was profoundly affected by his meetings with Peter. His sense of spirituality became stronger. He began to communicate telepathically with Peter. Carter grew up, searching out the works of spiritual leaders, but none held a candle to what he learned from Peter. Carter traveled the world, and ended up in Hawaii where he built an off-grid home and met his wife. One evening in the middle of the night, the house filled with unexplained white light. Both Carter and his girlfriend had strange memories of being onboard a craft. When they woke up the next morning, they found a strange implant in the same location on their arms.

They moved back to the mainland and continued to have UFO sightings. Carter thought about Peter daily, and often wished that he would see him again one day. But he never did. He looked back on those few incredible meetings with Peter and wondered, who was this man, an angel, a spirit guide, an extraterrestrial? It remains a mystery, but today, now in his late sixties, Carter will never forget how his life changed forever when Peter came into his life.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal thank you for
joining me I've got a really interesting episode for you today I think I call this one Peter and the
UFOs this is a little bit different from a lot of episodes I've presented here this one is all about one person's
experiences it's one case but it's really quite extensive it involves a gentleman I call Carter Wells that's not
his real name he insisted upon being anonymous and in fact he had no intention of sharing his story
whatsoever it was actually his son who contacted me and asked if I could
interview his father well his father did not want to talk to me at first it took some
convincing uh as long as he remains Anonymous and gets no attention he decided it was okay to share his story
and yeah it's different from most it doesn't does involve human and high strangeness certainly but it's got a lot
to it missing time onboard experiences implants I mean the whole deal but a lot
of real high strangeness and paranormal stuff that goes beyond a lot of what
other cases I've investigated have so I think you'll find it quite
interesting because it is very unusual again this case is taken from my book
humanoids in high strangeness and it's probably one of my favorite chapters in the book so I'm super excited to share
it with you today and I think you'll find it quite interesting I certainly
hope so it was 1968 and 13-year-old Carter Wells was
walking to school with his best friend Jackson Groves again pseudonyms Jackson
lived just down the street from Carter and because they both went to the same school they had to walk the same route
every day they had plenty of time to get to know each other and they became friends and they soon enjoyed long deep
conversations with each other talking about anything and everything they could imagine they were both really good
students they liked learning and exploring strange new things so one day
as they were walking to school Jackson became unusually pensive and silent and
Carter could clearly see that something was bothering him so he asked him what's going on why are you so quiet what
happened and Jackson said well I don't want to tell you because I think you might think
I'm crazy but Carter assured him he wouldn't and said just tell me what happened
Jackson turned to him and said that the last night he woke up in the middle of the night standing in the center of his
room and looking at his bed he saw that his body was actually still in bed was
confusing because he knew he was totally awake everything around him looked real he knew it wasn't a dream and that's
when he realized he was having an outof body experience and as soon as he realized
that and the blink of an eye he was back in his body and he woke up so Carter was
amazed by this and he told him man you're not crazy that sounds really
interesting to me so Carter himself had always had very Vivid Lucid like dreams
and hearing about his friend's astral projection experience got very excited
so they spent the rest of the Walk going to school talking about Jackson's outof body experience they had heard of astral
projection but only a little bit they knew almost nothing about it but they both were convinced that Jackson had had
a genuine outof body experience and the more they talked about it the more interested they became
in this subject and vowed to learn how to do it as Carter says I just thought
it was one of the coolest ways to find stuff out you could just go anywhere to be honest I thought it would be fun to
go into the girls dressing room and spy on naked babes I wanted to go check out
planets and go into the Earth I just thought man this is like being a genie you could go anywhere you can fly the
walls can't stop you my friend Jackson and I we were so into it we were like
Tom Sawyer and Huck fin astral buddies we thought we'd go out and gallivant and have a blast
so at this time they were living in Toronto in Ontario Canada and they went directly to the library to find some
books on this could not find one single book but Jackson had an idea he had done
a paper route since he was a little kid and he had gotten to know the local neighborhood pretty
good and he knew about a place called the rosac crucian center this was
located near the intersection of Dan for and Broad View and you can see it here
this is the rosac crucian center where they went to visit because Jackson knew
that they had a library of esoteric books and he thought well maybe they have something on the subject so as
Carter says we just boldly went knocking on their door one day this old lady met
us at the door and we asked her if we could access their Library she kind of
looked at us she looked above us and all around us I didn't know what she was doing I thought she was crazy she was
kind of goofy and I was getting ready to leave but then she gave us the go-ahead so they both went into the
library searched the shelves for any kind of book on astral projection and
there wasn't a single one but Carter did find an interesting book called Cosmic
Consciousness this is written by Richard Maurice Buck it's a very well-known book
while it doesn't provide instructions on astral travel or even really talk about it at all it was all about raising one's
Consciousness and this really captured Carter's attention and it soon became his favorite book I mean he was reading
it in school other than his school textbooks so one way or another both
were very much committed to trying to achieve astral projection as Carter says
I just immersed myself in this stuff every day after school we go home go to my room and we try to leave our bodies
until dinner time so what happened was we kind of activated something in ourselves by practing practicing this
all the time so this went on for a couple of years both boys read anything they could
find about esoteric subjects and spirituality both became huge fans of
Science Fiction they continued to meditate and try to astral project but
unfortunately they never did succeed but then something very strange
and synchronistic happened it was one evening as Jackson was walking home from
his girlfriend's house this is when he lived in the small town of New Market she did so it was a pretty long distance
to Jackson's home and he had to hitchhike and often would so he was
walking along an isolated section of Highway surrounded only by Fields when a
truck suddenly pulled over next to him two men exited the truck and kind of
whispered to him be careful the guy that's driving is really weird and the
two men walked off into the fields and this was weird cuz there was nothing out
there and Jackson's like well where the heck are they going again back in those days
hitchhiking was much more popular and wasn't really considered dangerous at any rate when the truck door remained
open Jackson climbed Med up into the front passenger seat and looked at the driver he was amazed to see this
enormously obese man humongous he was Caucasian appeared to
be in his mid-30s had Sandy brown hair was slightly balding but it was what
this man said next that left Jackson absolutely amazed because the man knew
his name and he said well Jackson he was smiling how's it going with the astral
traveling so jackon needless to say was absolutely amazed he had never seen this
man before this man did not know him and he had not talked really about his
efforts to learn astral projection with anything but Carter so there was no way this man could know this so Jackson
asked him how do you know my name and how do you know about what I'm trying to
do and the man threw his head back and laughed loudly and he said oh you know
we've been sort of keeping our eyes on you guys for a while so this really stunned him to the
degree degree that he didn't know how to react and instead they began to talk and
this is when the man introduced himself as Peter and said that he worked as a truck driver delivering produce to
various towns outside of Toronto and that he was very encouraged to learn that Jackson and his friend Carver were
interested in these deep spiritual subjects Jack says he felt immediately
at ease with this man felt like he was an old friend Peter seemed to exude confidence and wisdom and kindness like
nobody else he had ever met so before he knew it they had arrived at Jackson's
home Jackson asked if he could meet Peter again they agreed they exchanged phone numbers and it was a week or two
later that Peter agreed to meet Jackson and showed up at his house in a small
car they drove off together to a small basement apartment on the outskirts of
Toronto now Peter didn't talk much about himself but did say that he grew up in the suburbs of Cabbagetown this was not
a good neighborhood but they talked into the night about all kinds of deep
subjects mostly spiritual and philosophical and Peter explained to
Jackson that all humans have psychic abilities that they have only begin begun to
understand and at one point he set an ashtray in front of Jackson and said okay learn about the universe make it
disappear so very much intrigued Jackson focused on the ashtray and concentrated
on making it disappear uh obviously it did not work but Peter explained that humans do have
all kinds of psychic abilities that they can call forth the wind and he actually demonstrated this for Jackson and
Jackson said that he seemed to be able to read his mind because he to answer Jackson's questions as he formulated
them so this went on throughout the night and it was all about trying to
help Jackson learn to grow and develop his psychic abilities at one point Peter did bring
up the subject of UFOs and said that he actually worked with the ETS and flew
their craft transporting various Freights around but Jackson was mostly struck by
Peter's incredible kind and wisdom he said the man had a presence about him that made him seem totally trussworthy
and very spiritually Advanced so they talked about all kinds
of subjects he said Peter was incredibly funny as well and would just say things
that would leave Jackson in spasms of laughter uh the evening finally ended
and Peter drove Jackson home promising to meet him again so the third meeting came a short
time later Peter showed up at Jackson's house again driving a different car a
fancy convertible and they took a drive out into the country and Jackson found
himself sharing all about his interests of going into space learning how to do out ofbody travel science fiction he
said there was something about this guy that made it easy to talk to him about
anything and at one point while they were returning home back to Toronto
Peter suddenly pulled the car over on a remote section of Highway and normally very smiling and jovial he became
suddenly Stern and made an announcement that really caught Jackson off guard
Peter said if I called down a spaceship right now would you be willing to go for
a ride and Jackson felt this wave of fear when he realized Peter was being
entirely serious and he had no doubt Peter could actually do this and he was
afraid if he said yes a UFO would show up and I mean things suddenly became far too real it was too much and Jackson
said no thanks and hearing this Peter threw back his head and just laughed and
laughed and it was at that moment this really powerful wind swept down and
swirled all around them it was so strong he said it practically lifted him out of the
car so there was this weird calling of the wind again which is something that would happen over and over
again so finally Jackson shared all this with Carter and Carter was astonished
because he you know Peter sounded absolutely incredible and Carter said you know I really want to meet him and
Jackson said okay so Carter was super excited this
would be the first time you could find anybody that had any interest besides jaon in astral projection and all these
esoteric subjects by now it's the summer of 1970 and it turns out that Carter's
parents owned a small cottage about 15 miles north of Toronto out outside of
Toronto in the small country town of Rosedale this is just a little town and
in fact Carter and Jackson and their friends would often hitchhike up there to get away from the city and listen to
Moody Blues and hike in the surrounding Woods rest along the shore of balam Lake
which is this really beautiful area usually there was four of them Jackson
Carter Carter's cousin Dan and their friend Sammy again those are pseudonyms
but all four of these young men who are very interested in obes life after death
UFOs Consciousness astronomy spirituality and all these kinds of
things and Carter and Jackson decided that this would be the ideal place to meet with Peter so
Jackson called Peter up and Peter agreed so on that one morning they all gathered
at Dan's house waiting for Peter to arrive and everyone's asking well what
are we looking for what does he look like what kind of car does he drive and Jackson explained well he's really fat
he has short hair he's kind of bald on top but I can't tell you what he's going to drive because it's always a different
car and sure enough this car pulls up it's a Volkswagen Beetle and they're
sure it's him they all go running out to meet him and there is a big guy in there but he's got this massive head of hair
and so as they approached him the boys were like oh shoot sorry we thought you were someone
else and turns out it was him he comes out of the car and he's laughing and
laughing and he reaches up and pulls off his wig and it's him it's Peter this
enormously obese man so this was another weird thing that
happened they all get in the car and since Carter knows the way there he sits
in the front seat and the other three boys squeeze into the back and as they're driving along Carter says and
I'll just quote Carter directly were driving along and there were these amazing biblical clouds gorgeous and
puffy and there's one Cloud that had a perfectly Square rectangular hole in it
with blue sky behind and I was like wow holy crap look at that can you guys see
this and at this point Peter says something very strange he turns to Carter and says yeah there's a door up
there why don't you go through it and Carter looked at him in confusion like
what Peter just laughed he would often laugh like this as Carter
says so Peter didn't know quite what he meant but he tried to imagine himself
going through the door nothing happened but there was this weird sensation because as Peter says or rather as
Carter says in his own words he's there driving and it felt like he was turned
and staring at me with his full attention it was so intense that I would kind of glance over at him and he would
just be looking ahead driving the sense of presence that he could operate no matter what his body was doing was new
to me I'd never experienced anybody like that before so at some point during the drive
to the cabin the boys said that they needed to stop and pee they pulled over
on the highway near this beautiful wooded area where there was this huge Grove of trees this is later going to be
important and all four boys ran off into the woods relieved themselves piled back into the car and continued on their
way they drove up to the cottage and the plan plan was for Peter to stay there
with him with them and he did he stayed for the day and they got to know Peter
Peter explained that again he worked as a truck driver but that he was really on Earth as a guide and the boys asked him
all kinds of questions Carter of course asked him about UFOs and Peter said that yeah he worked
with the ETS as cter says he made references to actually working on UFOs
almost like they were Freighters and he was hired on to transport stuff which I thought was interesting I never really
thought of them like that but he implied that he could contact them of course
Peter also talked about calling the wind he took them outside and demonstrated it
as Carter says he had some kind of connection with the wind he could just conjure up the wind it was the most
amazing thing so Peter also noted noed that
Carter had this tendency to answer their questions before they could actually ask
them and instead of being freaked out by this Carter found it to be actually comfortable and
natural and they talked about all kinds of subjects and at one point Peter said
something very strange he said that he no longer ate food that he had long ago
given up eating food and this was really confusing to the boys and Peter just said basically
well what do you guys think food is and the boys had no answer for this and
Peter said well it's sunlight it's just transformed sunlight and there are ways
you can extract energy directly from the Sun and that's what I do it just works
for me it's an easier way for me to exist so caror couldn't believe this and
he's looking at Peter's enormous overhanging belly I mean the guy was
obese and Carter nearly burst out laughing and finally he just said uh
then why are you so fat Peter thought this was the funniest thing all four of
the boys started howling with laughter and Peter laughed with them but then suddenly became sober and serious and
said well I do this because I'm a walking billboard when I walked down
Young Street in Toronto people can't help but notice me in a split second of
contact I can tell if they're ready for guidance so yeah he's apparently some
sort of spirit guide and he told Peter or Peter told Carter and the other kids
I am quite excited to meet you four kids you guys are just amazing you're only 15
and you've been into this stuff for a couple of years already I'm really impressed it's really refreshing to meet
young people who are just so open to this stuff so this was a transformational evening
for Carter at one point he decided to just go outside and lay in the grass and
meditate and he says he was just lying there thinking of a question and thought
in his mind Peter I have a question for you well apparently at that moment Peter was inside with the guys he stopped what
he was doing and said hang on a second Carter wants to ask me something
and next thing you know he squatted down beside Carter and says okay what's up
and Carter again said that felt completely normal that this man could read his mind finally Carter did ask Peter about
how to go out of out of body how to astral project Peter just kind of laughed and rolled his eyes as if as if
learning how to do astral projection was a lower spiritual practice to the other
things he was trying to teach them but said okay I'll show you what I can they
went outside and laid down in the grass Peter told him to pick a star and just
focus on it and Carter walked about 30t away lay down and picked a star and
looked at it and the next thing he knows he's waking up he had fallen asleep
apparently and he jumped up and had this incredible sense of love and
gratitude and just felt this incredible affection for Peter like he's some sort
of spiritual master of some kind they went back inside and turned out 15
minutes had gone by and Carter does not remember that as Carter says honestly my
experience was we went out I laid down I looked at the stars I blinked we got up
and I came in that's what I experienced in terms of the time so I had missing time here I don't know what happened but
something big something just completely knocked me out so at that point they all went to
bed Peter left the next morning and he promised to pick them up and drive them
back to Toronto at the end of the week and this is when some really
interesting things began to happen as Carter says it was during that week when
all the UFO stuff started showing up now it was a day or two after Peter
left Carter was in the Cottage alone it was nighttime when Jackson and their
friend Sammy came running into the cottage with an incredible story they announced to Carter we just saw a
Martian and they explained that they were on the docks by the Highway 35
Bridge which spanned the rosale river leading to balam Lake you can see it
here and as Carter says they described it and it was exactly like what we think
of today as a gray a little guy with a big head big eyes a skinny little body
and they saw it they saw this thing and we have never experienced anything like that before so we were very excited we
all ran out to go see it and there was nothing there of course at that time
there weren't really a whole lot of books on UFOs and really no descriptions of Grays whatsoever but Jackson and
Sammy had gotten a good look at this figure they could clearly see it was not human it was not that far away so all of
them were super Amazed by this strange synchronicity of talking with Peter
about UFOs and aliens to have only a few days later one of these aliens show up
but events weren't over yet they had recently met another boy their age who also lived in rosale and a day or two
later they all walked over to his house to hang out and talk about their sighting of the quote
Martian and evening came it was time to return to Carter's parents' Cottage and
the four of them were heading back in a group but as they began to cross this same Bridge the rosale bridge Carter got
ahead of the others he was walking about 50 ft ahead and had almost reached the
end of the bridge and looking down over the side at the parking lot which you
can see here he saw a short thin gray skinned being
now this parking lot was pretty well lit and this being was standing only about 100 ft away close enough for cutter to
see him clearly and he knew instantly it was the Martian I mean it looked exactly
like Jackson and Sammy had described gray skin a large hairless head a skinny
body huge dark eyes cutter said he couldn't tell if it was wearing anything
but if it was it had to be a skintight suit without any markings on it
but what was most amazing to Carter was how this being reacted and I'll just let
Carter describe this cuz it's so interesting as Carter says I saw this
little being it looked like a little gray alien and when I first saw it my body reacted and I kind of jerked and it
mimicked me and I saw what it did and I kind of shook my head and looked at it and it did the same thing it was kind of
playing with me it was really playful I had this whole little interaction with it it was like mimicking me and bouncing
around kind of overexaggerating my movements it was very playful it was
just standing there in this empty parking lot it was completely visible it was easy to see it and all of its
movements the energy coming off this sky was so fun and playful so Carter felt no fear he said
the little gray almost seemed elf-like and he stared in awe and wonder and
light actually and he said the gray itself seemed to be equally entertained
and he watched it for about 30 seconds and then it did something which absolutely amazed him as Carter says all
of a sudden it was like something overlapped in my mind and I couldn't see it anymore and I knew I just totally
knew that it was still there but it was somehow able to manipulate frequencies
or my perception in some way that it could just kind of show up and disappear
but it wasn't disappearing it wasn't gone and all of this just happened so
fast so although Carter was sure this ET was still there he could not see it and
it was at that exact moment of course that Carter's friends showed up caught up with him he told him what he had seen
and I said well that's exactly what we saw and it was in the exact same place
the only difference was Jackson and Sammy had seen it from a diff a different perspective on the docks so
they stayed for just a little while it did not reveal itself again the ET so
they went back to the cottage and it wasn't until years later when reports of
Grays surfaced in the popular media that they realized their Martian was actually
a gray so finally at the end of the week Peter arrived to take them home and they
were all all full of questions for him they stayed up all night and asked him
all about all kinds of stuff and Carter was just so excited to have finally met
someone who could talk about this stuff they told him what happened he just smiled and laughed and kind kind of
looked at them he said with this bemused knowing expression but wouldn't say much
about it so that was curious Peter again of course showed up in a different car
and took them home uh the boys asked if they could see him again and he agreed to meet them in a
week or two but alas it was not meant to be because following this experience
Peter pretty much disappeared completely from their lives as Carter says he
disappeared after that he completely disappeared and I have to say he left such an impression on me I was
heartbroken when he disappeared there's a lot later on that
I haven't mentioned about what I experienced in this guy's presence but in short it was like when we look into
his eyes it was like looking and seeing someone that you had forgotten about someone so dear and precious to you like
a great great great grandfather or something was just like this Indescribable feeling of love and
connection it's hard to describe it now all four boys felt the same way like he
was a long lost lifelong friend and all of them really experienced the
pain of his lost and talked about him endlessly cuz there were so many strange
things about him they wondered if he was even human was he a guardian angel could
he be an extraterrestrial was he an enlightened Master but he was so normal
looking and he was so fat so they did not know what to think about this
guy uh they did tell others about their sighting of the Martian most people didn't not believe them some were
interested they did find one local kid who absolutely believed him they had become friends with him and he said that
he lived on the other side of the bridge and had a long way to walk home and one day he was walking past a field when a
little silver disc popped up out of the tall grass and shot upwards was
completely unexpected scared the hell out of him it was one month later after
Peter had gone that they were back and Ro Dale it was a bright sunny day he had traveled by boat to Grand Island which
is located on the center of Balsam Lake and looking Northwest towards rosale
about 2 miles away hovering maybe 600 feet in the sky or so maybe a
th000 feet was a gigantic shiny metallic
Golden Disc your classic Flying Saucer it's Carter says it was this incredibly
bright shining golden classic UFO right over rosale we're across the lake
looking at this thing this ship it looked like this beautiful burnished polished go gold and it just sat there
perfectly still for about 20 minutes so people were out there water
skiing and doing all kinds of stuff but Carter spent the whole time just
watching this thing some people would come look at it for 5 minutes then weirdly lose
interest and he looked away and suddenly it was gone he did not see it leave so he doesn't know if it faded away or
guarded off it just suddenly wasn't there so winter arrived and they started
spending much more of their time back in Toronto and one day Carter's cousin Dan
was hanging out with some friends at a little burger joint on the outskirts of Toronto this was in February sitting in
a booth and he saw this car pull up into the parking lot out stepped several
tough looking young men wearing sleeveless shirts their hair all greased back and then to Dan's absolute shock
coming out of the same car was Peter so Dan stared an absolute disbelief he
couldn't believe it there was no mistaking it this was Peter he was very easy to recognize but he couldn't believe that
he was hanging out with these young thugs it made no sense because Dan and
Carter and these other guys Sammy were all very studious intelligent spiritually minded young men but these
guys according to Dan were borderline criminals or so they appeared to be and
he wondered why someone like Peter who was so incredible would be hanging out with these
delinquents but he was Peter and these young guys walked in and this is when
something very strange happened because Dan wanted to jump up and introduce himself and talk to Peter but Peter
turned and looked at him and Dan discovered that he could not move he was absolutely paralyzed couldn't move
couldn't say a word he really wanted to get up and say something but for some reason he just couldn't he said it was
as if his entire nervous system had just shut down and it stayed that way for the
entire time Peter and these men were in there they ordered some food waited for it and during this time Peter would
occasionally glance over at Dan but after about 10 or 15 minutes they got their food got back into the car and
drove off and once the car was actually out of sight Dan could move and I mean
he was sitting at the table with his friends and none of them noticed anything which was also weird so Dan went straight home and
called Carter and Samy and Jackson about
his Peter sighting and everyone was amazed Peter was still around but unfortunately he never showed up again
however at this point they decided to do some investigating Jackson had met Peter at
his basement apartment on the outskirts of Toronto so he went there and there
was no answer so he went to the upstairs house and knocked on the door and a little old lady answered and Jackson
said excuse me ma'am can you tell me where the guy is who lived
downstairs and she looked at him absolutely bewildered and said what are you talking about Jackson said you know
the big guy the big huge guy who lived down there and the woman said there was
no such man Jackson persisted and she became angry she said listen this is my home I would know if someone was living
down there and no one like that has ever been here so I don't even know how you
can explain that but Jackson is absolutely sure that this is where he
had met with Peter done Little P psychic exercises like trying to make the ashtray disappear so it made no sense
but again nothing about Peter seemed to make sense and they discovered another
mystery when Peter had first driven them to Carter's uh Cottage in Rosedale they had
pulled off the road so the boys could relieve themselves but now traveling the same route again Carter could not find
the location where they had stopped by this Grove of trees and it really baffled him as Carter says was literally
between these two towns it was maybe 15 miles I could never find it and it was
weird it became a thing I became obsessed like afterwards since after
this guy came and went but it was just I mean it might seem like a small thing but it was one of so many weird things
about Peter that just left them all wondering what who was this
guy so you know Peter continued to affect them long after he had
gone what really baffled them most was Peter's ability to call the wind and
made them look at the wind in a whole new way because you know Jackson had met Peter on five occasions while Carter and
the others had only met him twice but it completely changed their lives as Carter
says for years afterwards I'd be sitting up at the cottage or anywhere and I'd hear a wind blowing by and I'd go out
and feel it we would call them Peter winds and when I would feel it it was like a call it was like no matter what I
was doing I would just take off boom and follow my intuition and this would lead to some
really interesting synchronicities and all kinds of psychic experiences and as
Carter says that's why I was so broken when he disappeared but he still had a
connection Carter did with Peter he'd be trying to leave his body and suddenly he
could feel Peter's presence unfortunately Carter never did succeed
in astral projection but he did have these interesting telepathic
Communications with Peter for a long times afterwards as he says suddenly I
would connect and he'd be there communicating to me and one time it was
about two weeks after Peter left Carter got this communication
from him that he was going to die at the end of the week that it was his time to go back to his spiritual
home and while this may sound tragic and scary Carter was actually excited CU he
believed in life after death and it left him in a bit of a quandry he knew he was going to miss his family but some part
of him was really excited about all of this and Friday arrived and there was a
celebration going down on in downtown Toronto and pet Carter says he was just
overcome with this feeling of absolute Oneness and love and empathy with
everyone all around him he said he was almost to the point where he was drunk that he could barely walk he was just
completely blissed out he said I just felt like I was dissolving in love this
Universal love and the feeling persisted all day and the day ended
and Carter was still alive he was strangely slightly disappointed but at the same time he knew something really
profound had happened to him he said as he says I felt different but I couldn't
really put my finger on it later he read about Walkins and wondered if he had
experienced some kind of Soul exchange or something like maybe part of him did die and another part came in he doesn't
know but all he knows is quote it all happened in this extreme field of
love so time went on years passed Carter grew up he left Toronto traveled all
over the world and often thought about Peter as he says it affected me for
years and years honestly I was just always calling to him telepathically to
come back come back uh he hitchhiked all over uh the world across Europe North
Africa always hoping to see Peter again he never did but he became a spiritual
Seeker he came upon the works of GFF and uspensky and just ate it up but I mean
there are all kinds of gurus out there in Vancouver where he lived all these people trying to be spiritual and as
Carter says I checked out a lot of them and none of them held a candle to the
presence of the truck driver so years later
Carter again decided to travel he moved to Hawaii he loved the weather there in the wilderness he moved off grid like
many contactees do built this little cabin with no electricity or running water but it was really comfortable he
met a beautiful woman they fell in love got married and were very happy in this tiny off-grid house and one night in the
middle of the night they woke up to go to the bathroom
and as they were climbing down the ladder from The Loft the whole house filled up with bright light like flood
lights blazing into the windows which wasn't possible because this was out in the wilderness there were no
roads and they relieved themselves and were climbing back into the house when again it blazed with brilliant light so
they knew something was happening and he asked his wife if she
had any weird dreams prior to waking up right before this happened and she said well actually yeah
I dreamt I was on a ship or something like this strange airplane and there was this strange little man there eating ice
cream and Carter wondered about that but he decided to meditate and see if he
could recall anything and he did as he says I'll just quote him directly this
whole thing just unfolded in my head I was like almost a specialist kind of
pilot and I my consciousness had been put into this UFO type of
machine my Consciousness and this machine was so sophisticated was like a
living nervous system that needs a living Consciousness to operate it just like our physical body I was test
piloting some kind of new system it was like I was immersed in it I was inside I
was the Consciousness living inside the living wiring of this thing and it was
very complex as complex as a body it was like that it was all golden like
everything was made of gold filaments everything was golden and clean and
super precise and yet living it had a living Dynamic to it it was super
responsive to your Consciousness whatever I was thinking so Peter or I mean Carter
recalled all this and he said felt almost as like he was being trained how to Pilot a
UFO which is certainly something I've heard many times from their
contactees and this was when the their house suddenly filled up with
light and the next morning they woke up to another strange mystery they both had
this hard little bump on their arm in the same place Carter had it on his left
arm his wife had it on her right arm and as Carter says I assumed it was some
kind of implant this kind of concerned him at the time his wife was pregnant with
their first child so he had some concerns about this he wondered if
perhaps this was missing time and onboard experience it certainly sound like sounds like it he did try to cut
this implant out of his arm but he never was able to do it at any rate they
decided that they would move back to the mainland because the house where they
lived off grid was not really well suited to raise a child and ended up moving to
the small city of Auburn California a tiny quaint little town and he continued
to see UFOs he says and I quote I see those quite a lot actually I don't know
what they are but that's a pretty common thing I've seen lots of stuff like that
little things going on in the sky so that is Carter's story he's now
in his late 60s he's enjoying his retirement he never thought he would talk about this a couple of his friends
have passed on who were there one is still living but he doesn't really remember a whole lot about it other than
that Peter was a real person and when Carter started to hear gr being portrayed as quote dark evil
little bastard he was very puzzled because that was not his experience at
all either way he feels certain that the UFO phenomenon on and ET contact has a
very strong spiritual component and he's very optimistic about it and the state
of the world as he says in his own words I feel hopeful I know the world looks
pretty messed up right now but I still feel hopeful the glimpse of beauty that
I saw back then I feel like we're getting there I really do I feel like
one day humankind is going to find its true kindness and that is the story of
Peter and the UFOs in the experiences of Carter Wells and as you can see it
affected him profoundly throughout his life but especially after age 13 and meeting this
gentleman Peter frankly I think Peter is probably an ET himself I really do an
angel perhaps certainly an enlightened person of some kind and such a shame
that Carter never met him again but he certainly thinks about him on a pretty
much daily basis and I think you can understand why considering that amazing
experience he had with him I mean wow who was this guy I mean it's such an
interesting story all the way from the psychic aspects to Peter's claims to how
he could apparently control the wind said he didn't need food and yet here he
is enormously obese there's a lot of really interesting things I think we can
learn from this particular UFO contact story because it is so different from
others in fact when I was interviewing Carter he asked me do you want to hear
the whole story the spiritual sides the high strangeness and I said absolutely yes that's exactly why I want to talk to
you because there is a lot more than to UFO contact than just being taken on
board and physically examined I think that's a total misconception EG contact
is far more profound and spiritual than just that I think this case really shows
that in a remarkable way and that's why I wanted to share it with you today
again it was taken from my book humanoids in high strangeness I left some parts out so if
you want to know the whole story you'll have to check out the book but it's just one of many many really interesting
cases involving humanoids and high strangeness that are in the book but again certainly one of my favorite
chapters because it is so unusual I like it because there's a lot of evidence to
it as well with multiple Witnesses and physiological effects and spiritual and
psychic effects and multiple UFO sightings and missing time and implants
and just so much to it so that's it for today I hope you've
enjoyed this episode I truly thank you you once again for watching I really
appreciate it a lot it's because of you guys that I do this show so thank you
and until next time I'll just do my typical sign off keep asking those hard
questions keep searching for the truth most important of all keep having fun I
know I am hope you are too bye for
now
