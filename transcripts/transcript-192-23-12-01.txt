THE EXPERIENCERS: OF ONBOARD UFO
Dec 1, 2023

Summary:
Dec 1, 2023
Onboard UFO Encounters! These cases are the heart of the UFO phenomenon. Almost everything we know about ET contact comes from the people who have been inside UFOs. These are the most extensive and interesting of all UFO encounters. This video presents five fascinating firsthand cases involving people from across the world who have been onboard a UFO and interacted with aliens.

MUST HAVE WATER! One evening in the Spring of 1951, an anonymous engineer, HM, drove near the Drakenstein Mountain in Paarl, South Africa when a man flagged his car down. “Have you any water?” he asked. HM said no, but agreed to drive the man to a nearby stream and get some water. The man then asked HM to drive back up the road. To HM’s shock, they came upon a landed flying saucer. The man invited HM inside the craft, where he saw four other men. The man said that they needed water to cure an injured companion. They agreed to answer any questions HM might have. HM asked how the ETs power their craft. He asked where they came from, and they pointed to the stars, but refused to be more specific. HM was ushered off the craft. Returning the next day, he was amazed to find weird landing traces.

TAKEN IN ITAPERUNA. On the night of Sep 25, 1971, Paulo Caetano DaSilva was driving through Itaperuna, Brazil when a saucer-shaped craft chased his car down the road. He went to the police station and told them what happened. He then returned on his journey, only to have the saucer land on the road and stall his car. Three little men exited and pulled Paulo onboard where he was examined. Paulo fell unconscious and the next thing he knew, he was being set down next to his car. Paulo was shocked and disoriented, and his eyes were very sore. He went to the police and told them what happened. To his shock, another man, Benedito Miranda, reported an encounter on the same night, and people throughout the area saw UFOs. Little did Paulo know that his encounters had only begun. The ETs would soon return, this time with a profound message.

OWYHEE RIVER ENCOUNTER. One day in the Summer of 1975, a married couple, Darryl and Toni were on vacation near the Owyhee River in Oregon. They stopped by the road when they saw what they thought was a plane in the sky, except it was silent. Upon returning home, they found that they were missing two hours of time. Darryl became very depressed, and Toni noticed an increase in psychic abilities. Knowing something strange had happened to them, they went under hypnosis and recalled being taken onboard a craft. Darryl recalled being examined by short, gray-skinned ETs, who proceeded to heal an old childhood injury to his arm. Toni was told by the ETs that because she was psychic, they would allow her to observe the healing procedure. Afterward, both felt it was a benevolent encounter, and Darryl described the ETs as very loving.

TAKEN ON CRYSTAL MOUNTAIN. At 2:30 pm on Jul 14, 1985, Joseph left the lodge at the Crystal Mountain Ski Resort in Washington State to take a hike up the mountain. No sooner had he left when he suddenly found himself lying face down 2000 feet up the side of the mountain, disoriented, sore, with five unexplained needle-marks on his back. He stumbled back down, met his partner, Cassandra at the lodge and learned that he was missing two hours of time. Wondering what had happened to him, Joseph sought hypnosis and learned that he had been taken onboard a craft. Inside he was shocked to see more than 25 short, grayish-green, humanoid ETs. He was placed on a table and physically examined. He remembered them doing something to his back. He was then placed back on the mountain. Following this, he had two close-up UFO sightings.

TAKEN IN THE YUKON. On the morning of Sep 3, 1987, Kevin Bramm drove his motorbike along a remote highway in Yukon, Canada. Stopping to go pee, he was shocked to see a UFO fly across the road ahead of him. Moments later, he saw two insectoid-looking figures, who struck him with a beam of light. Time seemed to stop, and Kevin had the sensation of being paralyzed and drawn upward. The next thing he knew, it was nearly nighttime. He got on his bike and rushed off. Upon arrival to his trailer, he heard an odd buzzing sound, but was too scared to investigate. But it was then that he remembered being taken onboard a craft with strange instruments and panels, and two gray ETs. They gave him strange liquid so he wouldn’t remember. Kevin wanted to remember, but drank the liquid. Afterward, he found two strange scoop marks on his hands.

These five cases provide a vivid portrayal of what it’s like to be taken onboard a UFO and meet extraterrestrials face-to-face. These cases are supported by multiple witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. They show that ETs are actively engaged in taking people onboard their craft and have been visiting our planet for a very long time.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today I'm going
to talk about the kinds of UFO cases I love most and by that I mean onboard UFO
Encounters in fact today's episode is called the
experiencers five cases of onboard UFO encounters as I've said many times
sightings are interesting and of course Landings and face to face encounters with humanoids but onboard encounters
are the closest of all UFO encounters there is pretty much zero chance of
misperception when you are enveloped in the phenomena itself these are so
extensive we get a lot of information from these cases this is the True Heart
of the UFO phenomenon so I love these cases and I've only got five I want to
present to you today but but they're all quite extensive so we're going to learn a lot about ET contact who they are
where they're from what their agenda is on our planet and I've got cases from
across the world there's one in South Africa one in Brazil one in Canada and
two in the United States these all involve a variety of humanoids different
types a variety of experiences and of course unique elements as well and
supporting evidence in terms of corroborating Witnesses and medical
effects and all these different types of evidence we so often see so yeah some really interesting
cases tonight and let's just get started and the first case I'd like to talk about I call must have water there are a
number of cases in UFO literature where ETS approach people and ask for water
and that's what happened in this case from South Africa this occurred in Spring of
1951 near grinstein Mountain in South Africa it's a really interesting
extensive and unique case with some super interesting elements to it and I
think you'll find it really fascinating this case was investigated by researcher
Juan Jose Benitez who says and I quote it is one of the most spectacular of the
cases that I have investigated in recent months the story is one that would
indeed be difficult to believe were it not for one very simple but overriding
fact namely the professional and cultural standing of the
witness so this is a great witness he is known only by his initials hm and he was
at first very reluctant to talk about his story and had to be convinced he is
an engineer originally from England and he specializes in the Development and
Construction of automatic Pilots for airplanes so clearly a very intelligent
man and at the time of his encounter he was living in parl South Africa near the
location of the encounter drenin mountain now his car had recently failed
so after giving it a full overhaul he decided to take his vehicle for a drive
to recharge the battery and this is when his encounter occurred it was around 11:00 p.m. and he
was driving along the foot of the drakenstein mountain and he was about to turn around and head for home when he
saw a man a normal human looking man standing alongside the road but waving
his arms in an obvious request for assistance so the witness hm stopped his
car and asked this man what's the matter and the man replied have you any
water now according to the witness he told this man that the only water he had
was in his car radiator now the man was not happy to hear this he got a
distressed look look on his face and told hm you see we need
water so seeing this man's obvious need the witness offered to guide the man to
a nearby stream just up the road and this strange fellow standing by
the side of the road said is it far to this stream now he spoke in English
according to hm but had sort of a strange unplaceable accent and and hm
said no the stream is just down the road and that it was a mountain stream with
good cool pure water and this strange man seemed very pleased to hear this so
hm invited him into his car and off they went and they drove to this stream and
when they arrived there it was clear this man had no container to hold the water so hm grabbed an empty oil can
that he had in his car washed it out cleaned it all up and then filled it
with water from the stream then together they got back in the car and drove back
up the mountain and this man that he picked up instructed hm to drive a little further
up the road and this is when the witness got an incredible shock because there
landed on the ground not far away was a classic Flying Saucer and as hm says in
his own words I perceived that there was a strange object there it was about 100 m
or so from the road and in the zone of shadow cast by the mountain it was quite
big between 10 and 15 M or so it wasn't very high in the underp part I could see
an opening which was lit up and some steps which led to the interior of the machine I stood there dumbfounded
so at this point he could see that this was your classic Flying Saucer and to his amazement this man he had picked up
apparently an ET invited him to follow him inside hm was a little bit nervous and
somewhat afraid but the man seemed friendly enough and kept insisting so hm
agreed and followed him inside this craft and I'll just let the witness describe what he saw as he says in his
own words inside the object which was completely circular there were other men a total of
four more in fact one of them was stretched out apparently so my companion
explained to me they had had a slight accident and the recumbent man had
gotten burned then I replied that I would like to get a bit closer so as to be able to
see the wounded man but my companion said no know that I must not move from
the spot where I was so I stayed there but by the entrance it was a circular room there
were Square Windows all around it and under these windows a sort of circular
couch going all the way around in the area where the windows were the ceiling
was somewhat curved in the center of the room there were some levers set in a
small rectangular area about 1 meter in height so he's looking at all of this
according to hm the beings these men were about 5T in height they looked
human human enough but they had higher than normal foreheads they had brown
hair they were very slender with Slender hands all of them were clean shaven all
of them were dressed identically in a sort of kneel length laboratory Overcoat
which was fastened around their waists with a beige colored belt and hm was amazed to see that
although there were no apparent light fixtures the entire craft seemed to Glow
with light this is of course a description we hear often about the interior of these UFO
craft now the injured man was laid out on the couch alongside the wall and the
other figures who are attending to him paid no attention whatsoever to the
witness and were simply concerned with their injured companion but the figure who hm met took
the can of water to the others and then returned to speak with the witness and asked him if he'd like to ask any
questions and this is where this case gets so interesting because of course we have here a witness who's quite well
educated and interested in aircraft and his first question was
where are the engines because he didn't see any and the ET zoomed ET replied we
don't have any engines hm asked then how do you
navigate the ET began pointing to these lever type instruments and said we have
a different system we nullify gravity that is how we
rise so I'll just let the main Witness describe what happened next according to
him and I quote I asked them how they overcame gravity and he replied that they use a
very heavy fluid which circulated in a tube and with this system they created a
magnet that is to say somewhat as we do with electromagnetics except that they
instead of using electricity were using this fluid apparently this fluid was
subjected to a velocity similar to the velocity of light that is to say the
velocity of electricity but I answered that is impossible no he replied it is simple
when the fluid is leaving the tube it is already entering the other end thus its
relative speed is infinite so it seems that on the base of this system plus a
few magnets of a Kind which clearly do not exist on our planet these beings had
achieved enormous velocities and were able to conquer
gravity so this is interesting because there are a number of cases where the ETS have explained how they power the
craft and this is what they're attempting to do with this witness and then the gentleman hm asked where they
came from and the ET pointed to the stars and said quote from
there and I'll just let hm describe what happened next because this is quite interesting as hm says in his own words
I insisted on wanting to know from which cardinal point in the sky they came but
he simply kept repeating from there and then he rapidly changed the subject it
was obvious that he didn't want to say anymore about that so after we had
chatted about 15 or 20 minutes he pointed in a friendly but firm manner
towards the door and invited me to leave and I did I went down out of the machine
and departed so he drove off while the craft was actually still there but this really
affected him profoundly he could hardly believe this is had happened to him and very curious about it he returned to
this exact spot the very next day as hm again says in his own
words thinking it had all been a strange dream dream I went back to the spot and
there were some very strange marks there and on top of that there was the matter
of my can which we had to carry the water in and which was now
missing so he had some evidence at least that this experience was real and not
just a dream but it should come as no surprise that he didn't want to talk about this for quite some time and had
to be convinced to tell the story because is it really is quite fantasmagorical especially all the way
back in 1951 when when it occurred but hm the witness is
absolutely convinced it was a real experience as he says in his own words I
remember it all still with absolute perfection and in all its details I
think that case has some really important takeaways again it's one of many cases where et's ask for water and
as we found out in this case it's apparently connected to a healing event
another thing I like about this case is the witness is not seeking any publicity or attention whatsoever insisted upon
anonymity I think that speaks towards the credibility of the case it's got some interesting physical evidence as
well and it's very interesting that he asked the ETS where they're from How The
Craft operates and they provided at least some limited information about this so a lot to like about that case
it's super interesting and here's another case that I think is equally if not even more
fascinating and I call this one taken in itap peruna itap peruna is a city in
Brazil and in fact this case occurred on September 25
1971 in itap peruna Brazil it's it's a super fascinating case of extensive
contact where a gentleman was basically followed by a UFO and then taken on
board and his testimony while does rest
this case rests solely on his testimony there are supporting witnesses as well
and later during further contacts he does have more supporting Witnesses some
very interesting things happened the ETS gave him some important warnings something we often hear about in cases
like this it's just a really remarkable case that I think deserves to be more
welln the main witness in this case is Paulo Kitano Da Silva though in some
accounts his last name is Silvera at any rate he's a typewriter technician and
salesman and on the evening of September 25 1971 was driving through the city of
itap peruna to his home when he saw a glowing red disc following his car it
came quite close it was about 10 ft behind him he says and only about 2 feet
off the ground it then circled around his car and caused the engine to fail
but suddenly it took off so Paulo was sweating quite frightened he started the
car engine and drove to the nearest police station and reported the encounter unfort fortunately they did
not take him very seriously other than telling him to stop driving that night
and if he's so scared why doesn't he just spend the night in the city and resume driving in the
morning but Paulo wanted to get home and after calming down for a few minutes he
decided to continue his drive so he's driving along and was near the village
of Saria when this UFO returned it zoomed ahead of him and this time it
landed on the road right in the middle blocking his way forward this point it's
around 8:00 p.m. and he said this craft was quite small about the size of a VW
Beetle a little car and it was a classic saucer shape and as he's watching it it
emitted a beam of Light which caused his car to pull off onto the shoulder stall
and the doors immediately popped open at this point Paulo found himself unable
to move and as he says in his own words first I saw only a ball of fire moving
toward my car then when it sat down ahead on the road the transmission
disengaged and the car began to obey the commands of the little men who were descending from the ship carrying a
lantern with an obfuscating light so so as he watched three beings
approached the car they were very short he said only a few feet tall about the
size of a seven or eight-year-old child he said they didn't quite walk normally
they appeared to Glide or float up to the car and used beams of light to pull
him out and it was quickly taken inside the craft inside the craft there were
six beings he said they wore blue jumpsuits and a smooth covering on their head and
weird helmets kind of Roman type pointed helmets he says their shoes were
squarish the only visible part of their bodies were their hands and faces which
he said were light gray in color they had dark slanted eyes he said it was
weird cuz they walked stiffly without apparently bending their arms or legs
and he was unable to resist and just walked dutifully into this craft and
once inside the craft he said it appeared to go whooshing upwards he
heard a loud whining noise which he described as a quote infernal then he
said the ETS moved around quite quickly and appeared to be communicating to each
other in a way that he could not fully understand the room itself was large
larger than it appeared on the outside and very white and bright so bright that
he had trouble seeing he did see what looked like buttons or some sort of control panel
but he was most impressed by the way these little guys were rushing around one he said was gliding back and forth
between these two lighted objects on an overhead walkway Paulo himself says he was placed
in a beam of light and he believed that at this time he was being physically
examined another very strange thing he noticed is that his body felt much lighter than
normal while inside the craft as if it had a lighter gravity again he did have
the impression this craft was flying around but at some point he lost
Consciousness to his awareness the encounter lasted about 5 minutes but the
next thing he knew he was being carried out of the craft which had landed the
ETS carried him and lay him on the road next to his car and he watched as this
craft rose slowly vertically and then shot off horizontally at very high
speed now at this point poor Paulo was extremely disoriented in shock he had a
lot of trouble seeing he said he was practically blind at this point because the lights inside the craft were so darn
bright uh he was taken to a hospital where he was examined by Dr mun
bsab and he was found to be healthy and sent home but he had some pretty
significant physiological effects in the week following this encounter he says
his vision suffered pretty badly took a long time for his eyes to heal they were
watery and quite red also he was very anxious and nervous he suffered a loss
of appetite he did notice later that his wrist watch was about 15 minutes slow
which would speak towards the actual accurate length of this encounter and later he did find a
strange mark on his arm now Apollo did report this incident to the police and in support of his case
are several other encounters which occurred that night in the same area
most notably and significant I think is what happened to another truck driver
Benedito Miranda who said that he was being chased by a
bright light and in fact was crossing the carangola river bridge right outside
of ITA peruna when his car was blocked by this little craft which he described
in the same way that Paulo did very small the size of a small sports car
saucer-shaped he said he saw three small beings in blue suits wearing those same
strange Roman type helmets that Paulo described he said at one
point he was struck by a beam of light found himself being pulled out of his car by this beam of light and raised get
this almost 150 ft in the air he was very frightened
but was unable to move or call out for help but thankfully for him when
suddenly a car approached this beam of light immediately set him back
down so it's very interesting that he gave the same exact description of this
craft and these beings and thankfully he did report this experience to the
police so this was incredible confirmation of Paulo's encounter and
researchers of course found out about this case and did a thorough investigation and found numerous other
people in the area who also saw what is apparently the same craft in this area
on that night but this was not the end of it Paulo had a number of encounters
following this was less than one month later on October 11 that Paulo woke up
around 300 a.m. and saw apparently the same craft land in his backyard out came these same
little beings they looked directly at him pointed a weird box that they were
holding in their hands pointed it at his head said at this this point he experienced a brief headache the next
thing he knows the beings are going back into their craft which took off a brief encounter surely but it wasn't the last
one the craft returned again on November 5 and this time Paulo's friend berbert
Das saw the craft and 10 days later another encounter and amazingly this
time Paulo was able to take about six photos three of which clearly show a
lighted object in the sky then another encounter on November
17 this time he was driving again with his another friend
Elio and Paulo told Elio a UFO was
following them but Elio said no it's just a bus and then weirdly Elio
suddenly fell asleep and Pao found himself being taken on board again
placed on a table he said a blood sample he believes was taken and then they
showed him something very interesting the ETS showed him the city of itap peruna in Brazil and then an explosion
of an atomic bomb I'm guessing this is the kind of warning we often hear from
ETS either way it wasn't his last encounter on December 5 he was driving
again near the carangola bridge when this UFO showed up he was taken on board
and the ET spoke to him and they had a message for him they said that their mission was peaceful and that what they
were doing was Preparing People for contact Paulo's last major encounter
occurred on December 19 he was driving to his friend Erbert's house when he saw
the craft in the distance so he stopped his car to observe got out walked
towards it suddenly this craft darted right over his head sent down a beam of
light and lifted him about 2 feet off the ground and then set him down very
strange but again in confirmation and corroboration of this case later other
people in the same area saw apparently the same Craft on that
night so after that he did have a few more more sightings and took more photos
but it's certainly a fascinating and very complex case of a UFO ET encounter
and onboard UFO experience I really like that case for a number of different
reasons all those supporting Witnesses the fact that the main witness
had multiple encounters and was even able to photograph these craft that's
super unusual not a lot of contactees get that opportunity and he had repeated
experiences over a period of months was quite an intense period of time for him
and uh I'm so glad that he did get some corroborating Witnesses because I know
having talked to a lot of contactees that they often feel quite alone with their
experiences it's just a fascinating case and this next case is also super
interesting I think the vast majority of cases go unreported uninvestigated and
this one very nearly slipped under the radar I call this one the oi River
encounter this occurred in September of 1975 of course along the OE River in
Eastern Oregon it is a multiple witness case it does have some super interesting
physiological effects and of course psychic effects how it affected the
witnesses afterwards a lot of really interesting details and elements to this case that I
think make it worth being more widely known than it is I doubt any of you have
heard of this one this case comes from researcher Terry a Hartman and it
involves a couple who we know only as Daryl and
Tony they at the time of their encounter were residents of Portland Oregon and
they very much enjoyed taking camping trips in the Oregon Wilderness in the
summer of 1975 they took a 3-day camping trip to explore an archaeological site go water
skiing and enjoy the Wilderness in the OE River area of Eastern
Oregon and they enjoyed their camping trip it all went very well but they were
driving home and had pulled off their pickup truck by a small Creek to cool
off it was quite warm and also give their pickup truck a rest their pickup truck and this is important had a
tendenc a tendency to overheat and needed to have a rest
because when it got overheated it wouldn't function well and it was very difficult to start the
engine so they pulled over darl had just took taken off his shirt to cool off and
looking up he saw what he thought was a plane and he described it is looking very much
like a B52 bomber strangely however it wasn't making any
sound now his partner Tony saw it too but she described it differently she
said to her it looked like a supersonic jet but again making no
sound no sooner did they see this when there was a weird shift and the next
thing they knew they were looking at a shiny silver object landed in the valley
next to them now neither of them spoke about it or really thought much about it
at all but just kind of walked away got into their pickup truck and to their
amazement the pickup truck started right up again normally it was difficult to
start when the engine was hot but then they looked at the temperature gauge and they saw that it registered as the
engine being cold this really puzzled them because they thought only a few minutes had passed but apparently they
were wrong though they weren't quite connecting to it at that time they drove home without incident but when they
arrived they discovered another mystery they were about 2 hours later than they
thought so they clearly had missing time but by this time some of these
details were already being forgotten the plane and the shiny object in the ground
so they really had no clue how to explain the missing time now over the next few months and
actually years there were a few other strange things Tony who had always been
psychic experienced a very strong increase in her abilities Daryl became unaccountably
very depressed and in fact he became depressed to the point that he was not able to hold his job as a mechanic
so this was quite difficult for them a difficult period of time and they
started putting the pieces together especially when they heard UFO researcher Terry a Hartman on a talk
show so they began to wonder you know about this missing time and had they been taken on board a
UFO so they ended up contacting Terry Hartman and arranged for a hypnosis
session now under hypnosis and it took a few sessions both remembered seeing this
quote plane and then the silver object on the hill both recalled falling into what
felt like a trance and they began to walk towards this landed craft darl went
first with Tony following about 10 feet behind him darl Daryl remembered walking
up to the craft and actually touching it he said it was weird it kind of remind reminded him of Teflon he walked around
it he saw what looked like an octagonal opening with rounded corners and of
course Tony verifies this this is exactly what she saw next thing he knows
a ladder seemed to materialize and he found himself crawling up it he recalled
turning around and seeing Tony staring up at him in kind of a days again Tony
remembered all of this but the next thing both of them know they're inside the craft the next thing Tony knew she
was inside this small room which was quite dark but had walls with what
looked like little lights on them she's trying to orient herself when this opening
appears she walked through and saw her husband lying on his Back strapped to a
table by his legs and arms she said the room was white with curved walls along
one side were a few small chairs a small table she saw a strange looking
instrument hanging down from the ceiling over her husband on one wall she did see
a round port hole or window and looking through it she first saw only Blackness
and then clouds and then to her absolute amazement she saw the planet Earth as
viewed from space so these are some very interesting details which are not super uncommon
often people do report these kinds of things so she's watching all of this her
husband uh his eyes are closed he's apparently not seeing any of this but as
she's watching another opening appears an inw walk to
humanoids she said they had dark gray kind of wrinkled skin small facial
features no visible ears no hair that she could see they wor dark gray unifor
forms and they approached Tony and began making this audible buzzing sound she
could hear it but at the same time she heard a telepathic message and it was very interesting what
they told her they said they meant no harm that they had not meant for her to
follow Daryl into the craft but told her that because she was so psychic they
believed that she would be able to handle the experience and view what they were doing
so they then turned their attention to her husband Daryl and she watched as two
ETS began to thoroughly examine him with that strange in instrument that was
coming out of the ceiling she watched as this instrument emitted sort of a pin beam of Light
which scanned his body she saw one of the ETS grab Daryl's arm and pull it
from above and below the elbow as if trying to stretch out the elbow joint
and at this point Daryl screamed out in pain now Daryl actually recalled all of
this uh he couldn't see the ETS he never opened his eyes when he was on board the
craft not because he didn't want to he just says he couldn't but he could feel
all this and he says when the ET pulled his arm it was very painful but that the
ET immediately took the pain away he could feel them touching him again never
saw them but Daryl then had a very interesting detail to all this when he
went under hypnosis he and experienced all this he then told the hypnotist that
as a young man he had badly injured his right elbow and after that injury was never
able to fully extended ever since at this point the encounter ended
the next thing darl Tony knew they were getting back in their car but both of
them do feel that this was a benevolent encounter Tony says that the encounter
resulted again in a very strong increase in her psychic abilities but she also
became much more grateful about life in general Daryl amazingly says that his
elbow injury was completely healed and he no longer suffered from depression
and he found out the source of his depression he says that the ETS were not only very friendly but he says they were
so full of love that it upset them to see all the troubles humanity is
experiencing on Earth and this was the cause of Daryl's depression he felt such
love for the ETS and was so upset about all the madness going on on the planet
that he couldn't do anything about so a very interesting case and in
fact while they were both going under hypnosis again this was several sessions
Tony woke up one evening and saw one of these ETS standing at the foot of her
bed and he told her that his name was Ahab very strange but quite a remarkable
multiple witness onboard UFO encounter I think you'll agree that's a truly
fascinating case really hard to deny when you have a multiple witness case
and it's super interesting how profoundly it affected the witnesses psychically emotionally mentally and
physically I mean the fact that this gentleman was actually healed I think
speaks towards the ET benevolence yes he was somewhat traumatized yes he did
experience pain but they took it away immediately they were trying to heal them I wonder why it's super interesting
that they pick people to heal uh perhaps he was doing some important work for
Humanity that is a pattern I see with a lot of contactees hard to say for sure but
certainly an important and interesting case and here's another one that I doubt
anyone knows about because it received very little publicity I call this one
taken on Crystal Mountain this one occurred on July 14
1985 near a ski resort at Resort in Crystal Mountain
Washington it's a super fascinating case involving a gentleman who had missing
time while hiking on Crystal Mountain and sought out hypnosis and uncovered a
really remarkable onboard UFO encounter this is a single witness case and the
witness is known only as Joseph he wants to remain anonymous and it was a warm
Sunday afternoon around around 2:30 p.m. again on July 14
1985 when Joseph who was a businessman around age 59 and his partner Cassandra
decided to venture to the Crystal Mountain Ski Resort and take the chairlifts to the top so they could take
some photographs of the mountain but when they got there Cassandra hurt her ankle and it turned
out that the lower miners Basin chairlift wasn't running so Joseph decided that he was
going to hike up alone to the upper Iceberg Ridge lift and then take
photographs from the summit house so he left Cassandra at the lodge and began
his hike and he had no sooner left when suddenly the next thing he remembers is
waking up and he's now lying face down on Powder pass which is about 2,000 ft
above the point where he had had began begun his hike and in fact he was now
about A4 Mile East of the summit house so quite a distance from where he had
just been and as Joseph says in his own words I was panting like a steam engine
I was petrified I had no recollection of how I'd gotten there I was emotionally
drained I don't know how I got there but I was up there on those
rocks so Joseph says he couldn't have hiked there there was no way he was very
lightly dressed he was he says in poor physical condition looking at his street
shoes which weren't for hiking they weren't scuffed at all he was very
disoriented somewhat sore and he stumbled back down to the lodge met up with his partner
Cassandra uh he said he got there around 4:30 p.m. so he was missing about 2
hours and she could immediately tell that something very strange had happened to
Joseph and in fact in the days that followed Joseph was still somewhat
traumatized upon getting home they found what looked like five quote needle marks
on his back but they very quickly healed and faded away but as Cassandra says in
her own words he would jump at every little noise like the telephone ringing he's
never shed more More Tears he didn't leave the apartment for a couple of days
he didn't want to be alone and as Joseph says in his own words it was the first
time in my life that I didn't have control over an event so yeah this was quite difficult
for them the aftermath but after doing some research on cases involving missing
time Joseph wondered if this was connected to a UFO encounter and decided to seek out hypnotherapy he contacted
researcher and hypnotherapist Fred Rance who's a very
experienced and well-regarded hypnotist and Fred placed Joseph under
hypnosis the sessions were successful in recovering the memory of the lost time
and no surprise Joseph remembered being taken on board a large craft and as
Joseph says it the craft was about 200 to 300 ft in diameter and was Blue the
undersurface was it had no lights on it her Joseph this craft hovered nearly
above him at a very low altitude and the next thing he knew he was on board and
again as Joseph says in his own words I don't remember how I got into the ship I
understand they can levitate you but anyhow the next thing I remember the only only thing I remember was I was in
a White hospital bed and there were around 25 or 30 figures around me and
they were diffused you couldn't see their features but they were humanoid it
wasn't like ET they were blurry they were grayish green
humanoids so his memory of the whole event is pretty sketchy he does believe
he was being examined and in fact while under hypnosis he learned how he was
taken on board he says that he was taken into the larger craft via a smaller
craft a little two-seater type vehicle with a glass Dome on top he says it
carried him up into the larger craft through an opening in the center of the
underside and once inside the larger craft he saw a window along the wall to
the outside said it was very much like being inside of an airliner like many witnesses he said this room
was curved he recalls being placed on a weird chair and then on his back on a
table he said the beings who never really got a good look at surrounded him and were looking down at him he did see
one of them pouring liquid out of a beaker type instrument and at some point
he said he was flipped over onto his stomach and examined and after being examined he was then placed back into
the smaller sort of car-sized craft which exited the larger craft and he was
then placed on the ground where he woke up so a pretty short and standard
onboard encounter but certainly very interesting and that he saw about 30
different beings that is not super common but
after being hypnotized was a short time later he saw what he believes is the same craft again this time hovering
above the Seattle trust building not too far from his apartment and it was just a
few days later on the evening of August 21st he looked outside of his window and
boom there was that craft again zooming across the Horizon so a very interesting case which
was also researched by UFO investigator Dale gy who said that Joseph's account
was quot quot very convincing and no surprise that Joseph
himself believes that he was in fact taken on board the UFO as he says and I
quote there's no doubt that this happened I think you'll agree that's a
super interesting case uh and like we see in many of these onboard experiences
there were followup UFO encounters it's just not a singular
event in most of these cases and clearly this did affect the
witness very profoundly I think that's pretty much standard when people have
these really close encounters I can only imagine what it's like for these people
to be taken on board and I'm sure it's far more common again than most people
realize certainly more than the general public has any idea there are just so
many cases and here's another one which is perhaps for me the most interesting
of this little collection in this episode I call this one taken in the
Yukon it's a super interesting case which occurred on September 3rd 1987 of
course in Yukon Canada along a very remote Highway in the wilderness
involving a gentleman who was on his motorcycle when he saw a UFO and then
saw ETS PR mantis type which is quite
unusual and as we shall see he had a really remarkable onboard encounter
which he didn't remember at first he did actually have missing time but immediately afterwards the onboard
segment came back to him spontaneously without the use of hypnosis and I think you'll find it
super interesting because it's got some elements to it that are quite rare perhaps not unique but not often
described this very interesting case was investigated by researcher Martin JC and
involves a young man by the name of Kevin so he wants to remain anonymous
but Martin interviewed the witness thoroughly and calls him a quote very honest sincere and reserved individual
not at all the type looking for attention so Kevin's encounter began
early in the morning of September 3rd 1987 when he got on his motorcycle and
was going to join some friends to go hunting and he was driving toward mcass
in the Yukon along this remote Highway and at some point during his trip he
pulled over to relieve himself it's still early morning and that was when he saw a strange craft very low in the sky
he thought at first it might be a plane but it made no noise there was no wings or tail and it became immediately
apparent to him that this was not a plane and as Kevin says in his own words
it had what looked like a port hole all along the side of it it was cigar shaped with a gray strip
down the middle and a dark green on top and
bottom as I watched it seemed to partially dematerialize and then return
to solid form it it did this as it was moving a couple of times and then it
dawned on me oh I don't think I should be seeing this it's a UFO and probably
doesn't want to be seen I crouched down on the road hiding behind the roadside
grass I then watched it go behind a con shaped Hill and not come out I stood up
looking for it and feeling very excited and happy about what I saw and thinking
they didn't even know they were being watched Now Kevin did notice one other
strange detail as he says when I was watching the UFO move slowly in front of
me I thought I better get a picture of this my camera was just inside my jacket
and my shirt pocket and was very quick and easy to get at then a sort of
calming feeling came over me and I felt like it's no big deal don't worry about
it I don't have to have a picture afterwards I thought what
bizarre behavior I kept two cameras on the go all the time and I was always on
the lookout for photo opportunities to think a UFO photo is not important is
insane so I found that detail very interesting it's certainly one I've heard many times and it's pretty funny
that Kevin didn't think that the ETS or the people inside this craft knew that
he was watching them because after what happened next it became clear that sure
they did they knew they were being observed and we're about in fact to take this gentleman Kevin on board but Kevin
at this point thought his encounter was over then he heard this weird metallic
clunking sound behind him he first thought it was a car door that someone else had approached and he was excited
because he wanted to share his story and see if these people saw it too but turning around or walking towards this
the source of this sound he saw not another person but in fact two
ETS and I'll just let Kevin describe them in his own words because he gives a
very detailed description of what happened next as Kevin says and I quote
I came face to face about 20 years yards with two gray creatures in blue
jumpsuits about 5 ft tall with big insect looking heads pointy faces big
eyes thin arms bodies and legs I immediately thought they're not Little
Green Men they're grasshopper people before this all I knew about aliens was
that they were supposed to be Little Green Men at that same instant the one
on the left raised his left hand to his wrist which held some type of flashlight
device and I saw a bright flash of light come from it I instantly felt paralyzed
and was convinced time had stopped everything was black no sound I tried to
yell no but all that came out was a distorted grunt when the being shot me with this
flashlight device I experienced what they call the cone of silence
it seemed like time Stood Still and nothing existed but me like I was pulled
from reality it was the most absolute quiet ever imagined I was really scared
and tried to yell no but all that came out was a gnarly growl everything went
dark and I had the sensation of hurdling Skyward at terrific speed I also felt
that I was being stretched as if my feet were on the ground ground and my upper body was 20 ft above my whole body was
shooting Skyward the next thing I knew I was standing on the side of the road
scared shaking and Confused within seconds I remembered all
of this that had just taken place and I thought I'm getting out of here before
they get me again I turned around to get my bike and for some reason it was not
there then I noticed it was on the other side of the road I said to myself what
the hell is this I didn't put it there still panicking I rushed over and got on
it and realized the keys were gone this was weird because he didn't
move the keys and this is when he realized that the keys to his motorbike were in fact in his hand he jumped on
his motorbike and immediately drove off and this is when he noticed something
very strange it was no longer morning and in fact before a half hour had
passed Darkness fell so he was very confused by this this is quite a long
period of missing time and he told himself and again I quote I'm not telling anybody about this I'll just
forget the whole thing so he drove straight to his trailer put on a pot of coffee and as
he's doing this suddenly he heard a soft humming noise coming from
outside and he was pretty sure this was the same UFO he purposefully did not
look outside did not look out the window he just sat down and drank his coffee
and this is when he started to get very Vivid flashbacks and memories of what
happened to him during this missing time and in fact he had a very clear memory
of looking down and seeing the landscape below him flashing by at a very high
rate of speed he then remembered waking up and finding himself looking into the
eyes of a gray alien not sort of the praying mantis that he saw on the ground
but your typical gray ET and I will just quote Kevin here at
length because boy he describes a very interesting onboard encounter as Kevin says in his own
words I could hear in my mind a voice saying there is nothing to worry about I
could hear him talking in my mind there were three or four of these types walking around but only one talked to me
the two I saw earlier on the road I never saw again I then sat up and had an
idea of what might be going on and I asked are you going to do experiments on
me and the one said they've already been done I felt really good then because
except for a strange sensation in my hands everything felt normal I kept
rubbing my hands together but did not look at them as there was a totally strange environment to look at
instead I experienced no discomfort the being nearest me asked me if I would
like to see my home planet and I said sure I then walked over to the window
where there was a machine that looked like a big copy machine he asked me not to touch it I replied
don't worry I'm not touching anything in here he then said that bright white star
is your home I didn't know anything about astronomy at that time but I always thought Earth was blue so right
away I thought he's lying he also explained to me about space and stars Etc but I can't remember
any of it now I was also asked if I would like to go on a trip
I replied not yet I felt very honored to be asked and I did want to go but felt
that the time was not right then I was told I would have to forget all of this
I was disappointed at hearing this the first far part of the experience was
very scary but once I was with them I found them to be friendly helpful and
their looks didn't bother me they actually seemed like old old friends
they gave me a clear glass 34s full with a yellow liquid and said to drink it up
it would make me forget everything I told them I did not want to forget an
experience like this it should be remembered I was told it was for my own
good that I forget so I took three little sips and put the glass down next
thing I know I'm on the road by my bike scared to death and wanting to get out
of there so that's his encounter in a
nutshell when he got home when Kevin got home he did notice a strange sensation
is in his hands and looked down and saw a small scoop mark on each Palm they
persisted and he later asked several medical professionals about them two doctors and four
nurses and none of them could explain it they said they'd never seen anything quite like it couldn't attribute to any
condition but as Kevin says I still have them Kevin did feel the desire to share
his story but at the same time he was reluctant not so much because of fear of
ridicule but because as he says every time I tell someone I feel like I just
broke a promise I made to them that I wouldn't tell anybody this feeling feeling may just be
me or may be programmed into me to keep quiet I don't know I decided to tell it
as more of an awareness thing I'm sure other people have had experiences but
are held back so there you go another fascinating case involving multiple
different types of ets a gentleman being given a liquid to consume that's not
very common very interesting how they showed him the Earth from a far far
distance away I have heard that many times it's just a fascinating case all
around so those are the five cases I wanted to present today again it shows
this is a worldwide phenomena one that's ongoing cases from the 50s to the 1980s
and of course they reach back further than that and continue on forward through time this is just a tiny little
glimpse into the huge number of cases of people who have been taken on board a
craft I've come to know for certain that the vast majority of people do not report this kind of experience
particularly because it's so extensive and they are afraid of ridicule and disbelief and will even keep it secret
from their own family and friends thankfully this attitude is changing the
subject is moving into the moon mainstream and it's being taken a lot more seriously it's about time it's way
past time I think it's a very important subject we have a lot to learn from these ETS I don't think we have anything
to fear from them honestly in my opinion it's the own people our own people here
on Earth the folks behind the government cover up who are the ones we should be
concerned about that's just my personal opinion but I think I've got some good reasons for it at any rate I really want
to thank you for watching I hope you found it interesting and maybe even learn something and I want to thank you
very much for for watching it's truly appreciated until next time keep searching for
answers keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun
until next time bye now.
