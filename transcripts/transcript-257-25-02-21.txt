UFOS IN THE ARCTICE: 25 TRUE CASES
Feb 21, 2025

Summary:
Feb 21, 2025
The Arctic has always been a place of mystery and wonder. The magical Northern Lights, a rich wildlife of polar bears, seals, foxes and more, surviving in one of the most inhospitable locations on our planet, continue to capture our imagination. Speculation and conspiracies about the Arctic abound. But what is the truth? Have UFOs been seen there? The answer of course is yes! The Arctic Circle is 9,900 miles in circumference. Only 8 countries are located within this area, and yet it encompasses about 7.7 million miles. It also has a rich, varied history of UFO encounters reaching back to 1850 continuing up to the current day. This video presents 25 of the best-verified and most fascinating accounts from the Arctic Circle.  These cases involve sightings, landings, humanoids and even an apparent UFO crash!

TWO UNKNOWN OBJECTS. In 1850, the crew of a ship sailing the Wellington Channel observed a mysterious glowing object.

AN EERIE EVENT. In 1912, the Russian Ship, Saint Anna became icebound in the Arctic for two years. On November 8, 1913, they had a remarkable sighting of a red glowing object.

ESKIMO VILLAGE DISAPPEARS. In 1930, trapper Joe Labelle went to Lake Angikuni, Canada to trade with the local village, only to find that everyone was gone. But where did they go?

THE WATCHING GLOBES. During WWII, four ships in a convoy in the Norwegian Sea had an extensive encounter with weird glowing objects.
 
PROJECT PTARMIGAN. Researcher Lt. Col. Wendelle Stevens reveals that during his work in Alaska with Project Ptarmigan, many officers had incredible encounters with UFOs.

“IT WAS OBSERVED BY THE ENTIRE POPULATION.” In August 1950, resident of an arctic village and Russian aviators observe glowing discs in the sky for three days in a row.

THE SPITSBERGEN ISLAND UFO CRASH. In May 1952, a disc with UFO occupants allegedly crashed on the remote Spitsbergen Island.

UFO TRACKED ON THEODOLITE. On June 26, 1952, weather observers on Padloping Island track a UFO for five minutes.

“YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT.” On April 29, 1952, navy pilots at Thule, Greenland observe three UFOs investigating a skyhook weather balloon.

A STRANGE OBJECT. In February 1953, the crew and passengers of a WV-2 Super Constellation observe a UFO over Thule, Greenland.

THIRD THULE SIGHTING. On December 9, 1953, three Navy flights over Thule, Greenland observe a strange craft near their jets.

UNIDENTIFIED. On August 29, 1954, the crew and passengers of a Dutch Airlines DC-4 see a fleet of dark objects near Prince Christian, Greenland.

SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL. In 1956, two Russian pilots of a TU-4 aircraft have an extensive sighting of a pearly disc-shaped object pacing their plane.

EXTREME ALTITUDE ARCTIC OBJECT. In November 1958, a US radar station detects an object hovering above the Arctic Circle.

A DISC LANDS AT UMIAT. In 1958-1959 a wave of sightings in the Arctic Circle caused concern within Finland and the Soviet Union. One case involved a landing at Umiat, Alaska.

NOTHING ON EARTH. On March 16, 1961, the crew of the USS Glacier observed “strange luminous aerial phenomenon.”

A PEARL-COLORED DISC. In February 1967, pilots over Tiksi, Siberia saw a pearl-colored disc-shaped craft overtake their plane.

DISCONCERTINGLY CAPTIVATING, DEEPLY PROVOCATIVE, UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. On August 22, 1967, Soviet journalist Alfred Tulchensky had a closeup sighting of a metallic disc over the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia.

AN EXTRAORDINARY THING HAPPENED TO ME ON MY WAY TO THE NORTH POLE. On March 1, 1968, while flying over the Arctic Circle, reporter Sally Remaley and others saw a group of six craft landed on the frozen tundra.

ESKIMOS OBSERVE UFO LANDING. On August 16-17, 1972 a wave of sightings occurred over St. Michael, Alaska, including a UFO landing.

ARCTIC OCEAN UFO. On October 16, 1976, the crew of a small boat in the Arctic Sea had a close-up encounter with a glowing disc.

AN EERIE APPEARANCE. On October 22, 1980, a Soviet Air Force Pilot saw a huge metallic disc-shaped craft which disabled his aircraft.

CAUGHT ON RADAR. On January 5, 1981, observers at Thule Air Base in Greenland observed a UFO which is also caught on radar.

ARCTIC HUMANOID. In 1982 (approx.,) two men at an airbase in Greenland saw a humanoid. One was taken onboard a craft and given a vital message for all humanity.

WE ALL GOT REAL QUIET. On February 22, 1997, four people in Aklavic, Canada are paced in their car by two metallic craft.

WE’RE USED TO IT. For two weeks in December 2002, UFOs appeared so regularly over Noorvik, Alaska that residents saw them nightly.

These 25 cases are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to UFOs seen within the Arctic Circle. Cases likely number in the thousands. Because the Arctic is so remote and uninhabited, most activity likely goes unobserved by human eyes. There are now enough cases to prove that UFOs and ETs are visiting the Arctic.

Feb 21, 2025
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal
today I'm going to do something a little bit different today's episode is called UFOs in the Arctic I've had a few of you
request this I've been wanting to research it for a long time but it's an enormous research project well I finally
finished and wow I found some amazing stuff about UFOs in the Arctic before I
dive into it let let me tell you just a little bit about the Arctic I've confined the cases in this episode to
events that occurred within the Arctic Circle this is a pretty big area though
the Arctic Circle is about 99,900 miles in circumference it
encompasses an area of approximately 7.7 million square miles that's around 4% of
the Earth's surface so it's pretty big the location of the Arctic Circle is
approximately at 66.5 De north latitude and are only eight countries
this surprised me only eight countries that are situated within the Arctic
Circle that includes Russia Finland Sweden Norway Canada the United States
specifically part of Alaska Greenland and a small part of Iceland so really
not nearly as many as I thought still it's amazing how many cases have taken
place there what's really interesting about the North Pole of of
course with its location the sun does not set there on the summer solstice or
rise on the winter solstice it stays there for just one day it's a really
interesting location it gets the least amount of sunlight of any location on the earth except of course the South
Pole let's not confuse this with Antarctica I'm only focusing on the
Arctic in this episode there are of course all kinds of strange Mysteries
and conspiracies that abound about the Arctic I'm not really going to go into
all that I really prefer to stick to cases that are very much factual and well documented of course the Arctic is
very well known for the Aurora Borealis really beautiful uh compasses go crazy over the
Arctic that's another really interesting facet to all of this another weird
mystery that I'm not really going to go into but certainly well known among scientists are called palas These are
warm lakes that are not Frozen not perfectly understood but apparently
there are some reasons whether it's currents or geothermic areas that keep
these Lakes warm of course there's the whole Admiral Bird Story which which I'm not going to
go into that would take an entire episode just to cover but don't want you
to think that I'm ignoring it because yeah we all know about Admiral bird and his trips to the Arctic there's also an
interesting aspect to all of this in terms of the little people that are
present in all cultures on this planet and that of course includes the eskimos I was looking into that because there's
quite a few reports of that that would take another whole episode so I'm not
really going to cover that either but I will mention that these little people that the eskimos do see have all kinds
of amazing Powers supposedly they can transform themselves have superum
strength there's a few cases that link them to UFOs and ETS but yeah that's
just another subject that's far too complicated for this episode which is
already going to be quite long because I found about 25
really well verified cases that's what I want to cover today these reach back all
the way to 1850 up to pretty much the present day and not just sightings but Landings
humanoids one possible UFO crash it's quite controversial but it's certainly
pretty well known within the UFO community so yeah lots of cases let's explore UFOs in the Arctic and the first
case I want to talk about I call two unknown objects this goes all the way
back to 1850 this is an event that occurred in the Wellington Channel and it's a really
interesting and early case of UFOs in the Arctic in 1845 the two ships HMS herbis and HMS
Terror which were manned by Sir John Franklin were last seen heading into the Davis Strait heading into the Arctic
Circle and they were never seen again they promptly disappeared later dozens
of expeditions were sent to locate these ships which were eventually found one of
these Expeditions was the US grenell which was headed by Captain de Haven
this was in 1850 they set out in hopes of finding the lost crew they were unsuccessful however on September 15
1850 they did have what may be the first recorded UFO sighting in the Arctic
among the crew was Elijah Kent Kain and here is his firsthand testimony of this
very early UFO sighting as Elijah says this afternoon a large spheroidal mass
was seen floating in the air at an unknown distance to the north it undulated for a while over the IC lined
Horizon of Wellington Channel and after a little while another smaller than the
first became visible a short distance below it they receded With the Wind from
the Southward and East Eastward but did not disappear for some time so these
objects were not very large they couldn't tell exactly but looked like just a few feet the one of them was
longer than it was wide at any rate Captain Edwin Jesse de Haven thought it
might be a kite but that explanation was disregarded as who would be flying a kite in a remote area of the Arctic now
Elijah considered the possibility that it was a balloon sent aoft by the crew
of the Lost ships in order to Signal the grenell but no crew was found so that
doesn't seem likely and as Elijah says the incident interested us much at the
time and I have not seen anything in the published journals of the English Searchers that explains it so that's a
pretty interesting case I don't think that was a balloon of course really hard to say that was quite some time ago but
this case also shows what a dangerous and treacherous place the Arctic is as
does this next case which involves an icebound ship actually bought the book
on this case recently uh this one is quite brief but it's certainly an interesting event I
call this case an eerie event this occurred in 1912 and I think you'll find it pretty
interesting in 1912 the Russian ship St Anna which you can see here became
icebound north of the the France Joseph islands in the Arctic they remained
stuck for a full 2 years until finally deciding to abandon the ship and take a
200m sled and kayak Journey back to civilization now one of the crew members
was Valerian albanov who ended up writing a book about his Adventure called in the land of white death of
Interest here is an apparent UFO sighting which took place on November 8th
1913 and as Val Ian writes on November 8th an eerie event occurs or seems to
occur at 5:00 at night we saw some kind of red star that was moving to the
Northeast at first we thought that someone was approaching everyone ran out on Deck but no one was there no more
information on that case but certainly interesting there you go another very early UFO event long before the Modern
Age of UFOs whatever that quote red star was it certainly doesn't sound like a
natural astronomical phenomenon again very hard to say it's over a hundred
years ago but certainly an interesting case now I want to move to another event
which is perhaps only peripherally related to UFOs it's not completely
verified either but it's certainly a well-known Arctic mystery that I think
deserves mention I call this one ES esimo Village disappears this occurred
in 1930 at anjikuni Lake this is in nevat Canada within the Arctic Circle and yeah
this is an event which has gotten a lot of press attention over the years and has never been solved and could very
well be UFO ET related this controversial story has been disputed
but never fully debunked it comes from a Trapper and Hunter by the name of Joe label you can see him here
he says that each year he would go into Inuit territory to trade and sell furs
he often worked with the small village of Inuits about 2530 residents who lived
at anjikuni Lake one day in 1930 he arrived at the lake to find this
settlement completely abandoned now the evidence showed that the evacuation must
have happened quickly because as he searched the structures he found that Provisions were still in the pantries
guns were still in the homes some tables were actually set for lunch it looked like food was sitting in pots on the
stoves and as Joe says the whole thing looked as if it had been left just that
way by people who expected to come back but they hadn't come back I went outside
and looked over the rest of the camp I tell you I was puzzled I tried to figure out where these Eskimos had gone to they
hadn't moved to another territory or they would have taken their equipment I stayed around all afternoon trying to
figure things out there were no signs of any struggle everything looked peaceful
so we ended up calling the Northwest Mounted Police and an investigation began no Footprints were found dogs that
had been tied up had perished strangest of all was that in the Inuit Cemetery
one of the graves had the body removed of course surrounding villagers were
questioned Joe Lael questioned them personally but none had any information
and that's really all the original article mentions on this case pretty much all the information apparently
comes from this one article but later accounts apparently expanded on this not
sure if they're making it up or not but apparently a huge storm had struck the area According to some sources a
brilliant green light was seen coming down from the sky over the Inuit Village
um some of the villagers thought it was the a Borealis others said no they had seen a
solid object apparently the police allegedly had a report from a hunter who
said that he had seen a solid object moving towards this area around the time
of The Disappearance of these eskimos so over the years this story has been told
and retold in various books some of who did clearly exaggerate the account or
wrote contradictory details it all originates from this one article by EMT
kellerer which was published on November 29 1930 researchers have looked into this
to try to verify it there's no hard evidence proving this story but again neither has anyone been able to disprove
it and now nearly 100 years later it remains unsolved nobody knows exactly
what happened to this small village of Eskimos how weird is that it would be
amazing to know the truth what happened to that little Eskimo V Village certainly does seem to be a mystery
which has persisted all these years so hopefully one day we'll get some answers
about that but I don't see that coming anytime soon now let's move to the next
case this is certainly one of my favorite in this compilation very well
verified so unusual I call this one the watching Globes this occurred some point
during World War II the exact date is is not known somewhere in March between
1939 and 1945 I'm guessing somewhere in the midpoint of that
4344 I couldn't determine the exact date but multiple Witnesses very well
verified so mysterious I think you'll find this one really interesting this very well verified and extremely
intriguing case comes from Naval historian William G Schofield he wrote
about it in his book Eastward the convoys which you can see here it's recounted in chapter 15 which is titled
weird and unknown it's appropriate because this is weird and unknown the
crew of a Navy ship was in the Norwegian sea heading to Iceland and Circumstances
had actually forced them far north of their planned course into the Arctic Circle this was a four ship Convoy was
just after midnight one March evening again sometime during World War II when
when four large balls of light appeared overhead as the witness says suddenly
they were there four identical balls of light appearing abruptly overhead in
about the same relative position as the four ships in formation below they
looked cold and white they did not glisten or Sparkle or gleam they just hung there in the sky like pale white
watching Globes I was on the bridge at the time wearing the battle phones and I
heard several Lookout Gunners starting to call in at once we watched them in wary silence they stayed with us hanging
poised and Cold against the Blackness overhead so it was impossible for the witnesses to say how high these glowing
spheres were without actually knowing the size but it was clear to them it wasn't ball lightning which moves IR
radically or St Elmo's Fire which appears next to the Mast of the ship and
furthermore both of these phenomena are quite short-lived and these Balls of Fire were just staying up there so
concerned the captain of the lead Commodore ship ordered a sudden 45°
course change to the north hoping to escape from these lights but as the witness says the strange lights stayed
right along with us maintaining speed and never wavering from their fixed locations so the captains of the other
ships queried as to the nature of the lights and the lead ship responded we do not know hold formation
regard as friendly and as the witness says if they were not friendly at least
they were not hostile they made no move to descend or approach us they simply stayed there hanging in the night sky
ridging above us for a full hour as we sailed on our way through the dark Arctic Waters maintaining our silence
and our speed and our uneasy watchfulness all the time our guns were
held trained on the strange balls of light and all the time we hoped we would not have to shoot at them thankfully
they did not as just before 2: a.m. the light bulbs departed quote all four
moving at once as though on Signal pulling away from their positions to higher and higher altitudes at a speed
that was astonishing and then poised High overhead they streaked off towards
the North and within moments had vanished from sight their departure left us all relieved but shaken who can never
say what force created and controlled the balls of Cold Light That appeared suddenly above our ships we never did
know what they were where they came from what they sought or where they went how
does one explain a thing like that except to point out that it happened at Sea and that the sea contains many
Mysteries and always will very strange undeniably something really unusual
clearly not some natural astronomical phenomena St Elmo's Fire or ball
lightning or anything like that these objects were very clearly under intelligent control so strange and as we
go along we'll see a lot of cases like this the Arctic is definitely being visited for example this next event
which actually includes a number of cases it's quite interesting comes from researcher Wendell Stevens I call this
one project tarigan this is really interesting this occurred sometime in 19
1948 Wendell Stevens is a pioneering researcher and he has something really interesting to say about UFOs in the
Arctic researcher Lieutenant Colonel Wendell Stevens has made Untold
contributions to the UFO field he's written and published many books he writes that his interest in UFOs began
way back in 1948 as a young man when he was assigned to Alaska it was his duty
to brief and debrief the air Crews of project tarmigan whose mission was to photograph every inch of the Arctic
polar regions and as Wendell Stevens says in his own words the crews
occasionally reported strange aircraft that could not be accounted for if they were Russian as some believed then they
certainly had experienced some technical breakthroughs that we were unaware of and based on my previous experience with
the air Intelligence Center I was convinced that there was no Earth Technology capable of producing
producing air vehicles that could fly at thousands of miles per hour and make sharp angle turns at such high speeds
stop and even reverse instantly stand still in the air descend and Ascend
vertically at slow and high speeds and land on the ice and water and even
submerge underwater and emerge again and fly away these reports piqued my
personal curiosity immensely and I had to know more so yeah apparently these
objects were in the Arctic way back in 1948 in Fairly large numbers or were
certainly being observed regularly when I hear reports like that it becomes very
clear that we are not hearing the full story about UFO activity in this area
while I did find a bunch of EP uh events that have occurred in the Arctic I'm pretty sure this is just the tip of the
iceberg literally in this case uh yeah I mean so many cases I suspect you could
easily times the 25 cases I'm presenting here by 100 or even a thousand because
most people again don't report it and it's clear that in a number of these cases there's secrecy and coverups being
imposed upon what's happening here because these are a lot of military
Witnesses who don't have the freedom to talk about their experiences perhaps
like a normal citizen would but here is another interesting
event we're now moving into the Modern Age of UFOs which began in 1947 with the Kenneth Arnold citing over
Mount reneer and of course the Roswell crash and this huge superwave that swept across the United States and the planet
this is when UFOs really started to enter our culture and people were really talking about them and no surprise that
they're appearing over the very high Northern latitudes I call this next case
it was observed by the entire population this is a case which took place in the
USSR August 1950 I'm going to try and pronounce this Village so please forgive me if I garble
this up but it's called n kimsk this is a really interesting case because it's
well verified by a military pilot for Russia and I think you'll find it quite
interesting the main witness in this case is Valentine I catov he's the chief
Navigator of polar Aviation of the administration of civil aviation of the
USSR and he writes that in August of 1950 at 3:30 p.m. a disc-shaped object
appeared over the small Arctic Village of nen kimsk this was three days in a row
always at the same time and as Valentin says it was observed by the entire
population causing great interest especially Among Us the flight Personnel
now at that time many weather balloons were being released by the United States but as Valentine says this disc was not
at all similar to an aerial balloon in color or speed or movement they reported
the sightings to Moscow and were instructed to attempt to intercept them in their aircraft they were able to
reach about 7,000 M 25,000 ft which was the limit of their Catalina aircraft but
they could not reach these objects whatever they were but as Valentin says we noticed that the disc did not change
in dimensions and its movements were very slow from east to west the color was pearl colored with pulsating edges
so finally they saw these objects gain altitude and disappear into the distance
in later Valentin akirov would have a second dramatic encounter while flying
over the Arctic Circle that's a pretty interesting case pretty early on in the history of UFO visitations in our planet
1950 it's clear by that time our governments were perfectly aware that we
are being visited by extraterrestrials so any denials or claims that you know it's all
attributable to hoaxes hallucinations misperceptions and mental illness is absolutely
disingenuous they know and they've known for a very long time and here is another
case which is Extreme extremely controversial because it involves an apparent UFO crash this is the spitsberg
island UFO crash which allegedly occurred in May of
1952 at spitsbergen Island this is off of Norway it's a pretty remote
location uh this is again very controversial there are some who have
absolutely tried to debunk this not successfully I don't think because there's some pretty interesting
verification to it I think there are quite a few UFO crash cases and that we
don't hear at all about the majority of them but this is one that did get some
publicity and the publicity that surrounds it I think points to there's something true going on here but you can
make up your own mind about it pretty much all UFO crash retrieval reports are controversial and this one of course is
no exception allegedly Norwegian air Force personnel were conducting military
exercises when distortions in their radar system at the base in narvik showed strange readings investigation
showed that the source appeared to be coming from the island of spitsbergen so they sent out a crew and reportedly
pilot Olaf Larson was flying over the area with his Squadron when he was the
first to notice a glint of light coming from the jagged Peaks and flying lower and lower he observed the crumpled
remains of what appeared to be 135 to 150 ft wide metallic disc so they
circled it for about an hour looking for signs of life but didn't see any survivors but they could see it was a
craft of some kind so a rescue mission was sent and this is when they found this metallic blue disc now per some of
the reports on this case there was a center transparent Dome and what looked like 46 Jets located around
circumference of this craft and according to some reports there were foreign maybe Russian looking symbols
inside it was believed at first to be Russian but according to later reports
there were in fact seven small humanoid bodies found on board all badly burned
each were just over 4 feet tall very much human looking perfect sets of teeth
One Source says that while a control room was found with buttons and gauges there was no apparent engine at at all
inside the craft which was quite puzzling to researchers also there were no rivets no fuses no bolts the craft
was just all smooth one piece it was believed by researchers that the craft
must use magnetic fields to navigate reportedly they did find some pills and
heavy water on board along with a book like object filled with strange symbols
ultimately authorities said it was not Russian and in fact the Norwegian government alleged ly released a
statement that the craft was quote definitely not of this Earth but shortly
after that a security lid was clamped down over the case and little further
information was forthcoming however Norwegian Air Force
Colonel jard Darnell said and I quote the spitsbergen crash was very rewarding
a misunderstanding developed some time ago when it was stated that the flying disc was probably of so iiet origin it
has this we must State emphatically not been built by any country on Earth the
materials are completely unknown to all experts either not to be found on Earth
or processed by physical or chemical processes unknown to us now he said that
the material was impervious at absolute zero and the highest temperature possible and to every known chemical
treatment he also said and again I quote we must tell the public what we know
about the unknown flying objects a misplaced secret May well one day lead
to a panic and he did say that a report on this case would be made public though
of course this never happened interestingly journalist Dorothy Kil Galan reported on this case apparently
and shortly later died under mysterious circumstances that's a whole other story
still confusion about this case reigns with some calling it a hoax some saying
it's conflated with another possible UFO crash at helgoland and some saying it's the absolute truth but with this
statement from Lieutenant Colonel jernard Darnell there does appear to be some truth to it but then again
researchers have not been able to confirm the identity of this Colonel also interesting is that a Norwegian
Lieutenant by the name of Tillson was apparently assigned to observe the polar area after this incident and he released
a statement that he has seen UFOs in this area many times as he says I have
seen them land and take off three times I noticed then that having landed they
execute a very Speedy rotation around their axis during flight and takeoff or
Landing the brilliant light prevents any view of the events behind this wall of
Brilliance and on or inside the flying object itself so that's that's the
spitsbergen island UFO crash I don't know I think it probably something did
happen there well these UFO crash cases are so interesting but they're also a
little bit infuriating because we don't hear hardly anything about them certainly not in the
mainstream media it's now getting coverage in Congress which is super interesting but where are the bodies
where are the craft show us this evidence because then we could put to rest any
you know Mysteries or confusion about whether or not this is even a real phenomena we still have Skeptics out
there people who are you know scientifically trained saying that no UFOs don't exist I really wonder about
that because anyone who does even a little bit of research into this subject can see that there's something really
profound going on here so those UFO crashes that's another really kind of
Cutting Edge area of UFO research that I think has great potential to change the
way we all think about this subject now let's move on to another case it's just year after year UFOs over
the Arctic these are well verified cases especially this one which I call UFO
tracked on theodolite a theodoly is a telescope attached to a compass it's a
little device that helps observers to sort of triangulate and observe objects
and determine exactly how high they are how large they are in their course across the sky it's used for aircraft
it's used for weather it's used for weather balloons and these sort of things and occasionally for UFOs as in
this case which occurred on June 26 1952 at pad lopen Island just a very
briefcase but super interesting pad loping is a small island on the eastern coast of Canada uninhabited except for a
small weather station you can see it here was there on June 26
1952 that three weather observers had launched a py weather balloon and we're
tracking it with a theodoly again a telescopic instrument and this is when a UFO showed up it was reportedly silver
difficult to determine the shape which was described variously as peculiar pearshaped oblong and flat but it was
seen by the weather observers for a full five minutes now apparently the 1950s was a very busy
time for reports coming in from the Arctic Circle because per the South Wales Echo newspaper they learned that
an American Research Institute unnamed says that in 1953 no less than 126 reports came from
Alaska 103 from Greenland and 187 from elsewhere in the Arctic Circle
how about that that's some 4 100 cases in 1953 alone which allegedly occurred
in the Arctic Circle and what are we hearing maybe one or two of them this is another really strong indication that we
are just seeing the tip of the iceberg here that so much more is going on that we never ever hear about and haven't
heard about to this present day so again this should just be considered a tiny
representative sample of what's going on with UFOs in the Arctic but here's
another case which is really quite astonishing I call this one you're not going to believe it that is a direct
quote from the witness clearly had a very impressive encounter which occurred on August 29
1952 in THU Greenland this is an Airbase
American-owned and uh quite a few cases that have taken place there and this is
one of the first this next setting began when three Navy Patrol planes were out
on a mission of ice reconnaissance they were plotting the locations of icebergs and pack ice for the Navy ships but they
had a secondary Mission which was to support a group of scientists who were conducting Research into cosmic rays
using Skyhook balloons they would send these up with equipment and they would travel up to 100,000 ft elevation and
take scientific measurements it was on August 29 195 2 that Commander Edward p
Stafford he was in charge of these three planes that this incident occurred and
upon return of one of the planes he noticed that one of the pilots a lieutenant John Callahan looked quote
tense and pale so he asked him what the hell's the matter and lieutenant John
Callahan replied you're not going to believe it I'm not even sure I do and I
saw it so this pilot then proceeded to explain that they had been watching the Skyhook
balloons as they normally did when they noticed quote three bright silver discs
which were apparently investigating the scientific package hanging below the balloon in fact they were directly on
top of it The Observers used binoculars and watched these three discs for several minutes when suddenly they
executed a tight left turn and took off at blinding speed upwards and disappearing in seconds now the pilots
who observed this knew that nothing we had could accelerate at that speed at 990,000 FT of altitude and they estimate
that these objects moved in excess of 10,000 mph how amazing is that I mean
with this object moving well in excess of 10,000 miles hour they estimated it could have been twice that clearly not
one of our own clearly not a meteor again really good evidence these are trained observers mind you people who
are very familiar with aircraft very familiar with weather balloons and all the things that are in the sky uh so not
your average citizen just making a observation of something they don't
understand uh these are really good well verified cases and here's another one
which occurred in the same area THU this occurred I mean I call this one a strange object this occurred in February
of 19 53 yeah at THU Greenland it was deep in the heart of the Arctic that
Robert Ripley a factory radar representative was one of more than a dozen passengers on a wv2 Super
Constellation aircraft you can see it here which had in February of 1953 just
taken off from THU Greenland deep in the Arctic when a strange orange-colored
object appeared over the icy wastelands as Robert
says I know there isn't any human habitation out there in those ice Fields
but we all saw that strange light and followed it for some time before it disappeared so this is a relatively
mundane UFO sighting if you can call the observation of an apparent extraterrestrial craft mundane pretty
brief case it's sparse on information but again undeniably something really
unusual now let's move to the next next case which I call a third THU sighting
this occurred on December 9 1953 same area this one is really well
verified because there are three separate groups of witnesses all
military all Pilots incredibly unusual and yeah what's
interesting to me is how the military reacted in this case in terms of their
explanation this case is so amazing on December 9 1953 three flights with a
total of six people observed UFOs at the same time the first flight was piloted
by Captain ww Irwin along with him was radar Observer RM Roberts they were
flying an f94 at 26,000 ft at about 220 knots when both saw what they describ as
an oblong Blue Light which zipped across the sky it went very fast it was visible
for only 2 or 3 seconds this is about 25 miles south of THU the pilots tried to
turn and intercept the object tried to catch it on radar but were unsuccessful it moved too quickly but both officers
believed that this was not a meteor and described it as quote an unidentified flying object now it was moments later
or at the same time that Captain DB zuk and radar Observer RH zegler were also
flying an F 94 they were at 26,000 ft altitude moving at 230 knots and were 20
to 23 M south of THU 2 miles south of the other flight above and they
described this object which again they saw it too as round or oblong a white
light much brighter than the brightest star they said it was dead ahead of their aircraft they tried to intercept
it too catch it on radar but were unsuccessful they estimate that this object was moving at around 1,000 knots
and upon being questioned at the base when they returned they said that they did not believe this object to be a
meteor and meanwhile a third f94 was just 8 mil Northwest of THU piloted by
first lieutenant James n henden and radar Observer Walter o rich and they
apparently saw the same UFO that was seen by the other two flights they had it in view for no more than 7 Seconds as
it flew parallel to their plane about 1 1 and A2 miles away they estimate they
were moving at about 400 knots at 25500 FT altitude and both observers stated
that they did not believe this object to be a meteor later they were interviewed
as were the other Pilots by group intelligence officer Captain Harold R Miller after interviewing the witnesses
he wrote up a report and concluded get this that the officers had seen quote
probably astronomical phenomenon can you believe that calling this a meteor when
all the observers specifically told the investigating officer not a
meteor this just goes to show the lengths that our governments have gone
to to Discount and cover up this subject so much is going on at THU you'd be a
THU to deny it that's just a few s that are going on there I've found quite a
few others but I'm not going to you know go over all of them because it does get
repetitive but it's clear that the THU base has been visited over and over
again so that's an important location Greenland is mostly in the Arctic Circle
so they've had a lot of activity there now let's move to the next case which I
call unidentified this occurred on August 9
1954 at Prince Christian this is again in Greenland this is a very brief case
but I think it's important to include because it's pretty well verified the
witnesses to this next case were the pilot of Dutch Airlines DC4 Mr HG
Gardner and first officer jvd Whitty they were flying over the prince
Christian area this was at 11:00 a.m. daytime on August 29 195 54 when they
saw a formation of large black oval-shaped or lens shaped objects which
actually flew along with them on a parallel course for a full 10 minutes
before suddenly veering to the north and disappearing Air Force officers investigated the case could not explain
it and concluded that the objects were quote unidentified amazing I mean when you're
seeing a fleet of UFOs for a full 10 minutes that's a long time you're
certainly able to have enough time to see that this is something unusual not
conventional it's not a brief sighting and again made by a pilot who's very
familiar with aircraft and astronomical phenomena that's their job so I think they know what they're seeing or in some
cases don't know because these are technically unidentified here's another one that did
get a lot of attention it's been printed up in a number of UFO journals and
newspapers and such I call this one something super natural again a quote
from the witness this occurred in 1956 at Cape jessip in Greenland a
really interesting closeup observation of a UFO yeah a long observation as well
the witness in this case is Valentin I akirov who had seen arctic UFOs in 1950
in that small town nen kimsk he says that in 1956 he and Commander ninov were
conducting strategic ice reconnaissance in their tu4 aircraft over Cape Jessup
in Greenland when and I quote We unexpectedly noticed that some sort of
unknown aircraft whose shape resembled a large lens was moving parallel to our
general course and as Valentin says it was pearl colored with undulating
pulsating edges now knowing that there were many American air bases in this area they at
first assumed it was an advanced military craft from the US they soon entered cloud cover and couldn't see it
but after flying for 40 minutes they came out of the clouds near medzi Island
and still there was that same object says Valentin it was clear ahead and we
again noted this unknown aircraft along our left side deciding to examine the nature of this
object in Greater detail we changed our course sharply and moved to close with
it the unknown aircraft also changed course and flew parallel with us with a
speed equal to ours after 15 to 18 minutes of flight the unknown craft
changed course suddenly it flew ahead of us and departed upward rapidly
disappearing Into the Blue Sky the speed of its departure was so great that this
phenomena appeared to be something Supernatural it's interesting how in this case the pilot called this object
something Supernatural I think honestly that's a bit of a misnomer there aren't you know the laws
of the universe don't get broken when we label something as Supernatural what this indicates is not the laws of the
universe being broken but rather our lack of understanding and knowledge about what's going on here uh ET
technology is is very very Advanced I think that's one of the things pretty much all UFO researchers do agree upon
so it kind of disappoints me that this subject often gets put into that category of occult and Supernatural
really it should be in the science category because something clearly is going on here and with so many cases
it's impossible to deny it really at this point Skeptics have no leg to stand
on there are far too many cases that are extremely well verified here's another
interesting case which is quite brief but I think important I call this extreme altitude Arctic object this
occurred in November 1958 well within the Arctic Circle and
yeah a well verified event according to qos the Center for UFO studies sometime
in early November 1958 a US radar station monitoring the Skies of the Arctic Circle detected an
object hovering at quote an extreme altitude now per the station which is
not identified this object suddenly descended vertically in altitude remained briefly stationary then moved
at 500 knots for a distance of 100 miles then climbed vertically disappearing out
of radar view I always get a little bit angry when people say there's no evidence for UFOs because there's a case
right there radar confirmed something is flying around up there there is evidence
and there's a lot of it again these are not all just sightings because this next case involves a landing I call this one
a disc lands at umat this is in the Arctic Circle this occurred in
1958 59 and it's a really interesting case involving multiple Witnesses this
object coming down and landing on the ground it was late in 1958 and early
1959 that brought a wave of reports of strange objects seen near and within the
Arctic Circle there were observers on the border of Finland and the Soviet
Union who described these objects variously as luminous brilliantly
glowing cigar-shaped and spherical some of which were seen to move vertically up
and down and later in January of 1959 there were press reports that
described these objects as huge spheres disc-shaped and Rocket shaped and that's
not all because according to researcher Lee R munik of Nik cap the national
investigative Committee of aerial phenomena there were sightings from northern Alaska within the Arctic Circle
by a small party about 200 miles east of umat they reported their observation of
a red saucer-shaped object which descended to just a few feet above the ground only about 2 miles
away from them then flew in a tight Circle and moved off into the distance
and according to researcher Lee rmic he learned that officials in the Norwegian
military were apparently aware of several sightings and were speculating that the Arctic region was being
utilized as a base of operations for the UFOs very cool um I think that there are
quite a few cases of Landings we never hear about and yeah that case provides
some really interesting sort of clues that the military of these countries
that are in the Arctic Circle are perfectly aware of the activity that's
going on there here's another really interesting case I call this one nothing
on Earth this occurred around 1960 1961 this is an important case which is
fairly well known within the UFO Community but apparently was badly
misinterpreted or misreported rather uh the witness finally came forth and
cleared things up and described exactly what happened which is not how it was portrayed in a number of
Publications uh about his sighting around 1960 and 1961 Ruben's J Vela was working with the
US Navy's operation deep freeze as a scientific Observer aboard the USS
Glacier which you can see here to explore this area and while they were anchored at Martell Inlet inside
admiralty Bay at King George Island on March 16
1961 according to reubin and I quote we were a witness to a strange luminous
aerial phenomenon resembling a meteorite but which in my opinion should be classed as a true UFO the object I saw
was silent its trajectory nearly horizontal he later elaborated and said
it was multicolored blue white and red and moved quote rather slowly but left a
sort of Tracer in the sky he said it seemed to be a solid object tear-shaped at one point it split into two and then
disappeared very suddenly the entire duration of the sighting was about 10 seconds and he's later quoted as saying
I believe it was much too slow for REM medor also its appearance was out of this world I can think of nothing on
Earth which would reproduce this phenomenon now Rubin was later disappointed to find that researcher
Ivan T Sanderson who wrote a book called invisible residence included Reuben's
account and completely distorted it claiming that the object Ruben saw actually broke through the ice cap and
flew upwards nothing like that ever happened I'm really glad the witness in
that case came forward to correct the mistakes about how his sighting was
misportrayed definitely makes me wonder about the journalistic coverage of this subject
which we know is not only being covered up and not talked about but sometimes
it's just got all the details wrong I saw a post on the internet where someone
asked have there been any sightings in the Arctic and someone had the G to say no there are no well verified sightings
in the Arctic I mean come on again anyone who can do just a little bit of
research knows that there are sightings everywhere on this planet that of course
includes within the Arctic Circle here's another case which I call a pearl
colored disc it's a brief case but I think important it occurred in February
of 1967 this is in tixie in Siberia in the Soviet Union so yeah another really
interesting case it was one day in February of 196 67 that Captain Petrov
and his crew were flying at 25,000 ft above the town of tixi Siberia this is
when they saw what they described as a pearl colored disc it was a craft which
quickly overtook their own plane gained altitude and flew off now per Valentin I
akirov who had two of his own sightings he says quote this disc did not resemble
any existing aircraft and he says that Pilots have often reported sightings in the Arctic Circle but because the
Russian press often discounts them as quote light effects and fearing ridicule
from others the vast majority of Pilots do not report their sightings admittedly
a very brief case but really important because that one provides a very strong
clue or indication that the vast majority of reports coming out of that area never reached the Public's ears
such a shame this world would be a very different place if we all had truth and honesty and transparency with this
subject just not there yet it's one of the reasons why I do this research we
all deserve to know the truth about what's going on now here's a really
interesting case which clearly affected the witness quite profoundly I call this
one disconcertingly captivating deeply provocative utterly incompr
apprehensible that's a direct quote from the witness who you can tell yeah was very much impressed by his sighting
which occurred on August 22nd 1967 in the timer Peninsula this is
again in Siberia this next report comes from Soviet journalist Alfred tensy was
3M on August 22nd 1967 as Alfred was flying with pilot
bogia novikov in an mi8 Convoy helicopter they were flying at a few
thousand feet over the remote Siberian Tundra of the northern timir Peninsula
with the closest town to them the village of chatanga this was hundreds of
miles away and as Alfred says suddenly I noticed a strange dot penetrating my
field of vision and moving not in accordance with any established flight pattern but rather in a perfectly
straight line with Incredible velocity I could no way accurately
determine the distance separating us from this flying object nor could I discern what type of craft it might
possibly be now it was a clear blue sky at this time and the object was casting
a dazzling Reflection from the Sun making it nearly impossible to determine its exact shape in fact Alfred was
trying to determine if this object could be explained as a balloon a satellite or anything conventional
when it suddenly slowed down started to move slower and slower and then as
Alfred says I could not believe what I was seeing it had come to a complete
halt as though rooted to a single spot in the sky and then within a second's
fraction the object changed course by a full 90° and with astonishing speed
literally vanished into the air itself so Alfred immediately grabbed the mic and said did you see that did you see
that or not and the pilot vogia smiled and said quote I saw what I saw and then
again I didn't see because orders are they are not to be seen understand well
as Alfred says and I quote I was far too shocked to understand a thing but he later realized that quote what I had
seen in that Northern Azure sky was unmistakably a UFO an unidentified
flying object or simpler words a flying saucer now vogia later told Alfred that
in his career he had seen many UFOs several involving solid metallic craft
later Alfred had another identical sighting while flying in the Arctic and later in
1969 traveled to the Tiny Village of mesac this is 300 miles from
norilsk and while there he saw on the ground a perfectly circular 30 5 w foot
wide depression completely Barren of growth he was there with a group of other scientists and as Alfred says the
local inhabitants the niny speaking in their chirping bird-like language pointed to the sky leaving the
geologists of the Expedition dumbfounded now in an article titled do
UFOs exist now it can be told which was written by Alfred tensy he writes that
quote all this was so disconcertingly captivating so deeply provocative and so
utterly utterly incomprehensible how amazing is that I mean wow it takes a lot of Courage for
some of these W military witnesses to step forward and talk about UFOs knowing
that there could be serious repercussions to their reputation to
their career so kudos to all these military Witnesses who do find the
courage to come forth and share what they've seen in the Arctic Circle now let's move to the next case
which I think this one has to be my favorite in this whole compilation here it's so interesting very detailed so
unusual I call this an extraordinary thing happened to me on my way to the
North Pole this is a firsthand account from a journalist who was on a flight
over the Arctic when she saw something very unusual this was on March 1st
1968 and it took place in Northern Canada this amazing case comes directly
from the firsthand witness Sally REM who wrote about it in an article titled
luminous objects on Arctic Ice which she wrote for fate magazine her Adventure
began when she was invited to participate in NASA's Aurora expedition of February 29 1965 to March 10
1965 which was organized to measure and observe the polar regions specifically
the Aurora Borealis Sally was invited in her capacity as a journalist and writes
quote I was the only reporter on the second leg of this well-planned expedition was the most exciting
assignment of my journalistic career so they flew across Northern Canada northern Alaska Northern Greenland over
the polar cap these flights typically lasted about about 6 hours most of the
time they flew between 37,000 and 40,000 FT elevation while
they were flying this weather gauge that they had get this showed the outside temperature to be about 60° below zero
on March 1st 1965 Sally and 33 other passengers were
on board the Galileo you can see it here it's a 129 ft conver 990 jet which had
been especially outfitted with cameras and observation windows and all kinds of scientific equipment and survival gear
and on the night in question Sally got up to get a cup of coffee then curled up
back in her seat to continue watching the amazing view of the remote empty and
desolate Frozen ice cap below and the Crystal black sky above and the Aurora
but at some point she looked down to the ground and got an incredible shock and
I'll just quote her at length cuz this is amazing as Sally says in her own words Far Below on the icy surface were
three round glowing lights arranged in a straight line each light was huge all
were the same size and perfectly round they were luminous glowing with an inner
white light completely different from any other thing we had seen in the Arctic the lights were so different in
fact that at first I just stared fascinated trying to memorize everything about them before they disappeared
behind us they were not at all like the lights of any settlement or Village they
were not like lights on a boat ship or any familiar flying craft they looked
like flying saucers landed on the ice and if that's what they were they were huge ones another unusual thing was that
the lights were an equal distance apart I was greatly impressed by their size
these luminous objects whatever they were must each have been as large as several city blocks perhaps even larger
I could hardly believe my eyes so she was absolutely entranced with amazement but finally had the presence of mind to
ask Joe March the official Expedition photographer what are they and his
response was I don't know I really don't know she then asked the scientist in the
seat ahead of her pointed out these objects and his reply was I just don't know some kind of Reflections and Sally
bulked at that explanation and told him you know they're not they're not following along and he replied they
don't look like settlements I don't know what they are by this point the lights were already disappearing behind them
but moments later there were three more as Sally says they were round glowing
white and luminous about the same size as the others but this time instead of
being in a row they were arranged in a triangle so there were three of them and
uh again she could not describe these as being anything similar to lights from a
village or any kind of aircraft that we know but the plane moved along and soon they passed over these lights
too and returning to the base waking up the next morning Sally decided to do
some investigating and she asked several of the members of the Expedition if they had seen the strange lights but nobody
had it was weird the only two who would admit to seeing the lights were the scientist and the photographer that she
had specifically questioned at the time the sighting was taking place as you can
see she sketched them and was amazed to see that their placement formed a kind of Arrow as Sally says what significance
could this strange symbol formed by the lights on the ice have how can we explain the unique formation of the
mystery lights these lights were miles and miles from any any settlement or known life and they were arranged in
geometric patterns we may never know the answer we may never see the strange lights again I do not know what they
were I only know that I saw them a truly amazing sighting I don't know what those
objects were doing way up there on the Frozen north um hanging out uh but they
were clearly very very large objects CU they were seen from a pretty high
altitude and it's also weird that there were only a few Witnesses I suspect that there
were quite a few other Witnesses but that this got covered up cuz let's face it they were there to observe the Aurora
and anything unusual this was a scientific Expedition I am quite confident that
there's more information on this case that we will probably never hear about
but now let's move to the next case cuz there's always another I call this one Eskimos observe UFO landing this is
another really interesting Landing case which occurred on August 16 1972 near Stein Alaska pretty well
verified multiple Witnesses Landing traces I again believe that there is
more information on this case than I was able to find certainly uh so it's a pretty brief report but I think an
important one it was at the small town of St Michael not far from steens Alaska
well above the Arctic Circle that on August 16 1972 Eskimo Scout Sergeant John chimu
and his wife both saw what they described as a football-shaped object they could actually see it had a
window in the front red lights on the front and the rear and as they watched
it moved slowly across the sky and then to their surprise actually landed on the ground and it remained there for a full
5 minutes after which point it took off going to investigate they saw a 3ft wide 2in deep
hole in the ground they could see that the grass inside this hole was
burned now it turned out about 20 other people in the town saw a UFO the next
day but only the chimu of course had seen this Object Land they reported it
to the first Scout Battalion headquarters who did confirm the presence of the landing traces
reportedly took photographs and samples of both the soil and vegetation they
said they would analyze it but the results of this analysis were apparently never released I would love to see the
photos of these Landing traces unfortunately I was not able to find them but they're out there
somewhere man oh man there's so much evidence that we never get to see it's really disappointing and so
frustrating because it this subject should not be covered up the way it is
people should not have to suffer ridicule and disbelief and skepticism
the fear and confusion surrounding this subject the disinformation it's mindblowing how hard
our governments have worked to cover this up don't think they've been successful the truth is coming out cu
here's another case which I call Arctic Ocean UFO another really amazing case
from very credible Witnesses this occurred on October 16
1976 in the Arctic sea in the Arctic Circle and yeah an amazing case
involving a UFO this brief but interesting sighting comes from a crew member of the Mt farella which was
piloted by Skipper H powr and was published in the October 1977 issue of
the Marine Observer was at 11:00 p.m. on October 16
1976 as the main witness decided to visit the Wheelhouse of the boat now
also on board was radio officer Mr G Chrismas now arriving at the Wheelhouse
the skipper pointed out to the witness an unusual object flying across the sky
and told him it had been in view for about 5 minutes so using a pair of binoculars the witness observed this
object close up and as he says and I quote it could be described as a brilliant light traveling at a very high
altitude leaving a a bright v-shaped trail of rays like the sun's Rays from
behind a cloud so as he and the others watched this object descended and then
suddenly reversed its course changing in appearance to quote totally circular it
came lower and closer and they could now see that inside the circle of light was
another circular object much more intense and pulsating with white light
after about 2 minutes of observation this inner circle of light vanished within the outer glow of this object and
the entire object just moved off and Faded from sight how many cases is it going to take before people recognize
that we are being visited that you know we are not alone in this universe and
it's amazing to see all this activity up in an area which is really largely
uninhabited so the vast majority of cases are probably not even observed by
human eyes but here's one that was I call this next case an eerie appearance this
occurred on October 22nd 1980 again in the Arctic Ocean and
Military Witnesses pretty well verified this case comes from respected Soviet
researcher Felix ziggle who reports on the experience of an aviator by the name
of Captain of Vladimir dubov now per Felix zygel on October 22
1980 Captain dub stav was flying over the Arctic Ocean when he saw a circular
object hovering motionless over the ocean's surface and it was huge he said
it appeared to be at least 900 ft in diameter as Felix ziggle says was truly
immense a cone of light protruding downward from it gave it an eerie
appearance but it showed no sign of life now Captain dubov very much intrigued
decided to move closer and as Felix ziggle says then all of his instruments
went haywire he began to lose altitude at that point almost immediately the craft rose vertically at high speed
whoosing by Captain dav's plane leaving a sort of green blue Vapor behind as you
can imagine Captain dubov was stunned he had heard reports from other Arctic
Pilots but this was his first encounter and per Felix zygel the polar region is
the gate through which extraterrestrial ships enter and exit the Earth's gravitational field now per researcher
Robert Barry a similar incident occurred in the same area two months earlier as
he writes a Jet Pilot from the Moscow Air Defense unit was flying over the
Arctic Ocean when he encountered a huge craft similar to the one later seen by dubov the craft engaged in a series of
unbelievable Maneuvers which could not be matched by the Soviet fighter plane
there you go more evidence that we're only seeing just the little bit of what
is going on here so frustrating I suspect that if I were to spend more
time doing research in this area kind of charting every single City that's in the
Arctic Circle I could write an entire book on the cases that have occurred in the Arctic Circle but I've just want to
really um move to other projects because there's so much going on uh but what I'm
saying is that this is an open opportunity for research here this field is crying for good research there's so
much going on that we never hear about here's another really interesting case
which I call caught on radar this occurred on January 5 1981 and is
another case which took place at the THU Air Base in Greenland and provides
absolute confirmation that something unusual is going on at that base for those who say
where's the evidence to prove UFOs this case provides compelling radar
confirmation it is brief but at 12:50 on January 5
1981 Witnesses described a flaming squarish disc which appeared only
briefly before disappearing over the skies near THU Air Force Base lots of
UFOs there but supporting the testimony of the eyewitnesses radar stations at the base
allegedly recorded a quote unidentified flying object which was in the same area
at the same exact time as this visual observation pretty brief report but
certainly important now here's a super interesting case which is kind of secondhand so it's
not super well verified but given who the witness is uh who is reporting on
this I think it's very important because it's none other than Dr Bob Jacobs who
had a very well-known and very well authenticated sighting himself but he's not the actual witness
it's a friend of his this is an amazing case because it does involve a humanoid
and I call this one an Arctic humanoid the exact date is not known in this one
but it's prior to 1982 or thereabouts and again I believe from what I can
understand from the report occurred at THU Air Force Base but yeah this one is
a really interesting case because it echoes what we see in so many reports
where people meet humanoids face to face who have a message for Humanity again
this story is secondhand and the exact date and location are unknown but it is so extraordinary that I think it's
worthy of inclusion because again the witness reporting this is Dr Bob Jacobs a professor from the
University of Wisconsin a former Air Force photographer who is very well known in the UFO Community for having
filmed an apparent UFO incident at Vandenburg Air Force Base now he tells
the story of his friend who is anonymous who was a security man at the Air Force
guarding bomber planes at a US base in Greenland like THU but per Bob Jacobs his friend and
another security guard while on duty spotted a figure of what appeared to be
a woman with long blonde hair standing on a hill about 300 ft away she wore a
blue ski suit her hair was long and flowing but the weird thing was nobody
should have been on that hill in that area which is secured and very close to
this base so one of the security guards went up the hill to investigate and as
he got close he was surprised to see that this figure was taller than a normal person 7 ft tall and it was not a
woman but a man now this strange man proceeded to put his arm around the guard and led him over the hill to the
other side out of sight of Bob Jacob's friend who had remained behind so he
didn't see what was happening but this guard returned to his post a few minutes later and his eyes were all glassy he
looked day AED and he explained to his other co-employee the security guard
that this tall figure was in fact a male an extraterrestrial and had taken him
onto a landed spacecraft it was weird he said because he could hear music playing
in his head as he approached this craft this being was communicating with him that way
telepathically and had a message for him according to the witness this ET said
that we have to stop testing a atomic bombs because we're damaging the atmosphere of our planet so after
telling this extraordinary story both men still outside looked up and saw this
Flying Saucer lift up from behind that hill and disappear up into the sky and
was gone there aren't a whole lot of reports involving humanoids in the Arctic but that's set definitely one of
them and given that this comes from Dr Bob Jacobs I think it's important we
take it seriously uh his friend was clearly very impressed by the sighting and while his friend
didn't see the humanoid directly the other friend did and the message again
is something we hear so often ETS are very very concerned about our use of
nuclear weapons I hope we listen because it's clear that this is a pathway
towards self destruction and that's the last thing any of us
need all right let's move to the next case we're moving forward in time some
these next cases are pretty recent I call this next one we all got real quiet
this occurred on February 22nd 1997 in aklavic Canada and a really
interesting multiple witness case it was early in the morning hours of February 22nd
1997 that Vera Oak a resident of Tuk toy
yaku was driving along the ice Road near the small village of aklavic when she
was followed she says by two UFOs and it's not just her because with her in
the car were her son Grant and three friends Lena kotak and Churchill and
Dorothy woli but as Vera says regarding this object it hovered over the trees
then glided so smoothly down to the snow near the ice Road behind us when it
started moving to the right another one showed up so she described these objects
as silver gray they had a row of Port holes around them and as Vera says the
one in front had four big windows and the light coming out of them was bright blue you could see the one in front real
good I think we panicked and we were kind of scared we weren't about to stop
so this craft actually followed them for about 15 minutes but it disappeared when the road took a turn as Vera says we
expected them to be there but they were gone then we all got real quiet for about 20 minutes I wasn't a believer of
such things but now that I've seen them I'd never underestimate people's words
so Vera can sketch them as you see but as she says I'll never travel again
without my camera next time I'm going to take a picture very interesting that's
not the first time and I suspect it won't be the last that a witness says that from now on
they're going to carry a camera with them wherever they go because you never know when the opportunity is going to
arise to take a picture of a UFO it's one of the reasons we don't
have more photographic evidence because when someone sees a UFO it's quite shocking it's often brief they don't
want to take their eyes off of it nevertheless the photographic evidence
of UFOs is very very extensive people who say there are no photographs graphs and they're all blurry simply have not
done their research there's an enormous amount of photographic evidence and as
you can see in some of these cases people do take photos but we don't get to see them it's
maddening now let's move to the last case in this compilation which I call
we're used to it this occurred over a period of weeks actually from December
2002 to January 2003 in nor viic Alaska
I like this case because activity was so common it was going on for so long that
as the witnesses say they became used to it this became not paranormal or
abnormal or unusual it became part of their daily routine seeing UFOs in this
area within the last two weeks of December 2002 that residents in the town
of norvic Alaska this is a small town of about 600 to 700 residents just above
the Arctic Circle had a series of dramatic UFO sightings said one of the
residents Teresa palick she's a bookkeeper and a rescue coordinator she
says everybody in town saw them it would always be different every time the one
time I saw them really bright was like a tower like a pole with three lights on top of each other in a straight row and
there was another light strobing going from place to place around the three
there was another light on the left side like a glow every night it would be different we've seen them maybe every
night since it started so yeah these sightings continued night after night on
one occasion Teresa received a call from a resident reporting these lights so she decided to call the FAA who confirmed
that they had no known aircraft in the area but did advise her to send out
people to investigate so was around 400 a.m. that she had four snowmobilers go
out to check out these lights which appeared to be hovering over nearby seu this is about 20 mi away but when they
arrived these lights just moved off ahead of them and every attempt to reach them failed because these lights would
always just move off and the sightings just continued as Teresa says a lot of
people were up that night watching the lights they saw the first snow machines coming back to town towards them
when all of a sudden there were more than four lights coming the four guys on the snow machine said that the lights
were following them back to town so these sightings continued so often to
the point that they almost became normal as Teresa says we're sort of getting used to it so we don't even check if
they're still there I understand that somebody has a videotape of it too the local people are calling it a UFO we
don't know what else to call it there you go more evidence that UFOs are
visiting the Arctic Circle so that's 24 25 cases which have taken place near or
around the North Pole so amazing and yeah I didn't include all the cases that
are kind of unverified or very conspiratorial of so-called underground government bases
and I mean some wild stuff people are talking about in the Arctic kind of blew my mind how much disinformation is
surrounding this area I think a lot of this stuff is just not true uh so it was definitely a very
difficult research project to sort out some of the really well verified cases from cases that are just wildly
speculative I will say I did investigate my own case which was secondhand so I
wasn't able to talk to the witness directly but did so through an intermediary who said that he worked at
an underground base in Alaska which was several stories down I don't know that
this is within the Arctic Circle but certainly close to it it's interesting though because according to this witness
he was lying to everybody his whole family about where he worked which he said was in Las Vegas but actually he
would be flown up to Alaska every week and come back on weekends and he said he
worked in an underground base in Alaska where they had three areas of research
one was sensing devices that basically could look through solid walls and roofs
and solid objects another was biological warfare which he said made weapons that
we have look like Child's Play but the third and most interesting to me and important here I think is that they were
working on reverse engineering of ET technology so again this is unverified
secondhand but one of many reports of whistleblowers saying that yeah this is
the subject we take very seriously so with 25 reports again just
the tip of the iceberg you could easily times it by 10 or 100 or probably even a thousand if you think about it because
it's been a long time that UFOs have been visiting the Arctic and with so
many of these Witnesses being military uh I think that there's a lot more that we just don't hear about because of this
really brutal uh coverup that is being perpetrated on all Humanity it's such a
shame it can't go on it's unsustainable this is what I like about the truth you can hide it you can ignore
it you can distort it you can lie about it but you can never ever destroy it
truth is truth and one day or another it's going to come out and I'm glad to
see that we are able to see at least the reports we've got here which are very well verified despite all the weird
conspiracies and wild speculations going on in the Arctic we know for sure that
stuff is going on up there in terms of extraterrestrial visitations so that's it for today UFOs
in the Arctic they're up there I really want to thank you guys for watching I hope you learned something I hope you
found it interesting I certainly did I certainly learned a new few new things about the Arctic that I wasn't aware of
and one is yeah there it's being visited by UFOs and extraterrestrials so thank you so much
for watching I truly appreciate it until next time keep asking those hard
questions keep searching for the truth most important of all keep having fun I
will see you next episode bye for now
