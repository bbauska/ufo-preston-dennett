UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE TEN
Apr 25, 2025

Summary:
Apr 25, 2025
Welcome to Episode Ten of UFOs in Your Hometown. The challenge continues: name any town or city in the world, and I will find a UFO encounter there! This includes sighting, landings, humanoids and onboard encounters. It appears that the UFO occupants are conducting a carefully orchestrated and vigorous publicity campaign, visiting every location on Earth, in an apparent attempt to announce their presence. In this latest installment, we explore four new locations: Slovakia; Covington, Kentucky, Chicago, Illinois and Sarasota, Florida. These four locations alone represent a microcosm of UFO activity, containing enough cases to provide an accurate representation of the UFO phenomenon. There are cases with multiple witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, photographs, radar returns, and more. So come along on a journey that is sure to change the way you feel about UFOs.

SLOVAKIA: In 1944, a physician observed a fleet of 8 UFO. In 1959, Air Force officers and airport employees viewed an object hover over an airfield and was caught on radar. In December 1967, many people in the small village of Myjava saw a UFO appeared directly above the local church. In 1971, three people were taken from their apartment to what they believed to be another planet. Slovakia’s most famous encounter occurred in 1987 when a helicopter crew chased a UFO over the Vranov reservoir. In 1997, the residents of the small town of Milicin were panicked by a very intense wave of encounters. In 1991 and 1992, more sightings were viewed by police and caught on radar. The years of 1993 and 1994 were particularly active, with landings, multiple face-to-face encounters with humanoids and a gentleman whose car was levitated into the sky. In 2005 and 2006, multiple low-level sightings over the Bohunice and Temelin Nuclear power stations caused concern at high levels of government.

COVINGTON, KENTUCKY. In July 1947, residents observed a UFO with landing legs flying at very low elevation over the city. In 1956, a pilot had no less than three encounters. In 1959, police were flooded with calls about a UFO and a strange creature. In 1975, a gentleman in a high-rise building watched a UFO fly around his building. In 1976, a UFO hovered over the suburb, sending down a beam of light. In 1978, people across the city described a glowing green object, and some reported seeing it land. In 1985, police across Covington saw a UFO which was also caught on radar. In 2017, a Covington resident reported an object which hovered for hours, causing a bizarre electromagnetic disturbance in his home.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. Numerous low-level sightings occurred in 1952, including one viewed by police over two radio towers. In 1954, witnesses observed a UFO hover and then land on the shores of Lake Michigan, disgorging a small humanoid. 1954 produced several other cases, including a low-level sighting over an oil refinery. In 1957, policemen saw a UFO hovering directly over a cemetery. 1963 brought sightings of classic UFOs with portholes moving only a few hundred feet overhead and seen by hundreds of people. In 1965, a man walking along the shores of Lake Michigan came upon a landed UFO with a little spaceman standing next to it. Dramatic and widely viewed sightings occurred regularly, in 1966, 1973, 1978-79, and 1988. In 1990, a witness reported a low-level encounter with a craft that caused odd physiological effects. In 1999, a man was visited in his home by a 7-foot-tall mantid.

SARASOTA, FLORIDA. In 1952, a UFO skeptic changed his tune when a UFO zigzagged over his home. In 1953, two men had saw a UFO following several B36 aircraft, and then zoom towards them and hover overhead. In January 1954, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, MacKinley Kantor saw a UFO and took it to the highest levels of government. The years of 1957, 1958 and 1960 brought many undeniable UFO encounters over the city. In 1969, and again in 1976, waves of activity were viewed by many residents who were left with no explanation for what they saw. In 1985, authorities were flooded with calls as a wave of activity occurred over the city, with some seeing an object diving into the bay. In 1995, a pilot and his passenger flying in their Cessna reported a near-collision with a bright glowing object. In 1995, residents of a home on the outskirts of Sarasota discovered a strange glowing stone in their yard, which ended up causing severe repercussions. In 1999 and 2005, witnesses driving through the area saw UFOs at treetop level moving overhead. In 2022, a man not only saw a fleet of 8 disc-shaped objects, he took photographs!

As can be seen, UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen all over this planet. This is important as it reveals that the ETs appear to have an agenda to announce their presence to all humanity. The ETs have done their part to disclose their presence. The rest is up to us!

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. Guess what? It's time for another installment of my ongoing
series, UFOs in Your Hometown. This one is called UFOs in Your Hometown, episode
10. I really love doing these episodes. Thank you guys so much for providing so
many different locations for me to explore. I always learn a lot, not only
geographically speaking, but all these new cases, most of which I've never heard before, and I think most people
haven't heard before. And it really does prove the point that UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen
everywhere. And in each of these locations, I'm finding the full variety of encounters. Simple
sightings, UFO landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids, on board experiences as well.
Lots of humanoids in this episode, so I think you might be happy about that. They're certainly the most interesting.
In my opinion, they are. But yeah, all kinds of UFO cases. I found so many this
time that I was really only able to cover four different locations. So,
thanks you guys for being so patient. Those of you who suggested these locations, which are
Slovakia, really interesting stuff there. Also, Coington,
Kentucky, Chicago, Illinois, and finally Sarasota, Florida. I would have liked to
cover more locations. Usually I cover about eight maybe 10 locations in one
episode, but I found so much going on in each of these locations that I had to
kind of stop there. So I think you'll find this super interesting because each
of these locations not only have all these different types of encounters, but the evidence supporting these cases is
amazing. Of course, lots involve multiple witnesses. In some cases, we're talking hundreds of people seeing these
things. But there's also landing traces. There's physiological effects. There's
animal reactions. There's electromagnetic disturbances. There are alien artifacts. That's always super
interesting. Radar returns, UFO photographs. So, really some really
compelling evidence to support a good number of these cases. And we will today be starting with
Slovakia. I was really interested to find what I could find here. This location comes by the request of two
people, Martina and Loki Jack. So, thank you Martina and Loki Jack. I was really
curious what kind of cases Slovakia would produce and I was really amazed
and impressed because again all different types of encounters some
amazing humanoid encounters on board experiences just so much going on in
Slovakia. I'm including Czechoslovakia and Slovakia together because
essentially they were at one time connected uh and are now adjacent. But I
think you'll find this pretty amazing. I certainly hope so. The earliest case I could find in
Slovakia occurred in April of 1944. This report comes directly from the
witness, a physician, and he reported his experience to Cufos, the Center for
UFO Studies. He says it was late afternoon, again in April of 1944. He
was 20 years old. This was wartime. An artillery fire was going off about 30
kilometers to the west. And as the witness writes, I was standing on a hill
near my home when a round object the color of a dark cloud suddenly grew up
to about 2 feet in diameter traveling from the left towards me on a trajectory
and then getting smaller as if going at an unbelievable speed to my right. The
total time of the sighting was less than a minute. It moved at a steady speed and was followed by another identical image
flowing from the same pathway about 20 seconds later and then another starting
as a pinpoint so that at least five of the objects were visible starting as a
pinpoint then growing and again going on as a pinpoint all identical. I cannot be
sure how many there were. If I saw them from the first one, which I think I did, there were seven of them, possibly
eight. I dismissed it as an optical illusion, although this explanation
bothered me right there and then. As a 20-year-old would, I suppose I did not
tell anyone about it, being afraid of ridicule. I suppose that I was one of
several or many people who cited it. Lots of Soviet soldiers must have been
looking in the same direction, and the peasants east of the front were sewing in the field, but nobody spoke of it
that I heard. So that's a strange encounter. He saw these small, dark
objects going off at very high speed, pretty low to the ground, one after
another. Hard to say what exactly those were, but it certainly impressed him.
Now, here's another one from 1944, and this is technically not a UFO encounter,
but could possibly be related. This is a discovery that was made in 1944 during
World War II by Tony Horak. He's a Czechoslovakian soldier, and he had
taken refuge in a cave in the Tatra Mountains of Slovakia. This is now quite famous.
Reportedly at the back of this cave, he found this huge black artificial steel
metal looking wall, 27 feet high, 20 ft wide, curved, totally smooth. Ted
Phillips, best known for doing studies on UFO landing traces, investigated this
case in depth, actually traveled to the location and studied it. He says, and I
quote, "It looked almost like a looking in a mirror of steel, totally smooth, no
seams, no rivets, a huge structure shaped like a fat crescent moon with 7
ft thick walls that extended up beyond the light of his torches." So, there's quite a bit
written about this. This cave is allegedly in a very remote location. Uh,
some people have tried to find it and not been able to find it. But by all accounts, it's totally real. Nobody
knows what this structure is. It's very old, apparently, because they did find
the skeleton of a cave bear right beneath it. So, who knows? This could be
an ancient structure of some kind, indicating that there were advanced civilizations far before ours. But I
think it deserves more studies before we can really form any solid conclusions.
But certainly very interesting. Now we move to another case. November 16,
1959. It was around 8:00 p.m. as a former fighter pilot and Air Force commander by the name of Mr. Duchon and
another Air Force officer, Mr. Bzac, were driving to an unnamed airfield in
Czechoslovakia. They were about 10 kilometers from their destination when their car mysteriously stalled. So, of
course, they got out to investigate and both men immediately saw this strange object racing across the sky. They said
it glowed this sapphire green color. It moved much faster than a jet and in
perfect silence heading directly towards the airfield where they were going to.
Now, once out of view, their car worked fine. So, they had the impression that
whatever this object was, it was responsible for their car stalling. They
arrived at the airfield shortly later and they learned that at 8:05, this is
just 5 minutes after their encounter. The people at the airfield also saw this
object appear overhead, rotate, make a 90° turn, then return back over the
airfield. This object did appear on radar, which showed an altitude of about 1,000 m, 3,000 ft. They said it was
about twice the size of a bomber aircraft, so quite large. There was an airplane ready to go on the runway, but
it became nonfunctional. At this point, anti-aircraft gun officers and control
tower staff all observed the object through binoculars and could clearly discern that this was a discshaped
object. And they estimated it was about 150 m in diameter or 450 ft. Quite
large. Now attempts were made to communicate with this object via radio
in the International Aviation Code. No response. They tried different languages
including Russian and English, but no, whoever was in this disc did not respond. And this entire sighting lasted
about 2 minutes. But it's a very well-verified, widely viewed case and
one of many, many of UFOs seen over airports. In fact, I did a previous
episode focusing solely on cases of UFOs over airports, and that one wasn't in
that episode. It's another addition to this type of case. All right, moving along. Eight years later, December
1967. This report is so interesting. It comes from Janet S. Pock, PhD. She's an
anthropologist from William Patterson College in Wayne, New Jersey. And way back in 1971, she was conducting live
fieldwork in the Czech Republic for her college dissertation. And while she was doing
this, she met someone from a very isolated small village in the Mjava foothills of western Slovakia. And they
had an amazing story to tell her. They told her that one evening in December of
1967, she this witness saw an object come over from a nearby hill. It swooped
down at a low elevation and hovered in complete silence just a few hundred feet
above the village's 300year-old church. And while it was hovering there, it
rotated and tilted forward, which allowed the witness to see that this was a classic flying saucer, gray, metallic,
had glowing port holes around the perimeter, a dome structure on top. And
when this object appeared, dogs in the area started barking furiously, and this
brought brought out all the people within hearing distance to see this
object as well. This object tilted back and forth a few times and then suddenly took off at very
rapid speed. Now, Janet was able to interview several of the witnesses, each
of who confirmed these same details. A really interesting case. Next case I'd
like to talk about occurred on New Year's Day, January 1st, 1971. This case comes from researcher
Dr. Milos Jasenski. He's contributed quite a lot of cases in Slovakia.
There's not much detail to this one, but it's certainly a very interesting account. The anonymous witness reports
that she, her cat, and her friend were all spontaneously and suddenly pulled
through the window of her apartment in Kosis, Slovakia, and into a UFO. Once
inside, they kind of fell into what they described as a translike state. and upon
awakening saw that they were in a very different place. What they perceived to be another planet. They were outside.
The location where they stood was completely covered with ice. They couldn't see any sun or moon. And while
standing there, three, what they described as attractive female humanoids
arrived. They were all wearing silver suits, apparently humanl looking. The witnesses were rendered immobile and
were kind of loaded onto a type of vehicle which they said was kind of like a sleigh but different. And at this
point, the witness's memory ends. She says she woke up the next morning back in her apartment and had unusual pain
all over her body. So that's certainly an unusual case to say the least. And
here's another. July 12, 1987. This could be perhaps the most famous
sighting in the Czech area. Uh, so interesting. Again, around noon, July
12, 1987, a helicopter crew who you can see here was flying above the Venav
Reservoir, and they saw and pursued this black colored cigar-shaped object. They
described it as being like an airplane, but without wings. And in fact, they were ordered by their superiors to try
to shoot this down. But every time they aimed at this object, it would
immediately dart another direction. So it was apparently aware that they were
trying to shoot at this thing. Also, the pilots were very reluctant to shoot at
this object as this was being seen directly over the reservoir, which at
that time was pretty busy with people. Now at one point per first lieutenant
Geraslav SpaceX this object flew directly towards the helicopter and this
forced the pilot to do an extreme maneuver to avoid a collision. This object was also allegedly caught on
radar and it wasn't only the pilots and the crew of the helicopter who saw this.
Many people saw it from the ground and were also interviewed. So yeah, a very famous, very widely viewed, very well
authenticated and famous case in Slovakia. Here's another one. Super
interesting because a lot of people saw this one. Basically, this was a wave of sightings over a very small town that
had everyone in an absolute uproar. This occurred in July of 1991 when this
series of strange incidents occurred near this town called Millison.
that literally caused panic among the local population because this unidentified spherical object kept
appearing and would follow residents as they drove or walked through the area.
There were hundreds of people who saw this. Now, a few of these witnesses said that they could actually see figures
inside this sphere. And in fact, in one case, a witness said he saw this sphere
come right down over a roof. figures came out and walked on the roof of a cottage, leaving evidence behind in the
form of foot or handprints, which showed they had only four
digits. During another appearance of this sphere, a bunch of people were watching it and one of the witnesses
suddenly became entranced and walked or actually ran towards this sphere.
Everyone called out to him. He would not stop. He was totally unresponsive. They tried to call him
back. He just kept going and they were afraid to follow him. He returned later
completely confused. Had no memory of what had happened. Could not say what
happened to him. He said he said he was unable to describe it. Others had encounter with this sphere and
experienced missing time. Another woman said strange humanoids came right into
her house at which point she screamed, cried, and began praying, and they
immediately left. There's a lot more to this case, but wow, this is a very
intense UFO wave over this very small town. Here's another amazing case. 1992,
exact date unknown, but traffic workers at the Kosis National Police Station in
Sock observed an unidentified aerial object with a very bizarre appearance.
They described it as kind of a cross between a seagull and a sports car. That
same year, a silver object was reportedly seen over Havaz. This is near
Manatin. And this was seen again both visually and on radar. And in fact, the
military sent fighters and helicopters after it. But they were unable to make any visual contact despite the fact that
this object was still being tracked on radar, which shows that, you know, they can turn invisible if they want. One
year later, this is an amazing case. Not much detail to it, but it occurred on
January 9, 1993. Again, investigated by Dr. Milos
Jasenski, a witness in Pope Hudinsk. This is in
Mochadini, Slovakia. He said he saw an orange glowing ball of fire just sitting
on the ground in a field. Shortly later, it saw a tiny flying triangle land on
the top of a nearby pigeon house. A door opened and a tiny almost smoky looking
humanoid exited the object. I couldn't find any other details on this case, but
it's certainly interesting because there are a lot of cases involving tiny humanoids and tiny UFOs. And that's
another one. That same year, couple of months later, March 21st,
1993, also investigated by Dr. Milos Jasenski, this very unusual case
involves a lady who met with her friend and another gentleman. This gentleman
was driving them from Kosis to Prasav and suddenly the main witness felt
herself becoming entranced and her friend started to explain something that the man who was
driving was actually an extraterrestrial. The witness said that this man was blonde and very handsome
and during this whole encounter she and this man became intimate. The witness
then became pregnant but shortly later apparently miscarried this fetus. She
says that 6 months later she woke up in the night to hear the voice of a child
calling her name and saw a vision of a six-month-old girl. So presumably this
is the child she had carried and lost. It's another case where ETS are basically apparently
creating hybrid children. Hard to say for sure. There's not a lot of detail to that case, but certainly fits the
pattern we see in other cases. And here's another super interesting case. August 5,
1993. Again, from Dr. Milos Jasenski. Thank you, Dr. Milos, for contributing
all these cases. This one involved a group of 10 children who around 10:30
p.m. on August 5, 1993 were all playing in a field near
Dunach, let me get this right, Dunageka Strada, Slovakia, not far from their
homes, when suddenly they came upon two very strange looking humanoids who they
had said had heads shaped almost like cucumbers.
They said that these humanoids were wearing silver suits and did not walk but glided over the field disappearing
from sight. A very brief encounter but again witnessed by 10 people. And it was
that same year one evening around 6 p.m. a man in southern Slovakia said he was
driving to work in Nov Zamki. This is so strange. He said his car suddenly felt
like it was floating. At that point, he became immobilized and entranced, but he
was able to look out and saw that yes, he was floating in his car over the
overpass. Suddenly, without warning, his car fell. He sat from a height of about
15 ft. And this absolutely destroyed his car. He was thrown clear, laid down on
the ground, stunned, unable to move. He was found there shortly later by passers by. Miraculously, he was totally
uninjured. He was fine, but his car, he says, was completely totaled. Such an
unusual case. Here's another one. This is also very unusual. Also involving humanoids. January 16,
1994, an owner of a large greenhouse in an unnamed area of Slovakia exited his
home to go turn on the heater for this greenhouse. Uh, this was around 1:00
a.m. and they turned it on each evening because if they didn't, everything in
the greenhouse would freeze. So, he's walking towards the greenhouse when he noticed what he first thought
was a group of five or six children standing next to it, which is so strange
because again, it's 100 a.m. and who are these children out at that time in this
kind of weather. Also very strange is they all appeared to be dressed in one piece
coveralls. So, he now realized that they were not children and he became quite frightened, turned around and ran. And
it was at this point something hit him from behind. And the next thing he knew he was waking up back at home in bed,
drenched in sweat, totally still afraid, got up to check the greenhouse, thinking
it would be completely frozen, but was shocked to see that no, the temperature was normal. So later he examined his
neck where he believes he had been struck and he found a halfhealed scar
which disappeared by the next day. So another very unusual case with physiological effects. Very odd. Here's
another one and this is an important case I think because this fits the pattern we see in a lot of cases all
over the world. This one occurred on November 19, 2005 when UFOs were seen hovering over
the Bohun Nice nuclear power plant. This object appeared around 6:00 p.m. and was
hovering only 600 maybe 900 ft above this plant. Multiple witnesses saw it
and they started calling the police. Eventually, the Air Force vetored a jet
to intercept this object, which was apparently also caught on radar. Now, this object, of course,
zipped off, and later the military said it was nothing more than, and I quote,
light reflecting off the water vapor coming out of the power plant's cooling tower. How about that for a debunking
explanation? Yeah, like witnesses wouldn't recognize a reflection cuz, you know, they were calling the place.
Clearly, this was very strange. And as it turned out, it was not an isolated incident because only 3 days earlier,
two cigar-shaped objects were seen flying over the Tein nuclear power
plant. And just a few days after the first bub sighting, another witness said
that he saw two L39 jets chasing a smaller object over the Bohun plant. And
the next year, you know, just a few months later on New Year's Day, there
was another encounter when a father and son saw an object which they said was shaped like two cones placed edge to
edge and it had port holes around the circumference and was again hovering by
this nuclear power station. Clearly, this is another really good example of
this. ETSs are very concerned about our use of nuclear
material. Now, we move to one final case in Slovakia. I couldn't get the date on
this case, but I wanted to include it because it's a firsthand account of what
appears to be an onboard experience. The witness is known only by his initials,
GP, but this witness reports several encounters. This is just one of them. He said he was sleeping with his
girlfriend. And when he woke up in the morning, she had a very interesting question. She wanted to know where he
had been in the middle of the night because she woke up and the bed was empty. But the problem was he hadn't
left the bedroom at all. At least not of his own valition. But he does remember
something. And I'll just let quote the witness directly as he says, "One
beautiful evening, we went to bed. At night, I fell out of bed because I was
crouched in the corner of the bed. At the time, I didn't even realize what had happened. I woke up, but I wasn't home.
I was lying on a table. It was pleasantly warm. I was lying there naked. The table was pleasant to the
touch, like velvet. The room was light, pale gray. I looked for a light source,
but the light came from the walls. The walls were smooth. I couldn't see any furniture or equipment. I could look at
the ceiling to the left, to the right, to the front. But when I tried to look behind me, I don't remember anything
from that moment on. In the evening, I found out something else. Since I don't
go to the doctor, only they could have done it for me. I had one puncture in my left elbow. My veins are so deep. I have
only one place where they can give me an injection into my veins or take blood and it was in that one place. This is
just one story out of all the ones I have experienced. I find that case
particularly interesting because all these details he describes about how this table kind of felt soft and
pleasant and the room had indirect lighting and the walls were so smooth with no furniture. These are all details
people describe in an onboard UFO encounter. There you go. Cases all the
way back from 1944 up to 2005. So many different kinds of cases
and some are so interesting. I mean that one of the UFOs hovering over the
nuclear power plant and again not just one incident of that. They clearly show
an interest in all things nuclear. And that case over this one nuclear power plant really I think shows this and many
different types of humanoids and just so much going on. It's so amazing because
the vast majority of these cases don't really get a whole lot of publicity at
all. And as any UFO researcher will tell you, most people don't report it to any
official UFO reporting service or authorities. A good number of these
cases really only go as far as the local newspapers. So again, you know, this
could not possibly be the only cases that are going on in Slovakia. I would
say it's a tiny sample, a representative sample certainly quite accurate in that
regard, I suspect, but by no means comprehensive.
But super interesting, proving once again UFOs are seen
everywhere. Now we move to the next location. I was super excited to explore this. Coington, Kentucky. This is by
request of Tanya Martinez. So much gracias. Tanya, I really appreciate you
suggesting this location. Thanks for being so patient with me. Was really wondering how many cases I would find
here. and I found a bunch. So, I think you'll find this pretty interesting.
What's super interesting is this location has a couple of famous sort of UFO tourist attractions, including a
really famous house that's shaped like a UFO and this enormous ET that's part of
the building there, like 20 foot tall alien structure. So clearly people are
interested in this subject in this location and the cases I found go all the way back to
1947 pretty much up to the current day and again a huge variety of cases. So
thank you again Tanya. I hope you find it this interesting. The earliest case I could find in Covington occurred on July
5, 1947. And this was during a huge super wave of activity, the Kenneth
Arnold sighting, the Roswell crash. Lots of activity going on across the United
States and the world. And this is a case going on in Covington. The witnesses
were Dorothy Creve and May Lawrence. They were at their home in Covington at
434 Johnson Street. It was afternoon. Suddenly, they saw this circular object
with weird landing legs fly at very low elevation over their home. This was a
num one of a number of cases of people describing what it was apparently the same object in various locations in this
area. And it was just one day later on July 6th that there was another sighting. The witness in that case is
Commissioner William Ross and he said he was driving along the Dudley Pike. This
is just south of Co. Coington when he saw this weird red light. He thought at
first it might have been a search light, but he couldn't explain it. So, this is
technically a UFO. Next setting I want to talk about, super interesting. October 14,
1956. On that afternoon around 400 pm, a gentleman by the name of Harlon Grimes
was driving in heavy traffic when he saw this brilliant object, quite large,
about the size of a quarter moon and hovering stationary in the deep blue
sky. It passed out of view behind a building. And when he next got a clear view of where this object was, it was
now gone. This interested him because just a few months earlier, he and his wife had seen
a strange glowing object above their home. So, he was really on the lookout
for something strange. And as it turned out, just one month later on November 12, he had what he calls his most
definite sighting. He saw this very sharply outlined oval-shaped object,
flat white, moving overhead. It was in view for only about 10 seconds before it
disappeared into a cloud bank. But the witness, Harlon Grimes, is a pilot very
familiar with aircraft. And he could clearly see that this object had no wings or tail. He estimated it was about
40 feet in diameter and moving at about 500 m hour. Now, here is a very odd
case. January 30th, 1959. Truly bizarre. involving a creature of some kind. And
there were reports of this coming over from a fairly wide area in Covington. Police started receiving
calls. One came from a resident of New Richmond who said that he saw something
he could not even begin to describe. And shortly later, the police got a second
call again from a witness who saw something. He says, "I can't describe it. I have never seen anything like it
before." But he said he saw it come right out of the water and go across the
sky. Now, curiously, street lights were going out along Kellogg Avenue around
the same time. This is where this witness had seen this thing. And it wasn't long before more calls started
coming into the police station. One gentleman, a scientist, said he saw what was clearly a creature of some kind. As
he says, it was large, not a dog or a cat. It leaped in front of my car and on
two legs and was taller than the auto. When I looked back in my mirror, it was
moving along the bridge rail. It was three or four times the size of a man
and much bulkier. I have an eye and mind for dimensions, and I know it was
huge. Another witness was a lady in Coington who said that she saw it in a
creek near the Fort Thomas pumping station. She said it looked so strange. She had difficulty describing it. She
said it reminded her vaguely of an octopus. She said it came up and then went down. Was gray in color, lopsided,
had what looked like rolls of fat running horizontally over its bald head.
So yeah, clearly people were seeing something given the huge number of calls
coming in. Uh, I think that it's hard to explain what was going on here and
ultimately what it was remains a mystery. Moving along, October 22nd,
1975. It was after dark on this evening that an engineer says he was on the 14th
floor of a municipal building overlooking the Ohio River towards
Cincinnati again in Covington when he saw a UFO move very close to his window
at very low level. So kind of like eye level. He used binoculars and was able
to see that this object was discshaped. Had a weird kind of catwalk around the perimeter. rotating lights as well. He
could see peculiar looking kind of wings protruding from the body of this craft.
So, seeing how unusual it was, he ran to get his camera and he got his camera and
could see that this object was now actually going around the building at very low level, close enough he should
have been able to hear it, but it made no sound that he could hear. And so he got his camera ready and was about to
take a picture when this object darted away very quickly. Seems they always do
that. One year later, June 1976, around 8:00 p.m., this is approximate, a
5-year-old boy and his older brother were playing outside. This is just before dark when suddenly a classic
flying saucer zoomed right over their street, stopped, came back, and hovered.
It had four lights underneath moving in this weird way that almost looked like it was making symbols of some kind was
making a pretty loud buzzing noise. Loud enough that a bunch of neighbors came running out to watch it. Reportedly,
some of these neighbors did take photographs of this object, though these photographs have yet to surface. This
craft then moved off towards the city dump, hovered there for a few moments, and a few minutes later came back again
to this exact same spot. Then it moved over behind the house and sent down this
brilliant beam of light. And when it did this, according to the witness who reported this to Newark, he heard a
person screaming for help. It was at this point that all the witnesses became fearful and ran back into their homes.
But per the witness, he couldn't get back into his house because they had locked themselves out of their house,
running out to see this object, and they had to wait until their mother came home to let them back inside. But as the
witness says, I remember this event like it was yesterday. I don't remember
anyone ever talking about it, and I thought it was weird that no one ever talked about it. That is a weird thing
that happens. you know, this really intense UFO sighting can occur and it's
like it's almost taboo or people forget about it or just don't talk about it. And here's another case, same exact
time, June 1976. I'm wondering if this is actually another witness describing the same
encounter, but the details are slightly different, so I don't know. But this witness says it was around 900 p.m. when
this brilliant glowing saucer-shaped craft moved slowly overhead and hovered
behind their house. He says his whole family came out to watch. At one point, a plane appeared heading towards the
direction of this object at which point this object immediately turned all all
of its lights. It became dark which rendered it essentially invisible. And
when this plane moved off, this object turned its lights back on. And then, as
the witness says, it sped off in the opposite direction. It moved so incredibly fast without any sound that
it left a light trail in the sky for a few seconds. Now, here is another interesting series of sightings which
occurred in mid January of 1978. It was around this time that a wave of sightings hit the South Ohio
North Kentucky area. most people describing a glowing green object. In
fact, on January 19, numerous people in both states saw this object, but one
witness in Coington said she saw a quote very green tear-shaped object flying
across the sky and suddenly it dropped down and quote floated to the ground.
What's so interesting is this is exactly what other people were describing, seeing this object move horizontally
across the sky, then stop and go straight down as if coming for a landing. Very odd. Here's just a couple
of more cases. in Covington. March 22nd, 1985, around 1:00 a.m., numerous
residents at the 3,800 block of Glenn Avenue, including a police specialist by
the name of Todd Finnen and police sergeant William Dorsy, all saw an
oval-shaped object hovering overhead. And as Sergeant Dorsy says, it went from
red to green to white in color and moved slowly westward parallel to the ground.
So he was very curious, decided to do some investigation and called the Greater Cincinnati International Airport
Tower. And as he says, they confirmed that they had something on radar but
didn't know what it was. Now, interestingly, further investigation revealed something odd. Henry Merik, the
assistant air traffic manager at this control tower, said he could find no record of the radar reading. And as he
said, if it did happen, it wasn't on our log. So, this could be evidence of a
cover up. Hard to say for sure because they did tell the original witness,
William Dorsey, a police sergeant, that yes, they caught it on radar and now
suddenly, no, not on radar. Sorry. One more case in Covington, September 25,
2017. was around 11:00 p.m. The witness was putting his dog outside when he says
he saw a strange light at a low elevation moving in a weird figure8 kind
of infinity pattern up in the clouds. So he watched this for a long time. He says
it was there for about 4 hours. He looked around the area to see, you know,
if something on the ground might be causing this, but he couldn't find anything. He did notice one other
unusual detail that he feels connected to this. They had an electronic plushy
toy in the house and it kept vibrating which he absolutely believes was due to
the appearance of this object because he says this toy had never done this before and that it was quote scary. As the
witness says, I still don't know what it was to this day, but that night I dreamed of UFOs and aliens. So there you
go, Tanya. Amazing. UFOs definitely have been seen in Covington, which is really
no surprise. I keep saying it. Uh I think what is happening here is that the
ETs are putting on what amounts to a publicity campaign. They want people to see them. Why else would they be showing
themselves to every darn location on this planet if they didn't want us to
know that we are not alone? That is speculation on my part, but I think the cases speak for themselves. There's so
many of them. So, now let's move to our next location, which I was super excited
to look into because this is, in fact, my hometown. I was born here, and the
location I'll be looking into now is Chicago, Illinois, the windy city. And
this one gave me a real headache. Not because I couldn't find any cases, but because I found way too many. I'm not
kidding when I say I could write a fulllength, two, 300page book on UFOs
over Chicago. So, I really had to do a lot of editing here. And at one point, I
just threw up my hands. I'm like, this is enough cases. I give up. There's hundreds more. I found enough, I think,
to show that absolutely Chicago has been visited. And I kind of concentrated on
cases that were widely viewed, well authenticated, super interesting ones
that had solid craft as opposed to anomalous lights. And of course, humanoid encounters because, as I said
earlier, they're the most interesting. But I had a lot of you guys requesting
Chicago, including XZ Drift, Dulu Blinky, the Vanc Slam, Mr.
Corsair Ryan Sizansa Ces of Panskoy probably
butchering that sorry Ryan also Sheldon Dogh house. So yeah a bunch you guys
requested Chicago. Thank you so much. It was really interesting to explore my hometown because I know this area and
amazing cases and so many of them. Uh, I
probably could have done an entire episode again on just Chicago. So,
please don't think this is fully comprehensive, but I think there's enough cases to not only show that
Chicago is being visited, but honestly to get a pretty broad perspective and
knowledge of all the different types of UFO activity going on. It's like each
city represents a sort of microcosm of UFO activity. By that I mean you could
look at one location and get a pretty accurate view of the entire UFO
phenomenon. This is how ubiquitous UFOs are. So here we go. Chicago,
Illinois. All right, here we go. June 25, 1952. It was 7:30 p.m. as a Federal
Revenue agent by the name of Jean Olivivero was relaxing in his backyard
at 2917 North Nordica. And this is when he noticed two quote silver cylindrical
or discshaped objects hovering silently overhead. He immediately shouted out to
his wife Francis who also came out and saw them. Their next door neighbor, Alberta Gregory, also heard them
calling. She lived at 2915 North Nordica. So, she went outside
and also saw them. So, that's three witnesses seeing this very unusual
discshaped object hovering silently overhead. And it was just 4 days later
when there was another sighting. And this one was over Chicago's O'Hare Airport. This has been the target of
many UFO visitations. In fact, there was one in 2006 that is world famous. I
covered that one in my episode on UFOs over airports, so I won't be covering it
here, but you can check that episode out if you'd like to learn more about that case. But again, Chicago's O'Hare
Airport has a history of encounters. This one involved three air police
officers of the 83rd Airbase Squadron who said that they saw a smooth metallic
oval-shaped object surrounded by a blue aura hovering above the two radio towers
owned by the WGR and WBBM radio stations. And it remained
there for a long time. They watched this object for about 45 minutes from the
airport area as it hovered with a kind of rocking motion and occasionally performed instant accelerations before
eventually moving off. Here is one of the most bizarre cases. Uh this one is
investigated by Project Blue Book. It does involve humanoids. It's one of very few Blue Book cases involving humanoids
that was also declared unidentified. This occurred on April 8,
1954. The witness was a lady by the name of Leela H. Stoker. She's very well
educated, has traveled across the world, has written articles, uh speaks multiple languages. The w the
investigators were really impressed by her intelligence. At the time of her sighting, she was living at an apartment
building at 3121 North Sheridan Road. She was in
apartment number 706. And at 2:30 p.m., April 8, 1954,
she looked out the window and saw this brilliant white parachuteshaped object
skimming back and forth at high speed over Lake Michigan. She estimated it was
about 2 to 3,000 ft away from her, maybe two or 300 feet high off of the lake.
But most shocking was that below it, she could see a short humanoid kind of
suspended right below this object. So this puzzled her. It clearly was not a
person on a parachute because it was zipping back and forth. There was no boat below it. And she was watching this
thing just go back and forth. She called out her neighbors. Uh the neighbor is
William R. Borisac and his wife. They lived at the neighboring unit number
703 and they saw this thing too. So watching this for some time, she finally
called the Coast Guard and they sent out a little search boat and as this boat
arrived, this object immediately, as if in response to this boat, moved towards
the shore. It seemed to decrease in size and to Leela's shock, this object
actually landed among the bushes there, appearing to conceal itself. You could
now see this humanoid much more clearly because it was only about 500, maybe
1,000 ft away from her. And she could see that this humanoid was quite short,
dressed in a tight-fitting green jumpsuit, which went up over its head,
and it walked back and forth along the lakefront until this Coast Guard boat finally left. At that point, this object
rose up, seeming to resume its original larger size. This little humanoid
entered inside this object, and it then darted away with tremendous speed, she
said. So this could not have been anything normal. This entire event lasted about 30 minutes. Blue Book
officers interviewed her, investigated the incident in depth, and were unable
to explain it and ultimately declared it unidentified. Now, it was just one day later after
this, at 6:00 p.m. April 9, 1954, that 14-year-old Frank Reed was at
Lincoln Avenue near Damon Avenue on a cloudy day when he saw something very
unusual. I'll just quote him directly as he says, "I was crossing an alley when I
happened to look at the sun. The sun was covered by a layer of cloud and haze that blocked off enough light to make it
just a bright orang-ish disc. As I was looking at the clouds crossing the sun,
I noticed a thing to the right of the sun. This thing was slowly moving across
the sun, moving very slowly. It was tubular with rounded ends and was from
one/4 to 1/3 the diameter of the sun. It was not a cloud as it kept a sharply
outlined form all the time I saw it and it was black against the sun was not a
plane. So he actually provided the drawing you see here. This affected him
profoundly because years later as an adult he became active in the UFO field
joined the center for UFO studies which was based in Chicago and did many UFO
investigations. 1954 was a big year. Here's another case to August 22nd. This
is four months later. Two men were working at an oil refinery in different
locations when both independently of each other noticed a strange object
hovering directly above the factory. One of the men, Walter Bedenic, said, and I
quote, "The object which appeared like a half moon shape with something projecting on the end or in the middle,
was just above the refinery. The thing just stood still for a few seconds, then
made erratic darts in various directions, finally straight up and straight down." He said it couldn't have
been more than 2500 ft over the factory and after about 2 minutes moved off. As
he says as it was going away, it would speed up then slow down, shoot off to
one side for a short distance and appeared to keep turning. It didn't look anything like a balloon or an airplane.
So again, there was another witness working at the factory. His name was Edward Rail and he described the same
details. Both men reported their sighting to company officials. It's an
important case because there are quite a few cases of UFOs investigating our
technology hovering over factories of all kinds. So that's apparently what's going on here. Here's another case which
I did cover before in an episode of UFOs over graveyards, but I think it bears
repeating. Uh, this is such an interesting case. November 4, 1957. There's a lot of cases of UFOs
seen over cemeteries. For some reason, they find graveyards of interest. I've
got all kinds of theories about that, but you can check out my episode that covers a bunch of cases. It was 3:12
a.m. again, November 4, 1957, when patrolman Joseph Lucas and
patrolman Clifford Sha and fireman Robert Vault were at the Elmwood Park
Cemetery in Chicago. They were invest in their squad car investigating a store
which had an open window when suddenly that one of them spotted a strange
bright red orange kind of egg-shaped object hovering only 250 ft in the air
directly over the Elmwood Cemetery. So they turned the spotlight on the object.
They radioed officer Daniel Deiovani at the Elmwood Police Station and told him
that they were observing quote an unknown object. Now, it was at this
point something interesting happened. The headlights and the spotlights that they were shining on this object both
dimmed and flickered repeatedly, and the object im immediately began to quote
fold into itself. Now, when they turned the spotlight on it, they watched it quote
puff out, it then shot up 200 feet and took off. The officers tried to chase
this object in their squad car, but hit a deadend street. Still, they were able to watch this object, quote, "Fold
inward from the bottom and finally disappear." So, back at the Elmwood Park
Police Station, Officer De Giovani was able to run outside just in time to
observe this object shoot across the town and disappear. This whole sighting
lasted for about 15 minutes. Moving along, 1963. This case has very little
information, but I included it because the witness did supply a illustration. And he said in a letter to
the Air Force, quote, "I saw a UFO in 1963 in Chicago. My father, brother, and
cousin all saw it. It was revolving, and its square port holes were lit up
brightly, but not in colors. It was going fast and was making sharp turns.
Certainly sounds like a classic UFO encounter to me. That same year, May 19,
1963, a remarkably similar account and very wellverified. So many people saw
this comes from Reverend R. Dean Johnson. He actually wrote about his encounter in the January 1964 issue of
Fate magazine. It was around 10:15 p.m. again, May 19th, 1963. and he and his
wife were driving along Highway 131, Green Bay Road in the Walkagan area
north of Chicago or in North Chicago when they noticed a bright fiery object
over the lake over Lake Michigan. Now, this object slowly approached closer and
closer to them. At one point they thought it might be an object on fire, but then they could now see it was had
pulsating lights that were going on and off in a kind of steady pattern and it
just kept moving closer and closer. Finally, it got close enough that they could see it was an actual flying
saucer. They could you can see the drawings here. This object was illuminated by rows of horizontally
placed square port holes around the perimeter of the craft. And still heading south on Highway 131, they
crossed Highway 132. And it was here that this object came down towards them
at very low altitude. They drove a half mile further and then actually got out
of the car to get a better look. And as Reverend Johnson says, I estimated it to
be 200 or 300 feet above us, possibly 80 feet in diameter and 15 to 20 ft high.
The entire craft revolved counterclockwise. There was something very eerie about this strange craft that
neither of us quite identified until later. This enormous vehicle, as large
as our church, was absolutely silent. So that freaked him out. And as it passed
over them, they continued to drive south. And a few hundred feet ahead, they saw a stalled car. And right above
them, unnoticed by the people in this stalled car, was this craft. Uh, and by
this time, several other cars were chasing this object down the road. As the reverend says, a carload of boys
went racing past us as one beat on the side of the car and yelled, "Look at the
flying saucer." They too pulled their car off the road, as had the others along the highway to get a better look.
So the reverend and his wife continued to watch this object as it moved over North Chicago and then out over the lake
and was gone. And he later learned that people all over the city had seen this
object. And in fact, this was not an isolated incident. Some saw it the day before, some saw it in the days after.
And as the reverend says, it was not any known craft. It appeared to be
intelligently controlled. The craft glided back and forth over the more densely populated communities and
industrial areas strung along the lake shore and traveled as far as US Highway
41. How amazing is that? so many cases. Here's another one somewhat similar.
June 21st, 1963. This was a sighting reported by a
student who said he saw a gray spherical UFO with a central row of yellow lights
moving east and then turning north over Chicago. Now, he was close enough to hear it making a quote sizzling sound.
He said as it moved, it revolved and went directly over the intersection of Fairfield and 21st Street and then north
up California Avenue towards a vioaduct. Really interesting case after
case. Here's another very strange one involving a humanoid and a landed UFO.
This was February 1965. was early dawn as a retired milkman,
Harvey Kek, had taken a vacation to Chicago and he was walking along the
shores of Lake Michigan in the Chicago area when he says he saw something he could hardly believe. He came upon a
landed flying saucer. He described it as being about six feet high, metallic,
your classic saucer shape, sitting on four legs right on the beach. And standing next to it was a 5-ft tall
figure which he said had a stocky body and uh very unusual looking. As he says
he had a dark tan flesh, a glass dome helmet, and his eyes were farther apart
than normal. He also noticed that this figure had an unusually pointed chin. Uh
he decided she's not going to tell anybody this. He did tell his wife. His wife didn't believe him and said he must
have dreamed it up, which of course he says he did not and he would have kept it entirely secret, but it was at that
time he read about another account involving a landed craft and a humanoid.
He read about this in the newspaper. And as Harvey Kek says, I didn't report it
because I figured everyone would think I was crazy or drunk. I wouldn't have said anything. But the resemblance between
this robot and the one I saw was so remarkable, I thought I should report it
to someone. So he told this two newspaper reporters and they asked him
if he planned to report it to the military. And his response was, "No, I don't want to get involved in this
thing." So, he clearly was not seeking publicity and was very reluctant to
report this. This is another indication that most people do not report what they've seen. And I wonder if there were
other witnesses to that glanded saucer and humanoid. Here's another case. September
24, 1966. Again, I'm going chronologically through these cases.
There was a flurry of sightings, but it was around 400 a.m. when numerous witnesses reported a UFO over various
parts of Chicago. Policemen in the northwest and Northshore suburbs said
that they saw this object over Lake M just northeast of the city. One of the
witnesses was news reporter James Murray of the Chicago American and he said he saw a large black object with a white
ring around it at about 4,000 ft altitude flying in perfect silence
towards the east as he was driving through Prospect Heights. But there were
other witnesses, four airline pilots actually called O'Hare Airport to say
that they saw this brilliant light at about 4,000 ft about 100 miles northeast
of Chicago. These were just a few of the sightings going on at this time. I don't
know how skeptics survive. They just got to do their homework. There's so many cases. Here's another one. January 23rd,
1973. On this evening, literally hundreds of Chicago residents watched
what they described as a strange bar of light hovered over the city for more than an hour. Now, Dr. J. Allen Highneck
of Project Blue Book initially thought that this could possibly be the Aurora
Borealis, even though it didn't sound like it. But as he examined the reports,
he saw that some of these witnesses were actually north of this object looking south. Others were south of it, looking
north. So this indicated that it was in fact at low elevation over the city, not
the northern lights. It's another unexplained object. Here is another interesting encounter. January 10, 1978,
25 minutes after midnight, a good witness, a 31-year-old paramedic, was
driving with her three-year-old son on the way to pick up her husband, who was a policeman, and it was her child who
pointed out what he called a moving star. So, she was arriving at her home
just seconds later, got out of the car, could now see that this was actually a silver discshaped object with cup-like
protrusions, one on the bottom and one on the top. She said it was as large as
a full moon, very large. And when it would move, it would leave this yellow orange glow behind it. She watched as it
stopped, reversed directions, moved forward again, finally moved behind a nearby building. She didn't notice that
it would glow orange only when it was in movement. And the duration of the sighting was about one or two minutes
before it disappeared from view. Here's a rare daylight sighting. September 9,
1979, 4:30 p.m. This object was cited by numerous people. One of the witnesses
was a 30year-old man who shouted out, "Gee, that looks like a flying saucer."
This alerted his family and all the neighbors and they all came out and watched what they described as a classic
silver disc about the size of a half moon. It had a black center. It was
pretty high up there and they all watched as it moved off to the northeast. As many people describe these
objects, none of them could hear it making any noise. It was totally silent.
Here's another interesting case. I love it when we have police officers as witnesses because they're trained
observers. They're the people who, you know, are watching the area for anything unusual. And this is why we have a lot
of police officers who are also UFO witnesses. This sighting occurred on September 23rd,
1988. The officers were out on patrol in the Lamont suburb of southeast Chicago
when their attention was drawn to flashing lights overhead. One of the officers was Sergeant Tom
Hess. And as he says, I was with another officer. We now know that this other
officer was Halere. But as Sergeant Tom Hess says, I was with another officer in a squad car
eastbound on Main Street heading towards Route 171. And all of a sudden, coming
out of the north, I saw a real bright light. We both caught a glimpse of an oval-shaped object. So both officers
said that this object was white on top, blue green on the bottom, and that it quickly entered a cloud, and it was so
bright it lit up the entire cloud. But it then came closer to the ground,
darted erratically from north to south, much faster than any plane, finally
disappearing behind some trees. Now, unknown to these two officers, there was another squad car on the other side of
town who saw this object around the same time. One of the witnesses was patrolman
Mark Janice. And as he says, "As I looked up toward the cemetery, between
two trees, I saw a flashing object like a spotlight. It hovered and then shot
straight up and was just gone. I know it wasn't an airplane or anything because
it made a real swift, erratic movement. I was amazed at what I'd seen. I didn't
tell the other guys because I didn't want them to think I was a little bit off. But this report eventually did make
its way to Mark Rodiger of Cufos who said that they had received about 10 or
15 reports of similar sightings in the same area at the same time. So, how
about that? The police officer saying he didn't want to report it makes you wonder how many police officers see this
thing and just don't talk about it because they don't want to be ridiculed or disbelieved. It's a real problem.
Here's another case. April 16, 1990 with 7:30 a.m. early morning as
Bruno Malone was on his way to work and was driving near the intersection of South Chicago Avenue and Commercial
Avenue. Looking up through his windshield, he saw an oval-shaped object, Silver with a round dome on top.
It was motionless in the sky. He was close enough he could hear it making a
kind of whooing noise. And he watched it for a minute until it suddenly disappeared. But here's a really
interesting aspect to this encounter because he had some weird physiological
reactions to its presence. As he says he felt odd and afterwards suffered from a
headache, nausea and neck pain and also this weird sense of euphoric elation or
what he called runner's high sort of you know when you get endorphins from exercising. He said it affected him
physically in a very strange way. One final case in Chicago. This is a
humanoid case. Really interesting. August 1999. This case comes from Albert Rosali's and
it was late at night. The witness was sleeping on the sofa of a friend's house in Chicago. When he woke up, he felt all
panicky, cold, unable to move, and he could see standing by the doorway was a
7 foot tall figure resembling a quote preying mantis. He said it was dark
gray, was wearing this black and purple cloak of some kind, and to his fear,
this figure slowly approached the witness. It then reached out and grabbed
his shoulder with these long, thin fingers, and the witness immediately
passed out and remembered nothing else until morning. So, a very intense
encounter. That's the last one that I'm covering here in Chicago. There's so many more. And again, perhaps I'll
revisit it because I know there's a lot more cases. All right, that's Chicago. I
might have to revisit Chicago because I again kind of just threw up my hands in
despair. I'm like, there's just too many cases here. This is driving me nutty. I had to stop. Otherwise, I would never
finish. Maybe I should just write a whole book on Chicago. That would be pretty interesting, I am sure. But yeah,
UFOs have definitely visited Chicago big time. Now, let's move to our last and
final location in this particular episode. Can't believe I could only do four locations this time with a list of
well over 800 uh locations. I'm going to be at this a long
time. But the next location that I looked at is by request of Marina. So,
Marina, we are now going to look into Sarasota, Florida. I've always been curious about
UFO activity over Florida because there was that huge wave over Golf Breeze in
the 80s into the '9s and it is one of the top 10 in in the United States in
terms of the number of encounters. So, yeah, there is a lot going on in Florida. I've interviewed
quite a few people who've had encounters there. Sarasota is certainly not left out. And
man oh man, some really interesting encounters here. One which was so
bizarre. I've never heard anything like this. So that alone I think was worth
looking into Sarasota. But again, a huge variety of encounters. It's really fun
to dig into all of these and I think you'll find it pretty interesting. So thanks Marina. Here we go. The earliest
case I could find in Sarasota, occurred on August 17, 1952 around midnight when
the witness C. E. Pendley, he's a sign painter and former Air Force member, he
was dozing on his porch at 305 Oak Street when he says he saw a brilliant
light arcing across the sky. Now, he first thought it might be a shooting star, but he very quickly changed his
mind because, as he says, the brilliant white light kept the same intensity and
traveled southward exceptionally fast when it suddenly made a right turn west
and another to speed north. I realized it was neither a plane nor a star. So he
quickly called out his wife who also saw it and as he says, "Then it started to zigzag in peculiar fashion, turned
again, and then went south a second time and disappeared. No airplane could ever
do what that thing did. It was traveling too fast and making too many right angle turns. I never did believe those flying
saucer stories, but after I saw this thing, I've changed my mind." Moving
along, one year later, June 1953, around 1000 p.m., Charles Iy and his c-orker
and friend James Shaon were closing up the Beach and Sun motel on Leo Beach
where they worked. This is such an amazing encounter. So after they finished working, they decided to walk
up to the beach to watch a fleet of B36s, which were apparently practicing
night landings because they kept go rising up there and then turning around and going back towards the airfield. Now
they're watching one after another of these B36s when suddenly they see this bright star-like object show up and
approach one of the planes. And I'll just let Charles Eiley describe what happened because he describes it
vividly. He says that this object quote came scooting out of the north at
incredible speed. It approached the plane as if the plane were standing still and those planes at a pretty good
speed. It stopped right behind and below the plane and followed along with it. If
there had been a man in the rear gunner's position, he would have been staring straight at a real flying
saucer. After a few minutes, suddenly the UFO shot straight up in the air, a right
angle to its previous path and disappeared for a few minutes. It came back and sort of played tag with the
plane. So this went on for the next hour. This UFO would come play this game
of tag with each plane that flew by and would almost always fly behind and below
the plane. So after an hour of this, to their amazement, this UFO seemed to grow
tired of playing tag and started to move off. One of the witnesses, James
Shonaman, expressed a lot of relief that this object was leaving. And it was when
suddenly, as if listening to them, this object turned and started coming directly towards the two men. Jim
shouted out at this point, "God, look at the size of that thing." It scared him
so much that he ran towards a patch of tall grass and ducked down inside it to
hide from this object. Both men could now see that this object was glowing green blue. It was totally silent. And
as Charles says, I stayed right out in the center of the beach so I wouldn't miss a thing. And sure enough, this
object came right over them, moving, he estimates at about 200 to 250
mph, no more than a,000 ft high. And as Charles says, this thing was big,
perhaps as big as two railroad freight cars. It was roughly cigar- shaped. It was a cylinder tapered on both ends. A
row of windows or port holes ran the length of the body. I ran to the center of the beach and jumped up and down and
waved my arms, hoping to attract someone's attention, but no luck. Jim
came out of the bushes, and we watched it disappear to the north. We were both pretty well shaken up and trembling all
over from the excitement. He wanted to leave at once, but I made him stay another hour to see if it would come
back. Unfortunately, it did not. But it certainly made believers out of both of
these men. Here's one of my favorite cases in this whole collection. This is so interesting to me. January 4, 1954.
McKinley Caner is a very famous Pulitzer Prizewinning author, perhaps best known
for his novel Andersonville, and he's the witness in this case. He did not believe in UFOs before 6:07 p.m. January
4, 1954. But at 6:08 p.m., he absolutely
believed in UFOs. At the time of his encounter, he was on his private beach
at Siesta Key when he noticed this strange object with a kind of curved top
or rim around the edge, a darker base, and it was hovering over the water gleaming in the setting sun. He
immediately saw that this was unusual. He could not explain it. He was very much impressed by it. So, he called over
his neighbor, Dr. Gillespie, who also saw it and couldn't explain it. So they
watched this thing hovering for about four minutes when it shot off faster than a shooting star at an upward
diagonal course. And that's basically the sighting. But there's some interesting
events that occurred afterwards. So convinced he had seen an actual flying saucer, McKinley Caner was determined to
do something about it and went straight to Mcdell Air Force Base and told Colonel Michael McCoy, who was a
bombwing commander, about what he had seen and told him that he needed to contact Project Blue Book. The reaction
was not good. This colonel just shrugged and told him that project blue book would just insist on some conventional
explanation and it was best that McKinley just forget about this encounter. So McKinley told him that he
would never forget about it. And nine years go by and this is when McKinn
Mccanter got some amazing vindication because he was asked to be the co-writer
of a person's biography and this person turned out to be no one else than
General Curtis Lame who was writing his biography mission with Lame. Now if you
don't know Curtis Lame look him up. He's infamous in the UFO field among UFO
researchers for basically towing the party line and being part of the UFO
coverup. So now that McKinley is co-writing his book, he confronted
General Curtis Lame about UFOs. And at first Curtis Lame towed the
party line, told him that UFOs can almost always be explained as balloons, birds, stars, etc. but then did admit
that there were some credible witnesses who had seen odd things and finally told
McKinley Cananter quote there were some cases we could not explain never
could. So this book was written. You can you can read it online for free. And in
this book, General Curtis Lameé did talk about UFOs. He made several mentions of
UFOs in the book talking about the wheels of Ezekiel. But
ultimately, while he admitted that there were some cases they couldn't explain, really denied that the Air Force was
complicit in any UFO cover up, which we now know is flatly false. This cover up
is easily demonstrable through documents released from the Freedom of Information Act. So, yeah, an interesting
story. Here's another case. Really interesting. March 11,
1957. Two young boys, Michael Ball, age 13, and his younger brother, Charlie
Ball, age nine, who lived at 4567 Camino Royale. This is in Sarasota. They were
out flying a kite at nearby Sarasota Beach. 400 p.m. Again, March 11,
1957. They're flying this kite and suddenly both boys are shocked to see this UFO appear. In fact, they were so
impressed, Michael called the newspaper to report his sighting and said that
this object was quote some object with a metallic gleam and shaped like a half
sphere. said it flew in from east of the bay and headed north. It was going too fast to be a jet, he said. And it must
have been above the stratosphere because there was no sound or vapor trail. So
these boys watched this object. They said it traversed from one side of the horizon to the other in about one
minute. And they reported this sighting to the newspaper in hopes that there might have been other witnesses who saw
it. Unfortunately, none did come forth, but I suspect that there were other
witnesses. That same year, a few months later, November 6, 1957. At that time, there was a a huge
wave sweeping across the United States in the world. And of course, Sarasotans were not left behind. 5:30 a.m. Kenneth
Julian, his wife, and daughter were driving to the Tampa airport when they
described seeing this eerie blue sphere zoom across the sky. As Kenneth says, it
was very strange, I can tell you. Quite high and just barely visible. It seemed
to make a slight turn or curve. Just after making the ark, it disappeared.
So, they only saw it for a few seconds, but it turned out that people all over the area were seeing it. Authorities
were being flooded with calls from witnesses. A delivery man saw it, a sports writer, a newspaper reporter, and
an Eastern Airlines flight crew, and others. So, there were a lot of witnesses. So many sightings in
Sarasota. Here's another one, June 4, 1958 from a lady by the name of Miss
Burbank, who actually used binoculars to watch this zigzagging UFO. As the
witness says, the object appeared as a source of white light. It was oval in
shape, seemed nebulous or fuzzy around the edge, and stronger down the center.
It was not a bright or conspicuous thing, but still was easy to track. and moved with tremendous speed and in this
general direction, passing overhead in wide crazy zigzags, would hesitate and
abruptly change course. An odd fact is that it always pointed the same way,
even on the sharp turns. The course was not regular. It went something like this in spots, straighter in others. Case
after case, May 4, 1960, 9:15 p.m., a
gentleman by the name of S.B. Parker Jr., an architect, saw this very unusual
looking object in the sky. As you can see, he drew a very precise picture of
it. He described this as a yellow elliptical object with four evenly spaced squarish windows with rounded
corners along the side. This was very low. When he saw a treetop level, it
moved off in just a few seconds, but was visible long enough for him to get a very good view of it and realize it was
unusual. Here's another case. May 21st, 1969. Numerous people across Sarasota
reported seeing this cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky. In fact, people
over a wide area saw it. People in Port Richie, north of Sarasota. It remained
hovering in place for about two minutes. Now, skeptics did try to explain this away as a satellite. Uh but as
researcher Joan Wright writes, "No satellite can sit in any one position
for even one minute." Certainly an interesting case.
Here's another one. December 1976. Uh it's not exactly sure what day.
perhaps the 11th though, but numerous witnesses across Sarasota reported seeing an unusually bright light or
lights which would sometimes hover, sometimes dart around. A lot of people saw this. One witness at Siesta Key
described seeing these lights hover for over an hour. And as she says, and I quote, "We know it's not a constellation
or a meteor, but we would like to know what we're seeing out there." Another
witness said he was parked at the intersection of Wood and Brink Streets when he watched an object with lights on
it at very low elevation. And as he says, the lights were closer together than on a plane, and the object darted
off in different directions. It didn't follow a route or a pattern. Now, here
is a very, very strange case. June 24, 1985. Very widely viewed. This was
around 10:15 p.m. when calls began to flood the FAA, the police, UFO reporting
centers and newspapers. In fact, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Station
fielded calls from people describing this object. Some said it looked like a meteor. Some said like a comet with a
brilliant red tail. Another person said it looked like an airplane with its engines on fire. They received no less
than 14 calls in the space of 1 hour. So clearly there was something up there.
Now here's where it gets interesting because the research revealed that there was in fact a laser light show at Harbor
Island in Tampa. And so this is what a lot of skeptics and reporters seized
upon and said, "Ah, people think it's a UFO, but they're just seeing laser lights." But here's the problem. This
laser light show was 60 miles away. And these witnesses were in Sarasota and they insisted that what they saw could
not have been lasers. As one witness says, a Sarasota resident by the name of
Trey Miller. He says, and I quote, "Don't let anybody fool you about a
laser light show. It was no light show. It was a craft, cigar- shaped, silver,
and with lights on it. I stopped in the middle of the road and the people behind me in traffic stopped and saw it too. It
was like 400 to 500 yards in the air. There's no way a laser light show can
hover and move at that constant of a speed. So other witnesses across a
pretty wide area saw this thing with some describing quote a large blaze with
fragments falling from it. Some of the witnesses said that they saw this object actually land in Hillsboro County. A few
others said they saw it go into the water. One said Tampa Bay. Another said Palmola Bay. A couple said they saw it
go down into the Manatee River. These bodies of water are all immediately adjacent to each other. So, this does
appear to be a USO. But whatever it was, the laser explanation doesn't even come close to matching the details described
by the witnesses. Now, this next case is a very good example of a UFO plane
encounter. was 45 minutes after midnight on January 27,
1995 when a pilot and his passenger were in a Cessna 172 at an elevation of about
3,000 ft 30 miles away from Sarasota and heading towards Sarasota when suddenly
the pilot's automatic directionfinder radio began to pulsate in noise level.
This was very puzzling. One minute later, the plane began to pitch around in a way that he couldn't explain. So,
he's thinking there must be some kind of malfunction and began to study the instrumentation on his dashboard to try
and discern the problem. And looking down at his tachometer, he says, quote,
"The entire cockpit lit up with a brilliant light source." So he immediately muttered an expletative,
looked up, and saw the source of this light. Just about 2,000 ft above him,
and less than 1/3 of a mile away, he saw this red orange ball
of light the size of a semi-tra. He estimates maybe 60 ft long, 20 ft wide,
and it was moving at a downward angle at lightning speed, he said, from east to
west going directly towards Sarasota. and in fact it passed right in front of his flight path. He could see two trails
of greenish light, one on each side, coming from this object. Now his passenger, who had been sleeping,
immediately woke up when this bright light filled the cockpit. And like the pilot, he watched in amazement as this
object darted down, reached an altitude of about 2,000 ft, leveled off over
Sarasota, and then darted out to sea. The pilot immediately called Tampa Airport who said that they had nothing
on their radar and no evidence of any planes in this area. But this object
moved so fast that the pilot estimated the speed in excess of 21,000 mph and
says that there's no way that this could have been a meteor. All right, just five more cases or so. And this one is
probably the strangest, certainly the strangest one in this whole compilation. And absolutely the strangest one coming
out of Sarasota. This comes from the November 2007 issue of Your True Tales and was
printed up in Albert Rosali's volume of humanoid encounters. This may or may not
be directly related to UFOs or ETS, but it could be, and it's certainly odd. It
involves a mother by the name of Christine and her two children, Ryan and his younger sister. They were all
renting a house on a 2 acre lot on the outskirts of Sarasota when something
very unusual happened. It was a Friday, a summer afternoon. Ryan and his sister
were playing on the lot when they noticed this unusual looking bright orange rock jutting out from the soil on
their lot. But it was so strange and bright, about the size of a watermelon,
that they decided to dig it up. They put it into a wheelbarrow and brought it towards the house, set it on the porch.
No sooner had they set this orange rock on the porch when all the power in the
house went out. This was weird because no other houses lost power. It wasn't a
blackout. And at the same time, their phone went dead. So, they didn't connect
these electrical problems to the rock until later that night. And they noticed that this rock was actually luminescent.
It was glowing with orange light. So now, wondering if the rock was to blame for their power outage, the mother
Christine told her kids to take this rock off the porch and put it into the yard. So, they did. They removed the
rock, put it in the yard, covered it with a tarp, and no sooner had they taken this rock off the porch. When the
power came back on, the phone came back on. Everything returned to normal. But events weren't over yet because it was
the very next day, a Saturday, Christine was doing the dishes when she saw two
what she described as muscularlooking women pull up in a white van. They got
out. They walked straight up to the tarp that was covering this rock. They uncovered the rock, took the rock,
carried it up into the van, and drove off. This was very strange because nobody but Christina and her two kids
knew about the rock. This tarp wasn't even visible from this driveway or the street. So, how did they know about it?
And still events were in progress because later that same day, Christine got a call from her rental office and
was told that her lease, which was supposed to go for two more years and was paid up, had been cancelled due to
quote, evidence of improper usage. She was told that they had two weeks to get
out and that they would receive a refund for the rent already paid. Very strange
story. Here's another really interesting case. September 7, 1999. This case comes from Moveon and
involves a former firefighter who was heading to Sarasota on Interstate 75
when he noticed what he first thought was a jetliner about to crash. He actually pulled over to the side of the
road and could now see that it was about 3,000 ft away from him and wasn't crashing, but was hovering about 800 ft
up in the air above a wooded area. and it was huge. He estimates this object
was about 225 ft long, glowing all over. It had a white strobe like light on what
appeared to be the front end and a blue one at the back end and it then proceeded to move off slowly to the
southwest and was gone. So he drove on. He stopped to get a coffee at the
7-Eleven store in Sarasota. And this is when he noticed an unusual number of fire trucks and medical vehicles
circling this area. And he later found out that there were many other witnesses. And in fact, NASA later
released a statement saying that what people had seen was probably a Russian rocket booster moving at 17,000 mph,
which certainly does not match the details described by this firsthand witness. Just a couple of more cases.
This one occurred at 10:02 p.m. on July 21st, 2005. There's two witnesses and as
one of the witnesses says, "My fiance and I were driving separate cars when we
both noticed an extremely fastmoving object going south across the road we were on. My fiance called me on my cell
phone to verify what we saw. We turned down a small unlit road south towards
our home when we both noticed an astronomicalsized object just hovering
literally right above our cars with beaming stadium lights shooting down on
the road. I looked in the rearview mirror and suddenly it was gone. A brief
case but certainly impressive. Now I just want to end this with a couple of apparent photographic
cases. This is really interesting. December 29, 2022. You can see this
photograph here. This comes from New Fork. There's little info other than the witness saying, quote, "Eight
disc-shaped bright white objects with black edging on the front. One smaller,
more diamond shaped discs were in a 242 pattern with the diamond in the front
right. Picture was taken at sunset with very few clouds around. It certainly
looks unusual. But you have to be careful. Consider this next case. This one went viral.
July 17, 2024. You can see this impressive looking photo of what
appeared to be a fiery UFO sending down a beam of light onto the water. This is
all over the internet. It took me quite some time to track down the source to a lady by the name of Jennifer Rogers. She
says that she's the one who took this photo and thought it was a UFO, but did her research and later learned that no,
this is actually a search helicopter looking for a swimmer. Nevertheless,
this picture went all over the internet and is circulated as a genuine UFO, uh,
which shows you can't be too careful, but certainly a beautiful photograph
nevertheless, not a UFO. There you go. Sarasota, Florida. It's funny because
there's lots of towns next to each of these locations and I'm looking at them. I'm like, well, there's another town I
could look into. You know, I wanted to include some of these cases since they're so close to these other towns
like Sarasota, but I'm like, I'll just wait. I'm sure somebody's going to request this town or that town and I'll
visit it at that time. But yeah, Sarasota delivered. Thanks, Marina.
Super interesting. All different kinds of accounts. That one involving that glowing orange stone was super
intriguing to me. I don't think I've ever heard a case quite like that. Again, can't prove it's UFO related, but
it's certainly unusual and unexplained, or so it would appear. So, thank you again, guys. Four
different locations. Slovakia, Chicago, Sarasota, Florida. Really
interesting. And of course, Coington, Kentucky. Always learn a lot. It's
amazing to me how many cases there are. It's millions. I mean, millions upon
millions of cases that have been recorded in these local newspapers. That's where I'm finding most of these
cases, by the way. some in books, some in various databases, but it's mostly
the newspapers that I'm finding a lot of these accounts. So, really interesting.
Uh, hope you enjoyed this episode and perhaps learned a little bit, but it's
just again proving my point. And I think this is important that people need to know a couple of things. one that UFOs
are far more common. UFO encounters are far more common than most people
believe. Two, they are being seen all over the world, pretty much every
location. And three, I think these cases show, like I said earlier, that ETSs
want us to know we are not alone. That they are conducting a very carefully
orchestrated, vigorous publicity campaign. essentially just announcing their presence, saying hi. And the
variety of encounters is also super interesting. The variety of humanoids,
the variety of shapes of UFOs, all of this shows we still have a lot to learn.
These cases have so much to teach us. They really offer us an amazing
opportunity to learn not only about what's out there in the universe, but about ourselves, how we react to stuff
like this, how open we are to learning new ideas and so forth. So that's it for
today. Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate it. It's because of you I do
this research. It is a lot of work, particularly these hometown episodes, but I always have so much fun, always
learn something new, and it's because of you guys. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And until next time, please
keep asking those hard questions, keep searching for the truth, keep having
fun. I think that's important, too. So, until next time, bye for now. See you
next Friday.
