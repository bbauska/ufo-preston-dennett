UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE FOUR
Sep 20, 2024

Summary:
Sep 20, 2024
Welcome to Episode Four of my ongoing series of “UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN.” I have put out a challenge to anyone interested in this subject: name any location, such as your hometown, and I bet I can find a UFO encounter there. Hundreds of people responded. I am working my way down the list of locations. In this episode I investigate eight places: Fort Wayne, IN----Greenock, Scotland----Warsaw, Poland----New Paltz, NY----St Charles, MO----Boston, MA----van horn, TX----Grand Junction, CO. And guess what, there are cases in each of these areas! Sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters…supported by eyewitness testimonies, photos, radar-returns, landing traces, medical effects and more. Has your hometown been visited? The answer is probably YES!

FORT WAYNE, INDIANA. On February 7, 1955, American Airlines Flight 266 had a dramatic encounter with five UFO. In 1955, the Freeman family of Fort Wayne all watched a classic flying saucer. In 1967, minister Allen Federspiel reported his amazing sighting to NICAP. That same year, dozens of people saw a UFO hovering over Fort Wayne for four hours. In 1979, Sally Collet saw a UFO with a humanoid inside it right outside her home, and she wasn’t the only one. In 1991, a lady in Fort Wayne was chased by a UFO for 25 minutes. In 2005, another witness had a dramatic missing time encounter. The cases continue!

GREENOCK, SCOTLAND. Sightings, UFO fleets, humanoids, UFO photos…Greenock has them all. Back in 1948, two schoolgirls saw multiple UFOs hover overhead. One hovered so low, they could see a humanoid figure inside. They waved at it, and it waved back! Truly dramatic low-level sightings occurred in 1973, 1978 and 1999, including a case involving a fleet of UFOs. In 2005, Jonathan Smith heard shouting in the street and looking out his window, saw a group of colorful objects. He grabbed his camera and snapped an amazing photograph. These are just a few of the many cases in Greenock.

WARSAW, POLAND. Warsaw has an astonishing number of close encounter cases. In 1922, a Warsaw family observed a silver craft hover 400 feet away, so close, they thought they were about to be taken onboard. In 1959, an engineer observed a craft hovering over the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science. In 1975, a man was in the forests outside of Warsaw when he saw two gray-type ETs who rendered him temporarily paralyzed. In 1979, a man came so close to a landed craft, it burned his face. In 1986, a plumber was taken onboard a craft where he saw froglike beings. So many other cases!

NEW PALTZ, NEW YORK. Per whistleblower Robert S. Carr, a UFO landed in New Paltz, and a humanoid was captured by a game warden, and was taken alive to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia until it died. This is one of many New Paltz cases. In 1970, a woman and her boyfriend had a dramatic missing time encounter. Another dramatic case occurred in 1978 when three separate groups of witnesses observed a strange triangular craft over the city.

ST CHARLES, MISSOURI. One morning in 1971, three people, including a doctor, observed a low-level cone-shaped craft with a humanoid inside it. In 1973, the police received a call from a UFO witness. They sent out an officer, and he saw it himself. Soon many other witnesses saw it. In 1998, a witness described his sighting of a cigar-shaped craft with portholes on it.

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. Sightings here reach back to 1638, when a group of witnesses saw a UFO for three hours. In 1950, a dramatic UFO display involving multiple craft occurred over Logan International Airport. In 1955, a man reported his sighting of a craft as big as a 10-story building. In May 1963, a group of witnesses witnessed a fleet of UFOs over a drive-in theater. In 2024, a boyfriend and a girlfriend were stunned when a UFO shined a beam of light on their car, causing it to noticeably shake.

VAN HORN, TEXAS. This small town had an undeniable encounter with a classic flying saucer when, on July 23, 1999, truckers driving along Interstate 10 observed a craft with blue and white lights zigzagging at low level alongside the highway.

GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO. In 1956, four people were shocked by the appearance of metallic discs flying only 1500 feet overhead. In 1968, a man driving near Grand Junction saw a UFO that was so bright, it hurt his eyes to look at it. In 1969, two young men were walking down Main Street when a silver saucer with windows hovered for two minutes in view of hundreds of people. In 1985, Bob White was driving outside of Grand Junction when a UFO ejected a piece of metal right in front of him. He scooped it up, and had it studied by metallurgists who were unable to account for its composition. These are just a few of the many fascinating cases in Grand Junction.

It appears that every location on Earth has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. The evidence speaks for itself. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal guess what it's time
for episode 4 of UFOs in your hometown this is a challenge I put out quite some
time ago I received a huge response name any location name your hometown and I
can find a UFO encounter there and I'm going down my list and I'm proud to say
I'm still batting 100% UFO are seen everywhere and I've got eight locations
chosen by you guys the viewers that I found UFO cases in and this covers not
only sightings but of course Landings face to-face encounters with humanoids
missing time onboard experiences really the entire range of UFO encounters super
excited about this episode because there are a lot of humanoid cases there's quite a bit of really amazing in
evidence everything from Landing traces and animal reactions physiological effects radar
returns photographs really an amazing array of evidence and of course cases
reaching back hundreds of years all the way up to pretty much the present day
and cases from a wide variety of locations not just the United States but
all over the world at least in several locations uh so today I'm going to be covering
Fort Wayne Indiana Greeno Scotland Warsaw Poland that was really
interesting for me to find encounters there but also new PS New York St
Charles Missouri Boston Massachusetts the little town of Van
Horn Texas and finally Grand Junction
Colorado some really interesting cases in all of these locations and this is going to be a
fairly long episode so let's just get started in the first place I'm covering today is Fort Wayne Indiana and this is
by special request from Annex and wow I found some great cases humanoid
encounters UFO car chases daylight discs cases involving missing time a really
wide variety of UFO encounters one of the first really significant Fort Wayne
cases occurred at 7:55 p.m on February 7
1955 and this is when the crew of an American Airlines flight
266 observed two groups of five star-like objects two were in one group and three
were in another they estimated their altitude at about 30 to 40,000 ft and
they first appeared stationary then suddenly finally the group of two darted away at high speed followed Moments
Later by the other three now this case made it all the way to the air technical intelligence command at Wright Patterson
Air Force Base in Ohio checks showed that there were no other aircraft in the area but despite the expertise of the
witnesses being Pilots the Air Force dismissed this case as quote possibly
Reflections that's Project Blue Book for you now that same year September 8 1955 a
Fort Wayne resident said that he watched a quote silvery white very bright
circular object slightly larger than a grapefruit and this object was hovering in the sky he said for a full 45 minutes
pretty good case another good solid case occurred in August of
1961 when a gentleman by the name of John Freeman and his family reported their sighting of a craft which quote
looked like two big blls one on top of the other with a flashing light on top
now this thing was hovering at Tree Top level when they saw it it very quickly Rose silently after a few seconds and
then it climbed rapidly out of sight and was gone so it's a fairly significant
encounter with a classic Flying Saucer and here's another important case I
think this one occurred on March 9 1967 at
9:15 when a gentleman by the name of Alan federspiel he's a minister and a
prison guard said that he saw a group of lights and sort of an X formation they
were hovering they blinked on and off in sequence then seemed to rotate kind of
like a top he said and then shot away he later reported his sighting to naikap
the National investigative Committee of aerial phenomena an activity continued Fort
Wayne for example August 10 1967 Fort Wayne meteorologist made the
news when he watched a UFO for no less than 4 hours he said it was flashing red
and blue and white lights and he was not the only witness it turned out there
were hundreds of people who saw this strange light in the sky it got a lot of
attention Military Officers and astronomers were unable to identify it
and the cases continued here's an interesting case which occurred at 7:20 p.m on September 23rd
1973 the witness was turning into the Glenn Brook shopping center this is a
huge shopping complex when she says she saw a huge object with a rounded
backside sort of flat bottom and five rows of pulsating yellow lights on the
side she watched it for a full 5 minutes or so until it moved slowly behind some
trees and was gone so this was apparently a pretty low altitude now
here is a humanoid case a really unusual one which comes from Fort Wayne resident
Sally Colette was the second week of January 12
1979 and Sally woke up at about 6:30 a.m on that day unable to sleep and feeling
strangely uneasy it was still dark at that time and when she looked outside her home she saw this
weird glowing light and as she says it was kind of unusual I wasn't scared or
nothing I mean seeing something like that could cause a body to take a heart attack but I wasn't scared a bit there
was something real bright in the center like a star only brighter it was kind of gold colored but the thing see it was
sparkling like a fireworks things shooting out all around it so it was
unusual and she's staring at it as it's pulsating in brightness and this is when she saw a humanoid figure the top half
of a humanoid figure and was moving back and forth walking inside this bright
object and as she says he was moving pretty slow but all you could see was
just his waist up and he was kind of a heavy and stoop shoulder kind of bent
over a little bit I I know this don't sound right it's so unusual I ain't
never seen nothing like it before it's kind of unreasonable so I hope someone
else saw it beside me so she watched this object for a good period of time until the sun came up the man did not
reappear she only saw this humanoid figure once but at 700 a.m this object
was still there in the sky so she decided she's going to call the police the desk sergeant Willie wear sent out
an officer to look he didn't see anything but then they received another
call from another lady who was reporting the same darn thing as sergeant willly
wear says she described the exact same thing to me about the shadow of a man
passing in front of this object that was kind of sparkling that made me wonder
now further inquiries reveal that there was another sighting of About a Week earlier of a parent the same darn thing
Sally did eventually call the newspaper to share her story as she says I don't
pretend to know what it was it was way above the rooftops but there was the
make of a man walking like he was walking across the floor right there in the sky that's what I saw so yeah pretty
interesting humanoid case and certainly unexplained here's another brief but
still interesting case which occurred on April 7 1982 2 when two people were driving in the Fort Wayne area and they
said they saw this mushroom cap shaped flying disc with hazy lights which began
to Pace their car making odd but smoothly executed Maneuvers lots of cases of UFOs
following cars and that's another one here's another real interesting case was
around 131 a.m on January 17 1989 when Jim hadex who s is a UFO
researcher said that he left the Woodbridge Apartments in Fort Wayne
going east on St Joe Center Road which you can see here and he noticed this
strange object in the sky he saw it again at Treetop level as he traveled
East on Route 37 now before reaching Hicksville not
too far away he said this object moved about 200 ft in front of his vehicle at
which point it Shone down three lights directly on his truck for a full half
mile as he drove down the road finally he stopped and the object moved away he
went to Hicksville got his roommate and returned to Fort Wayne going West on
Route 37 and guess what this object followed him again this time accompanied by
another object reaching Fort Wayne the object crossed the road right in front
of them they finally chased this thing back and forth until it quote stopped
and hovered turned back to the west and flew away arcing South another really
good case of a UFO Pace in a car here's another case on April 15
1991 Mr F Crocker and RT treway both observed a fast moving object described
as quote pearshaped with the Apex downward round with a v-shaped tail to
it the color of it seemed a bright yellow and strong rays of the same colored light were constantly being shot
out from the main body there's a lot of cases here's an impressive case of a
solid object which was seen at 12:45 a.m on October 7
1991 this was investigated by Richard sea freed he's a professional very
well-respected researcher and this object was seen while the witness was driving M along
Route 14 near Fort Wayne this subject had Port holes was hovering stationary
just above Treet toop level and was totally silent now here's a real
interesting UFO car chase occurred near Fort Wayne this was at 1:30 a.m on
November 29 1991 when a 17-year-old woman was driving with her
infant child and she saw two bright white lights approach her vehicle
then positioned themselves directly behind her and then pursued her car for
a full 25 minutes this really quite frightened her so she finally pulled
over into a private driveway and turned off her headlights at which point this
object passed directly over her car went around the house in the surrounding area
she now got a good look at it it was disc shaped so she pulled out and drove without her headlights on and a quarter
mile down the road this object reappeared paced her car for five more minutes and then darted away so I can
only imagine how scary that must have been for her now here's a really compelling case involving missing time
which was researched by muan field investigator Roger sugden was about 10 p.m on January 25
2005 and a woman was driving to her home near Fort Wayne when she noticed that
the car ahead of her was driving so erratically that she actually feared for
her own safety the witness did so at this point she tried to call a friend to
alert her about this but strangely her cell phone wouldn't work and at that moment her car lost all power and at the
same moment this shooting star-like light zoomed down from the sky and this
is when she noticed that the car in front of her also lost power and it stopped about 300 ft ahead of hers she
could now see that there was a large green and white object hovering overhead and sending down a beam of light onto
the car ahead of her and the next thing the witness knows the light and the object are gone so is the car ahead of
her also she noticed that her car and herself were both extremely cold so she
turned on her car turned on the heater she noticed something else real odd a small bottle of lotion that she had with
her had strangely expanded so she contacted researchers told them what happened turned out she
had also had two previous Encounters in Fort Wayne further investigation
revealed that the family who lived in the area where she had this missing time
encounter said that they saw quote silver balls of light this is in the
field where this UFO had appeared let's move on just a few more cases in Fort Wayne that I'd like to cover was just
before 1 p.m on March 22nd 2008 when a boyfriend and a girlfriend saw quote
five whitish discs now these were flying very close together spread apart by only
about 20 ft they estimate flying much lower than a plane reflecting the light
said the witness I was shaking badly I've always wanted to see something like
that but now I'm scared here's another Fort Wayne case which was reported to
field investigator Philip Devon leech of muon the mutual UFO Network and this
occurred along Highway 27 in Fort Wayne at 8:05 p.m on April 4th
2015 the witness described seeing a quote solid light it descended from the
sky he thought it was a plane until this thing crossed the road in front of him and began to hover over some nearby
trees and he could now see it was a solid object somewhat triangular in
shape red and white pulsating lights and he said this thing was zigzagging down
the highway in full view of many witnesses and he followed it until it
suddenly picked up speed and altitude and disappeared but here is a final and
impressive case which was also investigated by Philip Devon leech it occurred one year later this is
2016 9:30 5:00 p.m on April 12 when a Fort Wayne resident looked out her
window and saw two flashing lights blinking on and off but this is when one
to her perspective appeared to change shape was still blinking then both headed west and
disappeared Philip Devon leech after investigating this classified this sighting and the one before it both as
quote unknown thank you for suggesting Fort Wayne Indiana and
it really delivered I learned a lot so interesting keep saying it UFOs are seen
everywhere not only in the skies but coming down for landing picking people up all kinds of UFO events and that's
true as well of Greeno Scotland and this is from special request by C
5894 and yeah I found some amazing cases involving humanoids fleets of UFOs
really interesting photographic case some pretty interesting UFO events
overall first case I'd like to talk about in Greeno comes from researcher Ron Halliday and was featured in his
book UFO Scotland and this does involve humanoids
it be began around noon one day again in 1948 when 9-year-old Linda and a school
friend were walking home and this is when they heard this loud humming sound coming from overhead looking up they
were amazed to see four strange craft two looked kind of saucer shaped and two
more cigar shaped but all of them were quite low at about roof height the witness said the cigar-shaped
objects had windows at the front but the saucer-shaped craft had Windows all
around the circumference and inside one of the saucer-shaped craft they could see fig
figures looking down at them through the port holes these were more Silhouettes than anything but the girls could
clearly see this so they began to jump up and down and wave at these figures
and to their amazement these figures waved back they weren't close enough to see any detail as to what they looked
like but both girls felt that these objects or the occupants inside them
were deliberately watching them and after all this occurred suddenly one of the cigar shaped craft which was much
higher than the others came swooping down and then immediately all four rose up at high speed disappeared into the
clouds and were gone here's another amazing case from Greenock February of
1973 numerous residents in the area phoned the Greenock Telegraph newspaper
reporting that quote Balls of Fire were hovering over the Greenock golf course
which you can see here now some callers reported as many as six objects at one
time an investigation into the possibility that these might be satellites or other natural astronomical
phenomena showed this to be quite unlikely as the descriptions coming in
involved objects that's that were much too bright for this and very low in the sky 5 years later February of
1978 a gentleman with the initials JK said he was looking out the window of
the Lark field hospital and he saw two glowing objects Dart across the sky and
vanish he was impressed by this so he kept watching when quote yet another
object like miniature Suns and traveling faster than a Jet Plane end quote zipped
across the sky and here's another same year was around 1 p.m one evening in
late June of 1978 when 14-year-old rodick Buchanan
who lived at 32 Kelly Street was returning home with his mom and aunt and
they were between Loom and wiill golf course when rodrik saw quote something
strange this was of course up in the sky and as rodri says we stopped in
amazement to watch the phenomenon was pinkish orange and something like 200 ft
in diameter it made no noise but was spinning all the time we washed for
about 2 minutes then it began to descend ever so slowly it was an incredible
thing turns out he was probably not the only one to see this because on the same night Norville Paul and his two children
Merill age 13 and Allison age 18 said that they also saw a mysterious light
above Greenock as he says they appeared to be 400 to 500 ft above the skyline and they
lit up one by one until there were between six and nine of them they were
very bright flame colored and they remained motionless we watched them for 3 minutes
before they became obscured and we did not see them again I'm very puzzled for
I've never seen anything like this before so yeah apparently Greenock is a good place to see UFOs because on May
1st 1999 at 9:25 p.m another Resident said that he saw five lights performing
dramatic Maneuvers they were coming together breaking apart doing this whole
display another sighting occurred on February 15 2005 when a man was walking
his dog after 1 a.m and he described seeing a large yellow con shaped craft
now here is a very well documented encounter which has photographic
evidence so this is quite rare this occurred in the middle of the night in early August 2005 the witness is
14-year-old Jonathan Smith and he was in his 11th floor flat on Belleville Street
when as he says I woke up at about 2:30 a.m when I heard shouting in the street
but when I looked up I saw all the lights I never really believed in UFOs
before well he certainly did now cuz he was looking at them and what he was looking at was a group of a dozen
multicolored objects they were red blue and green to his credit he quickly
grabbed his camera and was able to snap a clear photograph of what he was looking at says Jonathan my mates say it
must be loads of planes but they wouldn't be so close together there are too many lights so no probably not
planes and in fact he and father whose name is John well both examined the
photo in an enlargement but they were still unable to identify these lights
and as Jonathan's father says I really don't know what it is but I would like
to get clearer images one more case from Greenock November 13
2009 a metallic disc was seen over coronation Park and another impressive case that
same year December 25 20 n involved Hugh and Debbie scobby who viewed two
unidentified objects from Berwin Road hovering over Larkfield they were
reportedly able to capture video footage of it but I was not able to see this
footage well hearing all those events that have occurred in Greeno Scotland really makes me want to visit there not
only because it's so beautiful but maybe I'll see a UFO you never know but
seriously what an amazing amazing series of events that occurred in that area I
know there's more I'm kind of filtering out the less interesting cases of anomalous lights and focusing more on
the interesting cases where the encounters are more extensive they're more credible there's more evidence more
witnesses something to add to our understanding of what's going on here so yeah don't consider these events fully
comprehensive of each location this is really just a sampling and the next place I'd like to
cover is Warsaw Poland this is by special request of
JG and JG I want to thank you CU I have never really explored the UFO Encounters
in Warsaw before I wasn't expecting to find as much as I did but man oh man it
delivered amazing cases not only of sightings but the full range Landings
humanoids and onboard encounter ERS and some are just really fascinating I
certainly learned a lot this very early case comes from researchers bronislaw
res peni and Kristoff pichota it occurred in June or July of 1922 and
involves three family members who were walking in the Targo area of Warsaw when
suddenly they saw this object dropped down from the sky was making a loud Whistling noise and coming down so fast
that they thought it was going to crash but actually it stopped about 10 ft above the ground and began to hover this
was only about 400 ft away they could now see that it was a flattened silver
gray metallic sphere with a rotating ring in the middle now as they watched
this ring stopped rotating and they saw what looked like Windows or Port holes
in fact one of the witnesses had the strong impression that the occupants of The Craft were observing them
that they were all about to be invited on board but moments later the craft
shot up at an angle and disappeared but apparently there were other Witnesses because a separate report describes
quote many witnesses seeing the same kind of object only the other Witnesses
said that they watched it shoot down a beam of light and then Ascend with a loud noise the next case occurred quite
a few years later on March 25 19 1959 the witness is an engineer who
describes seeing a silver dumbbell-shaped object with two
different Siz spheres connected by a cylinder and get this it was hovering
directly above the Warsaw Palace of culture and science this is a very
prominent landmark and as he's watching this this object appeared to transform into a dis
shape now might suspect this is a matter of perspective but at any rate he watched it Dart away and then it
returned back to position again becoming or appearing to be dumbbell-shaped
before departing for good here's another very interesting case involving humanoids lots of humanoids in
Warsaw this occurred in July of 1975 when a young man went to collect mushrooms in the woods outside of Warsaw
when only 45 ft away he was amazed to see two 3ft tall entities he said that
they had thin childlike bodies large heads black shiny eyes this sounds a lot
like Grays he said that they were wearing tight fitting black coveralls
which covered their body now the witness tried to move but found himself
paralyzed and as he watched both of these beings walked away in a strange jumping fashion and then disappeared
into the forest and once they were out of view the witness was able to move again and here is another really
interesting one involving physiological effects very unusual effects in fact
this occurred at 10 p.m on May 22nd 1979 this is in a park in the pesta area
near Warsaw when the witness his name is walmar R he noticed an unusual silence
settling around him and then then 15 ft away he saw two yellow beams of Light
which he suddenly saw were actually coming from a dark object that was floating just above the ground so he
walked up to it he approached to within 10 ft of this object and he could now see that it was about 9 ft wide and
shaped very much like a hockey puck he said it had green colored geometric
shapes along the edge what looked to him like triangles and squares trapezoids
and circles he so the upper side had a sort of H or E shaped symbol or
protruder uh right on top and it was radiating this red light now this craft
itself was resting on what looked like three small Landing legs and as he watched this object suddenly blazed with
intense white blue light when it did this waldemar felt a burning sensation
on his face which as you can imagine frightened him so he fled straight home
he woke up the next morning feeling somewhat ill he said he had this weird heavy sensation in his head and over the
next few weeks he woke up to find that there were abscesses filled with dried
blood on his face he connects this to his coming really close to this object
and the strangeness continued because it was between 6:00 or 700 p.m and January
15 1986 when Joseph K age 42 was returning
from his job as a plumber to his home on wikor Street this is in the motau area
of Warsaw and you can see this street here it's not a terribly long Street at any rate Joseph carry was
carrying his plumber tools along with him in a little briefcase and this is
when he noticed a dull silver saucer-shaped craft not very big about
15 ft wide 6 feet high which was landing on an empty Alley between two
buildings you could see a bright yellow light was emanating from an opening on top of this craft so he became curious
and he approached right up to it in fact he was about two steps away from this
object when a female figure dressed entirely in Black exited from the top of
the craft she looked he estimated about 30 years old but a normal human looking
person and she beckoned for him to come closer and this is when Joseph said he
found himself becoming strangely passive as he says she took my will I became
humble like a gentle man and I knew I was ready to fulfill all her wishes so
next thing he knows he's seeing two what he described as frog likee humanoids
dressed in overalls with hoods he found himself standing between them and they grabbed his arms on either side and he
found himself floating up through this weird tunnel of yellow light and it went on for several minutes he said this just
surprised Joseph as the object looked pretty small from outside and appeared bigger on the inside and he found
himself inside this brightly illuminated room these figures ordered him to lay
down and as he did he lost Consciousness his next memory was of
waking up and he was standing by his front door physically he felt fine but
he did notice three strange things one he was wearing his jacket inside out two
all his metal Plumbing tools were now magnetically attached to each other and
three his suitcase was gone never to return and here is another one which is
really interesting this occurred on March 17 1986 when Andre K looked out the window
of his home in Broad now again this is in Warsaw Poland and he saw this strange
red sphere and the second he saw it he says the back of his head began to throb
almost painfully and this is when he realized he was in telepathic contact
with the occupants of this glowing object and they wanted him to take some
photographs of their craft they told him that there were 17 people on board so
andrees very impressed quickly retrieved his camera at which point this red
spherical object moved closer changing colors and shape becoming now a bluish
disc the ETS told him that they were from the Orion constellation and were researching the presence of
aluminum on our planet at this point the witness requested to be taken on board but he
was told that this was impossible but he did take photographs which the editors
of the article in which his experience was published called quote true and
quote extremely interesting Unfortunately they were not reproduced with the reprint of the
article that I found and I have not been able to locate them and here's another June 27
1987 several newspapers in Warsaw including Poland's official Army
newspaper said that mysterious objects were seen flying silently over Warsaw
said one of the witnesses a pilot zers waloski says I saw a plane passing below
me with a blue of bright fire trailing it I was surprised because I should have
heard the Roar of a jet engine while the plane passed without a sound another military pilot said right
above us an object was sailing Eastward at an altitude of some 600 yards was
literally Sailing by as no sound could be heard physically it seemed impossible
another incident occurred just a few days later was witnessed by two pilots one by the name of Lieutenant Mark J who
said and I quote after I got to a distance of 300 yard I noticed its
strange shape was something that did not resemble anything flying in the air the
object was an oblong cylinder he said it seemed to be toying with his jet fighter
and then as if bored It sped out of sight and here's some more recent cases
February 21 2004 at 2 p.m a group of friends said that they saw what looked
like three triangular objects move over over Warsaw as one of them said one
light was at the center of the plane SL ship with a red orange color and was
pulsing the third ship was bigger than those two described above and had more lights located at the edges the objects
were flying in formation and were looking marvelous a final case occurred
around 1 to 2 a.m on January 20th 2007 when a fleet of no less than then 17
triangular objects appeared over the slooh zooo area of
Warsaw one of the witnesses a lady by the name of jolanta said that she
watched them scatter overhead for about an hour another witness said that each
triangle had three lights one at each apex of the triangle with a blue glow
around the perimeter one of the objects was much bigger than the others she watched them from her balcony and she
said her cats apparently reacted and her dogs the cats became frightened and her
dogs started barking these sound like they might be reverse engineered craft to me I don't know but certainly a
interesting and impressive case so how interesting is that all these cases from
one specific location and yet no matter where you go these cases have remarkable
similarities it's pretty clear our military no matter what country you're talking about is very aware of what's
going on people are being taken on board all over the world these cases are just
endlessly fascinating to me and I'm continuing to learn all kinds of things
and now we move to our next location which is New pult New York this is by
special request of Carolyn so thank you Carolyn this was also a really
interesting research project I found quite a few cases not quite as many as I
thought I would uh lots of anomalous lights which again I'm kind of skipping
over we don't learn a whole lot from them and as interesting as they are and I do think they're interesting they're
simply not as interesting as people who see solid craft or have more extensive encounters and I found some so don't
worry this is going to be pretty interesting I certainly hope so now I don't have the exact date for this but
this is certainly an interesting t bit which appeared in the Arkansas Democrat newspaper and comes from Robert S Carr a
well-known early crash retrieval whistleblower allegedly in the loop of the UFO coverup and he told John Lofton
of the Arkansas Democrat newspaper that either the sheriff or the game warden of
new pults allegedly Came Upon a UFO and a humanoid he quote managed to catch the
humanoid outside his UFO so this being was retrieved by the
CIA and held alive for 28 days at the CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia
until it perished this next case is really interesting this appeared in the
communion letters book by an and Whitley streber the date is the summer of
1969 and a young lady was returning home from work on the subway when she had an incredible Alien Encounter
as she says she's understandably Anonymous in the middle of the 7th Avenue subway Rush Hour crowd I saw a
little man about 4T tall he had a huge head but it was the quality of his skin
that first caught my attention it didn't look like human skin but more like plastic or rubber I knew he wasn't human
I tried to follow him with my eyes but he quickly got lost in the crowd no one else seemed to notice this Disturbed me
I thought I was seeing things now it was just one year later in the summer of
1970 that another experience occurred which gave the witness reason to believe that something very unusual was
happening in her life she was visiting a commun near New Pals New York and as she
and her boyfriend sat outside with a group of about 12 people she says suddenly everybody stood up as if in a
trance started walking to their cars all just let her describe what happened as
she says we found ourselves sitting in our cars revving the engines and
realizing that we didn't know why we were doing this but we were unable to stop then we all drove off one car
behind the other I was then with my boyfriend in his van one of the cars in
front of us fell into a ditch alongside the road the procession stopped the guys
got out helped push the car back on the road and we all drove off again I
remember being in a trance and watching the scenery as if it was a movie screen
the next thing I recall is the sky becoming very bright it was already a sunny day so it had to be very intense
there was an electrical quality to it then I perceived what seemed like the sky opening a force was coming towards
me the last thing I remember was finding myself outside of the car lying
alongside the road trembling uncontrollably in fear my boyfriend was
also lying alongside the road but he wasn't afraid I'd always thought I'd had some sort of religious experience now
later the witness had another experience in Woodstock where she and another person with her heard this loud whirling
noise the room filled with light it became clear to her that all of these were probably UFO related here's another
interesting newal case which occurred at 9:30 p.m on June 10
1978 when two students were driving eastbound on Route
299 suddenly a dark wedg shaped object appeared overhead they said it had red
and white lights on it and it appeared to be pacing their car but then turned South and crossed the road overhead this
point they stopped the car one of the students got out to watch it while the other stayed inside but both described
this thing as huge at least five times the apparent size of a full moon they
said it was totally silent suddenly it quote shot off it went to the southwest
and was gone in a few seconds now later two other Witnesses separate Witnesses
were found and as can be seen on this map one witness was at position number
one at 8:45 and saw apparently the same
object the other witness was at location number two this was around 900 p.m and provided the same description as the
other Witnesses the original witness is located at position number three on this
map and they were all interviewed by investigators from the J Allen heinik Center of UFO studies qos really wild
accounts coming out of new pults so thank you Carolyn pretty amazing so many
cases and again the vast majority of people do not report their encounters so the cases I'm presenting here should
really only be considered as the very very tip of the iceberg of a huge amount
of encounters that we never hear about now we move to our next location
which is St Charles Missouri this is by special request of not so much and I
have to tell you didn't find a whole lot of cases here I suspect there was quite a bit more but this turned out to be a
really difficult area to find cases in not because I don't think they're there
it's just that there's a lot of places with the name Charles in it Charleston and different city names with Charles
and because I I do the This research by doing sort of a search engine on words
like Charles and uh too many came up so I might come back to this because I did
find only a few cases but the one ones I found were certainly interesting and it proves my point once again UFO
encounters are happen in at every location on our planet keep telling you
if you want to name your hometown I'll put it on my list my list is quite long now it's hundreds of cases but I'm
working my way down through it and still batting 100% okay here we go 9:50 a.m
february 18 1971 the witness in this case is Dr JW
Mueller and two others Martin th and Theodore th all of them observed a cone
shaped quote cage-like object 10t X 10t
occupied by one person made no noise and moved very rapidly so yeah they could
see this humanoid inside this thing which was tipped at an angle and only about 400 ft above the street they did
see what looked like a string of lights or perhaps Port holes which extended partway down the side of this
cone-shaped cage-like object very odd 2 years later another case
10:40 p.m june 13 1973 the witness in this case is police
officer Ruben Abington he had received a call from someone near The Shard jeene area of St
Charles who said that a UFO was hovering overhead so officer Ruben Abington went
to the area and guess what he saw the object himself and he watched it as it
hovered made several 90 degree turns and moved quote with the speed of lightning
and to his amazement it was joined by another object and these two objects started playing what looked like tag
with each other flying around a nearby plane literally flying circle around it
and then a third object joined the other two this is clearly a display by this time a whole group of people had
gathered to watch later a call to Lambert Airport showed that the objects
had not appeared on radar here's the third St Charles case September 10
1998 this was reported to the new Fork National UFO Reporting Center the
witness described a quote grayish silver cigar-like shape flying across the sky
was flying very low there were three large port hole Windows which illuminated bright white light now the
witness said that this object was totally silent and moved in a straight line until it was out of sight a fairly
mundane sighting if you can call seeing an extraterrestrial craft mundane so
there you go not so much not so many cases I'm sorry I'm sure there's a bunch
more there but I got really frustrated trying to wait through all of the data
there uh trying to find new cases but I found some
and I will keep looking now let's move to our next location which had a huge
amount of encounters so many that I kind of threw up my hands in the air I'm like okay I'm really going to have to pick
and choose on this one and this location is Boston Massachusetts pretty big city it's been
there for a very long time this is by special request from joshelle so thank you
joshelle um I really am amazed at how many cases I found here
all different kinds I picked out the ones that I thought were most interesting a really early case that I
have a personal connection to I found super interesting but yeah I think
you'll definitely find enough cases here to show that Boston has in fact been
visited by UFOs and ETS now the first case in Boston is so interesting because
as it turns out this is the first reported UFO sighting in the United
States 1638 Boston Massachusetts and it was written about
by the Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop who wrote and I quote in this
year one James Everett a sober and discreet man and two others saw a great
light at night at muddy river when it stood till it flamed up and was about 3
yard Square when it ran it was contracted into the figure of a swine it
ran as Swift as an arrow towards Charlton and SE up and down about 2 to
three hours so this is a fairly long sighting also strange was when this object
appeared the witnesses boat reversed direction and moved against the current
I found this case particular ularly interesting because as it turns out John winrep the first man to write about UFOs
in the United States is actually my ancestor I'm directly
related to him he's my great great great great many great grandfather so how cool
is that pretty interesting for me certainly so here's another case 955 p.m
on April 7 1950 three air traffic controllers one a
lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard were at Logan International Airport when a mysterious light appeared
directly over the airport and it immediately began to change colors and
perform fantastic Maneuvers was clearly putting on a display because it would change from deep blue to Pure White and
then cherry red while moving Against the Wind it then appeared to split into two
objects or one came out of the other both began to spin around each other before finally moving off now one of the
witnesses was watching all of this through binoculars and said that he saw a solid mass in the light it was just so
bright it was hard to detect but he said in part and I quote for obvious reasons
no formal report of this incident was made to any Source One hesitates to
solicit ridicule but I feel it incumbent to submit this report in spite of the
risk what an amazing case that is and here's another one an excellent
observation of a metallic saucer this occurred at 6 p.m on July 22nd
1952 by an Air Force plane spotter by the name of Robert hawy he was at the
Wiston Observatory on Forbes Hill in Boston and he noticed a strange object
circling around in the sky and as he says it looked kind of funny and I
thought it was a plane and I reported it but then after looking closer I saw that
it couldn't be a plane cuz it was perfectly round and was going around in circles I could see it good because the
Sun was shining on it I never saw anything like it in my life I was really
frightened so he's a good witness it's his job to look at planes and here's another really interesting daylight disc
case which occurred in Boston and it occurred on at 5:30 a.m on November 6th
1955 the witness is a gentleman by the name of Mr baller and he noticed a
classic gray metallic Flying Saucer which zoomed down out of the sky in a
vertical position and as the witness says I was amazed at the size of this
thing compared with Boston skyscrapers it was as large as a 10 story building
so this thing was huge coming down vertical but then it quickly assumed a horizontal position hovered like that
for a few moments then reassumed a vertical position and darted away at
high speed now here is a super interesting case which I did report on before in my episode about UFOs over
driveing theaters but it Bears repeating cuz what a case this is this was
reported to researcher George faucet by a radio man who said and I quote one of
the technicians came in immediately after the broadcast to tell us of an incident that happened last May
1963 at the Wellington Circle twin open air Drive-In he said it was about 900 in
the evening and they were watching the movie when all of a sudden their attention was attracted to the sky above
the screen there they saw two disc-shaped objects glowing orange red as they walk
watched the two discs were joined by two more then two more until there was eight
in all everyone was out of their cars by now watching as these eight discs
performed for them they were watched for 45 minutes by all the people at the
drive-in and they gave a better show than was on the billing when I say
performed I mean he described them as 2 by two in formation then one would move
to the side and up to the top of the formation the other up the other side meeting at the middle but here's another
recent case of a solid craft this occurred on January 21st 2024 and was
reported the next day to newfork as the witness says the UFO was
about 200 ft from the ground causing the ground to shake and emitting a deafening
humming noise while flashing lights into our car my boyfriend and I were sitting
in his car in his backyard when the ground started shaking and a loud
humming weing noise began at the same time the car shook with the ground and a
white light flashed into the car we looked out the window and saw a black
oblong diamond-shaped craft with two white lights located at the ends of the craft and a large green light in the
middle the craft was about 200 ft off the ground far too close to be an
airplane or helicopter It sped off into the sky and the humming and shaking faded out with
it so there you go UFOs over Boston no doubt about it case is reaching Way Way
Back coming up to pretty much the present day lot of activity it's amazing to me
there's just no way Skeptics have a leg to stand on at this point there's far
too many cases so I kind of just sh sh my head in wonder when people say oh there's no evidence yes there is there's
a lot of it and frankly the eyewitness testimony alone should be enough to prove the validity of UFOs and
extraterrestrial visitations to anyone who has the ability or the courage to
take an objective look at the evidence throwing away their prior beliefs or what they think they know about what's
going on here and just look at the cases and tell me there's not validity to this
now let's move to the next location which is by special request of MC beavers and this location is Van Horn
Texas and I have to say MC beavers you have me worried there for a second because I wasn't finding any
cases and this was another difficult research project but I found one and I'm
sure there's more uh so this is going to be a brief little segment here I'm G to
keep looking but this was another area that I've had some difficulty and
troubles real challenges trying to find cases in turns out it's not a huge town
and that's one of the reasons but I found a case so I'm still going to claim lay claim to the fact that every
location on our planet is being visited because you haven't stumped me yet this is a brief case but widely
viewed quite interesting fairly recent was 11:00 p.m july 23rd
1999 a woman and her husband both truck drivers were heading westbound on
Interstate 10 directly through the town of Van Horn she was driving he was asleep
suddenly the CB radio started coming alive with reports of a UFO in the area
and as the witness says I could not get a good look at it so I woke my husband
who looked out the mirror he said it looked just like a disc that you hear about when you think of UFOs it had blue
and white lights and was moving back and forth the white lights were the color of a strobe light very white and bright he
estimates it was between 1,000 to 1500 ft off the ground it was very clear out
and you could make out the shape from all the lights blinking I would say that there were at least 8 to 10 lights
everyone noticed and no one could figure out what it was it was still there when I left so there you MC beavers I found a
case again it's one but I'm sure there's more out there and I'll keep looking like I said uh but I'm still sticking to
my guns here every location on this planet has a long history of UFO
encounters even if it's just a couple of sightings so let's move to our last and
final location for this episode and this location is Grand Junction
Colorado Colorado has a lot of cases I wrote a whole book on just Colorado UFO
incidents so that gave me a little bit of a leg up here and doing research uh this is by special request
from Deborah and Deborah I think you find these cases quite interesting again I tried to focus on
the most interesting cases not ones of just anomalous lights at night and I found some really good and unusual ones
particularly one involving an alleged alien artifact you can make up your own
minds about it but I will certainly present the evidence as we know it the first really good Grand Junction
Colorado case I could find occurred in 1956 four Witnesses were overlooking a
canyon in Glade Park just is just west of Grand Junction when they heard a very loud whoosing noise and as one of the
witnesses Ben R wsmith says quote although there were four of us only two
of us could see three round metallic looking discs they were moving very fast probably 500 y
above us all of us heard the noise though they were flying in a formation with the larger one in front and two
smaller ones to the sides they were probably in our view for one minute or
so so that's strange there's a number of cases where there's a group of witnesses and only some are seeing the objects
here's another case October 26th 1962 a rash of sightings hit the Grand
Junction area three Witnesses reported seeing white cone-shaped objects
hovering in the Eastern sky on the Western Slope lots of descriptions of
cone-shaped objects here's another one 6 years later April 14
1968 a man was driving from Grand Junction to Alamosa at about 10 a.m and
at a point between Grand Junction and Delta he said he saw a shiny object
which reflected a light so bright that it hurt his eyes to look at it now he briefly thought it was a helicopter but
stopped to watch it because it was unusual at which point it came towards his car and actually landed about a
fourth of a mile away just beyond a hill he said it was round spinning like a top
reflected the Sun or was giving off a brilliant light he's not sure which he
stopped to see if it would appear again but it did not he estimated it was about 80 ft in diameter and he said that it
appeared to actually strike the hill before disappearing behind it here's another one one year later 700 p.m june
15 1969 the witness is 14 years old and he
was walking with his brother down Main Street in Grand Junction and they were on their way to a bookstore when they
became distracted by a whistling sound coming from overhead and as the witness
says we looked up and saw a silver saucer that had windows and lights
flashing underneath it it wasn't Dark Yet it stood there for at least 2
minutes was parallel with the mountain bell tower on eth and Main Street then
it flew in a Flash towards the southern sky so both the Witnesses were very
impressed but as they say we did not report it because we were afraid people
would make fun of us but 44 years later at age 58 when did decide to report his
encounter to the National UFO Reporting Center here's a really interesting case
of a landed UFO which came into the sheriff's department on July 1st 1982
when an anonymous caller said that he saw this weird craft landing on top of a mountain near the West End of debeck
Canyon he said he saw it around 1223 a.m while he was driving along US
Highway 6 and he said saw several other cars watching it too but they apparently
became frightened and sped away now this next case has got to be one of the
strangest stories not only in Grand Junction but in the history of UFOs it's fairly well known if you
haven't heard of it you probably should have was around 2: to 3:00 a.m one very
early summer morning in 1985 when Bob White and his friend Jan
were driving near Grand Junction and Janet first noticed this quote strange
bright light very low to the ground she was driving Bob was asleep so she woke
him up and she appeared to him to be upset and frightened and asked him if he knew what this light might be and he
told her it was probably connected to the railroad which was running alongside the highway he didn't think too much of
it closed his eyes but a few minutes later she alerted him again that the light was now as big as the full moon
and coming around a corner in the road they both saw it hovering very low over a field both were very impressed by this
they turned off the headlights drove a little bit closer to it down the road
then pulled over to watch this light which was now they estimate only about 200 ft away now Janet at this point was
afraid to the point of tears and begged Bob to leave but Bob was very curious so
he got out of the the car to investigate he said this object was really bright
far too bright to see any structure behind it and as he's looking at it Jan
suddenly turns on the car headlights and as if in response this object immediately zooms upward and seems to
connect to another glowing object and as Bob says it looked like two long blue
tubular lights one on top of the other with a space in between
seemed as though there was an explosion when they connected and another object was propelled from them I watched the
object which looked like a fireball descend back towards me this object
whatever it was hit the ground in about the same place that the original light had been I saw where it hit the hillside
so I followed a Groove in the ground and there it lay was still glowing and I could tell it was hot so this very much
impressed by as you can imagine he returned to the car comforted Jan told
her to get out of the driver's seat he would drive after uh he checked out this object she
was in no shape to drive she's still very tearful and Afraid so he looked around in his car
for something to pick this object up with he found a glove and returned to the site and this object was still there
it was no longer glowing it had clearly cooled off and he was able to pick it up
it was like larger than his hand quite heavy and he carried it back into the
car now this artifact would soon become the center of attention in the UFO
community and the subject of incredible controversy and of course study B Bob began to share what happened
with others in the UFO community and with scientists and he had the object
analyzed in fact he had it analyzed over and over again in numerous scientific
and metallurgical Labs there was a lot of analyses on this
object some of which varied from each other but readings showed that it was
largely aluminum but none of the labs had ever seen anything like it they were quite puzzled by its structure unable to
account for it in fact some Labs took pieces of it and never returned them and
ultimately it was found to contain a pretty wide variety of elements was 85%
alumin but also silicon iron calcium sulfur
copper magnesium zinc titanium the list goes on and metallurgists have offered
various opinions saying it was a natural metallic stalagmite or the result of a
plasma ball of lightning hitting the Earth some accused him of outright fakery something which Bob vehemently
denies as he says I've sunk my life savings into this and he said he was
actually offered $100,000 for this object which he declined he did do the whole UFO lecture
circuit showing it off he later apparently did try to sell it for a million dollars he ended up writing a
book about this whole experience which is called UFO hard evidence it's all
about his encounter and his attempts to have this evidence analyzed and
explained and no one has ever satisfactorily debunked this case or explained exactly what this object is
sadly Bob passed away in 2009 but the artifact now remains at the Museum of
the Unexplained aerial anomalies research group headed by Larry cander
and yeah it apparently remains unexplained on the morning of April 1st
1989 an army officer was walking along Redlands Express in Grand Junction and
he says he saw a dark object object moving overhead at about 8,000 ft
altitude and after traveling across the sky this object suddenly dropped down
until it was only 50 ft over a nearby rock formation at which point it seemed
to transfer into a brilliant white sphere it moved about a mile changed to
a brilliant orange and it hovered for about 10 minutes then shot upwards back to about 8,000 ft passing directly
underneath a jet aircraft wasn't over yet finally it moved North turned white
again made periodic flashes of light before moving away a pretty dramatic
sighting in fact the next day an article appeared in the Rocky Mountain news that
the Grand Junction radar system operated by the FAA had experienced software
problems that had caused glitches that made it look like there were flying objects over Grand Junction sound the
little bit like a debunking explanation to explain radar blips when someone is
there actually watching an object the day after that the witness said he observed a C130 plane traveled
200 ft above the ground where the object had been hovering the army officer who also
worked as a police officer and has been a candidate for public office believes
he saw a genuine UFO as he says what I saw was beyond the scope of of our
military and industrial machine here's another really interesting case which occurred in 1995 when Grand Junction
disc jockey Robert St John was out jogging and he saw a craft moving
overhead he said it seemed to eject two smaller crafts which moved directly into
the ground that was his impression but what's interesting about this is it was that same day that Tim Edwards of celita
got worldwide headlines when he captured video ape of a UFO it's a vide tape that
would be called among the top 10 footage best footage of UFOs ever captured it's
really quite impressive another case one year later June 16 1996 a couple was fishing at surface
Creek Lake when something very odd happened suddenly their fishing bobber
flew 30 ft up into the air whizzed towards them and landed at their feet
something a fish can't make it do they didn't do it something caused this to happen and it freaked them out so they
grabbed their fishing gear hopped into their car and drove off and as they did
they said they saw unexplained lights hovering at Treetop level nearby it's
only a 10-minute drive to their home but weirdly they said when they got home it
was a half hour later so they were missing 20 minutes of time perhaps this
was an onboard encounter or more extensive than just a sighting here is another case around sunset September 19
2014 a man was hunting in the wilderness near Grand Junction when he saw an
enormous disc-shaped object flying above two airliners it really impressed him he
grabbed his pair of binoculars and it could see that this object was flattish except it had a large dome in the center
and it was much Lar larger than the planes so it was huge and as the witness says I was trying to understand what I
was seeing when three jet fighters banked over Grand Junction one of the
jet fighters got on a straight course towards the huge object and hit his
afterburners as the jet approached mysterious disc-like object faded away
after the jet moved on another small starlike object reappeared in the same
spot so this witness thought it might actually be a star until another jet fighter flew right over Grand Junction
heading directly for this object which promptly disappeared the entire encounter he says lasted about 15
minutes so there you go that's just a brief glimpse into UFO activity in Grand
Junction Colorado quite a few cases there it's amazing seeing all these
cases involving UFO Landings and sightings and
humanoids cases where these craft are being chased by our military all of it makes it very clear that our governments
do know a lot about this subject far more than they're revealing while we have had steps towards disclosure I
honestly think it's disingenuous they know a lot more than they're saying they have the proof they have the evidence
and again what we're seeing here in the public arena is just the very beginning
of what's really going on behind the scenes so I always encourage people to
step forward tell your encounters you can always be anonymous but it's important because
it's time that the world knows that this is all completely real we are being
visited there's no doubt about it and those of you who've had
