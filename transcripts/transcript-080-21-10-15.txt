HEALED BY LIGHTNING: 30 TRUE CASES (AND THE LINK TO UFO HEALINGS)
Oct 15, 2021

Summary:
Oct 15, 2021
Your chances of being struck by lightning are very slim, only about 1 in 50,000. And yet, each year approximately 2000 people are killed by lightning strikes. Many more people suffer severe injuries. However, very rarely, something strange and miraculous happens: people are actually healed. As strange as this sounds, lightning has actually cured people of a wide variety of illnesses and diseases. 

Being cured by lightning may sound like science fiction, but it's actually very well documented. Cases reach back all the way to the 1700s and are still occurring today. Men, women and children all across the planet have reported these healings, many of which are verified by doctors. People have been cured of paralysis, cancer, blindness, deafness, rheumatism, typhoid fever, asthma, muscular dystrophy and more. There are even a few cases involving animals! What is it about lightning that is causing people to be healed?

Lightning has some very interesting properties. It is extremely hot (3 times hotter than the surface of the sun.) It is also highly magnetic. People are not only healed by lightning, they are sometimes levitated off the ground. 

Some of these effects are shockingly similar to beams of lights from UFOs. In fact, there are now more than 300 documented cases of UFO healings. Many of the UFO healings are done using beams of light. UFO beams are also known to burn people, levitate them, cause temporary paralysis and more. Have the ETs learned how to harness the mysterious properties of lightning? One thing is certain, they know more about the electromagnetic spectrum than we do.

What is it like to be healed by lightning? How do these cases take place? What do they have to teach us about the power of light?

This video presents more than 30 cases of people who have been healed as the result of a lightning strike. These cases reveal a mysterious and powerful aspect of light that we have yet to understand.

If you would like to explore more about lightning cures, and healings by UFO beams, you may be interested in my book, "The Healing Power of UFOs: 300 True Accounts of People Healed by Extraterrestrials." The book also contains a section on people who have been healed by lightning. Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode healed by lightning 30 true cases and the connection to ufo healings this 
may sound very unusual but it's absolutely true a lot of people have been healed as a result 
of being struck by lightning and there are some very interesting similarities to people who have 
been healed as a result of a ufo encounter so that's what I want to talk about today 
i've got more than 30 cases first-hand cases of people who have experienced this 
i will say this is quite unusual lightning is actually very dangerous and kills many people 
each year but there are these few cases in which people have actually been healed 
it's really quite striking very unusual and that's what I want to talk about today 
probably the expert in these kinds of cases the first person to really look into it 
is a professor his name is panos t pappas phd and he is a professor of physics and mathematics 
at the technological educational institute in athens greece he's definitely one of the world's 
leading researchers into healings by lightning and compiled many true life cases I found many more 
they reach back hundreds of years and are continuing to the current day let's just get 
started because there are so many cases the earliest case I could find occurred in 1776 
to miss wynn of dublin ireland miss wynn was suffering from a large tumor in her left breast 
and was facing surgery to have it removed and this is when something miraculous happened 
while she was on her way home one day she was struck by lightning it went right through her 
body knocking her unconscious and when she woke up she was fine but she did go to the doctor 
and when he examined her tumor he got a big surprise her tumor which had been really hard 
was now soft and appeared to be shrinking and in fact over a period of two weeks 
it shrank completely and disappeared her doctor dr georges hicks was so impressed by this that he 
decided to do some experiments and he says that he was able to cure two other women of tumors 
by using electrical stimulation on their tumors so this was the earliest case I 
could find but there are many many more i'll just go through them chronologically 
the next case I could find occurred in 1806 to a gentleman by the name of samuel 
leffers in north carolina he's a very prominent man in his community and a few months before 
this in 1806 he had suffered a severe stroke this left him disabled he was partially paralyzed 
suffered from numbness vision loss and difficulty in speaking and it was a few months later he was 
struck by lightning it was a pretty severe strike he was in his house it did quite a bit of damage 
it knocked him out but when he woke up he first discovered that he no longer needed glasses to see 
and not only that he was no longer paralyzed and another weird result was that his skin tone 
improved dramatically his wrinkles went away and his skin tone became very smooth 
he was quite elderly at the time so this was a very interesting result 
another very interesting case occurred just a few years later in 1822 this was reported 
in the american journal of science uh the witness involved was named martin rockwell of connecticut 
and he was 10 feet away from a lightning strike and felt only a brief paralysis 
and a numbness that lasted for about an hour he said he also felt a burning in his chest 
at the time he suffered from pretty severe asthma but following this lightning strike his asthma 
cleared up and never returned again so here we have lightning carrying all kinds of illnesses 
uh here's another very interesting case which occurred on april 16 19 18 28 
aboard a ship called the new york the ship was sailing towards liverpool england carrying a full 
complement of passengers and it was struck by lightning on the morning of april 19th 
and this was a very severe lightning strike it shattered the the main mast 
it demolished the walls of the storeroom removed several planks from the hall doors 
and partitions were thrown open a large mirror and a cabin was shattered into small fragments 
many parts of the ship were damaged it actually sprung a leak none of the passengers were injured 
thankfully but one passenger was apparently healed this passenger was suffering from paralysis he 
was an elderly gentleman who was paralyzed for about five years and partially paralyzed 
and was only able to walk about a half mile at a time uh before being overcome with weakness 
well this lightning strike uh came right near him he jumped up and ran and apparently this 
cured him following this lightning strike he no longer suffered from this partial paralysis 
there were some other interesting results of this lightning strike every instrument on the ship that 
was made of steel including the carpenters tools all the knives and forks that and anything made 
of soft iron even the nails in every part of the ship all of them had been rendered permanently 
magnetic so this is a very interesting effect from lightning another case 1846 
involved an african-american slave a woman who was quite elderly she was 70 years old 
she was struck by lightning and even though she had gone through menopause some 20 years earlier 
following this lightning strike she began having her period again she began menstruating and did so 
for the next three years so I don't know what's going on here but it's having really profound 
effect on people's bodies and many of these cases are very well verified another case comes from the 
very respected landsat medical journal and talks about a gentleman named ruben he is 
a farmer from yorkshire england this occurred around 1850 and the farmer was suffering from 
cancer on his chin and lower lip one day he was out plowing a field with his two horses 
and they were all struck by lightning his two horses were killed but reuben not only survived 
his cancer went into sudden and complete remission the senior surgeon at the lloyd cottage hospital 
where reuben was being treated wrote and I quote what seems to be the most astonising feature in 
this case is the healing process which was set up in the lip and chin soon after the accident 
the cancer gradually lessened and in a few weeks every trace of the disease structure disappeared and for 10 years he enjoyed complete freedom from his former suffering 
and signs of the disease so yeah cured of cancer by a lightning strike 
another amazing case occurred in 1891 to a german man who was paralyzed in both his 
feet his caretakers had actually taken him outside for a bath and forgot about him a lightning storm 
rolled in there was a huge lightning strike and this is when his caretakers realized that they had left this poor man outside they were going to go run out to find him but in he walked of his own 
volition he had been cured of his paralysis in both his feet this caused quite a stir in 
the medical community at the time and it was one year later that there was another remarkable case 
this one in new york has reported by the new york times it occurred on june 10th 1892 
to a hotel keeper by the name of newton wurst he had been deaf for many years he was actually right 
next to a tree that got struck by lightning he was stunned by the lightning strike but when he 
recovered he was very happy because his deafness was gone his hearing had been completely restored 
and it's not the only case this also extends to animals a very interesting case occurred in 1896 
a hog farmer by the name of mr graf in kokomo indiana was transporting a load of pig carcasses 
dead pigs who were all victims of cholera his wagon was struck by lightning and this actually 
caused one of the carcasses one of the pigs to become re-animated this pig actually ran from the 
wagon the farmer chased it down and captured it and this pig showed no signs of cholera 
and appeared to be completely healthy so yeah that sounds very frankenstein-esque but this 
is what the report says and it's not unique and in fact it was just uh five years later in 1901 
when a nearly a very similar case occurred also involving pigs this case occurred in tupai china 
again a pig farmer was dealing with a litter of 11 pigs each of whom was suffering from paralysis 
in their hind legs and then their sty was struck by lightning all of the little baby 
piglets were knocked unconscious but upon awakening their hind legs moved normally 
so yeah this extends to animals as well another amazing case occurred on july 23rd 1897 as 
reported by the new york times a policeman by the name of shrop in washington new jersey 
was on the beat patrolling the area at the time he was suffering from rheumatism and indigestion 
which he had for a couple of months suddenly there was a strike of lightning 
right near him he fell to the ground his uniform was pretty much torn off of his body 
his brass buttons on his uniform were melted his billy club was shattered to bits but 
the good news was his rheumatism and his indigestion was gone moving along in 1899 
eli forbes uh who had lost the use of his left arm due to rheumatism was struck by lightning 
as soon as this lightning struck him his left arm straightened out and he felt a surge of strength 
pulls through him following the lightning strike he was now able to use his arm normally 
and his rheumatism was gone and another case of involving a cure for rheumatism 
occurred just a few years later in july of 1902 this was reported in the boston globe 
and the minneapolis journal the gentleman his name was jonathan w james of queens river road 
island and he was struck by lightning and it completely cured him of his rheumatism
many many cases three years later in 1905 a new york socialite by the name of miss 
warren williams was close to death with typhoid fever and blood poisoning 
she was lying in her bedroom when lightning struck struck and actually set the bedroom on fire 
her husband ran in and pulled her out of the room and carried her to her neighbor's house he called the doctor fearing the worst but according to her physician dr kaufman not only 
was miss williams fine she no longer suffered from typhoid fever so she was cured absolutely cured
the doctor was asked about how this could have happened and his reply was that quote 
the flash of lightning which filled the room had some strange effect
so there's clearly something going on here that we don't fully understand 
and there are more modern cases in 1907 a 13 year old girl in salem massachusetts 
was suffering from epilepsy she was struck by lightning and following this lightning strike she 
no longer had any more epileptic fits it cured her one year later james gorsuch of new york 
was struck by lightning at the time he was partially blind and deaf due to about with 
scarlet fever in his childhood he's now an adult so he'd suffered from partial blindness 
and deafness for years but during an electrical storm he felt really strong electrical sensations 
and this restored first his hearing and over the next few days his vision was also restored 
so this I mean this is amazing what is happening here here's a case which occurred in 1908 
this occurred to walter keane of new jersey who suffered from rheumatism was bad enough 
that he had to walk with the cane until he was struck by lightning he says this lightning strike 
actually nearly killed him but afterwards he was healed of his rheumatism unfortunately this 
was a temporary cure and after about three months his rheumatism started to come back 
one year later in 1909 mr beasley of melbourne australia was struck by lightning at the time 
he was suffering from rheumatic gout and could walk only with difficulty he had to use a cane 
he was struck by lightning and his health returned to normal really amazed not only him but all the people who knew him witnessed this
and there's many other cases most of the cases are in fact modern cases on july 15 1911 
miss jane decker who was 65 years old and profoundly deaf since childhood was struck by 
lightning while in her home in connecticut this strike left her sore and bedridden for several 
days but incredibly it also restored her ability to hear as was reported in the new york times her 
hearing is now so good that she is able to carry on a conversation in an ordinary tone of voice 
and if you don't believe that case there's always another case right after it that same year in 
fargo north dakota a medical doctor by the name of c h geary was struck by lightning in his home 
at the time he suffered from paralysis but immediately following the strike the movement of his limbs was restored and he quickly improved to completely normal 
health here's a case from new orleans in louisiana this occurred in 1911 to a young girl named 
jessie vichelle she suffered from an illness which caused her to lose her ability to speak 
and her family took her to a series of doctors 17 different doctors in fact none who of whom were 
able to help her the family was praying for some kind of miracle and this is when lightning struck 
literally and it frightened the girl so badly that she miraculously recovered her ability 
to speak also in 1912 october 18th 1912 a man from chicago was struck by lightning 
and it cured him of his rheumatism but just for 24 hours so apparently it was a temporary cure 
and as the article said the method may be all right but the difficulty of making it practical 
comes in securing your bolts on schedule in 1912 polly harper of harpersville new york 
was sitting in a chair in her backyard when a bolt of lightning struck nearby knocking her 
unconscious she was unconscious for several hours and finally woke up but at the time of 
the lightning strike she was bound to a wheelchair with chronic rheumatism and when she woke up her 
rheumatism was gone she was now healthy sometimes lightning not actually cures a person but makes 
them stronger there are two such cases which occurred in 1912. one occurred to a telegraph 
employee who was suffering from delicate health and he was a victim of lightning strike and after 
being struck by lightning and recovering from it he says he became much more healthy robust and 
strong and the same thing happened to another gentleman by the name of mr rold he was also 
suffering from weak health was struck by lightning and afterwards became much stronger and we've 
seen cases where animals have been healed well this app actually occurs to plant life as well 
there's a very interesting case in which a poplar tree was struck by lightning and following being 
struck by lightning this particular poplar tree started to grow at a much more vigorous rate and 
actually outpaced all the other identical popular trees around it became much taller and larger than 
all its surrounding trees so apparently lightning can actually have an effect on plant life as well
another case august 24th 1915 mrs charles a burdick of berlin connecticut was struck 
by lightning in her home that was a pretty severe lightning strike it knocked her down 
and destroyed uh her house pretty bad caused about a thousand dollars worth of damage and destroyed 
articles in all eight rooms of her house but the most amazing thing was the cure she experienced 
at the time she suffered from rheumatism but following this lightning strike her rheumatism 
disappeared she was cured a lot of cases of people cured of rheumatism
in 1916 mr h f riley of wilkes-barre pennsylvania was struck by lightning it actually threw him out 
of his chair and upon awakening he realized he no longer felt any pain he had been suffering from 
rheumatism for about five years but following this lightning strike his rheumatism was gone
another case involved actually two people this occurred in april 1921 in the edmonton area of 
london england a thunderstorm struck it was very severe it actually blew out the windows of several 
homes and a mother and her two boys suffered a near lightning strike and were actually burned 
pretty severely by it but was most amazing is her two young boys were deaf but following this 
lightning strike their hearing was restored so it actually cured two people in one strike
this is just really quite miraculous in 1925 miss john divini of beverly pennsylvania had 
lost had lost the use of her arm and she was sitting out on her veranda and was struck by 
lightning and this restored her arm it was no longer paralyzed and she enjoyed good health
also that same year 1925 a gentleman a 67 year old gentleman by the name of noah 
w myers also suffered from paralysis of his left arm and he was out camping in bakersfield 
california near his home and he was inside his tent and holding a metal cooking utensil 
when he was struck by lightning on his arm and the tent hit I mean the lightning hit the metal 
cooking utensil and uh went right through the utensil and struck myers it burned a 
spot about six inches diameter under his left arm he went to see a doctor and the 
physician declared that the patient would be just fine but most amazing is that noah myers 
was able now to use his left arm again it was no longer paralyzed
many cases here's a very famous case which occurred in june of 1932 to a gentleman by the name of thomas young he was a farmer from dukedom tennessee 
and he was suffering from cancer of the mouth and he was expected to die from it 
he was very near death it had spread through his body and he was reclining in a hammock 
when one of the trees that the hammock was tied to was struck by lightning and thomas felt this 
bolt of lightning travel right through him it actually ripped the shoes right off of his body 
but in the days that followed the cancer which had spread throughout his body completely disappeared 
something very profound is happening here and there's so many cases I think that they 
really deserve more attention than they're getting a lot of people don't know about this it's another very famous case occurred in 1934 to a little four-year-old girl by the name of muriel 
firmly she was blind from birth and she she was sitting on the couch of her home in london england 
when lightning struck nearby causing her to lose consciousness she woke up the next 
morning and everyone was shocked including her because she could see 
for the first time in her life only a few weeks earlier she had been examined by doctors 
for her condition and they had pronounced her condition absolutely incurable and then 
she was struck by lightning and she could see healed of profound blindness rheumatism 
does seem to be the most popular cure by lightning and here's another case which occurred in 
willow springs illinois to a gentleman by the name of john latz this occurred in 1934 john latz was 
suffering from rheumatism and then he was struck by lightning and cured and as he says I am a 
humanitarian and would not conceal this discovery for financial purposes so I gladly make it public
here's another amazing case in march of 1936 a lady by the name of adeline slover what suffered 
from arthritis for 15 years was struck by lightning this arthritis was pretty severe 
it was so bad that she couldn't even raise her arms and was unable to walk she was basically uh 
wheelchair-bound and she was struck by lightning and it caused a complete reversal of her condition 
as adeline says in her own words it flashed before my face and I fell back stunned 
then I began to shake all over I felt strength surging into my arms and legs ever since 
it was a miracle sent from heaven so following this lightning strike she returned to normal 
health and was able to take walks around the neighborhood and this was very well verified 
there are many many cases some quite recent in june of 1980 edwin robinson of fall mouth maine 
was blind and deaf and disabled due to a vehicle accident which occurred in 1971 
nine years earlier and in june of 1980 he was walking outside uh with his metal cane
near his garage at this time he was 62 years old and suddenly he was struck by lightning 
and following this lightning strike his hearing and his vision were restored 
and his partial paralysis went away and not only that he started to grow hair on his bald spot this 
is a very well verified case it got quite a bit of publicity he's done a lot of interviews about 
this so yeah he was cured not only of blindness deafness and paralysis but of baldness as well
one of the most amazing cases appeared on a segment of unsolved mysteries 
and it involves a lady by the name of mary clamser of oklahoma city oklahoma at age 19 mary clamser 
was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and she suffered from the disease for more than 20 years 
it was gradually getting worse and more severe and at some point she reached a point where her 
legs were completely numb and she could no longer walk unassisted that all changed on august 14 1994 
mary clamser was inside her home when she was struck by lightning it caused burns and 
other harmful side effects but she instantly began a miraculous recovery from her multiple 
sclerosis feeling came back into her legs and less than one month later she began walking again 
as she says I knew something had changed I was so overwhelmed that I started to cry
so many many cases I mean here's another one which occurred in 2001.
i'll just let the witness describe what happened to them in their own words as the witness says 
i was struck on april 20 2001 I have dealt with severe eczema on my hands for several years 
but since the lightning strike my hands healed up almost completely another very recent case 
occurred in 2007 to a gentleman by the name of sam woodruff of oklahoma city he was struck by 
lightning and at the time he had just given up radiation treatments for lung cancer and was in 
a steady decline he was not expected to survive but after being struck by lightning his appetite 
started to come back he started gaining weight and further tests medical tests revealed that his lung 
cancer had mysteriously disappeared he absolutely attributes this to the lightning strike he did a 
whole uh interview on youtube about this it's a very really amazing case and one of several in 
which people have been cured what appears to be chronic cancer as a result of a lightning strike
here's another case july of 2009 donald marsolay of cornwall 
england was struck by lightning while taking shelter from a storm under a tree 
and at the time he had suffered from partial paralysis due to a stroke three years earlier 
but following the lightning strike his paralysis cleared up he was back to normal health
another modern case august 17 2009 a woman from serbia suffered from arrhythmia an 
abnormal uh beating of her heart and she was struck by lightning and was lucky to survive 
because many people are struck by lightning do not survive or suffer from very severe health problems 
but in these rare cases it sometimes heals people and she survived and not only did 
she survive she was cured of arrhythmia her long-standing heart condition was completely gone 
so these are only a few of the many many documented cases of people who have been 
struck by lightning and healed just one final case for you the most recent I could find 
occurred in july of 2017 to a 16 year old girl by the name of faith mobley and she was 
actually at work she was doing dishes at the mcdonald's drive-through in haleyville alabama 
when lightning struck her it hit the restaurant traveled through the pipes 
to where she was doing the dishes and went right through the drive-through headset that she was wearing and exited through her left foot creating a large hole in her shoe 
she was knocked unconscious but was saved by a co-worker who called 9-1-1 
and faith later gave an interview and said that when she was struck she felt her whole 
body tighten up then she became completely numb and lost consciousness the only injury was a burn 
on her foot where the lightning had left her body at the time she suffered from poor eyesight 
but miraculously following this lightning strike her eyesight was improved before she had worn 
glasses but she did not need them any longer she had normal vision and here's another really weird 
effect it actually changed the color of her eyes before the lightning strike faith's eyes were dark 
green she says following this lightning strike her eyes became much lighter in color and are now 
light green her doctor dr james wong says and I quote this is the first time i've ever seen or 
heard of this but it's a great thing that it happened and we're very happy for her
so yeah there you go there's more than 30 cases of people healed as a result of being struck by 
lightning I would reiterate that this is probably not something you should seek out lightning is 
very very dangerous but in these rare cases people have been healed and this does have a very strong 
connection to cases in which people were healed as a result of a ufo encounter most of the cases 
of people who are healed as a result of a ufo encounter were healed using lights beams of light 
perhaps they were struck by a beam of light from a ufo or sometimes it's a handheld instrument 
being held by the ETs themselves who use it to heal a person of a wide variety of conditions 
i should note that these beams of light coming from ufos have many remarkable 
properties that are similar to lightning in some cases people have been burned in other 
cases they have been levitated lightning is also known to do this it will lift a person 
right off the ground and levitate you it will sometimes burn you and it will sometimes heal you 
i covered more than 300 cases of people healed as a result of a ufo encounter in my book 
the healing power of ufos and I also included a section about these lightning strike cases 
because of the remarkable similarities and I think we have something to learn from cases like these 
it shows that uh use of the electromagnetic spectrum use of electricity and light 
has a profound effect on healing and that there should be more research done into this 
thankfully doctors have started to recognize the healing power of light they are using it to 
cure jaundice in babies electrical stimulation is being used to speed up the healing of wounds also 
doctors are using electrical stimulation of muscle tissue to not only reduce pain or prevent 
atrophy but actually to stimulate muscle growth and more and more research is being done 
into the uses of light and light beams in terms of healing in fact there's a really interesting study 
going on right now at tel aviv university which is showing that lightning and electromagnetic 
fields given off by lightning actually might protect living cells from certain kinds of damage 
this is being studied by professor colin price and i'd just like to quote what he's saying about this
at any given time two thousand thunderstorms are raging across the surface of our planet 
and it's the energy from these lightning strikes that resonate through a cavity between the earth's 
surface and the ionosphere this is known as the schumann resonances and they produce extremely 
low frequency electromagnetic fields and it's this is what dr khan price is studying 
professor colin price and i'll just quote colin price in his own words as he says we found that 
under controlled conditions the schumann resonance fields certainly had an effect on living tissues 
the most important fact was that the atmospheric elf fields extremely low frequency fields actually 
protected cells under stress conditions in other words when biological cells are under stress due 
to lack of oxygen for example the atmospheric fields from lightning appear to protect protect 
them from damage this may be related to the evolutionary role these fields have played on 
living organisms it is the first study that demonstrates a link between global lightning 
activity and the schumann residences and the activity of living cells it may explain why 
all living organisms have electrical activity in the same elf spectral range and is the first time 
such a connection has been shown this may have some therapeutic implications down the line 
since these elf fields appear to protect cells from damage but this requires further research
so yeah amazing people are being healed as a result of lightning strikes and as we've seen 
it's cured people of a wide variety of conditions paralysis blindness deafness asthma rheumatism 
i mean cancer several cancer cases and even curing animals and in one case seeming to bring 
a pig back to life so this just goes to show how little we understand the electromagnetic spectrum 
and I think it definitely should encourage people to look more into the possible uses of electricity 
for healing purposes and that's why I wanted to do this video today because 
i think it shows what amazing potential that the electromagnetic spectrum holds for healing 
so that's it for today thanks once again for listening and watching I 
really appreciate it I hope you guys enjoyed it and learned something keep asking questions 
keep searching for answers and most importantly keep having fun
