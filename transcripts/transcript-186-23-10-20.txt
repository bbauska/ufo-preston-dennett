ALIENS, ALIENS, ALIENS! 100 YEARS OF HUMANOIDS: THIRTEEN TRUE UFO CASES
Oct 20, 2023

Summary:
Oct 20, 2023
Aliens, aliens, aliens! People have been encountering humanoids for a very long time. In fact, there are strong indications that UFOs and extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth since recorded history. Only in the past century, however, has this subject been recognized, documented, and studied. This video presents 13 firsthand cases of face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials. These cases span more than 100 years, starting in the 1920s, all the way up through the 2020s. They come from all over the world. They feature a wide variety of humanoids. And many contain multiple witnesses and compelling physical evidence, including landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, physiological effects and more.

UNDER THE PROTECTION OF ALIENS. In Aug 1923, Jacques B Bley (age 12) suffered from obesity, until he was visited by ETs in his home in Barcelona, Spain. Feeding him a mysterious substance, they healed Jacques and changed the course of his life forever.

THE ALIEN IN THE BACKYARD. One day in 1930, Joseph and Ella Rankin were shocked to see a large UFO hover overhead and then land in the backyard of their home in Greensboro, NC. Inside they saw a strange humanoid. It was an experience they kept secret for many years.

THE ALIEN WHO CAME TO SAY HELLO. On Jul 9, 1947, an unnamed merchant seaman from Houston, TX called the Houston Post to report a unique encounter. He said that a saucer landed by his home and out stepped a humanoid. The ET approached, shook his hand, then departed as quickly as he arrived.

THE HANDSOME HUMAN-LOOKING ALIEN. On Aug 20, 1954, sisters Aasta Solvang and Edith Jacobsen were picking blueberries near their home in Mosjoen, Norway when they were approached by a strange man. He spoke in a foreign language, then led them to a flying saucer parked in the forest.

THE ALIEN AT THE ICE-SKATING RINK. It was a sunny morning on Nov 28, 1972 as Mario Mercier ice-skated next to his home in La Sarre, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a weird cloudlike object landed and out stepped three robotic figures. By the time the encounter ended, there would be physical evidence.

THE ALIEN IN THE LIVING ROOM. On Nov 28, 1972, Alfonso Rey was watching TV in his home in Tres Arroyos, Argentina when his TV failed. As he got up to fix it, a strange-looking spaceman appeared in his living room, beginning a strange interaction that would result in a miraculous healing.

THE ALIEN AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. On the night of Feb 4, 1973, Brian Hunt and Sharyn Finckler drove along the Eyre Highway near Kimba, Australia and saw an amazing sight. Alongside the road was a glowing humanoid. They fled in fear. Little did they know, other people also saw the weird ET.

THE CROSS-EYED ALIENS. Around 2:00 am on Apr 30, 1983, Madame X of Sospel, France woke up to see a glowing red sphere in her bedroom. Moments later, four human-looking ETs appeared. And they had a profound message to share with her about the state of our world.

THE GIANT SILVER ALIEN. Tziporet Carmel of Kidima, Israel, was surprised to find herself waking up earlier than normal on Mar 20, 1993. She was even more surprised to look outside and see a huge silver craft landed in her backyard, and next to it, a giant silver alien. Her life would never be the same.

THE LITTLE GRAY ALIEN BOY. In Mar 1998, Felix Polanco had just begun to excavate a road near Fajardo, Puerto Rico when he saw something incredible in his headlights: a gray alien figure. It was definitely not human. Later that day, he and others would see a UFO in the same area.

THE FLYING ALIEN. When three residents of Narli, Turkey went to go plow their tobacco field on the morning of Jun 4, 2001, they were confronted by a 2-foot-tall flying humanoid. One of the witnesses, Fevzi Cam, tried to throw rocks at the short figure. Soon, others would see the weird alien.

APPROACHED BY AN ALIEN. On the evening of Feb 12, 2010, Roy Shaw, a retired engineer decided to take his dog, Sydney, for a walk in Phear Park, near his home in Exmouth, England. To their shock, they saw a landed UFO. Then a glowing figure exited the craft and began to approach them.

A NINE-FOOT-TALL ALIEN. On Sep 4, 1990, an unnamed man from Oregon stepped onto his patio around sunset and was amazed to see a 30-foot-diameter craft hovering only 50 feet above his neighbor’s roof. And inside, through a transparent dome, he saw a 9-foot-tall greenish-skinned creature.

These thirteen cases provide a mere glimpse into the huge number of extraterrestrial visitations that have been occurring across the globe for more than a century. With so many witnesses, so many cases, occurring year after year, decade after decade, and supported by compelling physical evidence, it’s time that humanity accepts we are not alone in this vast universe. In fact, the universe appears to be quite crowded! And one day, perhaps soon, everyone on Earth will become aware of this fact.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and 
the Paranormal today's episode I call aliens aliens aliens 100 Years of humanoids 13 true 
cases yeah it's a long title but this is going to be a long episode and it's on my favorite 
topic face-to-face encounters with humanoids I just really want to drive it home that people 
are seeing all different kinds of humanoids all over the world for a very long period of time 
so I have 13 cases I've chosen which I think each have something unique to provide to our 
understanding of extraterrestrial contact and yeah cases reaching back a 100 years from the 1920s all 
the way to the 2020s and these are cases coming from all over the world in Canada all across 
the United States South America all across Europe England turkey Israel Spain cases from Australia 
really all over the globe which again is an important fact a lot of people already know this 
but this is absolutely a global phenomenon and the variety of humanoids is truly astonishing what I 
also love about a lot of these cases is that they provide all kinds of really compelling evidence so 
once again we have pretty much the whole range of evidence involving everything from electromagnetic 
effects and Landing traces and medical effects all of these kinds of things uh so these are 
all important cases in their own right I think most of these are probably not very well known 
you may have heard of a few of them but actually I highly doubt it there are far more cases of this 
kind than most people realize it's one of the reasons I do this work because people need to 
know that this is going on so yeah a long episode today so let's just get started in the first case 
I want to talk about I call under the protection of aliens and this occurred a long time ago in 
August of 1923 in Barcelona Spain where all of his young life 12-year-old jacqu B bla suffered from 
pathological obesity which was causing all kinds of problems he was failing in school because of 
it and then one night in August of 1923 he felt compelled to go out onto the Terrace of his home 
which actually overlooked the ocean and this is when he saw an actual Fleet of quote delta-shaped 
vehicles of massive and metallic appearance and as he watched three of them rose up and to his 
amazement actually landed on his Terrace and they weren't huge as he said quote their Dimensions 
oscillated between 6 and 10 ft and as he watched one of them kind of fanned open in a very unusual 
way and out came this little man who he said was about 4T tall wearing a shiny cloth overall which 
covered most of his body and which seemed to Jac almost like it was covered with diamonds 
was very sparkly and per the witness this being then approached him quote hardly touching the 
ground with his feet so basically floated over to him and then said that they had quote taken 
him under their protection this point something very interesting happened this being gave him a 
large square piece of something that looked like chocolate of course it wasn't chocolate it tasted 
really bad kind of like tar but he did eat it and at this point the being said that jacqu would now 
become strong both in body and intelligence the being then re-entered into the craft and all three 
craft took off at high speed now the after effects of course were amazing the first after effect was 
that Jack said the taste of this chocolate I'll call it remained in his mouth for the 
rest of the day but immediately he began to notice improvements and over the next three years jacqu 
actually began to lose weight uh gain muscle mass and became a very powerful athlete did really well 
in school he later began performing as a gymnast at a circus and then became a mountain climber and 
he had some very amazing things happen to him uh he was involved in a war a conflict and he 
actually survived a gunfire attack from apparently hired Killers who fired at him from only 12 feet 
away but he says None of the bullets hit him and later he became a hugely successful businessman 
and was reportedly the wealthiest man in Andor he also later claimed to have the ability of handson 
healing so his case was investigated apparently by Antonio rera who wrote a book about him According 
to some sources this is under a pseudonym but is really Antonio rera and then he reportedly passed 
away in 2011 at age 100 certainly a controversial case and there are some who have criticized it or 
questioned its authenticity I think it's hard to say it certainly does have a lot of details 
we hear in other UFO accounts so you can make up your own mind about it but I think it was 
definitely worth presenting because it's quite popular in Spain actually and has been covered 
on a number of shows and here is another very interesting case I call this one the alien in 
the backyard this one occurred in May of 1930 in Greensboro North Carolina and there's some really 
interesting reasons that I have put this case forward so this case does come from researcher 
George D faucet who was given the account by Two Sisters Dr Katherine I Rankin and Mary Francis 
rank Ranken who was a school teacher now these sisters were told the story by their parents 
who told them that one day in May of 1930 during broad daylight they saw a UFO actually land in the 
backyard of their home on Pearson Street this is in Greensboro North Carolina they said this object 
was clearly not normal it moved both horizontally and vertically and when it landed they saw that it 
was shaped like a top dark in color and about 40 ft wide they said it appeared to be Hollow 
because inside they were startled to see through a window The Head and Shoulders of an occupant 
they couldn't see him super clearly but close enough that they could see that he wore a dark 
tight fitting garment and a tight fitting helmet over his head and they washed this for a good five 
or 10 minutes when suddenly without warning the object Rose vertically in perfect silence and 
moved off in into the distance so this was their very close encounter and Mr and Mrs Ranken later 
shared their sighting with their two daughters who shared it with researcher George D faucet 
what I like about this case is it was investigated by a professional researcher George faucet another 
interesting thing about it is that this occurred during broad daylight was a very close up Landing 
really no chances for misperception here also the main Witnesses never publicly reported it 
which means they weren't seeking publicity money or fame or anything like this which I think lends 
a level of authenticity and credibility to their account they never wavered from their story and 
only told it to their daughters and yeah it's just plain interesting and now we move to the 
next case which is quite brief but it's got some very interesting aspects to it for sure I call 
this one the alien who came to say hello this occurred on July 9 1947 literally days after 
the very famous Roswell UFO crash in New Mexico that's one of the reasons I wanted to present 
it I think that's an interesting coincidence and this one occurred in Houston Texas and as you'll 
see it's quite a strange case the main witness in this case is anonymous all we know is that he's a 
sailor a merchant Seaman and he called the Houston Post newspaper with an incredible story and as the 
reporter of the Houston Post says here is the dis yarn to end all saucer stories in a disc dizzy 
Nation at the time there was a huge Super Wave going on and of course this is days after the 
Roswell UFO crash but at any rate the Sailor told the reporter that he was absolutely sober did not 
drink but said that he was walking into his Acres Home aition in Houston Texas when quote a little 
man 2 feet tall and with a head the size of a basketball climbed out of the disc now he said 
it shook hands with him and then climbed back in and Whirled away Into the Blue now the reporter 
asked the Sailor did he look like a man from Mars and the Sailor reported I don't know I never saw 
a man from Mars a very short case admittedly that case was not investigated really at all it's just 
a very quick newspaper article and a conversation with a reporter but it's fascinating because the 
witness insists that he's telling the truth and as strange as the behavior of this Etc sounds I 
do know of many other cases where UFOs landed ET came out basically walked up to the witness just 
to say hello shake their hand go back into the craft and the craft takes off so in that regard 
it's not unique but certainly is unusual and quite a strange case to say the least and here is 
another case I love it that there's always another case cuz Skeptics can say where's the proof well 
there's an enormous amount of evidence and there's just case after case after case after case if even 
one of these is true it's a game Cher and I think probably most of them are true and this case is 
certainly interesting although controversial it was thoroughly investigated I call this one the 
handsome human-looking alien this occurred on August 20 1954 right at the beginning end of a 
massive wave which swept across Europe really mostly France but Italy as well and really all 
of Europe this one occurred in Mazin Norway it involves two witnesses and is a fascinating 
account of a human-looking ET the two witnesses in this case are again sisters their names are AA 
salang age 32 and her sister Edith Jacobson aged 24 both were married they were out with their 
Uncle picking blueberries they became separate from their uncle and while walking around looking 
for blueberries they saw a man approaching them from a distance now they thought at first that he 
was out there to pick blueberries too but he had nothing in his hands so they were very curious 
about that but still assumed he was just a normal person at some point that opinion would change 
because as I says we were frightened at first but the man appeared very friendly and stepped 
towards us we walked towards him and wondered who he was as we got near him he smiled and stretched 
out his hand I too smiled and held out my hand but he only brushed my palm with his then he 
began to talk but we didn't understand a word it didn't resemble any language I had heard so things 
were getting stranger he didn't shake hands like a normal person and this was a very strange language 
and according to the witnesses his voice was very soft and melodious and not unable to understand 
what he was saying they began to address him in of course their native tongue Norwegian and he 
didn't understand that so they tried French German and English but as they said and I quote he didn't 
seem to understand a word so at this point they're still thinking he must be a foreigner from another 
country but they began to examine him more closely because it was all very curious and 
as Edith says he was of medium height had Pleasant regular features and long hair with a natural wave 
he was rather dark we didn't notice the color of his eyes but I believe they were slightly oblique 
his hands were beautiful and expressive with fine long fingers he was clothed in a kind of greenish 
overall but as he wore a broad belt it could have been trousers and a blouse the blouse fitted 
closely at the neck I could not see any buttons zippers or Fasteners the thing that impressed us 
above all was the genuine friendliness he emanated it gave us a feeling of goodness and security so 
that we did not feel in the least bit alarmed at the encounter his smile convinced us that he did 
not contemplate anything evil so they elaborated and said that his hair while long was not past his 
shoulders uh that his eyes were somewhat slanted and unusual uh his overall was tight fitting and 
he seemed like a very very friendly person but it was clear to them both that there was a language 
barrier and this is when the man produced a mirror like sort of grayish tablet circular and 
a writing instrument of some kind they didn't pay too much attention to what it was because they were still thinking he's a normal guy but he began to draw several circles at which point he 
started gesturing to the landscape around them pointed to them at at himself and then another 
Circle and as Edith said I had the impression he wanted to tell us something about the solar system 
so she thought he was trying to explain where he came from and this is when she really started to 
get even more Curious both of them then the man motioned for them to follow him so they did and 
soon they approached a quote curious Contraption and according to the witnesses it looked like two 
quote pot lids placed edge to edge was metallic gray blue in color not super big about 10 ft wide 
and 5 feet tall at the most four or five feet and in fact it was so small that it really surprised 
Edith cuz she said there was no way a full-grown adult could even stand up inside it and as they 
started to get even closer the man motioned them to stop and not approach too closely and 
he started to walk towards the craft and as Edith says he then opened a kind of hatch at the top of 
the rim which encircled the thing crawled in and shut himself in presently we heard a faint humming 
like the droning of a large Bumblebee and the Curious vessel Rose slowly while rotating on its 
own axis so at this point the sisters now realized that this was very unusual this was probably a 
flying so ER that it had started to get some real attention and they watched as this craft rose to 
about 100 ft and then moved at quote tremendous speed and disappeared so they were absolutely 
exhilarated and Amazed by the sighting they vowed not to tell anyone for fear of being disbelieved 
did not tell their Uncle at first shortly after hooking up with them again but a few days later 
aa's husband noticed that she was sort of out of sorts and kept asking her questions about it and 
she revealed what happened and this was when word began to spread through this was a small 
town and soon the local police heard about it who brought both the girls in for questioning uh they 
interviewed them extensively actually went out to the site to look for any evidence which they 
couldn't find but by this point 6 days had passed but soon word spread and reporters started to 
come and interview the witnesses and this turned everything upside down as Edith said after that we 
couldn't venture out without being stopped in the street to tell the story a new many people laugh 
at us and many are angry because they believe we are pulling their legs but we have only told the 
story of something that definitely happened to us we saw it simultaneously and we reacted in the 
same way but the questioning we went through was so intense that at times I thought I would lose my 
reason I earnestly wish that some responsible person like a police official or a Parson had 
had the experience at least they would have been believed now their uncle was skeptical he wouldn't 
accuse the girls of outright lying but he did say that he just didn't believe in flying saucers 
however their mother says she knows her daughters wouldn't lie and she says I'm a obliged to believe 
that my daughters are telling the truth and that they have really seen what they say they have seen 
and many others who know the girls also vouched for their honesty so this was apparently Norway's 
first recorded Encounter of a landed UFO and humanoid and it pretty much split the town into 
two parts those who believed and those who didn't uh those who knew the girls did stand by them 
others were skeptical the police did say that the two witnesses were sober and trustworthy reporters 
repeatedly tried to catch them in contradictions but failed to do so reporters asked everyone in 
town many said that they absolutely believed the witnesses but didn't want their name used because 
there was so much controversy surrounding this incident what's super interesting is that project 
Bluebook actually heard about this case and apparently without doing any investigation said 
that the woman had seen an American Helicopter piloted by Billy Faro so reporters contacted him 
and he denied any such incident and explained that the description the woman gave didn't even 
come close to matching what he looked like and the two witnesses stuck to their story to the 
day they died and again as it turned out this was one of the first of a huge wave of saucer Landings 
that spread across Europe there's a lot to like about that account uh it's clear that while there 
was controversy in the town about whether or not these two sisters were telling the truth 
those who knew the sisters absolutely believed their story for the most part and again it was 
thoroughly investigated the details they describe are now well known but certainly weren't back then 
they also tried to keep it secret it was only one of the sisters who finally told her husband 
because he was so concerned about why she was acting so strangely that this case was revealed 
at all and was widely published in newspapers it's interesting that Project Blue Book took 
an interest in it and tried to debunk it with a ridiculous explanation as they often did but 
yeah certainly an interesting case and not unique there are many other cases like it but wow what an 
amazing experience those two sisters had and now we move to our next case moving through time this 
next case I call the alien at the ice skating rank this is a single witness case though it 
does involve some very interesting physical evidence it occurred on November 28th 1972 
this one occurred in Canada more specifically in lassar Quebec Canada and it's a unusual case for 
sure it was a cool Sunny morning around 10:30 a.m. again on November 28 1972 when 9-year-old 
Mario Mercier was ice skating on a natural sort of ice rink next to his home there were little 
goalies set up this is where people played hockey and he watched with astonishment as a strangely 
spherical quote White Cloud dropped rapidly from the sky and landed next to his house about 700 ft 
away and it was a tiny little thing about 7 feet in diameter but all Misty so he was wasn't sure 
what this thing was and he became even more shocked when three beings each about 4T tall 
Emer emerged from this quote Cloud these beings were clothed entirely in black and looked almost 
robotic they had very Square putt shoulders black Square helmets one of them was carrying a small 
black object in its hand which Mario said Look to Him like a kettle and to his amazement this being 
bent down and began to fill this container with snow at that point point the figure walked over 
to Mario's chicken Coupe and started to open the door this point Mario completely freaked out and 
he actually cried out audibly and apparently hearing Mario this being turned towards him 
and realized he was being observed Mario was frightened and hid in the hockey net at the end 
of the rink as this being quickly went back and joined the other two beings all of who climed Ed 
back into this cloudlike object which then Rose straight up and was gone so clearly not a cloud 
but at this point Mario ran home told his family what happened and they came out and all of them 
saw strange Square footprints in the snow also where this object had landed they found a 10ft 
diameter of black soot and burned vegetation and in fact this Mark remained for 2 years and 
no grass would grow there during that time what I like about that case is again it's a daylight 
case a landing the witness saw this object quite close the ETS described are very unusual the rare 
perhaps robotic type though we can't be sure that could have just been your typical sort of space 
suit but certainly interesting also because the ETS behaved in ways that do often see scooping 
up water or in this case snow investigating the chicken coup and really compelling is the fact 
that this object apparently left physical evidence not to mention the footprints which were seen by 
the witness's family so very interesting details all around with that case and here we have another 
truly bizarre case which created quite a stir in the community where it occurred it's very unusual 
I call this one the alien in the living room and this occurred on November 28th 1972 in Argentina 
more specifically in the suburb trace or royos in bues Ares and this case just a warning here 
is very unusual the primary witness in this case is Alonso Ray he was a retired chief designer at 
IMA metallurgical firm and also a pilot and he was in his home at Kay 346 libertad again in 
Trace or royos and was just watching TV sitting in his easy chair when the TV set began to fail 
so he didn't know what was wrong he got up to fix it and this is when he felt a strange impression 
and uneasiness and turning around he saw a very unusual looking figure sitting down in an armchair 
in his living room and he said this figure was not normal it wore a onepiece metallic green 
overall it had short boots a black belt with what looked like a radio type device attached 
to it and a helmet over his head and as soon as Alonso saw him this being stood up and this is 
when Alonso realized that he was quite tall over 6 feet in height and Alonso asked him what do you 
want this figure made no reply but held out its hand apparently in greeting so Alonso walked up 
and took the being's hand which he said felt cold and had a strange texture which he likened to foam 
rubber he said he could see the figure's eyes visible through the helmet that they seemed to 
emit a silvery light which was bright enough that it was hard for him to distinguish the being's 
facial features so at this point Alonso sat down in his chair the being did the same and this being 
this figure never spoke but just stared at Alfonso and at this point Alfonso said that he felt a 
quote very good sense of well-being and in fact fact he had been in physical pain since suffering 
a stroke a few years earlier and to his amazement all these pains disappeared so he was absolutely 
astonished got up and went to the kitchen and this being followed him and according to Alonso who 
didn't so much walk it seemed to float on the air Alonso turned on the gas cooker I'm not sure why 
he's doing this apparently making tea or something it's not explained in the report however there was 
an interesting effect because the Sparks from the igniter on the stove were much stronger than usual 
that was strange Alonso thought he also noticed that his refrigerator motor seemed to be faltering 
and he himself felt very peculiar at this point he offered the visitor a glass of water which the 
visitor declined so he went back into the living room the being followed him and when they got in 
there this being started to press some buttons on the radio likee device on his belt which began 
to Blink with an amber colored light so Alonso was starting to feel some fear at this point he 
didn't know who this being was he was starting to realize this might not even be human so he started 
to retreat to the kitchen but the being followed him him then walked to the doorway to the yard 
pressed some more buttons on his belt and then walked out into the yard so Al Fons was watching 
all this the being looks up into the sky and then quickly vanishes Without a Trace so this was the 
story he told and what's interesting is later that afternoon other people apparently saw this same 
figure it's further confirmation of his testimony because not far away at a bar at the corner of 
Elena and Pringles it was later that afternoon several witnesses reported seeing a strange figure 
of similar description actually enter the bar and everyone who was there watched him enter the bar 
and go directly to the bathroom and he didn't come out so at some point when he didn't come out the 
BART tenter went the bartender went to investigate and discovered that the bathroom was now empty so 
she called the police took the testimony of the witnesses who saw this being and were able to 
confirm this incident so certainly a bizarre case once again we have ETS coming into people's homes 
and interacting with them in almost casual ways it's quite an interesting encounter which I think 
is made all the more comp compelling because there were electromagnetic effects also physiological 
effects the witness certainly feels like he was healed as a result of this encounter but most 
compelling is the fact that there were apparently other Witnesses who saw what they believed to be 
the same figure in another area a short time after the initial encounter and very strange it was 
investigated by police so again I think that lends a level of credibility to it the main witness of 
the initial event is also a person of very high standing a professional quite intelligent so all 
around a really interesting case and moving along in time we go to the next case which I call the 
alien at the side of the road and this case was very thoroughly investigated and it occurred on 
February 4th 1973 in Kimba Australia and it's a great case initially involving just two witnesses 
but as it turns out there were more witnesses and just a very unusual event it was 9:50 p.m. when 
Brian Hunt was driving from Iron knob to Kimba along Highway 1 also known as the Eerie Highway 
and they were about 303 35 miles outside of Kimba when they he initially saw a quote red flare this 
was just off to the right side of the road but with him in the car in the front passenger seat 
was his friend Sharon finkler now he didn't say anything to her at first until they got closer and 
as he began to drive by he looked and saw that this light was actually an orange red triangle 
he estimates it was 5 feet wide 10 feet high and clearly visible inside it was a motionless 
human figure who appeared to be floating about 2 feet above the ground and was dressed in quote 
a white spacit according to Brian the figure's hands and legs were pointed slightly down Brian 
had been driving a steady 55 M hour but seeing this figure and becoming frightened by its odd 
appearance he started to accelerate and at the same time he motioned for his friend Sharon to 
take a look out out the window so Sharon looked and saw the same thing this orange red rectangle 
and what she perceived was kind of a white blob inside she didn't get a super good look at it cuz 
by then they were already passing this thing but she looked back and said that it looked 
to her like this thing was extending across the road so they were both somewhat alarmed 
by this uh they sped off went to the uh to Kimba where Sharon lived and shared the story with her 
parents and after listening to them they decided to call the police the police decided to conduct 
an investigation actually went to the location but found no physical evidence however turns out 
there were other Witnesses cuz the next day they received a call from a gentleman by the name of 
Alan dnor a truck driver who said that around 1 p.m. he had seen what he thought was a glowing 
white door of a trailer in the same exact spot he also saw a strange figure he said and it was odd 
because he couldn't see any structure around this store now later researcher Keith basterfield who 
investigated this case along with several other researchers did locate another witness Max englas 
who described seeing the same thing uh he didn't see any figure however and as it turned out he 
was driving just ahead of Brian Hunt and Sharon finkler but it was a pretty impressive case with 
so many witnesses and as Keith basterfield writes one is left with a firm impression that these 
people witnessed a real event of some kind this is certainly one of the most puzzling reports I 
have investigated while a whole lot didn't really occur in that case it was just a driveby of a 
seeing this ET standing in a doorway uh no one actually saw the actual craft itself which was 
probably because it was quite dark hard to say for sure but yeah the main witness Keith basterfield 
said it was one of the most interesting cases he's come across in a very long time so that alone is 
interesting and so many witnesses it was clear that the main Witnesses were very shook up it's 
an interesting case and now we move to what is probably one of my favorites certainly in this 
little collection I call this one the crosseyed aliens this occurred on April 30th 1983 in sasel 
France and I love this case because it was quite an extensive interaction between the main witness 
and several human looking ETS the main witness in this case is anonymous uh she's called Madam X and 
she's 60 years old it was around 2 a.m. when she woke up to see a glowing red sphere hovering in 
her bedroom now she couldn't understand what she was thinking or what she was seeing and thought 
it might be ball lightning so she tried to awake her husband but he wouldn't wake up he's normally 
a heavy sleeper but she was surprised that he wouldn't wake up she jumped up to open the window 
and when she turned around this red sphere was gone and in its place stood four Strang looking 
men and this weird orange light sort of filled the room she said the men were each under six 
feet tall and looked quite unusual they were human looking but had long faces very pale 
skin long thin noses that were sort of attached differently and their eyes were very strange they 
had pupils that looked like they were situated kind of close to the nose giving them almost a 
crosseyed appearance she said they wore overalls uh which were unmarked except for what looked like 
yellow and green bars on the shoulders which she thought might indicate rank um giving that 
they were uniforms this was her impression she couldn't tell if they had hair or not because 
their heads were actually covered with tight skull caps but she wasn't scared she said they seemed 
very friendly not at all threatening so she felt no fear but she really wanted her husband to see 
them so again she tried to shake him awake and he wouldn't wake up and this is when one of the antes 
spoke verbally in French saying it's useless he is sleeping and that was kind of strange but Madame X 
also noticed that her four normally aggressive German Shepherds were now cowering under the 
bed and their eyes were bulging as they stared fearfully at these visitors so at this point still 
feeling no fear Madame X invited these visitors to sit down which they did and she asked them do 
you speak other languages and they told her we know all the languages on earth now it was just 
one entity who spoke he would do all the Talking Madame X assumed that he was the leader and he 
asked her do you know who we are so she studied them and she had noticed at this point they moved 
strangely leisurely but kind of deliberately that they were very slow in their movements 
and gestures so she said you're robots now at this point this entity smiled with what she perceived 
to be Amusement held out his hand and said touch which she did and she noticed at this point that 
their hands were slightly larger than most people and very soft and of course you could tell now 
that they were in fact living beings because their hands felt like normal flesh so she said then you 
are extraterrestrials and the ET said yes so at this point Her Mind is whirling she wanted to test 
them to see if they could speak other languages but said that even though she was strangely calm 
and unafraid she was having trouble thinking and formulating her questions almost as if her 
willpower she said was slowed down at this point they stood up Rose from their seats and led her 
outside telling her that they wanted to show her that they were well acquainted with the history of 
planet Earth so this was strange but going outside she was surprised to see four additional entities 
outside looking the same as the others she also noticed that the entire yard was enveloped in a 
thick fog and it had been a chilly night but she was surprised that it was now quite warm 
where certainly where she was standing so at this point they returned back inside to the bedroom 
momentarily when the main guy said here it's fine we are going to make a projection for you and they 
returned back outside at this point Madame X saw that three of the four other ETS now held small 
black spheres in their hands and then they began to project a sort of like a movie screen on the 
fog showing her images of Earth's history she said reaching all the way back to prehistory up through 
World War II she said almost all of the images were focused on Wars and conflicts and battles and 
seeing this she told them that she had no interest in Wars but their reply was that conflict is all 
that the people of Earth know so there was a clear message there and she believes these images were 
being projected by the black spheres though studying them she could see no beams of light 
coming from them so she's honestly not sure how that was done but after that which went 
on for quite some time she and the first four ETS returned inside and sat down again and with some 
effort Madame X began to ask questions she started questioning about time and distances and space and 
things like this but their only response to all these questions was that she wouldn't understand 
she did ask them why there were only men in their group and the leader replied that sometimes they 
do bring female along but just had not done so on this occasion so Madame still felt no fear 
and instead felt this overwhelming happiness to be meeting them in fact she invited them to eat 
or drink or even smoke they smiled and declined but said that they would visit again in 6 months 
and would dine with her at that point now during all of this a few of the beings in the room kept 
glancing out the window as if to make sure that they weren't being observed or there was no 
disturbance she's not sure but after she says two hours these ETS suddenly Rose and exited her room 
and right before they did so she stepped forward and shook the leader's hand followed them outside 
and this is when she saw a UFO for the first time an oval or saucer-shaped object which was floating 
above the Terrace front yard about 75 ft from the house these were Terraces that dropped down 
in level so this object was actually at I level and it had a ramp which extended horizontally to 
the top of the shed in the front yard and as she watched these ETS walked across this ramp and into 
the craft the ramp retracted this object took off with what she described as a soft Whistling noise 
and they were gone so she stood there a moment in absolute astonishment considered waking up 
her husband and calling the police and telling the priest but finally decided not to tell anyone 
because it was such an incredible experience that she didn't think anyone but would believe her but 
she also says that right after the ETS left her sense of calmness and well-being left her and she 
felt this wave of quote Indescribable panic and it was so intense that it was something she had 
never experienced before so she kept her secret for about 2 weeks but her neighbor came over 
and started talking about ETS and that's when she Spilled Out her story and this ultimately 
resulted in Madame X's case being professionally investigated now after 6 months months went by 
the ETS did not return however the witness is hopeful that one day they will uh she says the 
only other effect is she has become very nervous about Earth's future and the possible arrival of 
the quote end times so very interesting case where once again the ETS are warning about War I think 
there's a lot of takeaways from that case like many witnesses she did keep it secret for some 
time Finally Revealed it was never planning on talking about it publicly so it's pure chance 
that we're now hearing about it but the fact that the ETS were warning her about war and 
aggression and all the violence on our planet that's certainly the message we get from a lot 
of contact accounts it's just a really interesting case again with weird medical effects and that her 
husband couldn't be woken up I would call that a physiological effect and animal reactions as 
well where her dogs absolutely would not come out from under the bed while those ETS were there and 
a very long case I mean I can only imagine what it must be like to talk for two hours with ETS and as 
we saw it had a very profound effect upon the main witness all right moving along the next case is is 
super amazing and I have to say it's also one of my favorite in this collection it's hard to pick a 
favorite because they're all so interesting this one I call the giant silver alien this occurred 
fairly recently March 20th 1993 in kadema Israel and boy did it create a sensation when it occurred 
because there wasn't just one witness there was many followup events but there were the landing 
traces as well some very profound physiological effects really an extraordinary case in terms of 
what the ETS looked like as well as we shall see it with 6:30 a.m. very early in the morning when 
ziet Carmel a lady was surprised to find herself waking up so early and I'm just going to quote her 
extensively because she describes what happens in this amazing case in amazing detail as she says in 
her own words and I quote I'm a late sleeper and I seldom get up that early and this was Saturday 
a day I always sleep late but something Disturbed me and I felt drawn to walk to the kitchen when I 
got there the room was bathed in a strange light this even though the sun was up I went outside 
and checked the grounds and as I went around the storage shed said I noticed what I thought was a 
new fruit Silo in the field about 100 m from me I remember thinking why would anyone put a silo 
there and in the middle of the night at that I took a closer look at The Silo and realized this 
was no ordinary container it was silver colored for one thing which is not standard for silos it 
seemed almost Square shaped from the angle I was looking and along it side were 18 glowing Square 
Windows which looked like diamonds in a necklace five huge beams of powerful light Shone from the 
roof into the northern sky and the sille was emitting what looked like sparklers along its 
side I guessed the size of the silo to be about 5 m in length and about 3 m high but then it seemed 
to grow Another Story by that I'm me in a second section materialized and doubled the height of 
The Silo then I saw what at first I thought was a worker a few meters from The Silo when I saw him 
so did the dogs and they went crazy the worker was over 7 ft tall and wore metallic overalls 
something like aluminum foil he wore a sombrero with a veil that covered his face and that in 
totality looked like a beaky 's hat we both stared at each other for perhaps 30 seconds and 
I realized finally who he was I quietly whispered why don't you take off your hat so I can see your 
face and I heard his answer clearly in my head he said in Hebrew Kaz meaning that's the way it is 
after that I felt impelled to go to my kitchen and boil some coffee and when I went back back outside 
the ship and its occupant was gone so quite an amazing and bizarre encounter but the surprises 
weren't over yet because when they went to examine the field they found a 15t diameter round circle 
of quote dissolved vegetation where this craft had been and next to it where this being had 
stood was another 4ft diameter circle and and inside this larger Circle they found deposits 
of what later turned out to be exceptionally pure silicone certainly not naturally forming and it 
was only two weeks later when more strange circles were found in her backyard and some 
had this strange red fluid inside them which was collected and tested and turned out to be 
mostly cadmium so very strange but wait there's more because following this encounter the main 
witness ziet said I was nauseous for days had horrible diarrhea fits of shivering and couldn't 
stop sleeping it was like a bad flu so this case was thoroughly investigated and many other people 
came to look at these Landing traces and what's very interesting is those who stood too long in 
the circle did suffer physiological effects Barry chamish who investigated this case reported that 
he felt very sick after standing in the circle as did another researcher D Danny yakobi who says 
he got sick but after he felt the sickness the arthritis in his near knees disappeared formerly 
he had to walk with a cane his arthritis was so bad and researcher AI grief had a similar 
reaction and as he says I had a painfully weak ankle that always impaired me it was repaired 
after visiting the Carmel Landing site and has never returned my theory is that there is 
something healing in that initial sick feeling so certainly something's going on and in fact eight 
months later the lead investigator Barry chamish visited the landing site and the circle was still 
there so he's standing inside it and zipper warned him don't stay in there too long but he did cuz as 
Barry says I couldn't resist looking for signs of the landing that might have been overlooked 
after scratching through the burnt and charred remains of wood and plastic and digging through the still burnt roots of the former plant life for about 20 minutes I felt genuinely lousy like a flu 
was approaching and spent the remainder of the day mooching painkillers from the people I was 
interviewing I told ziet that if she hadn't planted the suggestion in the first place I 
wouldn't have had a psychosomatic reaction so he was skeptical but she replied it wouldn't 
have made a difference everyone who stays too long at the spot gets sick after so they should 
have tested it perhaps for radiation I'm not sure that they did that but there were other 
strange after effects to zippa that main witness she found that she could now see auras and she 
says she's also believes she has gained healing powers so certainly a very interesting case and 
as it turns out it was the first of several cases involving UFO sightings Landings and also entity 
sightings as well wow what a case and really I could have done a whole show on just the series 
of events that occurred afterwards because there were many many other Witnesses who are 
having sightings and landings and I mean there's a lot to that case that we didn't cover here but 
you can certainly look into it CU wow I mean it's amazing and here's another really compelling case 
which I call the little alien gray boy and this one is super interesting for a number of reasons 
it occurred on March 19th 98 in Fardo Puerto Rico that involves one witness in terms of the 
actual humanoid being seen the great alien boy but there was remarkable confirmation with multiple 
Witnesses immediately after this gentleman's encounter with this little gray alien boy it 
was around 500 a.m. early one morning in March 1998 and still dark as road worker Felix palanco 
exited his car and got into his excavator again in Fardo Puerto Rico but he was working on a new 
road being built between Fardo and oliveres in the Sierra burha range of mountains so he gets into 
his excavator turns on the excavator headlights and saw something very strange in the headlight 
beams and I'll just quote Felix directly as he says I saw a little boy standing in front of it 
he had long skinny arms right down below his knees and very long fingers on his hands though I can't 
say how many I attempted to move and found that I couldn't and I panicked he was a thin gray little 
fellow about 3 and 1 half to 4 feet high with a pear-shaped head wide at the top narrower below 
with a small pointed chin I couldn't see what clothing if any he had on he was just gray all 
over I didn't see whether he had any ears he had no hair either either on his head or anywhere it 
all looked smooth like a gray skin all over there was no other color about him no white or black or 
any other shade just gray I couldn't see his face at all I could only see him from the side and the 
back and at no time did he look straight at me he just walked away towards the coast so this really 
Shook Up Felix and after this incident he went to the work office and he didn't say anything at 
first but seeing that he was quite shaken up his fellow employees asked him what was wrong so Felix 
told them what happened and described this little gray alien boy he had seen and they absolutely 
believed him and told him that this particular area was well known for UFO and ET activity which 
he had no idea and then to everyone's amazement and especially Felix a UFO appeared in the sky 
and as Felix says in his own words just at that moment some of the men shouted look what's that 
what's that thing up there and pointed to the sky we all looked and saw something like a big big red 
light flying on a West East course it was round and very bright full of red light and high in the 
sky suddenly it turned and then turned once more and headed off towards the Cabo Rojo Lighthouse 
and vanished one of the men suggested it was a UFO coming to pick up the little gray chap 
that I had seen course Felix doesn't know but he certainly found that quite interesting this case 
was was investigated by Puerto Rico researcher Jorge Martin and he learned that this case did 
take place very near the aerostat radar station and that this is an area with a long history of 
sightings it's well known that UFOs are attracted to technological installations so perhaps that 
was one of the reasons the ET was in that area so perhaps it was the aerostat radar station 
that was the draw for these ETS because there were other encounters that were involved directly with 
that very hard to say but certainly a strange case and moving along I like this case a lot 
it's very unusual how the ET behaved and how the witnesses behaved as well I call this the flying 
alien and this occurred on June 4th 2001 in gnarly turkey it's a great case because it involves three 
Witnesses and was very well researched as well it was early in the morning around 7 a.m. again on 
June 4th 2001 when three villagers fevy cam his wife Selma and their friend Ace topaloglu were 
driving their tra tractor to hoe their tobacco field now along the way they saw this strange 
being standing about 45 ft away from them in a field it was walking towards them when they first 
saw it but seeing this tractor apparently this figure stopped turned around and began to walk 
in the opposite direction and they could all see that this was a very unusual figure so feevy left 
leapt off the tractor and began to chase it and approached to within about 6 ft at which point 
he could see that this figure was very short no more than 2 feet tall he said it wore very strange 
clothes sort of a gelatinous like skintight suit and in fact there was all covered with 
wrinkles his wife Selma was close enough to see these wrinkles and said it looked like it needed 
ironing now this figure did have black oval-shaped eyes that looked to fevy like they were quote 
attached on the suit or drawn on the suit now he didn't see any arms in fact the legs themselves 
appeared to be joined together so the feet looked rectangular they were red in color he did notice 
a bright red light shining from the figure's head the top of its head which was very round and wide 
there was also a glowing orange red light on its abdomen but to fevzi it looked almost robotic in 
appearance and as soon as he got up close to this being it floated right up into the air some 10 or 
20 feet high or as fevy said about as high as a tree all in complete silence so he's staring up at 
this thing floating there apparently looking down at him and he thought to himself that he would try 
to bring down this creature by throwing stones at it so he could examine it more closely now 
he hadn't done this yet he just thought about it at which point this creature Rose even higher and 
in fact fevy had the impression it was reading his mind but he decided to anyway quickly bend 
down and he began collecting stones and throwing it at this creature he threw four or five stones 
but the being easily avoided all of them and it was just flying around which really impressed the 
witness because as he says it didn't have wings or propellers but it could fly upwards and quickly 
left the area so a Turkish UFO Group by the name of serus heard about this case interviewed the 
witnesses searched the area for any physical evidence they found nothing in the field at all 
but did discover that two other villagers had seen strange lights in the sky in the same area at the 
same time as fev's encounter fevy and the other Witnesses were vouched for by all of those who 
knew them including actually the governor of the village and the town counselor and researchers did 
receive further confirmation when they found out that one day later two security guards at a nearby 
Factory also reported seeing a being of the same description so once again we have beings which are 
apparently inspecting a factory so perhaps that's why the being was there impossible to say for sure 
but certainly a compelling multi- witness sighting quite a strange case I wouldn't advise throwing 
rocks at ETS but I can't blame the witnesses they were confronted with something they have never 
seen before and it is interesting that in fact there was a followup encounter with another group 
of witnesses and apparently the same ET but this case was taken very seriously it was researched 
the Witnesses were vouched for by those who knew them so there's a lot of reasons to believe that 
this is an absolutely genuine case but certainly a very Strang looking ET and now moving to the next 
case and again another location on this planet I call this one approached by an alien I and this 
occurred on February 12th 2010 again fairly recently it occurred at fear Park in exmouth 
England and a very interesting case involving animal reactions and an apparent Landing with a 
humanoid approaching the witness the main witness in this case is Roy Shaw he's a retired engineer 
and on the evening of February 12th 2010 again he was walking his dog in fear Park this is not far 
from his home on wycom Village Road in exmouth England and this is when he was shocked to see 
a UFO landed on the ground in front of him now he says he never saw it flying around or Landing it 
was just suddenly there it appeared right in front of him and as he says in his own words the object 
was round in shape and about 30 ft in diameter and 100 ft long with blue and red flashing lights 
on its perimeter it appeared to land at the top end end of the park by the Bowling Green my dog 
started to growl when what I can only describe as a white shape came towards us it was about 
4T high and seemed to be translucent and moved very slowly towards us I was transfixed because 
it made a droning noise which sounded like my my over and over again which I could not understand 
I don't know where the sound was coming from but it was coming straight towards me now Roy's dog 
whose name is Sydney is normally very friendly to strangers but Sydney was not happy about 
this being approaching them and actually bared his teeth at this figure and then turned and 
ran and in fact Roy also became quite scared and also ran and looking back he saw this object was 
now hovering in the sky over a hedge he watched it Fly horizontally from left to right and then 
shoot off upwards at a 45 degree angle at very high speed and as Roy says in his own words I 
twisted my ankle when I ran like hell my dog Sid kept whimpering and kept looking out the 
bedroom window towards the park until at least 2: in the morning I had problems sleeping because I 
kept going over in my mind what I had seen I still can't believe what I saw and I am still in a State 
of Shock Sid doesn't like going back up there now something put him off everybody thinks you are a 
crank when you report something like this I am an engineer I like to touch and feel things if I 
can touch it it exists but there's no way I can explain this so this case was researched by UFO 
investigator Nigel Wright who says this is a close encounter of the Third Kind this is definitely of 
a Third Kind having an occupant of a UFO in close proximity to the craft itself this is a really 
important sighting I like that case because it was investigated the witness himself is an engineer 
who was clearly quite affected profoundly by this encounter does again have animal effects we know 
exactly where this case took place so there's a lot of interesting elements to it and certainly 
the ET described is quite unusual if that's what it was hard to say for sure and here's the last 
case of the bunch this is not investigated really this was just reported to muon but it's certainly 
an interesting case of an ET being seen very close up inside a craft I call this one the 9 
foot tall alien it occurred on September 4th 2022 very recently in an undisclosed location in Oregon 
so the witness in this case is anonymous and again this case is not researched but certainly 
interesting and it was just after sunset on September 4th 2022 when the witness had his 
encounter as he says I was outside on the back patio I looked up and flying 50 ft or so above 
my house was an occupied UFO it was so close I could see the being staring directly at me 
and the control panel in front of him he looked forested green like the craft he had black eyes 
a small nose of sorts a small round mouth and stood about 9 or 10 ft tall I knew he or I had 
the sense it was a male I knew he was standing because his elbows weren't bent as his hands 
with four fingers were resting on the control panel the craft was about 30 ft in diameter I 
know this based on the length of my house and the Craft's relationship to it the top part of 
the craft had a glass dome for the upper part of his body to be encased in and there was a solid 
green Dome if you will at the bottom the shape of the craft was such that I could tell it was 
something that he stepped into I stopped smiled and waved but he kept going and disappeared so 
this had a strange appearance cuz he's could only see like the front of the craft even as it moved 
off and he says a week or so later he had this strange impression that this craft was actually 
partly cloaked and he's wondering if somehow this information was downloaded into him as he says 
he's quote not sure but certainly a very closeup sighting of what appears to be an ET inside of a 
craft yeah that last case wasn't investigated but it's certainly interesting and how the witnesses 
the witness rather reacted by waving to the ET and very brief but also some interesting elements 
to it that I think make it a legit account they were able to estimate the size of this craft it 
was quite close they feel like they got a download it's just an interesting case and yeah very recent 
a lot of you have been asking me to put up some more recent cases and there you go that's 100 100 
Years of encounters from the 1920s all the way to the 2020s and there's a lot to learn 
from that this shows once again that this is an ongoing phenomena there's far more cases of this 
kind Than People realize another very important takeaway is that yes this is occurring all over 
the world and in fact I suspect that if you dig in pretty much every location on this planet has 
a long and Rich history of UFO encounters and for me another really interesting thing is the very 
many different descriptions people give of these humanoids humanoids of all kinds from short little 
beings to very tall beings wearing all different kinds of uniforms all different skin complexions 
different types of eyes I mean you name it they are all different very much like humans here on 
Earth so that also is interesting and of course the evidence the evidence is compelling some very 
profound physiological effects in this collection some undeniable Landing Trace cases which were 
thoroughly investigated some really interesting electromagnetic effects and animal effects and so 
forth so again a lot more evidence as well than certainly Skeptics believe who often say where's 
the evidence well here you go how many cases is it going to take before this is something 
that all Humanity accepts is happening because you know it's not just a few hundred cases or even a 
few thousand it's many thousands I think probably more like Millions just that the vast majority go 
unreported so that's it for today alien aliens aliens 100 Years of humanoids 13 true cases so 
I want to thank you once again for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep 
looking for answers keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye for
now
