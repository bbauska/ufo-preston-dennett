Summary:
Aug 26, 2022
Jesus walking on water in the Sea of Galilee is a very well-known miraculous event. And of course, there is the account of Buddha performing the same wondrous talent. Although these men both lived thousands of years ago, their incredible feats are still remembered today. But what many people don't realize is that there are dozens of cases from many different cultures throughout history in which people have walked on water. Some of these accounts were widely viewed by outside witnesses and are surprisingly well-verified.

For example, in the year 350, St. Ammon of Egypt was viewed by his disciple to float over a river.

In the 4th century, Saint Bessarion reportedly walked across the Nile, the Takazze River and the Barada River.

Another early case is Raymond of Pennafort, confessor to King James I of Aragon. Raymond was seen by hundreds of spectators to travel from the Island of Mayorca to Barcelona, a distance of 160 miles, using only his cloak as a flotation device. Many sailors observed this event, and Raymond's arrival on the shore was observed by a crowd of hundreds.

Many of the early cases involve various saints. In the 6th century, Maurus rescued Saint Placid from drowning in a lake in Subiaco, Italy. Maurus ran across the surface of the lake and retrieved Placid. Only upon returning to the shore did he realize that he had actually walked on water.

In 1430, Blessed Alvarez of Cordova, Italy joined the list of people who have walked on water when he was seen walking across a flooded river to reach his monastery. 

 In the early 1500s, Saint Peter of Alcantara was observed to walk across the Guadiana River in Spain. 

Aso in the 1500s, Saint Seraphino was seen walking across the Potenza River in Italy.

One of the most remarkable and widely viewed accounts of walking on water occurred in the 1700s to Saint Gerard of Majella, who was seen by a crowd of hundreds of people to walk on water in order to rescue a small boat that was sinking off the coast of Italy.

While many of the early cases involve saints, accounts come from all over the world from a wide variety of people of different cultures.

In the 1800s, "Dengnabine," a well-known Azande Medicine Man from Africa was observed to walk on water.

Another famous case from the 1800s is that of Mademoiselle Frederica Hauffe of France, also known as the Seer of Provorst. She displayed numerous psychic abilities, among them one instance of walking on water.

Two saints from Russia, Saint Basil (1800s) and Saint Zachary (1900s) were both seen by witnesses to walk on water.

An amusing and modern case occurred on July 18, 1837 to an eight-year-old Russian boy named Nikolai Yurlov. On that evening, Nikolai was woken up by a ghostly apparition. He became so frightened that he fled his home in terror and actually ran across the surface of the Sviyaga River. Servants who were chasing the boy were shocked to find Nikolai on the other side of the river, completely dry.

In 1894, explorer and researcher Baird T. Spaulding traveled with a group of men to study the miracles of Enlightened Masters from the Far East. While visiting India, they met a group of Yogis who took them on a journey to the foothills of the Himalayas. Spaulding and his companions observed a group of a dozen yogis traverse a large river by walking on the surface of the water. The yogis explained that with the proper training, anyone could learn to attain this ability.

One of the most unusual cases of this kind comes from Angelo Faticoni of Jacksonville, Florida. Also called "The Human Cork" and "The Man They Could Not Drown." Faticoni repeatedly demonstrated his ability to stay afloat on the surface of the water for hours at a time in virtually any position. He could stay on the surface lying on his side, his back or curled up in a ball. He could even sleep on the water. He was able to swim long distances. He subjected himself to numerous experiments including allowing himself to be tied down with weights or sewn into a sac. Still he remained on the surface of the water. Scientists from Harvard University studied his case and were unable to explain Faticoni's amazing ability.

These are just a few of the many cases of people who have displayed this unusual ability to walk on water. French researcher Olivier Leroy lists many other saints with this ability. Can humans walk on water? The answer is apparently yes!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today i'm going to be talking about the paranormal specifically human levitation 
and more specifically the ability to walk on water in fact that is the name of today's episode can 
humans walk on water and the answer i believe is yes there are in fact dozens of cases throughout 
history where people have displayed this ability it's not just the very famous account of jesus 
and buddha but many other cases throughout history and all different cultures 
really right up to the present day i think this is an important ability that hasn't got a lot of 
attention that's why i wanted to do this episode for you today i'm going to present about 20 or 30 
cases starting with the earliest moving all the way up to the most recent that i could find and i 
think you'll find it pretty compelling that people do have this ability so let's just get started 
so the earliest case that i can think of in history that i was able to find is of course buddha siddhartha guatama buddha and there are many accounts of him performing 
all kinds of miracles i mean it's really quite an amazing list of the things he's been able to do 
which include walking through fire and visibility
taming wild animals i'm just all kinds of things teleporting it goes on and on miraculous healing 
but he did also reportedly levitate on a number of occasions and that includes going over rivers 
there's one very specific example where he was reported to have walked over the rohini river 
there was a war that was about to break out between the chicaya clan and a neighboring kingdom 
and at the time the region was in drought and the two kingdoms were on the verge of fighting so that they could divert the water from the rohini river for their own use 
and as the two armies gathered on opposite sides of the river the buddha sets off by air to stop 
them and appears before them levitating right over the river he asks the rulers of each side if water 
or human life is more valuable each side replied that human life is more valuable 
and that's when buddha persuaded them to make a deal to share the water and that's 
just one account there's another account where he reportedly teleported across the ganges river 
buddha and his monks were crossing the river and were seen on one side disappeared and reappeared 
on the other side instead of searching for boats or creating rafts is all the other people were doing and another account across the same river the ganges river this occurred 
shortly after buddha's enlightenment and he was about to deliver his first sermon 
and as he reached the ganges river he approached a fermin to cross the river who asked him for money 
says you need to pay the fee to cross the river the buddha said he had no money and proceeded 
to cross the river through levitating so he is not the only one at this time who 
reportedly walked on water there's a story about a believing layman this was a faithful and pious 
person a disciple of buddha and one evening on his way to jadavana he came to the bank of the river 
asira vati and the ferryman had pulled up the boat on the shore in order to attend service and uh 
this guy decided that he would just walk across the river and his mind was on buddha at the time 
and he just walked right into the river reportedly and his feet did not sink below the water but he 
got as far as mid-river and thought he was on dry land when suddenly he noticed there were waves 
and his ecstasy he was you know focusing on buddha suddenly subsided and he began to sink 
into the water so he quickly fell back into meditation focusing on buddha and was able to 
arrive at the city of jedhavana greeted the buddha and started to talk to him 
and buddha said i hope you had no mishap on your way and he said well on my way i was so absorbed in the thoughts of buddha that i set foot upon the 
river but i walked over it as though it had been dry ground and buddha replied you are not the 
only one who has been kept safe by remembering the virtues of the buddha in olden days pious laymen 
have been shipwrecked in mid-ocean and saved themselves by remembering the buddha's virtues 
and so that's another report in fact there's a yet another report during this time in which a 
gentleman a student of buddha crossed the river through walking on water and boasted to the buddha 
about it and buddha chided him saying this is not something you should display or use for 
you know no reason and that you could have just taken a bridge or a boat across instead of showing 
everyone that you have this ability but the point is there were several people in very early history 
already walking on water and of course there's the very famous account of jesus on the sea of galilee 
and as it says in the gospels of the bible and i quote jesus constrained his disciples to get 
into a ship the ship was now in the midst of the sea jesus went unto them walking on the sea 
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled and peter said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come 
and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus 
at this point reportedly jesus calmed the storm and pulled peter who was beginning to sink back 
into the boat so i'm personally not a religious person i don't know how much credence to place 
into these really early accounts we can't prove them but the fact is there are many 
many other accounts throughout history of people levitating and a number of them come from the 
saints throughout history one of the earliest ones was saint bessarian who in the 4th century 
reportedly walked across many rivers including the nile river the takazi river and the bharata river 
so that's just one account um there are more modern accounts in the early 1500s saint peter of alcantara was observed by people to walk across the 
guad guardiana river in spain there was a very famous account which took place in the 1800s 
to an azandi medicine man from africa by the name of dengnabin and he reportedly walked on water 
after he was bound by stones he carried big rocks and actually walked across the water so here we 
see this appearing in many different cultures and here's another case which is fairly modern 
this occurred in the 1800s and to a lady by the name of mademoiselle frederica hoff 
she is known as the seer of prevorst she's quite famous she lived from 1801 to 1829 in france 
and her case was investigated by dr justinis kerner and frederica hoff displayed many psychic 
abilities she could see with her eyes closed she talked to spirits there was constant poltergeist 
activity going on around her she was extremely clairvoyant she could do out-of-body travel and 
by location she taught spiritual subjects while in a trance state and she also reportedly on one 
instance walked on water don't have the details of it but her case is definitely one of the more 
recent cases there's another case which is pretty interesting which took place in 1936 
and this involved saint zachary of russia and saint basil in sometime in the 1800s 
and both were reportedly seen by witnesses to walk on water olivier leroy wrote the first book 
on levitation called levitation he was a french researcher and he lists more than a dozen cases 
of people who have walked on water he doesn't provide many details but his list includes saint 
bernadine of cn burton saint berin saint bogemail saint francois de paul saint jean of capistrano 
gene the hermit saint judah saint marie oh i can't pronounce this name saint marie doguen 
uh saint matthew of basil saint nazar saint pierre regaladi saint ramon de penifort st sebald 
and others the point is there are a lot and some of these cases do have details 
there was a very interesting case involving saint raymond he was confessor for the king james the 
first of aragon and while on the island of majorca to initiate a campaign to help convert the moors 
living there the king brought his mistress with him and saint raymond reproved the king and 
asked him repeatedly to dismiss his concubine but the king refused to do so and finally the 
saint told the king that he could remain with him no longer and made plans to leave for barcelona 
the king forbade him to leave the island and threatened punishment to any ship captain who dared to take him so saint raymond and his dominican companion went down to the seashore 
at which point raymond took off his cloak and spread it on the water and used his walking staff 
as a sort of a mast and he bid his dominican partner his companion to hop on but his companion 
was too frightened to do so so raymond bit him farewell and with the sign of the cross he pushed away from shore and sailed away on his cloak and this was apparently widely viewed he went 
around many boats that had forbade him passage and this saint was reportedly seen by scores of 
sailors who shouted in astonishment and urged him on and he reportedly sailed 160 miles to barcelona 
in the space of six hours and when he landed on shore he was greeted by a huge crowd of spectators 
and in awe of this miracle king james the first uh listened to raymond and mended his ways 
so yes levitation and walking on water are obviously connected and there are 
lot of cases throughout history uh one case is saint ammon and this is way back in 350 he's a 
well-known egyptian hermit and he lived the first half of his life as a normal guy quietly with his 
wife working in manual labor but was always very religious and would spend the nights in prayer 
but one day he decided to leave his wife and retire into the desert eating only bread and water 
and spending all of its time in prayer and as is written in the acta sanctorum religious writings 
saint ammon became known for producing miracles and one of these involved walking on water 
he was with his disciple theodore when they had come to an overflowing river 
and they withdrew from each other to undress st ammon however was too shy to undress 
and suddenly found himself being transported over the river and when his companion theodore thought 
that his friend had gotten across the river without getting wet he begged saint ammon to 
tell him what happened and saint ammon reluctantly said that it had been quote a miracle and not to tell anyone until after his death so this comes from a first-hand witness 
another case comes from the 6th century and this involved a gentleman by the name of saint benedict 
from subiaco italy he was employed as a caretaker for several children of various noble families 
and one day saint benedict had a vision that one of his children one of the children named placid 
had fallen into the lake and was drowning so he shouted to his friend morris to rescue the boy 
and morris without thinking quote ran to the lake and walked on the water a bow shot from the bank 
to the place where placid had been struggling and taking hold of him by the hair returned him 
with the same speed when he got to the shore and looked behind him he saw that he had walked upon 
the water which he had not noticed till then so as a result of this action placid himself 
became very religious and was later canonized as a saint so this is one of a number of cases where 
people have walked on water without even realizing what they were doing another case occurred in 1430 
to blessed alvarez of cordova italy he's well known for founding several chapels in this area 
and he was very much an ascetic meaning he for go comfort of any kind and did severe penances 
and spent much of his time in prayer and one night while he was returning to his monastery 
when a violent storm struck and blessed alvarez's path was blocked by a brook that 
had been transformed into this swollen torrent so he knelt down spent a few moments in prayer 
removed his cloak spread it on the surface of the water and used it to walk safely across the river 
he then put his cloak back on which was still dry and returned to the monastery just in time 
to take his place in the choir so these may sound like exaggerations but there are so many cases 
of saints doing this and a person often became a saint not only because 
they were very humble and religious but because they would perform these sort of 
wonder works as they were called or what we would call today displays of psychic power 
here's another case involving a saint saint serafino he lived from 1540 
to 1604 as a young child he worked as a shepherd who was then orphaned and cared for by his elder 
brother who abused him very badly so serofino ran away at age 16 and joined the capuchin monks where 
he worked as a bricklayer and he eventually became a very popular pre preacher and became known for 
his gifts of healing and reading the future which attracted wide crowds including people of very 
high rank uh including people high in business and government and also people very high in the church 
and there are at least two quote miracles ascribed to him and one involves 
of course important here walking on water saint serafino was on a pilgrimage to loreto 
but the river potenza was unpassable due to floods so saint seraphino just walked across the 
river by walking on the surface of the water and reportedly reached the other side completely dry 
so i've studied a lot of the saints because they've exhibited so many of these amazing 
psychic abilities and one of my favorite saints is saint gerard of magella who lived from 1726 
to 1755 and he experienced all kinds of miracles i mean way too numerous to list here but pretty 
much the full gamut of supernatural abilities including numerous levitations and there was one 
incident involving walking on water st gerard of magella was on the bay of naples this is in italy 
when a storm threatened to sink a small ship a huge crowd had gathered on the beach and 
they pleaded to saint gerard to help so saint gerard made the sign of the cross then stepped out 
into the water saying out loud in the name of the most holy trinity pause then he commanded the ship 
to come here or some say he actually laid hold of it and drew it after him safely towards the shore 
so there was a huge crowd watching this they became maniacally enthusiastic and mobbed gerard 
who quickly fled to naples and hid himself in a friend's home until the fuhrer died down 
and afterwards father margot asked him how he was able to perform such an amazing 
miracle and saint gerard replied and i quote oh father when god wills everything is possible and 
later another person asked him how he did it how he did this miracle father callion asked him and 
saint gerard elaborated and he said and i quote i caught it the ship with two fingers and i drew 
it to shore in the state in which i then was in i could have flown in the air so yeah saint gerard 
although he died very young was became very very well known for his amazing abilities 
which included among levitating by locating multiplying food healing predictions and more 
probably my favorite case of all of walking on water occurred on july 18 1837 
to an eight-year-old russian boy by the name of nikolai your yurlov on the evening of july 18 1837 
nikolai was woken up by a ghostly apparition in his room of a quote tall bald-headed elderly man 
who appeared next to his bed and so this frightened him half to death and gripped 
with this uncontrollable terror nikolai jumped up and ran out of the house across 
the garden and across the nearby sviaga river and at the time servants were chasing the boy 
and found him quote absolutely dry on the far side of the river and as nikolai says in his own words 
several of our servants were running after me they swore that they had seen me flying across the 
river with my feet touching the water sometimes so there aren't a whole lot of cases of this 
but there's plenty to show that i think this does happen and one of the most dramatic cases 
of this kind was actually witnessed by a cyclical researcher by the name of baird t spalding and he 
wrote a series of books called masters of the far east this series of books is quite controversial 
some have declared them hoaxes other believe them to be genuine but at any rate in december of 1894 
baird spalding says that he joined an expedition of 11 men to undertake metaphysical research in 
india and after two years of studying he met a group of yogis who were exhibiting supernatural 
powers of many different kinds and so spalding and his group of researchers were really amazed at the 
way these yogis were able to do all these kinds of things such as communicating with wild animals 
apparently teleporting appearing out of nowhere displaying an incredible range of knowledge 
they were unaffected by the elements they could walk in great heat or very cold weather 
with just a robe on however nothing could have prepared baird spalding for what he 
saw next he says he and his group were invited by the men to travel with them into the himalayas and 
they accepted the offer and began the expedition and as they reached the foothills of the himalayas they came upon a large river which spalding says and i quote was about 2 000 feet wide running 
bank full and the current was at least 10 miles per hour so baird spalding and his group assumed 
at this point the yogis would go upstream and cross the river on a bridge however instead one of 
the yogis by the name of jast told spalding that they planned to cross the river without a bridge 
and spalding and his group assumed that he meant that he and the other yogis were going to swim across the river and spalding thought that was really dangerous and stupid 
however to the surprise of him and his group jast and the 12 other yogis used another method 
and as spalding writes in his book and i quote when jast rejoined the group the 12 fully dressed 
walked to the bank of the stream and with the utmost composure stepped on the water not into it 
i shall never forget my feelings as i saw each of these twelve men stepped from solid ground upon 
the running water i held my breath expecting of course to see them plunge beneath and disappear 
i found out afterwards that that was the thought of all our party at the time i think each of us 
held his breath until they were all past midstream so astonished were we to see these 12 men 
walking calmly across the surface of the stream and not sinking below the soles of their sandals 
when they stepped from the water to the farther bank i felt that tons of weight had been lifted off my shoulders and i believe this was the feeling of everyone 
of our party judging from the size of relief as the last man stepped ashore 
it was certainly an experience that words fail to describe there was little discussion 
regarding what we had witnessed so engrossed were we with our own thoughts so spaulding 
and his group were not able to do this they had to go upstream to find a place to cross 
and when baird spalding later asked jast the monk about this incident the monk replied and i quote 
do you think that the men you saw walk across the stream yesterday to save themselves the 
inconvenience of this trip are in any way special creations any more than you are 
no they are not created in any way different from you they do not have one 
atom more power than you were created with they have by the right use of their thought forces 
developed their god-given power the thing that you have seen accomplished while you have been with us 
you yourselves can accomplish just as fully and freely the things you have seen are so 
accomplished in accord with the definite law and every human being can use the law if he will 
i think this is a really important point this is really the reason why i wanted to do this video 
because it shows that any one of us can do this if we just meditate and spiritually elevate ourselves 
so yes saints enlightened masters yogis magic users sorcerers most of the reports come from 
these types of people but not everyone there was of course a popular belief in medieval times that 
witches could not be drowned back in those times it was a very fine line between being accused as 
worshiping the devil or being a witch or being canonized as a saint uh if you exhibited 
paranormal abilities it could go either way pretty easily some were canonized and others were put 
on trial lynched by public mobs and a popular method of lynching a witch was known as quote 
swimming and the accused was thrown into a body of water and if they floated if they had the ability 
to not drown they would be found guilty and killed so kind of a catch-22 there but there are some 
actual first-hand recorded instances of this for example on june 5 1696 several people were 
accused of sorcery and put on trial in monteney france the witnesses were bound by hand and foot 
and thrown into the sane river where they quote didn't sink in the water no more than gourds 
so here's another case which occurred in july of 1737 to an anonymous young woman who was accused 
by the townspeople of bedfordshire in england of witchcraft she was surrounded and quote swam 
she reportedly floated like a cork three times but finally drowned after being tied down 
and if you can believe it this ritual of quote swimming witches was practiced as late as 1931. so 
you can see this is taking place all across the world uh the most modern case that i could find 
was one that was actually scientifically proven it's an amazing case which occurred to a gentleman 
by the name of angelo faticoni of jacksonville florida he was known as quote the human cork 
and throughout the 1920s he displayed his ability to float on water for an indefinite 
period of time over and over again he became known also as the man they could not drown 
he could assume virtually any position lying on his side his back or curled up in a ball he was 
even able to sleep on the water he was able to swim great distances with metal weights 
tied to his body and during one experiment he was observed to float in the water for a period of 15 
hours with a 20 pound lead weight tied to his ankles on another occasion a 20 pound 
cannonball was lashed to his legs he was sewn into a sack and thrown into the water 
this would of course kill most people but angelo fatticoni remained motionless floating on the 
surface of the water for a period of eight hours so his fame grew quickly and he began to attract 
crowds of people who wanted to study his case and at one point his abilities intrigued doctors 
at harvard university who agreed to examine him and it was their theory 
that there was a peculiarity in his physiology that would account for his unnatural buoyancy 
however these doctors from harvard did examine him they did a thorough medical examination 
by doctors and students and they could not find any physical abnormality whatsoever 
his experiments were of course photographed and one of these experiments shows faticoni floating 
in the water while tied to a weighted chair his arms land his chest and his head rests just above 
the water with a calm expression on his face and according to angela faticoni how he acquired this 
ability was the result of a traumatic childhood incident he never described what exactly happened 
but he often promised to reveal how exactly he became quote the human cork but unfortunately 
this was not to be because on august 13 1931 he passed away the new york herald tribune 
announced the death of angelo faticoni with the headline human cork is dead his secret unrevealed 
so again i covered all of these cases in my book human levitation and this ability to walk 
on water may seem like magic but the above cases show that it's available to anybody 
and the ability to remain dry after being exposed to water appears in many other accounts of saints 
and seems to be related to perhaps incombustibility protection from fire and immunity 
to coal to cold so perhaps these levitators these people are able to you know produce some 
sort of electromagnetic magnetic field around their body which can repel fire water and earth 
i don't know hard to say so there you go 20 30 cases of people who have displayed this ability 
to walk on water again this is something that any person can do once they reach a certain level of 
spiritual advancement so that's why i wanted to do this episode for you today because i think it 
shows how truly powerful we as human beings are and that we've only really begun to tap into all 
the many amazing unlimited things that we can do i did cover these accounts in my book human 
levitation there's a chapter in the book called walking on water and i was shocked to find out 
how many cases there are and i'm sure really the cases that i've presented presented here are just 
the tip of the iceberg so i hope you've enjoyed this episode today 
i really want to thank you for watching i truly appreciate it and until next time keep having fun
you
