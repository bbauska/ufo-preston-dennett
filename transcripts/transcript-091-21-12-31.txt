THE UFOS OF BILL AND ROSE
Dec 31, 2021

Summary:
Dec 31, 2021
On April 22, 1994, in the middle of the night, former Navy officer and postal worker Bill Shellhart was driving along a desert highway in New Mexico when he saw strange glowing lights ahead of him on the road. As the lights approached him, Bill realized he was seeing an actual flying saucer. It hovered above his car flashing down beams of light. Terrified, Bill raced away down the highway. Little did he know, his encounter had only just begun.

Looking around him, he noticed that the landscape around him had mysteriously transformed from flat desert to mountains covered with trees. And looking ahead of him on the road, he was shocked to see a massive roiling cloud-like mass sweeping towards his car. The weird cloud engulfed him, and the next thing Bill knew, he was many miles from his original location. 

This was Bill's first encounter, but it would not be his last. This missing time encounter was followed by a series of sightings and close encounters. One year later, a UFO paced his car along a remote desert highway. He began seeing UFOs over his home in Hawaii. He woke up one evening to find a brilliant light filling his bedroom. He would wake up to find strange triangular marks on his body. He noticed that some of his chronic medical problems were miraculously healed.

Meanwhile, Bill's wife, Rose, revealed that she had also had UFO encounters. As a young girl, she was mysteriously rescued from drowning. In 1977, she had a very close-up sighting of a metallic domed saucer with portholes and colored lights which sent down a beam of light, burning the grass near her home in Pasadena, California. She later met Bill and they fell in love and became married. Rose reports that she'd often wake up in the early morning hours when her husband would be dropped back in bed. Bill would then tell her about his strange dream-like experiences of being onboard a craft where he was taught by the ETs.

Then, in the mid 1990s, Bill and Rose were vacationing in Sedona, Arizona. Driving along a highway late at night, they were followed by a mysterious glowing light. For the next half-hour, the light circled around their car, getting closer and closer. Without warning, it dropped from the sky and landed in a field alongside the road. The next thing Bill and Rose knew, hours had passed, and they were approaching their hotel. 

Realizing they had experienced another missing time encounter, they decided to go under hypnosis. They learned that they had not been abducted, but instead they had been invited onboard a craft where they met friendly human-looking ETs who had an important message for them.

The UFO encounters of Bill and Rose continued, and both became spiritually transformed. They look upon the ETs as friends and teachers, and they have agreed to share their experiences with the world.

The full story of the UFOs of Bill and Rose (and several other accounts) is presented in my book, "Extraterrestrial Visitations: True Accounts of Contact." Available on Amazon!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal 
i call this episode the UFOs of bill and rose and this episode is all about the 
ufo experiences of a married couple by the name of william and rose shellheart 
they've had lifelong experiences with ET's sightings landings missing time and an onboard 
encounter in which they learned why they had been contacted by ETs it's a very interesting series 
of events some of these were quite frightening for them and others were very much benevolent 
in fact rose believes the ET's saved her life when she was a little girl and bill believes the 
et's healed him so it has some very interesting insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon 
and that's why I wanted to do this episode today and I'm going to play first-hand clips 
from my interview with bill and rose so you can hear them tell their story in their own words 
so let's just start with bill shell hart bill is a retired navy officer he also worked for the post 
office as a letter carrier for many years and his first major UFO experience occurred on april 22 
1994 while driving from clovis new mexico towards albuquerque this was about 3 00 am and he's 
heading west on highway 60 and he was planning on stopping at fort sumner but that didn't happen and 
i think this is significant as bill says in his own words upon approaching the exit I slowed down 
preparing to turn and for some reason unknown to me I overshot the exit and kept going I was 
puzzled as to what happened but decided it was no big deal as I could catch the next exit at vaughn 
i think this is significant because this is something I've heard from many other contactees 
something happens to to divert them from their original destination so bill continued driving 
he reached vaughan and turned north onto interstate or onto the highway 285 
and this is where he had a UFO encounter which I call missing time on highway 285 should have taken 
about an hour and a half to reach interstate 40 towards albuquerque but of course that's 
not what happened as bill is traveling up 285 he comes over a hill and sees a very bright 
white light ahead of him on the highway and I'll just let bill describe in his own words 
what happened next well like I say it was three something in the morning I know that and uh
like I say I came up I was I had been drinking coffee uh constantly because I was driving through 
the night so I you know I hadn't drank anything other than coffee so when I came up this hill 
and just as I was going down that's when I saw these lights and I you know my first thought was it had to be a huge truck coming because the lights were so bright and then all 
of a sudden they start dancing they would up and down back and forth and I just my god what is this 
and that's when they uh as the closer I got to it I was leery I didn't want to I didn't want to 
jump out of the car and that's when it crossed the road came straight towards me and just before I got to it went straight up in the air so he was amazed this light 
approached him and as he says in a written statement I was at a loss to what I was seeing 
it apparently was trying to get my attention what it did I had no idea what I was looking at my intention was to stop alongside of it and take a quick look 
and leave and again I'll just let bill describe in his own words what happened next 
and that's when I stopped and and I looked up to my windshield and that's when I saw it 
and before I could leave there I mean it's all happened within I mean we'll say 10 seconds 
before I could sit back down in the seat uh that's when that bright light came down in into my uh 
back window and it came right on in there and of course I was frightened I didn't know what was going on I was I wasn't looking for UFOs I mean I've never seen one in my life 
just scared the living hell out of me but that was the uh that was the experience I had and 
it was strange so bill did provide not only an audible interview but a written statement of 
what he saw which clarifies a little bit of what happened here he described this light over his 
car well actually he says it was a saucer shaped metallic craft and as he says in his own words and 
i quote it was a saucer shaped vehicle hovering about 50 to 75 feet in the air and not moving 
the only visible light was an orange hue over the dome the surface was a dark gray color and 
rough looking the round saucer under it was easy to see the craft was not large maybe six feet 
in diameter so at this point the object is over his car um he's quite alarmed and he's driving a 
1994 oldsmobile a very powerful car so he quickly presses the accelerator down to the floor and 
tries to outrun this object and as he says and again I quote at that moment a huge bright light 
appeared in the rear view mirror I went into a total panic every muscle in my body froze 
i could feel my foot on the accelerator trying to put it through the floorboard and my hands were glued to the steering wheel I glanced at the speedometer it showed over 90 miles 
per hour all I wanted to do was get that light off my back in what seemed like about five seconds 
this light quickly changed direction and darted away moving off and disappearing into the distance 
and he thought his encounter was over but it wasn't this is when things went from strange to truly bizarre first thing he noticed was that the landscape seemed to have changed 
the road which had been flat and desert-like was now hilly mountainous with lots of trees 
and looking ahead of him on the road he saw something he could hardly believe or comprehend it looked like there was a huge massive landslide heading towards 
him covering the entire width of the road and far beyond it and as he drove closer he could 
see this wasn't actually a landslide but instead it was this weird looking cloud kind of rolling 
and roiling and sweeping towards him like this huge tsunami it looked very strange and the next 
thing he knows he's inside of this cloud feeling very disoriented and quite frightened as he says 
i've never seen anything like that in my life it was like a big rolling thing and 
even though I felt I was driving on the road a sensation of being in the clouds overcame me 
i could see them rolling at me very fast it was not fog the night had been clear 
the next thing bill knew he was much farther along the road had reached highway 40 and was pulling 
into a rest stop so this was very confusing to him and I'll just let him describe this 
in his own words let's see that's the funny part of it is uh I took off the road that I 
was traveling was about an hour and a half to get up to i-40 which would take me straight into 
albuquerque and I swear to this god almighty I made that in such a short time it just seemed like 
uh it's true I was traveling fast but I wasn't traveling that fast that I could have covered that in and we'll say within 30 minutes and and I i felt I was in the car 
i felt I was driving but when I hit them clouds and they started rolling on me I mean I just 
i've never seen anything like in my life where the clouds actually just it was just like a big rolling thing and the next thing I know I was uh I was up in albuquerque I was 
not in albuquerque I was up in i-40 and I was in a rest area and it all happened so fast so 
somehow he had traveled an hour and a half and he believes about 30 minutes so this was very strange 
and confusing to him he was still quite frightened he immediately pulled into this rest stop and parked between two semi trucks he fell asleep woke up sometime later to a loud banging noise turned 
out the semi truck next to him its batteries were both dead completely dead and not only that 
bill's car also suffered some apparent electromagnetic effects in that his windshield wipers and washers no longer worked a fuse had blown so these are electromagnetic effects 
apparently due to this close encounter so this was quite confusing to bill and frightening 
two days later he returned to his home in oahu in on in the hawaiian islands and told his wife rose 
about what happened and rose had her own strange incident to report it turned out at the same time 
that william bill was having this experience rose had some strange problems with the television 
which started changing channels by itself she turned the tv off and it came back on 
and continued to change channels so she turned it off again and this occurred at the same time that 
bill was having his encounter bill also decided to check the two remote controls they had and 
discovered that the batteries in both remote controls had gone completely dead now this 
could be a complete coincidence I don't think so in either case it's a strange synchronicity 
that I think probably does have some connection to bill's encounter it's very hard to say but 
it was one year later or so that bill was driving along again highway 60 and had another UFO 
encounter in which a UFO paced his car and I'll just let him describe this incident again in his 
own words and you know the strange part about it is after I had this experience I went back
i went back good I went back a year later now this is something I can't even explain 
i'm I'm driving down the same road and all of a sudden I see this 
this red light in front of me and I thought well you know somebody's doing something so I speed it up and it's like this light kept moving as fast as I was moving now this is crazy I 
know it sounds crazy so I i speed it up and I and I and I caught up to this light and it was moving 
right alongside the car with me and we were going on this hilly road about 60 70 miles an hour I 
mean so all of a sudden I found myself coming into this little town I forget uh some kind of a 
port I forget the name of this town right now and there was two lights in front of me well these two lights went straight up in the air and they went over the rooftops and I thought oh my god this is 
crazy and two years after his 1994 encounter bill had the opportunity to drive along to highway 285 
and this is when he got an incredible shock the landscape that he remembered seeing that was hilly 
mountainous and full of trees did not exist the highway was flat and desert it did not look at 
all like what he recalled and I'll just let bill describe a little bit of how he discovered this 
the next year this was this was two years this was two years later from my original encounter and I and I i got there on that road I got there just as as uh the sun was coming up 
and I traveled that road and what shocked me is there wasn't a tree and there wasn't a hill and 
that first night that's all I saw was hills and trees now I don't know but that blew my 
mind two years later and I travel the same road and all of a sudden it's flat straight no trees 
i can't even explain that I mean I was totally uh totally shook shook up from that because 
i know what I saw that first night I remember going up and down hills I remember seeing trees 
that is strange isn't it so help me god I come out with home I like that I said you know I said that there was nothing there but uh that's the honest to god's truth I was really shocked at that one 
so this does appear to be a screen memory and judging from all the descriptions 
bill has given this close-up UFO sighting being struck by a beam of light the fear he felt the way this UFO targeted him the missing time the screen memory 
the electromagnetic effects uh these all add up to what I think is probably 
a missing time encounter where he was taken on board and in fact he does have some dream 
memories of this but they were quite vague and too confusing and he's not really sure quite what to 
make of it but he definitely had a very obvious missing time encounter and this was bill's first 
real introduction to the UFO phenomenon and what happened to him may lie with his wife rose who 
does have a lifelong series of UFO encounters beginning when she was just a little girl 
his wife rose was born in europe in lithuania and actually spent her childhood in rotenberg 
germany and it was there she had an experience where she was saved from drowning she believes 
by ETs later in life she had a hypnotic regression due to a future on-board encounter and during this 
hypnotic regression she recalled being taken to age four when her life was saved and I'll just 
let rose describe this incident in her own words okay my name is rose shellheart and um I'm born 
in lithuania partially raised in germany and then america so it it dates back actually to 
back in germany when I was around four in rottenburg germany I fall in this fountain 
of icy water in the middle of winter and playing along with some children's dishes and I remember 
as I'm drowning I don't know which way is up or down and done somebody pulls me out and doesn't 
say a word and when I look around to see who it was they're like totally disappeared but I 
didn't associate that with one of those encounters until my regression through this dr laszlo steiner 
rose's second experience occurred many years later in fact it was 40 years later by this time 
she had had three children and she was living in pasadena california this was back in 1977 
so it was much less populated back then than it is now and rose and her children 
had just finished dinner and they heard this very loud whirring noise and they ran outside to see 
what it was turned out so did their neighbors and much of the neighborhood all ran outside and a 
large crowd of people saw a classic flying saucer rose described it as metallic with colored lights 
little portholes around it and it was sending down a beam of light this thing was at treetop level 
and I'll just let rose describe this encounter in her own words and then in pasadena when I was 
already a mother of three our entire family and neighborhood saw one practically ready to land 
and of course when everyone called headquarters it's an air you know one of those air balloons 
that's what they always say but we all saw it so and a 14 year old and the 10 year old world enough 
to remember it as well oh it was around and had all these different lights and windows we could 
almost see in them but then some helicopters chased that away it was like no aircraft I 
had ever seen and I was raised in the war zone overseas so but it really really looked enormous 
and I don't know if it was just going to hover or try to land I don't think there was enough room for it to land between the houses there it was starting to come down till the helicopters came 
we all ran outside because it was making a noise it was in the night those worrying sounds like 
but different from what I could um relate it to some things you can't really explain like 
how do you describe the taste of milk no it was not a balloon it had the light beaming down too 
and then the grass died that's why we were all impressed the whole neighborhood was out 
wasn't just us so it was exactly one half block above colorado avenue 44 north parkwood
so that's quite an amazing sighting this object was sending down a beam of light which apparently 
burned the grass on the ground and it was chased away by helicopters and the whole incident was 
given a debunking explanation of balloons which rose is very much certain it was not balloons 
but the real encounter occurred later around 1996-97 in or around sedona arizona at this 
time bill and rose were on vacation in sedona in fact they had just left sedona it was late 
at night and they were driving towards prescott and it was quite late uh 11 p.m around midnight 
when this UFO showed up and it was a star-like object which first started following their car and 
then appeared ahead of them on the road and seemed to kind of circle around them playing this sort of 
cat and mouse game and I'll just let rose describe this sighting and how it began in her own words 
when I was with bill that trip when actually it made us chase it we had driven 
two days and two nights without sleep and we were exhausted looking for a motel but 
something compelled us to follow that light it's like we're hypnotized we have to follow this light 
and I remember we almost hit a cow and we ended up in this little town called jerome which I didn't 
even know existed what are we doing we must be nuts and we gotta follow this like and get playing 
games with us you know it was no star way too big for a star and and stars twinkle and this one 
doesn't and so forth and wherever these winding roads went it was there in front of us stars again 
don't do that when you change your direction and it did come like straight down in the middle of 
a field and this is where we don't have conscious recall of anything else except we finally found a 
place to sleep that night and that was it so bill also recalls pretty much exactly 
what rose says and as bill wrote in his written account of this incident and I quote 
that light came out of the sky straight out of the sky and went into the ground 
it just dropped out of sight and that was the last I saw of it I don't know where it went or what happened but I saw it come straight down so here's a short clip in which he describes seeing 
this light land in the field next to them my wife and I were up in sedona that's a that's a hot spot 
and we were coming up we had to go up the hill getting into uh arizona and uh it was almost 
straight up and we saw this bright light and we we followed that bright light and as we were coming 
into prescott arizona that light came straight out of the sky and went to the ground it just dropped 
now from that point on I don't know I i mean I don't know where it went or or what happened 
but I saw it come straight down it was a big it was a white light it was a bright white light 
and and like I said uh it could there's no way it could have been a star because it as we as 
we made the curves going up and down at that going up that hill it seemed to follow us it seemed like 
every time I turned around it was there in front of me and then I followed it into prescott and uh 
and anyways all of a sudden boom it just dropped right out of sight just straight down so they arrived at their hotel around 3am went to bed they realized later of course that they had had 
missing time and they decided to go under hypnotic regression and this is when rose learned about 
her childhood experience of being saved by the ETs and they learned that they had been taken on board
the hypnotist a UFO researcher tried to put bill under hypnosis but he 
could not be placed under a trance rose however was an excellent hypnotic subject 
and she went right into a trance and started to recall not only the childhood incident 
but this missing time incident that they had had between sedona arizona and prescott 
rose recalled that they were not abducted but that in fact this craft the starting object had landed 
in the field next to them and they were invited on board by human looking ETs and I'll just 
play a clip of the interview in which rose describes what happened but during the regression I was describing things that I had forgotten even details of the 
town and stuff and so and it says we weren't like kidnapped or abducted we voluntarily 
boarded and we were welcome and I was asked where is bill he well dr elijah steiner asked me to ask 
where is bill at this time because he's in another room they were just saying that we are helping you 
they looked a lot more like people than some of these um sketches do a lot more their eyes 
were a little larger than any like white person's big eyes would be but they were just not enormous 
they looked very much like they could pass for us if they wished and they glowed a blue aura 
which kind of made me feel reassured I don't know on a mental level that they're peaceful 
how how are they dressed do you remember that I said inside something like would be a military 
outfit but not of anything I have seen and I've been in europe in here and so forth 
but it would resemble because they're all like I alike but a little more loose fitting but with 
belts next I'd like to play a little clip in which rose describes the interior of the craft 
which surprised her because it was not what she expected she expected it to be quite different 
than what she actually saw so here's rose describing the interior of the craft oh there 
was all kinds of lights and very few actual gizmos like we would have on any aircraft here like they 
didn't need them it didn't look like they needed too many things it's like they almost had mind 
control to get the thing going but there were little lights I guess monitors for whatever 
at one point uh they asked where these ETs were from and the ETs gave a typically evasive answer 
as rose says they're from a place that you don't know about yet and now we get to what 
i think is the most interesting part of their encounter at which point rose asked the ET's 
why they had been contacted and the ET's told her a very interesting reason 
and again I'll just let rose describe in her own words what the ET's told her they said that they 
are helping certain people here because they will help humanity and something about like if the more 
we help the more they help us but they can't interfere and just take over and fix everything 
back on oahu bill and rose continued to have many more UFO encounters they heard about 
sightings from their neighbors and they themselves would often see UFOs hovering out over the ocean 
and one evening bill woke up in his bedroom to find that the whole room had filled with light 
this should not be possible because the window in his bedroom does not face the road it faces the 
back of the house which is pure jungle there are no roads or structures at all but back there so 
there's really no way for his room to light up and I'll just let bill describe this in his own words 
i woke up in the morning well the one night that uh that that light came in the back window 
i mean it came in just as bright as can be I couldn't believe it and there's nothing in the back because we we have a jungle behind our house and there's no way a car could have got in there 
and I mean that's what it looked like some of these headlights shining right into the window and I remember waking up and seeing that and then and this all happened within the matter of uh 
i'd say two to three months all of this stuff took place this whole this it was just a kind of 
a shocking thing I just know that uh I progressed and started to feel better I do know that I but I 
don't know what happened on a few occasions bill actually woke up to see strange marks on his body 
these were usually in the shape of a triangle once on his wrist once on his leg he believes these are 
related to the fact that he started to feel much better he believes the ET's 
actually healed him and I'll just let him describe that in his own words
one morning and I found those triangular pinpricks on my right hand 
and uh this was the hand I used when I carried mail I mean this like this was in constant use 
and uh they were they were very fresh because you know you could still see the 
they had they had just just about scammed over and I showed them to my wife immediately and 
i said my god look at this thing it's perfect it's a perfect triangle and uh 
then it was a matter of a few months later when when I found it on my right ankle 
the same exact thing same three exact print pin pricks that were evenly spaced 
in a perfect triangle I i felt uh I felt something itching on my my right ankle and that's what I looked and I said oh my god because there's no way possible in the night I could have 
done this and that's what had happened and like I say right now I'm very active in what I'm doing
even though I'm retired I'm constantly either working for my neighbors or for myself or whatever but where we live here it's right on the beach and it's uh it's constant uh constant upkeep to keep 
these houses in great shape so unfortunately in my age I'm able to do this and like I said when 
i was carrying mail I was I had went out and got myself a hot tub you know I did everything I could 
you know to take some of that pain away and then when I retired of course I came straight over here 
and uh it wasn't until uh until after my uh incident there in 94 that things started to 
get better so bill is probably being taken because he says that sometimes he would be 
dropped from his bed he has no actual memories of this but he does confirm that his wife does 
remember this and he does say that he did have weird dreams which the ET's were teaching him 
stuff so here's will describing this you know my wife has told me a few times she's thought 
that they took me someplace because when they put me back in bed she said she'd we have a water bed 
and she said I i came down I crashed down that's the way she explained it to me now I didn't know 
yeah she said that I woke her up because I just felt like somebody threw me in bed
that I don't know I just I mean I just know what she told me and I uh I have to believe her she 
said she put in a hell of a night with me I know that she said and that's usually usually when it happens now I want to play another clip in which rose confirms exactly what bill is saying about 
he being dropped onto his bed and being taught weird things about how these craft fly and also 
about healing that's another thing they do come to bill and dream state I don't care what he thinks 
that guy gets flopped back in bed so often and then he always tells me about this dream about aliens teaching him about different travel systems so that must have been something about his message 
but I can't prove it but both of us have become more and more interested in like helping people 
in a alternative healing way so it's even bill he's got this energy in his hands that he didn't 
have before he just plowed into your back trying to rub you down and almost hurt you and now it's 
like I feel this heat coming out that's really good yeah and people say they feel it out of me 
too and I thought where did I get this from I have a lot of good result stories from the neighborhood 
yeah I'm grateful because I think that has a lot to do with it 
so as you can see bill believes he was healed by the ET's he had been suffering from carpal tunnel 
syndrome and problems with his knees but following this 1994 encounter and following other encounters 
he started to feel much better and he believes the ET's probably healed him 
his sightings continued they lived in an area of oahu that's quite isolated it's called puna 
lu and they had more UFO sightings and there is a military base not far from them and on a few 
occasions the military showed up to actually chase these craft but they are they have been 
sighted here uh there's uh there's an area of about well I'm gonna say it's about eight 
to ten miles down the road I know one night that they were sighted down there and they because they broadcasted on television that they would they'd seen something out there 
now I've seen them out straight off the ocean in fact one night about midnight I saw one and uh they have we have a marine base and I could see the marine base from where we live 
and they brought they set out two helicopters and they circled this light they just kept going around it and then they then they went back to the base so I know it was 
nothing up in the sky it was something that they were looking at I saw it myself so because I i was working late that time I got home around midnight and that's when I saw it this was uh well probably 
about two years ago two two years or so ago my wife has seen him many times she get up in the 
middle of the night and she's seen she go to the front window and she's seen she's seeing lights 
over the ocean to three o'clock in the morning yeah so they're in the area but we don't know 
you know what their intentions are right now but they surely haven't heard us that's not sure so that is the story of bill and rose's UFOs as you can see it's quite an interesting 
and complex story that involves not only sightings but on board encounters landings electromagnetic 
effects and physiological effects and also what I would call spiritual transformation 
bill and rose were have been quite prominent in their community for helping others and uh healing 
or rose is an herbal healer and has done very good work and as she says has good testimonials 
so I think this again confirms why some people are being contacted and others aren't I told 
bill and rose's case in my book extraterrestrial visitations it's one of many accounts like this 
in that book and I think it shows that ET's again are contacting people and healing people who are 
helping humanity in some capacity that's certainly true in bill and rose's case they were a delight 
to interview but their story I think is a very important story and deserves to be told 
and that's why I wanted to present it to you today I hope you've enjoyed it I hope 
you found it as interesting as I do and I want to thank you very much for watching I 
truly appreciate it until next time keep searching for answers and more importantly keep having fun
