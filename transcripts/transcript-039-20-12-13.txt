UFO INCIDENT ON THE USS VALUE FORGE
Dec 13, 2020

Summary:
Dec 13, 2020
In 1960, a 21-year-old young man named Jim, joined the Navy and was stationed aboard the US Navy 
aircraft carrier, USS Valley Forge as an electronics specialist and a helicopter crew member of 
the HS-3 Hunter Killer antisubmarine squadron. While returning from the Mediterranean Sea to the 
United States, Jim and at least ten other crew members observed multiple unidentified glowing 
objects, UFOs, off the starboard bow of their ship. The objects remained in view for nearly an 
hour, beginning a mystery that would leave a trail of unanswered questions. 

Jim soon learned two things. First, there was an apparent coverup of the event. Second, this 
incident was not just a simple sighting, but involved direct contact, perhaps actual onboard 
UFO encounters. In fact, he himself had memories he couldn't explain.

This video presents one man's amazing story about his participation in a multiple witness UFO 
incident on the USS Valley Forge, and how he came to realize that his sighting might actually 
involve an onboard encounter and face to face contact with ETs. Jim had a long conversation 
with the UFO people, and was given a profound and important message for all humankind, one 
which would have a profound impact on his entire life.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  the title of today's presentation is the ufo  
incident on the uss valley forge this is a very  interesting ufo encounter which occurred on board  
a navy aircraft care carrier which was stationed  in the mediterranean sea and actually on its  
return voyage to the united states when this  incident happened the main witness i talked to  
is jim kublebeck at the time he was 21 years  old and had been stationed on the uss valley  
forge as an electronics engineer he was part of  the hs3 hunter killer anti-submarine squadron  
uh he was a member of the helicopter crew  and spent many hours you know over the ocean  
hunting out submarines doing training  he was trained in aircraft recognition  
the ship had recently done some experiments  with skyhook balloons and then after touring  
and training in the mediterranean were on their  way back home when a very interesting ufo incident  
occurred was viewed by many of the people on  the ship again the main witness is jim kublebeck  
age 21 years old he decided he was going to go  up on the deck one evening and smoke a cigarette  
so that's what he did and to his shock he  was not up there long when suddenly he saw  
something very unusual there was a group of  about four or five very large bright lights  
off on the horizon on the starboard bow and he  looked at them and tried to figure out what they  
could possibly be but was immediately puzzled you  could tell that they were about 30 feet 30 miles  
away and had to be at least 100 feet across or  more judging on their size they were pulsating  
both in size and brightness and he was absolutely  puzzled as to what these things could be  
as he says and i'm quoting they were the strangest  lights that i've ever seen in my life the best way  
that i can describe them is that the lights  themselves seemed to be a pulsating breathing  
living thing they increased in brightness from a  low to a dazzlingly bright level i watched them  
for some time trying to analyze what they could  be i've never seen anything like that in my life  
so after 15 minutes of watching these and being  unable to identify them jim decided he's gonna go  
back below deck and get a pair of binoculars that  he had bought while on shore leave and see if he  
can get some other witnesses so he returns to his  crew quarters and opens his locker and his fellow  
crewmates start teasing him many of them had also  gone onshore and bought various merchandise only  
to open up their packages and discover that they  had been ripped off and that their packages were  
nothing more than rocks so they started teasing  jim saying ah jim he wants to find out that  
he bought a bunch of rocks he probably bought  rocks and not binoculars so jim opens his package  
and smiling he holds up two pairs of brand new  binoculars these are 7 by 50 binoculars nice pairs  
and he asks if anyone has seen these weird lights  on this starboard bow and told them oh you've got  
to take a look at this um there's something really  weird going on top side and a number of these guys  
just paid no attention to him they didn't want  to go up but he managed to convince about four  
or five of his fellow crewmates to go back up  onto the deck and look at these weird lights  
they followed him up onto the deck and he pointed  him out they were very obvious to everyone quite  
large still pulsating they shared the binoculars  which although they magnified these objects  
they were still unable to identify them there  was no sound coming from them they continued  
to pulsate in brightness and in size and had  sort of a marbling yellow white color to them  
and everybody was just mystified nobody had any  idea what they could possibly be nobody actually  
used the word ufo but it was pretty much what they  were all beginning to think so jim has an idea he  
decides he's going to go below deck and call the  bridge so he goes below deck and calls the bridge  
and here's the conversation that  followed it's pretty interesting as  
jim called them up and said is there something  going on what's off the starboard side of the ship  
the officer who had answered his call said  i don't know what you're talking about  
jim replied do you see those lights off the  starboard side the officer replied i have not seen  
anything unusual this was clearly impossible  the lights were highly visible and had to be  
even more visible from the bridge so jim became  irritated and asked again well let me speak to  
someone else on the bridge and the officer  hesitated and finally said i'm here alone  
that's obviously a complete lie no no one is  ever alone on the bridge so jim hung up the phone  
in uh frustration and returned to the deck to  see if the lights were still there they were  
lights were still there the crowd had  grown to about uh 10 people by now  
and uh he noticed another some something  very unusual about these lights  
uh not only did they not reflect on the water  there was no reflection you could you couldn't  
see them in your peripheral vision as jim  says again i'm quoting they were unlike any  
lights i have ever seen before or since when  one looked away from them just a short angle  
it seemed they could not be seen out of the  sides of one's eyes despite their brightness  
there seemed to be no peripheral vision  reception on our part they could only be  
seen when looking directly at them so by  now jim was really concerned and puzzled  
and he decided he's going to go back down to  the deck below deck and call the bridge again  
so that's what he does uh jim goes below  the deck calls up the bridge and uh this  
time he gives his name his rank his service  number and his squadron commander's name  
and he says are you seeing what i'm seeing and  asks about the lights and the officer replied  
kind of angrily look we're damn busy we can't  talk to you now we'll have to get back to you  
and hung up on him so jim hangs up and goes back  up on deck there's at least 10 guys up there  
watching these lights pulsating  and just sort of sitting there  
and suddenly the ship makes a sharp 90 degree turn  it was clearly a maneuver to avoid these lights  
or to take some sort of action because this was  not something that would normally happen in the  
middle of the night and no sooner did they  turn when the lights started to winking out  
one by one they didn't zip away or  anything they just sort of disappeared  
and uh leaving all of the officers there on deck  completely mystified as jim says so everybody's  
just baffled we couldn't believe it we're  looking at each other like what in the hell  
is this we were taught to identify aircraft and  that kind of stuff but these were not aircraft  
so jim returned below deck as did the other guys  they all went to bed uh jim had a restless night  
he woke up the next morning very eager to find out  if there was any information about this incident  
he went and he checked out the valley forges daily  news sheet which was printed each morning and  
told about various events on the ship and he was  surprised to see that there was no mention of the  
weird lights whatsoever that really puzzled him  and he wanted to find out more information about  
what he had seen he didn't have a chance he had  to do some flights early that morning so he went  
off on a helicopter flight doing his training and  returned some hours later and decided he was going  
to call the bridge again and that's what he did  he called the bridge explained the set the weird  
sighting he had had the previous night and asked  if there was any information about this incident  
and the officer who answered  told him and i'm quoting  
we have no record of your call and there have  been no unusual observations or entries in the log  
so jim was annoyed at this and he asked well  then may i have the name of the officer who  
was on watch duty is there a chance i can  talk to him and the officer replied that  
he wasn't sure about that and that he would  have to get back to jim with that information  
jim asked when can i call you back and the  officer replied call me back in a few minutes  
so a few minutes later jim was back on the phone  with the bridge and again explained his request to  
speak with the officer who had been on duty last  night and asked if he could have the location of  
that officer when the the guy who answered said  no you we are you're not able to speak with him  
and so he asked where is the officer  and the officer on the phone replied  
quote he's been transferred he's off of the ship  he flew off this morning on a male plane uh jim i  
asked the reason for the transfer and the officer  replied he's going on leave for two weeks and he  
will not be returning to the ship so jim hung  up the phone he knew something extremely fishy  
was going on because this was the sort of thing  that just didn't happen as jim says nobody but  
nobody is flown off an aircraft carrier at sea for  the purpose of quote going on leave so he thinks  
it's probably connected to these weird lights  and this weird observation of the night before  
there's something still in his mind nagging about  the whole incident he can't quite put his finger  
on it but he feels like he's forgotten  something about it or there's something  
that he doesn't quite remember he's just not  quite sure what this feeling means but he  
this incident is haunting him that evening he  returns to the locker room where his crewmates  
are and is opening his locker when suddenly one  of the crew members starts teasing him and says oh  
jim's going to open his package and see if  he bought binoculars or if he just got rocks  
and jim is confused by the comment  because this was one of the guys who  
had actually gone up with him and viewed  these uh ufos through the very binoculars  
and jim's like what are you talking about  you know i already opened these binoculars  
and they're like no you didn't what are you  talking about and he says yeah don't you remember  
i opened the binoculars he held him up and we all  went out on deck and we watched these weird lights  
and these crew members looked at him like he was  crazy they did not remember they had no memory of  
going up on deck and watching these ufos these  were the same people he had been up there with  
and they had no memory of it now and as jim says  and i'm quoting it annoys the hell out of me to  
this day some of the guys did not remember  watching these objects with my binoculars  
and they were not lying they did not remember  these were some of the same individuals who  
had used them the night before in an attempt  to identify what we had seen to this day i am  
convinced that they have lost their recollection  of the events of the previous evening it was as  
if it was blocked out of their memory and to  this day that just baffles the hell out of me  
so yeah this really upset him uh he finally did  locate a couple of the guys who were there who  
were like oh yeah i do remember seeing something  now that you mention it but most of them did not  
it had been wiped clean from their minds  and they as jim says they weren't lying  
so this is definitely something  we see with extensive contact  
amnesia does turn up usually in sort of on-board  ufo experiences or you know ufo abductions  
but can't certainly turn up in what would seem  to be a simple sighting on the other hand this  
is often a red flag an indicator that there was  perhaps deeper levels of contact and there was  
another thing that bothered jim not only did these  his crewmates not remember but he himself felt  
like he had forgotten something about the sighting  and that was also annoying and frustrating to him  
and he just couldn't figure out what it was  he couldn't get the sighting out of his mind  
that evening he went back up on deck and looked  for the ufos again there was nothing there and uh  
he went back below deck and was laying there  and about to fall asleep and was sort of just  
meditating on the whole sighting and the  incident and all the events that followed  
when suddenly he had a flash of memory  this quote dream flooded back into his mind  
he calls it a dream in quotes indicating that  this is probably something much more than  
just a dream he believes there's some level of  contact with these ufos because in this dream  
jim found himself in a very strange place  and it was not aboard the uss valley forge  
he found himself in a strange room surrounded by  human looking men in white coats or white uniforms  
and his first thought was he was awol and he's  going to be caught he was pretty upset about  
it and uh they did not seem to care about that  their first question was what qualifies you to be  
here and kim started telling them about his  qualifications and his knowledge of energy as an  
electronics engineer and a scientist he was very  well educated uh even though he was quite young  
and they seemed to be very interested in talking  to him about energy in fact that's what this whole  
conversation uh proceeded to be about was  about how humans had evolved with energy  
throughout the ages he talked with these  guys about how humans had evolved from  
horse and bucky days to having the steam  locomotive steam engine to inventing the internal  
combustion engine with gasoline and diesel  engines and reciprocating jet engines and so on  
all the way up to you know nuclear power and uh  higher forms of energy electric motors and so on  
and one of the guys replied you are also limiting  yourself in many ways by the laws you adhere to  
and i'll just quote one of these alleged et's  uh directly because they had a very interesting  
message to impart to jim as they told him  you have momentum there's the sun magnetism  
centrifugal force there are an endless number of  forces do not limit yourself by what you have been  
told such limitations are negative in nature  if you think something will work it will work  
so the whole conversation was about alternative  energy sources other than perhaps fossil fuels  
and as these guys told him and again i'm quoting  
you can do your part everyone can change the  world in some way everything affects everything  
remember that so it's a slow process it makes  no difference five minutes is like 5 000 years
and uh jim was talking to them he's like well  what do you want me to do you know invent  
an alternative power source  and change the way people think  
and they said yes and again i'll just quote  these you know alleged et's directly as they  
told jim if you desire it you  can do it what you have to do  
you will do you will have other priorities for  a time but you will know when the time is right  
the only limitations mankind has is what he has  created in his mind his negative limitations and  
restrictions have been created by his own thought  processes there are some acceptable tradeoffs  
gifts from god are boundless and limitless and  never ending they can be used as power sources  
to generate whatever energy sources man desires  or needs in any stage of evolution the very  
problems you are talking about can be eliminated  and the very concepts you desire you can achieve  
any problem you can visualize can also  be non-visualized solving the problems  
as they arise if man changes his concept of  limitations there will be no limitations it's that  
simple and to sort of emphasize what they were  talking about they now took him to another room  
in this room which was relatively small jim  was with two of these uh human looking figures  
dressed in white and it was apparently  some sort of engine room because in the  
center of it was this weird looking engine  which he could not make heads or tails of  
the most interesting thing to him was that it  was not connected to any apparent power source  
and he pointed that out and they immediately  replied that he was contradicting himself that  
they had just pointed out there are other  forms of energy everywhere and as they  
said all you need is the concept you will do the  rest you mention friction inertia and momentum  
as problems when in reality they may be assets  if man would use these forces to his advantage  
he could invent a power source of what you speak  we also know that you once entertained the thought  
that everything that exists might simply be a  concrete manifestation of creative thought god has  
given all creation to mankind everything man needs  is at his disposal if only he seeks to use it  
and that was the end of this quote dream  jim doesn't remember anything more than that  
i've shortened the whole conversation considerably  because it goes on for pages these et's had  
quite a message to give jim but it all sort of  revolved around this idea of alternative sources  
of energy and that jim had the ability to build  a quote free energy motor or perpetual motion  
type of device he had the knowledge and the  wherewithal to do this was their message to him  
and that was it so this left him  pretty stunned and speechless  
uh he finally realized what he had been nagging at  his consciousness all this time and he definitely  
connected this whole quote dream to the ufo  sighting he had had uh uh just prior to the dream  
uh it's entirely possible he was taken  on board and this is actually a memory  
of the actual incident or his  you know what actually happened
uh he didn't talk about it with any of his  crew members after that he just continued  
working for the next few months he was very busy  on ship there wasn't a lot of time for chit chat  
and uh before he knew it his  service on the ship was over  
the last thing he did when leaving the ship  was talked to one of the guys he had seen  
the ufo with and he brought it up and his  fellow crewmate said oh yeah i will never  
forget those lights but you know i sure had  some weird dreams for a few nights after that  
so that left jim stunned so apparently  he was not the only one who had  
some sort of weird no experience with contact with  apparently the occupants of these ufos at any rate  
that that was something he always regrets is not  asking that gentleman his fellow crewmate what his  
dreams were about because jim certainly remembers  what he dreamt and it had a huge impact on him he  
did keep it secret he returned home to his parents  uh eventually left home uh became married had kids  
and lived out his life uh he actually moved  away from the military from working with  
the military as an electronics engineer or  doing any of that kind of scientific work  
instead he was drawn to alternative sort of  lifestyle he became a dowser a water dowser  
and turned out he was very good at it this  was something he had been interested in  
in uh prior to his time in the navy uh and after  he got out of it he found out he was very good at  
it he had quite a talent for it was able to  locate water sources when no one else could  
and ended up you know throughout a lifetime of  doing this locating more than different four more  
than four thousand different water sources in  his area he's received awards and commendations  
for his work and has been able to find water  where other scientific quote scientific methods  
had failed so yeah apparently he does have  this incredible talent with water dowsing  
but one uh many many years following this ufo  encounter in the navy on the uss valley forge  
he finally decided he was going to tell his  wife and kids what he saw what he experienced  
he told them the whole story and then he told  him about the instructions he had been given  
regarding building sort of a perpetual motion  device or a free energy motor and they were  
really impressed very supportive and they told him  he should try it you should go ahead and try and  
build this machine that he's envisioned and that's  exactly what he did as jim says and i'm quoting i  
decided at the very least i could try to find out  if what i had been thinking about had any merit  
maybe then i would be satisfied and would be  able to forget it so i went out and i purchased  
some parts and i began my dream project i felt  like a mad scientist as i collected all my junk  
all these parts in my garage and being careful  that no one saw me some weeks later i had the  
crudest weirdest bicycle wheel you've ever seen  mounted on a board in my workshop and damn it all  
it was turning my contact switches acquired from  an old pinball machine left much to be desired  
but still the damn wheel turned click click click  for days on end my daughters were impressed but  
what next much research i had to gain rpm  revolutions per minute to the thousands  
maybe it can't be done i'm sure an electronics  engineer would get one hell of a laugh out of  
what i had put together nevertheless the concept  is there my concept seems plausible if not in my  
lifetime maybe somebody else is maybe it can maybe  it can't work with the technology available today  
but the concept so intrigues me that maybe  if what one can envision can indeed become a  
reality at some point in time my sharing it  with someone will someday have some benefit
jim eventually put his uh machine away i find  it very interesting because this is the same  
sort of message a lot of contactees get about  alternative sources of energy and instructions  
to build a free energy motor i did a whole show  on this concept and did mention jim's story but i  
wanted to tell jim's story here in full detail  just because it's so interesting and complex  
so today jim lives a quiet life with his family  he's not interested in really changing anyone's  
mind about ufos i told his whole story in my  book inside ufos i was very happy he agreed  
to an interview because as i said i think his  story is very interesting and very important  
and that's why i kind of wanted to do this video  and as jim says and i'll just give you one more  
brief quote from him i just never shared this  with anyone because nobody wants to be ridiculed  
but i know what i saw the sighting of the lights  and the dream happened just as i said it did  
so that's the ufo incident on the uss valley  forge it's got levels to it again that have  
still to be explained it's a very interesting  encounter in which someone was apparently given  
a profound message about alternative  energy sources and how it can help  
humankind so i'm really honored and delighted  that jimin grew to speak with me and i'm really  
glad that i was able to get his story out  there and that's why i wanted to do this video  
so that's today's show once again thanks for  listening and watching and please keep having fun
