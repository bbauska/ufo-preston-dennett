ALIENS TRIED TO ABDUCT MY DOG: THE JOHN TRASCO STORY
Jul 7, 2024

Summary:
Jul 7, 2024
Around 6:00 p.m., on November 6, 1957, John Trasco and his wife Ellen were in their home in Everittstown, New Jersey. John had just returned from his job at the local paper mill. He stepped out to feed their dog, King, a six-year-old, charcoal-colored, half-blind, bad-tempered, Belgian police dog, who they kept tied to the side of the house.

Shortly after John stepped outside, Mrs. Trasco heard King barking furiously. She looked outside and saw a strange reflection in the yard. Staring at it, she was amazed to see it was a glowing egg-shaped object, about nine to twelve feet long, hovering, and bobbing up and down. Meanwhile, John also saw the craft, and approaching him from the direction of the craft was a strange humanoid figure.

“I looked and I seen a little man,” John says. “…He came down towards me and he said, ‘Don’t be afraid. I don’t mean any harm.’ So, I got a little closer to him and started talking to him about the dog. And he said, ‘Don’t be afraid. We’re friendly people, we don’t mean any harm.’ I started shaking. I was scared. He came up to me and said, ‘Would you like to give us your dog, we’d like to have it.”

The man spoke very slowly in English, with what sounded like a German accent in a sharp, squeaky voice. “We just want your dog,” he said.

So began one of the strangest UFO encounters in history. In this episode, you can hear the firsthand audiotape interview with John and Ellen as they describe their unique and bizarre encounter with a short humanoid who tried to abduct their dog. This episode is a sequel or addendum to the episode, “ALIENS ABDUCTED BY DOG," which features more than two dozen cases of this kind. You can learn more about them in my book, "NOT FROM HERE: VOLUME FIVE," now available on Amazon.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennety. This is not a new episode of UFOs in
the Paranormal. This is a sequel, an addendum to my last episode; Aliens
Abducted My Dog. As I promised, all of you I wanted to play the complete audio tape
of the interview with John and Ellen trasco who had an experience in Everett
town, New Jersey. So, what I'm going to do is a quick recap of their case 
and then play for you the complete 1 hour and 20 minute audio tape in which
they describe their experience in their own words. 

This episode is an addendum which I call "Aliens Tried to Abduct My Dog". I hope you 
enjoy it. Again if you want to read more about cases like these, check out my book "Volume
Five" in which I describe more than two dozen cases involving UFOs and canines. What old frisky 
did not allow himself to be taken. What an interesting case that is. What makes it even more 
compelling is on that same day just hours later there was another case that's almost identical to it. I
call this case"We just want your dog". It took place on November 6th, 1957 in Everettown, New 
Jersey. There are two witnesses to this case. It's quite a compelling case because as it turns out 
November 6 was a huge day in UFO history. There were sightings and landings taking place all over 
the World which I think adds a level of confirmation to this case. And, of course, the one before 
it that same evening on November 6th, 1957 around 6:00 p.m. This is only hours after the above case John
Trasco and his wife Ellen were in their home in Everetown, New Jersey. 

John had just returned from his job at the local paper mill and stepped out to feed their dog King who he describes as a six-year-old charcoal colored half blind bad-tempered Belgian police dog. They kept him tied up to the side of the house. Shortly after John Trasco stepped outside his wife Ellen heard the dog King barking furiously. She looked outside and 
saw a strange reflection in the yard and staring at it. She realized this wasn't a reflection 
but was in fact a glowing egg-shaped object. It was about 9 to 12 ft long hovering in the sky and 
bobbing up and down. In this weird manner. Meanwhile, her husband John 
also saw the craft and he said approaching him from the direction of the craft was a strange short humanoid
figure. 

As John says I looked and I seen a little man, he came down towards me and he said don't be 
afraid I don't mean any harm. So I got a little closer to him and started talking to him about the dog and 
he said don't be afraid we're friendly people we don't mean any harm. I started shaking. I was scared. 
He came up to me and said would you like to give us your dog. We'd like to have it. According to John, 
the man spoke very slowly in English with kind sounded. Kind of like a German accent. He spoke in a very sharp 
squeaky voice not normal, saying we just want your dog. 

Now, as John says he was about 3 to 4 feet tall I didn't see no flesh the only flesh I saw was his face he was all
covered he had some sort of cover all on you couldn't see the hands or other parts of the body he had shiny objects
on each finger he had a strange face you couldn't tell whether he was a man or a woman
now according to John this figure had a broad nose light brownish skin he said the suit was sort of a medium green
color and it had what he believ looked like shiny buttons but this was concerning John
because it was coming after his dog and he wasn't having it and he shouted at the being get the hell out of here and
actually reached out and tried to grab this figure the being then said I'll be seeing you again turned around and
walked towards the craft now John didn't see any port holes or doors but just like Everett Clark says
somehow this man entered the craft and it promptly took off now John's wife
Ellen didn't see this little figure but she did hear his squeaky voice she heard her husband shouting at this little man
and she also saw the craft disappear straight upwards.

Later they were interviewed by newspaper reporters and members of the UFO group 
CSI the civilian saucer investigations who conducted an hourlong interview with 
the trasco and as one of the reporters dick harpster says I just haven't been able
to think of one reason for not believing them and in fact Ellen trasco told him
if it happens again I'll probably get in the car and go far away from this place
but I told John we should have let them take King he's half blind and so cross I
don't know who else would ever want him now true to the ET's promise they
did return the UFO apparently returned the very next night when the Trasco's noticed a strange red and white light
hanging over the house and as Ellen says it didn't move as the lights of an
airplane do and after staying a while these lights moved off. Of course, the ET's 
did not take the dog. So while in this case the dog was not taken, the ET's interest in the dog was 
evident. And, incidentally both in the ever Clark case in this case they do 
both took place during a massive UFO wave which was sweeping across the United States. This is the first couple
of weeks of November 1957 and in fact November 6 alone accounted for dozens of cases. 
As researcher Lauren gross writes, the 6th of November 1957 has to be one of the biggest days in UFO 
History.  Mar 6 what is that trace Mr trco yeah TS o co o what is the first name John and then Mrs trco name is Ellen
trco and course dick hopster here Mary hobster and myself now uh this is ever
town this is Everett toown New Jersey H County H County at the local ask how far

Clemington well that far but we wanted to get it of course
was this experience that you had uh I know I've read about it in the newspaper

trco you just tell us what happened when your own words well I came from work and uh I
went down the street the doors and I got alongside the house was this youall I
come exactly what day it was early part of November all right but I think Mr TR is
going to get a newspaper article so now as I understand we've determined that this happened on November 6th on a
Wednesday night oh what time you get home from work Mr Tesco I come home I say about
5:00 what type of work you do I was in the pap St going down towards the bar and I
look I seen a little man but we have Hedges there I couldn't noce the

Petri you could see the S I saw that
but in the middle yard pushes yeah looked out there and from where she was
standing in the kitchen she couldn't see the man because of the bushes but she could see the

put her fingers towards the LA uh now walking along the side had you been the house already from work or you were just
on FR well I came in the house he came home oh then he went outside he went out the door
when she pointed that way toward the back of the house toward the bar did you immediately see this man yeah and at
that time was one man you saw just one man about how far away was he I was say
about I say about from here I would say about 20 ft about 20 ft
about 20 ft what was his first reaction he start walking towards me
well not the was see he was by a bar there and he walked from the hges he
walked probably about maybe about 5 to 8 fet and I kept going down
slowly toward him toward him we oh was fun

that how did he talk are you American or no he talk of Bren English it's sort of
like a German accent how about the tone of his voice
the voice was sort of like a squeaky voice squeaky yeah squeaky voice with a
German accent was I mean very easy to understand or was it difficult it was
easy to understand because he talk very slow so it was easy it was very slow SL
and well sort of on a sharp squeaky sideway when he said in substance Don't
Be Afraid how do you answer well I I
SW well they not did it right away well try well I got the 50 said don't be
afraid you don't mean any harm or something like that I mean did you answer him then or I mean what the

an well he was here yeah what can you describe his
appearance a little more for us well he was I say about 3 to 4T tall and I
didn't see no flesh the only flesh I seen was his face fles on his face was sort of like if you
take a a part in your KN in your hand and you you squeeze it like that that's
how his flesh was you know formed did you say it was a flesh on his
face flesh now where do he was standing with

was about 3 to 4 ft tall but 3 to 4 ft is well let's see understand that I'm
about 6 fo after what part of me would you say he talk well just by myself he
would come up to but up to here to me let's see that would would that be three
foot just just about 3 ft yeah no more like a little less I imagine not it's
the most was that the usual proportion as far as you can see his body with arms
along short or his arms were according to his size was
short well I mean his he was all cing he has sort of like cover rolls on him you
couldn't see his hand you know his hands or other part of the body it's just the
face and the ears did they cover his hands yeah his hands and on tip his um
the gloves sort of a round objects with shiny objects on each finger on each
finger well would this be like a glow like electric light B well that were L but they were shining
plesent or I wouldn't know we have every finger every finger yeah now how far did
this these covers extend was it one solid piece over to his head like it uh
it cover his uh body to the to the neck and then what he the only thing he wore
on his say is like a like a timing SC yeah could you notice the ears that
off well I don't know I didn't pay much attention to the ears it seemed like it like it was the ears we have you know
the same shape how about his nose his nose was kind of on the well it came out
this way like sideways was it a flat nose or no was
like we have but it kind of I seemed wi to me broader broader it's not if you just push our
nose in like that but it see the natural nose but covering a l area yeah what you
saying about his eyes Mr TR his eyes was sort of like a like a marble not the
like like f guys you know they thre sockets with any eyelid that you can
notice that eyelashes the cover's face was sort of like a putty color you know
brown but I mean I didn't notice no eyebrows and I mean I look was keep
looking at his face you scared he looked undernourished how about his mouth I
think had sort of a heavy lips was the size of the mouth size you ordar
expected a person yeah I guess was form on the side of his cheeks kind of you
know like I was told before like like a p squeeze it and I looked at me you know
you say PTY I assume is being a rather grayish color yeah now J is this the only part
of his fles that be exposed would be the face yeah if you were to ask to describe
him generally in some type of color what color would you say mrco
well his face well his face well I always say a
light brown side and corner like like I like a potty a light brown yeah light brown face and what are the colors of
the clothing was cl was like sort of a it wasn't dark green it was like sort of
like on a light shade it wasn't light it wasn't too dark maybe medium I say
medium green at this particular point you were talking with any lights nearby

covered up yeah other way to say the cover cover shoes the cover shoes and
his hands you

yeah I mean you you take a glass even though there's no know mean so be
shining you know have any hair I I
didn't what kind of a material did this thing look like it was made from cotton or rayon or wool or n no oh didn't look
like your shirt or anything like that or like a regular pair of covers would be
probably a pair of covers you know that wasn't shiny though no no did you noce
how TR though well he walked straight short
steps and he walked very slow see right in his teeth heavy on his
teeth you notice I gu walk I why did he say
that well because I mean the way you walk it walk slowly you know I would say
walk very light I mean walking slow it would seem to me that just would
indicate the opposite that uh you s of light on the feet I mean heavy one would
walk slow wouldn't it yeah but there was no tracks there how was the weather this
day by the way do you recall rainy clear was
dur well all right if you had a description of him is there anything you have ever seen in pictures that would
resemble anything like rle still or something like that in the fairy tales
some objects to comparison [Applause] [Music]
purp Poss could try make a sketch [Applause]
there and you're speaking the baptism of the Holy Ghost aren't you give your
just where it was
[Applause] brother-in these pictures you
mention what are they supposed to represent both fne sources are taken over
California in 54 57 and it supposed to be a picture of
somebody was captured yeah I think it was in New Mexico was it I don't know as
a man and a woman had him had his little guy holding fast to his arms and and
where they were standing they had hold his just like a child you know had he found way up the whole F his hand and he
stood there and he just like John described it but he was um that was the first I
seen it was about a couple weeks that where to pict just from do you know I never heard who just where from home did
he mention the name find out vanle or I don't D Skully do
you I read it lot of your brother-in-law think of
it generally oh um well um and getting back at the
end of the conversation uh when you swore out it why did he say that
well I didn't didn't say nothing but then he started me part the door you remember what specifically what
he asked about to do he said some more to me but I mean I just was scared
and but the you got in there so fast down him
see get in the thing to go when he asked about the dog was you have the dog with
you dog was tied right then oh this a little dog we have here now big big big
black dog what what is the dog's reaction to it by the way oh he was s
crazy run around Cycles said he's a partly blind partly blind this well
about all blind that dog is a look to be a German Shepherd typ
Oran shepher was he barking before you went down there yeah yeah he was was he
on a leash or yeah was he try to go for this party or well he was just going
around there in circles all cuz he couldn't see you [Applause]
know we had a big pile of rocks there and them rocks all down the bank pratically had a big
Power May about 3 to 4 ft high but is that I don't know I P up to keep the so
we have back up on is a creek and every time we have a big rain or
something I wash away some ground you know so I start building up rocks so I
left P May about 3 to 4 ft high and I if I had time I could have you know scatter
around more part Rock disappeared prly well when did you notice that I notic that
next morning I went down did the Rocks disappear where they spread they spread what I mean they
spread yeah did the dog hit them or I don't know did you notice at that time when you saw this man if the Rocks was
no I notic well the dog kept going up and down you know tied up on chain big
heavy chain well after you swore at the man did he uh he asked if about the dog
did you swear at him before he asked the dog or after I think I swear him
before I don't know before or after uh what he no before
I think I was going when I was going down towards him I start swearing do he have did he tell you why he wanted the
dog no you didn't ask him why he wanted no I didn't ask him uh did he say he
just wanted to was it your impression that he just wanted to see the dog or your impression that he wanted to take
it my impression he wanted to take the dog well then after you refused the dog
we might use that turn what happened then well he didn't say nothing just
turn around start walking towards the saucer there and when did you first notice the
saucer oh I was going down towards him was it behind him behind yeah yeah I
Haven been outside about 10:00 at night no but was he in a direct line with the
source or in your he was but over here and a sour was
right in front of a barn but how much distance would there be between them I would say May
10 or 12 ft diagonally diagonally yeah all right he started walking toward the
saucer now what can you describe the saucer for us well saucer was wrong I was going out
of great what you say round you mean like a ball no the ball side no like on
the flat side you're side come out like this one let's see well would it be if
you a b and cut the top B them off on it yeah now how large would you say the
saua was well I want say exactly how S I mean was going size to get to
go was just a nice size to get him to go you you did it appear big enough that
you could have got in it I don't know but I think if it came down again I'd make a good effort to get
in see this ta here would be about 8T here right yeah would you say the height
of this as it was the high of the ceiling a hi I mean I couldn't exactly describe the hide because it came like
this here and uh well the best way I would it didn't land on the ground it
just like the of the saucer for the way I would describe a simple way would be
if you take a saucer and turn upside down well that's that's how it look FL
on the bottom do you know or was it Sage shaped in the bottom too oh I I think it
was saus of shape on the bottom yeah I want you make a design how that look
you guy look anything like it at all well it would it would but I mean it's
well a smooth SP here you know but I'm you can rough it out you know what I
mean other words texture of his skin wasn't smooth it wasn't smooth enough it
was kind of like well I said Gro you know what I mean a Groove here and you
know like this here you know would it be like a a wrinkle like an old person's
face with the real old person there pinched up course wrinkles well I would say be heavily wrinkle course I you can
you know well there a lot of lines in his face from I mean the corners of his eyes and his mouth but I mean way his
face was like something like this well you it was a
drawn drawn sounds like there were bumps on it or something with like bumps yeah
yeah it's not the kind of a face that you would normally see on a on on an age person no no was the saler perfectly
round say like that metal thing no you try make a little sketch if you
would the next page okay fine I look some like this
well what's how look to me on mean yeah
um now all right from the the highest point about how high would you say it was up
down you the uh the sourer the highest Place top to the lowest in the
bottom I say could you place it in this room with it fit in this room there's an 8T seal ACR it probably
would and how about the wind Sab well I I couldn't I couldn't get a
good description on me how big it was because it was from an awful SP what an
awful SP rotation was all all the time
yeah and it go down one touch the ground would go down over and then go up in the
air again all the time he was standing on the ground just while he was standing
and I was stand would come down the ground down go about 10 ft and need a
top of roof my barn and I come down again and I come over the side over here
by the tree you have a big uh maple tree the whippy wow tree he come in between
that and it come to the barn again and come to the ground again and P up and
down but never stopped well if we didn't assume that it would stop this room was
what about 20t long what you say here yeah about 20 St Long yeah I guess more
the wall must be about 15 ft the other way is it think we put the whole thing in here where hit in this room maybe it
was uh were there any windows or anything like that you can see no I didn't see no windows at
all now what was the color up sources oh was shining a gold shine or what kind of
shine a silver shine silver shine uh pleas you see any Jo is there
any way of getting in or out no all right so he starts walking back to the S
now what happens and we're still Hing still going out of speed yeah all of a
sudden how see then nor took well let's see he he approached the S right yeah
well you were watching it right I was watching you how and all a sudden I didn't see nothing didn't see him go in
or what he just went so fast in there and all they went uh well was he walking slowly as he
approached the S yeah he's walking slowly how close was he to it when he
disappeared from your sight well as it came down and he come
to the sorcer and all all of a sudden it just disa in you were watching all time
I was watching all the time you didn't you you didn't see get in it or step on anything I went right by the doors was
open the bar right by the doors and I kept on looking at him and he just
disappeared and the SAU start come up I I turned around to look what I went
there more big trees there and I they would they let a big blue flame and then I couldn't see no more
there was Smoke on the along side of trees there I just get the picture out
you say you went to the was the source in the other bar yeah it was close to the bar well when he walked
away you said you went to the bar doors and open them or something that nature but B doors are open did you Clos them
no before he took off I I stood by barn doors you know yeah well did you follow
him when he walked toward the source it was be toward the bar too I assume well we were toward the bar do yeah well when
he walked away he turned his back to you yeah did you follow him there or no I I
Stood Still well we W you weren't at the barn then were you me when you going to the saucer yeah yeah I the bar there you
were by the bar there when he said I to have the dog well we were already bought
a bar when you had this conversation about the dog when he said you wanted to have the dog were you standing still in
or you stand still how far you from the bar in about 3 ft oh well when they first
saw him how far were you from the B oh I first saw him I was over here by the house I about 20 ft yeah well I was
wondering how come 20 ft you did you follow him you walk to the bar I
on now I think Joel probably what's what's confusing you is that dop is
located on one corner of the barn the do coup oh and theer was at the other end
of the barn and when he said he when the man walked away from him and walked towards the barn actually he was going
down along the Long Way to the barn he's walking in front of the barn right from the dog cop down to the other end of the
barn See the s what you found yeah well s was about in the middle of part of
bar but why you say they went me the sa on a man oh that's what
you refer to he's going down the side of the house see there's the barn there's where the saucer was hovering roughly
here's the dog poop yeah what do you do walk up to here to meet you about halfway then you walk together back to
the corner of the barn and then you stood there talking for a few moments and he walked down this way toward
the lots of stress in the vision from the house pushes right
here there's some big trees down in here and couple big over in here I assume
when he walk over toward the sauc which was visible wouldn't uh he be visible
there or from the house now these bushes are are high and she can see from this
kitchen window down to that corner of the bar yeah but she she can't see the
dog pop or or this this this area in here the one thing confuses me though
find the little man and I am walking to say that's the sorcer over
here I just suddenly disappear from VI and Kylie i p out no no I mean if he if
he was a little man yeah oh I mean I I I want here a s I'm walk to do all of a
sudden like that I just disappear or do I Fade Out gradually or well he just disappeared quick in the in the
saucer I said go towards the saucer I was very close and uh well I I don't I
probably had a feeling I probably had aun he going to take off you know so I got inside the door I'm I'm I mean I'm
still scared of nervous well he was in there in the doorway the sorcerer was blocking the
view of the man he couldn't see get in you stepped inside to the the doorway to
the barn when he walked over yeah was any particular reason why you did that I saw it f in the air cuz I stood right
there to the window did was a dog with you all the time in the leash tie down
at the CP kept there oh well you were walking him originally right stand no no
he he was going down a fet oh two feet oh have the dog Oh I thought you have the dog with you then no
no uh I'm just trying to get the picture of why you should go into the barn while
the man is there like I said about 3 ft from the barn doors yeah he's gone
toward the saer yeah well I just want a bond to us and and stood
there away you know I mean it seems so natural I mean little curious to see what happen to him that's why I can't
quite take probably he figured if that thing was going to take off he was going to get out of his way
he's took off it was just a swish he's gone he's gone toward the sorer so I I
realized he's going to he's going to take off I'm sing a doorway there and then
took right off so if if he would have climbed into the S through a through a
door you wouldn't have been in a position to see it from where you were standing at that time no how high up is
the sour the while he walked toward it was it down or up was down it came down
I mean what didn't land it didn't land the ground at all did you uh didn't see
the entrance to it have you any idea how we got into it no did you see any other men or women or
anything of that just just just one man as s now you refer to as a man I mean

understand you to say yeah s blue flame like when it disappeared and we see
little cause of smoke right by the trees there's two big trees over there and
smoke was on between trees what it took off is there any light other than the
blue no the only thing I no is blue flames light uh how how far could you see it in
the sky I didn't say long not p some trees I didn't see no more you have the idea the
rate of speed I mean roughly no you says Terri way to
speak what don't you do immediately after that what did I do yeah I just shut the
doors and come back home and and she started asking me questions and and I told B and and then uh so you
feat the drugs first before you get back in before I come home yeah and I I get tears out my eyes and and
then she started talking me again I went upstairs and I come downstairs I was you very upset you know the next morning I
got up and I went to work and uh I know it's a some kind of GRE in between my
FIT nails so I looked at it oh then I uh I
had green PO on my wrist know said green po late in the evening but there was
something between my fingernails what to me seem like pder I mean easily washed off you on
next morning in the shop well I mean I don't Rec you having told me that you had any physical contact with him did
you no no well how would you try in the green powder how you explain that I
would know I would know I I I didn't touch him or or got too close to him I
in your where you working the paper though Mr TCO was any
green you on the wrist with the green powder
there in the morning after this happened no that same that same evening I know
it's the green powder on my wrist or wasn't much you know but just a little bit you know but and the morning I had
in between my fingernails well I don't think was anything but I I didn't pay attention
you know I mean what makes you uh think that there may be a a tie between the
green paint on your wrist and and this thing well I mean I I don't have n green
like at home and then the shop we don't use because Department I work we cut
rope mhm I was at 14 in the morning before we start
working so let's turn this PR for a moment suppose you tell us what you
personal not like your husband told you what you actually saw well we went out to be
dog and uh I was getting something I was over there by the
cabinet and I just looked down the window King was barking like me and I
figured oh it's the baker cuz he always barked the truck I'm not pay much attention I down window and I saw this
here real round shiny thing down there first thing I thought got a lake down
there you know how far this the house excuse me huh how far the the window where you
were standing white this oh it's not about my is the bar that far back cuz
the property went 72 long from the road to the creek so uh I just stood
there you know I didn't know what to do and I went by the F there I you know and
I banged on the window for him did you see your husband at that time yeah he was sitting right there then going down
so that along side the house if you have it yeah right here by the house side was
he in a position then where he couldn't see the he see he didn't see it couldn't
seen this from the position where he waser I could have I could
but he was I could have seen because when I go
through the do the C is between my feet and I mean
by otherwise if I the cat wasn't going between my feet I could have seen
myself so I banged on the window I like that point it down like that and he h
down and and way he went going down there and then I I heard him talk and I
couldn't you know understand anything so were clo you know uh why could he uh you
you could hear him talking you mean your husband Holland what could you hear when he
holling well I don't know I can't I can't say what he was holling but I heard his voice you know I could
what the husband could you see I could see his back and he is
facing towards the you know not towards the bar but towards the on the where
that saucer was you know you see as light as they are yeah back back
down why if anything was that struck the a vision to see the little man well
there was a um my P kind of shru up there and still had
the Cen stuff goinge my view what
he whoever he was talking to you know but my view wasn't instructed from this
shining object did you notice the position of
the SAU before call that SAU there while he was talking yeah it was uh like on
the egg shap side and just going up and down how I after
the see us was go what how high up there the C he was going oh it was
about 6 ft up and that go down it never touched the what you im's
reaction then how do you feel I was SC
death now from from the time you knock down the window to indicate your husband
how long was it before the sorcer left well I guess it was about
oh what you say I don't know to me it seemed like an inity I guess maybe about 3 minutes or
something like that uh could you hear any other sounds other than your husband
hollering no you have a tendency to go out the house see if was happening I
couldn't I just stood there I I couldn't even move now how would you describe sparking
like me how would you describe the s took off
well it took off on my view it say I'm up higher here when went up it's s a big tree
moved down there and then the it went right it went right straight up and then
it switched right on up over barn and then it was like blue came out of it and
then it was like pinkish but I don't think John could see that because he was standing in the in
the barn right there but then there was nothing after that oh
was your hard been in your l view all the time no that's why I was just scar
me did he walk out of sight well yeah due to the fact that there liight bushes
and stub there they couldn't see the only uh way that you can see is
directory right straight down maybe later they can look out there myself you don't wait up to Mud up your hips oh
it's a little I took a couple photographs I have oh did you do yeah oh
when you saw this did you fig was flying s when I first saw it I I thought it was
a bunch you know a lot of water down there or something and then when I saw
the thing moving and what you think was sa I think it for did you have any idea that there was
any occupant who had been in that time no when was the first time you
realized that what there was someone in it yeah well I think you must be someone
in it it would be going up and down yeah uh you couldn't hear any sound from
the little man or woman or whatever it was did you immediately think of this
incident down in Tennessee about when your husband told you the story about the one of the dog uh did you
immediately think about this incident down in Knoxville Tennessee with the clock boy I come I didn't even know
anything about that so we read that the next night in the paper oh that was the first you heard of
that next night in our paper we read that that was November 7th uh let me ask
you this how how how you tell me before how the newspapers got hold of the story
well I had I hold up my brother-in-law he was over to my dad's house over Creek
that same night yes and I told him about it and uh he says no kid he says so the
next day see he had a week's vacation he was up from rway the next day he goes
down to French toown he tells Fred S Fred S who he U he used to be the motor
vehicle man he just right uh right by the dollar Valley has the building there all R com
so he told Fred sites and and my fed went right to the news and told the news and and then I think that night the You
Said Fred SC told the news yeah told the news about it oh is that the paper oh
yeah I yes and uh then then the woman called me up I heard about your
experience and I said well who told you she said what news gets around so then
Ray said that he had told Fred and Fred had told the news so we didn't go to the paper
then they came up and took pictures in paper took the story did you check with
your neighbor to or to see if they had seen anything no a matter of fact in the
house next door was the house wasn't occupied and the house below that wasn't occupied and the people up here next to
us they uh I mean weren't do any good to check
they but You' never heard that uh since that time you've never heard of anybody in this town that that did see it no
because in the daytime you could see this place actually there's quite a number of homes looked down on in this
uh particular area where this thing landed incidentally on their story in
Tennessee there about the door you recall what paper you r that in we us an Express with oh oh the E Express Carri
it I don't know that Jim sa paper yeah I don't remember the name of the people and where it was from well is it pay to
live at your house every day yeah the yeah have the pay deliv the house you
read it in yeah and it have to be The Eastern Express I guess wouldn't that's the only P you get yeah that's a weekly
you compared it all with the Schmid incident and the brass when you first saw did you think of that I read the I
know was the next night the night answer it in the paper I didn't say John about
when he see something in the paper and I see something paper we don't even tell each other yeah know we
get yeah I assume had you was that time read about the S Lev and Texas around
there or that was in the paper too right with that
thing has been anything in the papers at all about flying sources on the day that you seen the
six had you Mr trco or Mrs trco any interesting sources at all before and I
didn't believe it what do you think now oh I kind of think that I'm one of
their chosen favorites
know think they're seriously or yeah you know when I've seen it I I've seen it I
told don't you dare tell anybody about this she tell herw see of all I didn't
think they would tell Fred they because they said they'd be back you know they say well you scared them
away is that why you told her not to mention you thought they might be back no well we the reason John say not
to tell anybody because this town is a small town and uh they don't believe anything
you know and and they never seen it so they eat their heart at then uh at second segment
I when I was down down hill I see four objects I came home I told my wife about
it I just don't tell nobody but I but I did tell myself I told about
brother how long you have to was that Mr trco oh I about 2 or 3 weeks maybe yeah
s right there and uh I think I didn't think we put this in tape before what did you see as far as you can
recall what are wrong objects so treated one back to each other treated and then
one quite away from the rest what were you doing at the time I was driving a
car I was come down a hill and I thought it was the
reflection you know on my car you know I got a full car so I've all went that
time I slow down the hill but I didn't come to a stop and I still see you know to be sure you know I kept on looking
what is I'm saying things or what but I me I see uh how far no reflection or
nothing at the time yeah I come home from how high up were they about oh I would know they weren't close to the
ground were they no no they're up yeah right over
no like on my left about a 45 degree angle or some much time there were three
who get the idea of the size of the shape no we very high up like a highfly
airplane or I mean if there were overhead I would say that they would be
hard but this way I mean I couldn't say high but they won't be low any Hills I
mean which you can s of compare the height well I mean how about the shape
could you tell go wrong I mean did you tell airplanes
something like that no don't airplanes no and noise you can see they Trail huh
they bet Trail what time in the day this about 4:30 yeah it was light it was
light I get home about 20 minutes to five so I pass fresh on about
4:30 how long you watch them oh a few minutes until I got a D bottom my head
when I didn't see him anymore it went out of sight well well he was on the hill you know down the
valley I mean other words they went out of the arrange division yeah the work
question that disappear from sight was the distance I didn't that speed
approximately fast as an airplane or fast as a jet I couldn't tell a speed I couldn't tell a h
up you Mrs trco the next night you saw something yeah so what is out again well I saw two
lights up the barn a big white light and a big red light well how high how high
over the B would you say I say it was about U 50 ft which one up me which
light H which light there's a big white one and a big red one and another big
white one another big red one one was right up over top the other one two things and it was just like this and I
thought it was the plane down field I was watching to see the green light you know go red and green on the plane and
it wasn't even moving and I stood there looking out B in window and
then nothing this is was your husband home at the time he was down at television and that's told about did you
come up then no could you discern any outline around the light you no just
like a a great big white b a big red light so that illuminated the
surrounding area was that bright well uh the white light was uh very bright in
the red light was a real Bri GRE I mean enough to you could look
around either attached to an object or no do that's all I can how long did they
last there I sit there maybe about a couple minutes minut because it was Wasing think was near didn't even hear a
noise were they stationary stationary what finally happened to them just just
just like did you feel inl to go out the house or no no did it Light Up the Barn
no and you were saying you f you interpret this that there might be some reason why they were you had this
experience well I don't know I it was a mystery to me I mean
before uh when the saucer was down here I didn't see any red light light or clean from it or anything but night
there I big red light and a big white light I light been looking out window
they seen the same thing since that time you seen
anything yeah uh how about before that time have seen anything that might seem to be a flying s yeah I uh was this
about 4 years ago when we were going to lamberville and I had my daughter with me we were
she was in the back seat was fling on sit the F SE and uh I said look Annie up
in the sky I said see that shiny object she says yeah it was round you know and
she says well that's no airplane momm I I know it is well John couldn't see cuz he was
driving and it was on my side so we looked again and we didn't see anything
how long you think you saw that all fell H how long w f did you see that oh maybe
it was about a minute this you to go out of your range Vision or
just disappear disappear go out of range why did you think it was at that time
she says Mommy I supplying s how old is she do then well she's uh she just
turned 18 how old was she I guess must years
was she home tonight that about 14 she was she home tonight that you have this experience she was married no uh was she
interested in so no at that time uh was that the first
time you see anything that was or could be a CL sorcer at that time yeah yeah
had you been interested before that or did that have W from the interest no I was never interested I I uh heard about
him and all that but it was no P
because just real shiny but did you feel at that time this wasf show when you
show yourself I going up to that time this is four years back had you have you had the
opportunity to read anything about that no yeah you mentioned before you thought
that uh there might be some reason uh that you were chosen for this
experience uh would you have any idea why why you might be particularly did you have any mental
feeling at all at the time this happened when other no not really there many cases that have
been reported I had that excuse me I had the M feeling that
night I I to bed that I was going to see something
and I saw those that was the night afterwards did you ever have the feeling
can you to see something yeah did you
no do you think you they will be back watch you yes I know it's purely gu
where they come from you have any idea I thought they
were left you without impression why you the impression my
said said kind yeah well I mean you say kind uh
but you say kind or peaceful well kind that's what say peaceful people yeah
well I just kind Follow Your Story maybe a little TR I am excuse me but uh why

CRA I suppose uh now your opinion may have changed a bit or yeah no only thing
I couldn't you mentioned before and I think what serious is thaty might be one of the Chosen Few I was just
wondering and a particular reason why you think they pick out this particular spot or you with your husband I well I
die Som I'm going to go to ven come back did you believe in reincarnation mhm
yeah got probably the majority of the people in the world actually do have you always even before this even before this
incident well if they came back again would you walk down the me you would you don't think you'd be
afraid would you Mr TR well since this here happened I mean every night when I go to
feed the dogs I'll feed them but I'll I'll say to my wife I'm going get
rid I hate like to go down to B what's been going on quite a few months
now she feeds them myself down I don't don't want to go down B I go down every
day at 4:00 not for Less two weeks she she been going down but since that
happened I always I don't want to go down there you still have the door you still have the door but you'd be afraid
if you saw him again I know I'll would be afraid but I just you wouldn't want to go down I just disliked you know what
I mean yeah I had no decide put down to upon at
all with this uh getting back to this ship again Mr tresco did you get any
kind of other Sensations uh when it took off did you notice any
odors no any any heat or sort of a heat like heat was there a wind oh wind yeah
yeah yeah quite a strong wind a strong wind some branches that Mo they they
move or they D around the Tre like
know move and this uh this blew back on you did it this wind andha you feel it
yourself or did you just see the sh did you uh why well if I said was
the terrific speed it had you know so I mean threw a lot of wind and then it
kind of shook me yeah when you when you uh told you that your your eye did you mean that you were oh shook up as a
result of this or I mean I came home and it was L part of the even you know tears in
my eyes probably I thought I thought maybe
something B in your eyes or something irritated your eyes or no wings or anything like that on
this just door did it make any noise at all did you show yeah it didn't
yet on a ship on a ship when ship
is sort of noise like that I just of this newspaper Artic here
and know they quot here saying they were more than one well that's what well they
asked me maybe there was more all I've seen was one well the ship
yeah oh also I going ask you too when you were telling you stor TR I think the paper says something about that you
tried to grab one of them or something yeah he wanted to catch them yeah did
you try to grab them I think I did it too huh I think
[Applause] I oh or when did you try to grab
it well only got close to the barn I guess that's why he was talking to you
yeah how long after that did he actually leave after you tried to grab it only
about 5 minutes and uh did he run away a Dodge
or what happened I tr get the picture oh he run away it kind of touch
sideways did he sh anything no he do you appear to be carrying
anything at all TR no you have anything on any it look like a weapon no no sticks or no nothing
at all is every family fren at the time or fine
yeah and you never asked him who he was or where he come or why he was here
nothing you think he could have taken that dog it's a pretty good size dog yeah you think he could have taken it
probably would have oh they had the power to
how do you see go out now what mean how and why it happened you have any ideas
no not at the time it came home and found the all going she'll be looking you figure any
possibility that the ship might have been visible only to you for any reason
I mean I'm thinking here it is pretty open View and see quite a few houses
here to me was clear visible and also to my wife I mean
according to the sourer was very shiny like must have been more to him and me shiny
object could have been invisible to anybody yeah I mean why I was say about
the about the man because I mean you say he was camouflage had a green cover on
so matching to the gr the lawn you know so he could have been visible you know
from to somebody from the distance you know you would say 50 ft yeah I had a
figure with this flame and the noise how do you figure some other people didn't see it did you hear did you hear
anything Mr Transco probably it was nobody home a lot of people you know that was they work on different shifts
and stuff and as I said the house next was unocc
unoccupied the now just could you hear the noise from
where you were no I hear King CLK and I have a hearing I think
all you didn't get any sense of a noise from that uh from the
ship okay P back to these pictures again which I find most interesting uh you you
saw the pictures Mr trco your brother I know but did you do you think it look pretty much like this man well the SAU
it did but the man he was very thin he was awful thin he didn't have any cover
on your man pretty well skinny pretty heavy you say arm so skinny and his
hands look so long like you know B and the people had a whole bones no hat on
no he had no hat on your your man was more on the heavy side huh on the heavy side heavily built yeah how you take the
cam off these pictures they quite fascinate
me I heard a picture of a little man before are they supposed to be genuine pictures or yeah he was stand between
two men and they had one man one man and he had trench color on a
hat um I stand between are these pictures they sell or uh yeah
why you why don't you find how to get all of her brother-in-law we going on Sund find out where you got from maybe
you could do that kid I say I don't get out here too often the used it look like the from the
pictures yeah Angeles and the others was taken in
different places I forget I think pictures but if you uh want to contact
he show the pictures I give him a phone find off outside of the local Delaware Valley
newspaper reporter anyone has anyone else seen you and talk to you about this or only this card I got the other day
