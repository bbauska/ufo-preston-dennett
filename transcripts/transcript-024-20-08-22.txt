ONE WEEK IN NOVEMBER
Aug 22, 2020

Summary:
Aug 22, 2020
In the first week of November 1957, a series of dramatic and unusual UFO events occurred which 
caused great concern at the highest levels of government and changed the way many people viewed 
the UFO phenomenon. Sputnik 1 had been launched one month earlier, and the launch of Sputnik 2 
was imminent. Then, in the first week of November 1957, a dramatic wave of UFO encounters struck 
the states of Texas and New Mexico. The apparent primary target was a small town called Levelland.

What happened in Levelland, Texas was unprecedented and had never occurred before, and has yet to 
be repeated. Dozens of people in Levelland and the surrounding areas reported UFOs disabling their 
vehicles, causing the electrical system to fail and the car engines to cease functioning. In case 
after case, UFOs buzzed cars at low level, and often landed on the road, blocking their way forward. 
UFO car-stalling cases were well-known among UFO researchers, but this brazen and audacious level 
of activity had never been reported before. 

While the small town of Levelland, Texas and the surrounding area first appeared to be the target, 
the truth was much different. In fact, similar and often identical encounters occurred across the 
United States and the world, involving not only car-stalling cases, but many bizarre electromagnetic 
effects on a wide variety of machines.

UFO researchers had long known that UFOs cause these strange effects, but had considered them an 
accidental byproduct of close-up UFO sightings. But after what happened in Levelland, questions 
began to be raised. Perhaps these effects weren't accidental at all. Perhaps they  were intentional.

The U.S. government and Project Blue Book officials first attempted to debunk and cover-up the 
events, claiming that sightings were nothing more than "ball lightning," while at the same time, 
warning military and civilian witnesses not to speak to the press. 

But it wasn't ball lightning. The sightings were too dramatic to ignore, and soon garnered 
national headlines. The Levelland UFO encounters have never been explained and remain a mystery 
to this day. Nothing like them has ever occurred before or since. 

This amazing event was easily the most famous UFO event of the year, and is well known among 
researchers. However, what many people don't know is just how numerous, dramatic and widespread 
the encounters actually were, or the consequences that followed. This video presents a minute-by-
minute account of this incredible week in November 1952. The questions as to why, however, have 
yet to be answered.

If you enjoyed this video, you might also enjoy the book, "UFOs over New Mexico," which provides a 
partial accounting of these truly incredible events. Available on Amazon.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  today i'd like to talk about one week in november  
specifically the first week of november 1957.  on that week something really extraordinary  
happened it was a very intense ufo wave  unlike anything the earth has experienced  
before or since it was truly unprecedented this  wave of sightings actually involved landings and  
a huge huge number of car stalling cases cases  in which the vehicle's engine and headlights  
become affected by the close presence of  a ufo it's a really extraordinary case  
multiple cases really it caused a lot of concern  at very high levels of military and government  
it really changed the way people viewed ufos  forever and is often said to be isolated to  
the levelland texas area and parts of new mexico  it's a very well known case you've probably heard  
of it but what most people don't know is it's far  more intense than that it's actually worldwide it  
wasn't just in leveling texas and near white sands  new mexico this took place all over the world  
and this first week of november involved 50  100 cases of ufos stalling cars and actually  
having an effect on a wide variety of machines  vehicles and instruments so something was clearly  
going on here and that's what kind of really  draws me to this case to try to figure out  
why is this week so different from anything that's  ever happened in ufo history before or since  
so yeah that's what i want to talk about uh  you know car stalling cases do reach back  
to the 1940s at least and uh so they've been  known by ufo investigators for years and years but  
nothing like this i mean this is truly incredible  the first real hint of the upcoming wave perhaps  
occurred on october 16th this 1957 when a lady  by the name of ella louise fortune was driving by  
holloman air force base and saw this glowing  cigar-shaped object it was moving pretty quickly  
leaving a contrail behind it she had a camera  with her she quickly uh took a photograph of  
this object it's now a very famous photo and this  is how this incident really that was sort of the  
pre-show for what was about to happen uh  because following weird stuff started to happen  
uh october 30th about two weeks later a man was  driving through casper wyoming when he came upon a  
ufo right in the road uh he wanted to turn around  pull u-turn and get away from this thing but he  
couldn't because his engine failed and he was  stuck there in his car said it was very scary and  
finally this object takes off and his engine  works again and he pulls the u-turn and gets away  
really kind of ramped up one day after that  november 1st 6 20 a.m a secretary who is a  
resident of the sandia mountains in new mexico  saw a glowing red cigar-shaped object november 2nd  
in the town of canadian texas this  is not far away from levelland a car  
came was driving along when a ufo  approached and their headlights went out
same day november 2nd a witness was driving  through amarillo texas when a ufo approached  
and his car engine failed same day november  2nd four oil crewmen j a criswell and bobby  
black and two others saw a very large glowing  red object hovering over the uh their crew site  
uh jay kriswell said it was as big as the full  moon and probably about 200 feet high bobby black  
a much younger man said it scared the hound dog  out of me i thought the world was coming to end  
so after hovering briefly it darts away so this is  when it really starts to get busy the evening of  
november 2nd on around 8 p.m otis eccles owner  of a radio station kclv in the town of clovis  
new mexico saw an unidentified yellow glowing  object traveling at high speed over the town  
about a half hour later 8 30 pm an anonymous  motorist was driving through the town of seminole  
when our glowing unidentified light swooped  down from the sky ahead of him on the road  
dove at his car causing it to stall briefly  and his headlights failed the subject then  
rises up and zooms off into the distance it  was about two hours later when things really  
started to hit the fan i was 10 15 or 10 50 pm  or 11 15 somewhere around there november 2nd  
pedro saucedo and his friend jose salus  were driving along route 116 route 116  
about four miles south of levelland texas uh when  they saw this glowing object and it made a beeline  
for their car and just swooped over it i'll quote  pedro here this is what pedro saucedo said we  
didn't think much about it but then it rose out of  the field and started toward us picking up speed  
when it got nearer the lights of my truck went out  and the motor died i jumped out and hit the deck   as the thing passed over my truck with a great  sound and a rush of wind it sounded like thunder  
and my truck rocked from the blast was so rapid  and quite some heat that i had to hit the ground  
it also had colors yellow white and it looked  like a torpedo about 200 feet long moving at  
an estimated 200 or 600 to 800 miles per hour  so what is going on here things had just begun  
let's see it was about 5 10 maybe 15  minutes later two air traffic controllers  
at amarillo texas airport see a glowing  blue object moves swiftly across the sky  
less than a half an hour later  11 50 pm just before midnight   jim wheeler is also driving along route 116  same road as pedro saucedo and jose salas  
and he encounters this egg-shaped object which was  landed in the middle of the road in front of him
as he gets close his headlights  and his car engine died   like pedro saucido and jose sals he called the  police just before midnight around the same time  
jose alvarez is driving along route 51 outside  of levelin when his car dies and a ufo appears  
he also calls the police a married couple and  their children were driving on state road 1073  
when and bright object passed overhead causing  their radio and their headlights to go out  
and the car engine to stall it was around midnight  10 minutes later newell wright a student at texas  
tech was driving along route 116 again when his  car died he didn't see anything so he gets out  
of his car opens the hood is checking the engine  nothing appears to be wrong he closes the hood  
turns around because he senses something and gets  a real shock there's a 100 foot long glowing green  
blue object right there in front of him on the  road he jumps in the car but the car is still  
not working the object which is totally silent  rises upward and takes off 15 minutes later  
it's now november 3rd frank williams of witherall  texas not far away comes upon a glowing object  
landed on the road it's always landed on the road  right in front of these people blocking the road  
uh his engine and headlights both die the  object is pulsating and his headlights  
actually light up in time with the way this object  is pulsating and then it takes off so by this time  
the police and levelland have received a  flood of calls they estimate at least 15 or 20  
of people reporting this thing so the officers  decide they're going to go out and investigate and  
see what's going on there's three of them officer  spouler offer officer mcculloch officer weir clem  
all take off in their cruisers to see if they can  find what's going on meanwhile their activity is  
still going on full force 12 45 am ronald martin  is driving his truck when he sees a glowing  
object approaching it's about a mile away  at this point makes a beeline form and lands  
right in front of him on the road blocking his  passage it's egg shaped it's 200 feet long and  
once again his entire electrical system in his  car goes completely dead and his engine dies
so same thing keeps happening here  some around the same time uh 12 45  
1 am 1 30 perhaps james long is driving  along and he describes exactly the same thing  
a large glowing egg-shaped object it's landed  on a side street his car engine fails and  
so does his entire electrical  system until this object leaves  
so now i mean sheriff weir and mcculloch and  the others are driving around at 1 30 a.m  
they actually see this object in front of him on  the road uh it moves very fast like a streak of  
light it's shining some sort of beam of light down  uh here's a little interview from weir officer  
weir clem about what he saw i'm a direct contract  at the moment via telephone with level and texas  
on the line is sheriff's weird plan imagine where  the figures permanently produced across the united  
states of america since saturday night when a  number of witnesses in the town of leveling texas  
reported that they have seen a phantom object in  the sky one witness describes it as 200 feet long  
uh weird twin um tell me exactly what  does the story add up to down there in  
level in texas i understand the air force  is currently investigating that area  
and other areas and would you tell me exactly  what transpired late saturday night early sunday  
morning down there and what you were told by as  many witnesses who saw it number one a mr wright  
who told you a very interesting story sheriff  what was his story uh mr ride is a period going to  
texas back in love of texas while returning from
he
for about
125
for about four minutes the object didn't take him
object there was only four of them in the object  there were two more drove up on the object  
they were right there sitting in the highway
the object not on the ground but in the sky  that's right not where it is i did not see  
the object i think these lights always  may be seen from the father well as the
or people still going along just as it did before   although it has caused a  very a lot of attachment in
thank you very much share a weird  clip of level and texas for your  
first hand account of the serious  phantom optics seen in the sky
so yeah a lot of people were seeing this when  where clem and his fellow officers were seeing  
this there was another group of officers right  behind them a short distance away they also saw  
it patrolman lee hargrove and floyd gavin both  saw it as did another police officer lloyd ballen  
a short time later a fire marshal by the name of  ray jones was driving along and he saw this object  
as well and it caused his car engine to sputter  not completely fail uh and the object moved on  
so meanwhile while all this is going on the  object moves over to new mexico at white sands  
it's now 3 a.m november 3rd and corporal  glenn h toy and his fellow officer james  
wilbanks are on army jeep patrol at white  sands when they see quote a very bright light  
high in sky it's egg shaped it's about a hundred  yards in diameter descends to about a hundred feet  
get this right over the old atomic bunker that  was first used in the first atomic explosions  
after a few moments it blinks out a  few minutes later it flares up again   they said it was nearly as bright as the sun and  then descends toward the ground and what they felt  
was a controlled landing and disappeared they  sent out a search party but no trace was found  
11 hours later this is still let's see november  3rd it's now just before 2 p.m a test pilot  
is flying from texas to roswell new mexico and  he's coming in for a landing at holloman air  
force base and lands and tells base operations  that he just encountered a large oblong glowing  
object which passed right over his aircraft moving  so quickly that it left kind of a streak of light  
so this was going on not only in   texas and new mexico but really all over the world  we don't know how many cases exactly because once  
again most people do not report their sightings  but that same evening uh there was a gentleman  
driving all the way up in calgary in canada uh had  a ufo closely approach him causing his car to fail  
uh around 6 pm that same evening military  police at white sands again see another ufo  
they describe it as brilliant vermilion in color  about 300 feet in diameter and it's hovering over  
white sands range there the same time in  nearby resident in deming new mexico so  
she sees a strange glowing object whizzing  overhead so that's 6 p.m two hours later 8pm  
two military officers forest r oaks and officer  barlow were on another two men team an army  
jeep patrol at white sands when they saw another  glowing object hovering over the test base right  
over the old atomic bunker again and according to  officer oaks it was about 200 maybe 300 feet long  
very bright he estimates it was about two miles  away when this object ascends at a 45 degree angle  
the lights are pulsating on and off it's  moving pretty slowly sometimes stopping  
but then scooting upwards again farther and  farther upwards until it was had the appearance  
of a bright star uh went upwards even  farther until it was a tiny pinpoint of light  
and they again felt that this was a controlled  vehicle so there is an interview from the uh  
officer at white sands about this incident  and the incident involving glenn toy and the  
other officers i just want to play a short clip of  that just a few minutes long but very interesting
on an additional fighting by two  soldiers at white sand new mexico this is
officials
the soldiers said they had not talked with each  other about what they saw until after both reports  
had been turned in with the provo marshal's  office this day's father that uh prior to the
the object looked as bright  as the sky uh a brightest   sun rather but it did not light the sky around it
um
slowly to about 50 yards from  the ground the club was said   i stayed up there for three minutes just  getting off this reddish light and it came  
to the ground fairly fast about 45 degree and  the light went out quickly uh this was about  
two or three miles away from me it looked like a  completely controlled landing uh will banks have  
been on the three-day business not present the  interview is been approved some days previously  
the other two mps uh specialist third class  richard oak specialist third class henry  
spotted what appeared to be the same object  some 17 hours later about 8 pm sunday when  
they are patrolled together in the jeep they say  they first noticed it out to covering motionless  
about 50 yards from the ground and then saw  it rise uh slowly into the sky and stop again
i think that's it
on sunday morning on an unidentified  flying object so yeah i mean what is  
going on here so as november 3rd turns  into november 4th it's now past midnight  
there is an airline flying over brazil when a ufo  approaches and suddenly their direction finder  
and their transmitter fail and when they're  examined they show traces of being burned  
uh same evening at fort itapu in south vicente  brazil there was a very scary and very concerning  
ufo incident in which these objects hovered  right over the military fort there causing a  
complete electrical failure and the centuries  the guards who were patrolling the base were  
struck by beams of light from this object which  caused injuries severe burns on both of them  
so this is serious stuff and going all over  the world it's not just level in texas or  
you know outside new mexico like a lot  of people believe this is worldwide   that same evening november 4th elmwood park  illinois a police officer encounters a ufo  
and starts chasing it at which point his  headlights fail and his police spotlight  
starts to dim and you know brown out uh same  evening november 4th we're now up at toronto  
canada residents started noticing  interference on their television went outside  
and saw a ufo so by this time the media has caught  wind of these incidents the news is going crazy  
and many articles are being written about  this this is causing quite an uproar
folks in level land texas are worried about  strange objects in their neighborhood sheriff  
weir klim says he has received several reports of  a strange egg-shaped object about 200 feet long  
landing on farms and highways last  night in the vicinity of level land   sheriff clem says he even himself got  a glimpse of the thing which somehow  
turned off lights and auto engines when  it came near the sheriff says that lights   and engines worked fine again after the thing  went away this is bob pierpoint in washington
so it's now still you know november 4th but  now we're in the afternoon it's at 1 10 p.m  
and one of the most famous incidents  involving this whole wave of sightings occurs   to an officer by the name of james stokes he's  an officer at holloman air force base he's a high  
altitude missile engineer a navy veteran in other  words a trained observer a great witness he's  
driving along the side of uh white sands proving  grounds there's several other cars around him at  
least 10 when suddenly all of them all their car  engines fail all at once they all roll to a stop  
and uh there is this huge object some people  are getting out of their car and pointing at it  
it's approaching from the northeast stokes  leans out of his car and sees this glowing  
pearlescent egg-shaped object  he said of huge proportions  
it was no higher than 300 maybe 500 feet  performing all these incredible maneuvers  
he saw no visible portholes no external features  at all it passed overhead at least twice  
sending down strong waves of heat it dives down  very lows making sharp turns moving sometimes at  
an estimated 2500 miles per hour so i'll just just  let stokes sergeant james stokes describe what he  
saw in his own words i saw a brilliant egg-shaped  object making a shallow dive across the sky  
then it turned and made a pass at the highway  and crossed it not more than two miles ahead   then it moved toward away towards  white sand proving grounds  
as it passed i could feel a kind of heat wave like  radiation from a giant sun lamp there was no sound  
and no visible portholes when i got to my car  and checked the engine i found it intact but the  
battery was steaming so yeah other witnesses were  located uh to this incident there was a officer  
another officer at a holloman air force base at  white sands proving ground who apparently saw it  
and took photographs of it though  these have not been publicly revealed  
he said that the clouds and the mist would  dissipate as this object moved through it stokes  
by the way following this incident discovered  that he had received a sunburn on his face was  
this incident and others that were the inspiration  for that famous scene involving richard dreyfuss  
and the movie close encounters of the third  kind by uh steven spielberg so stokes is a good  
officer and reports his sighting to his military  superior at hollaman air force base they tell him  
initially that it's all right to talk publicly  about it they request a physical examination  
which he undergoes uh stokes goes public he's  interviewed by coral and jim lorenzen of the  
aerial phenomena research organization apro and uh  he was now pretty reticent to discuss his sighting  
and actually suggested it might be some kind  of quote atmospheric phenomena jim and coral  
lorenzen believe he may have been pressured  at this point by his military superiors  
not to talk about it and coral lorenzen said that  uh he may have changed his story because of this  
they met with him two months later after this  other interview after his story had been widely  
printed in newspapers and in some cases he had  been viciously attacked attacked as a hoaxer  
and he told the lorenzens that he was quite upset  about the hoax accusations and said if he ever saw  
anything out of the ordinary again he would he  wouldn't tell anyone which is truly unfortunate  
because we we hear this from police officers all  the time that they have to keep things secret  
for their own reputation in a taped interview  on klg radio sergeant james stokes did say that  
what he saw was quote definitely a solid  object but he refused to elaborate saying  
i just hope we're ready for whatever it is  so interestingly air force public information  
officer lieutenant colonel john mccurdy at the  missile development center did reveal that he  
questioned stokes extensively about the incident  and was in fact convinced that stokes had in fact  
had a genuine sighting so yeah there was other  officers who saw this jim and cora lorenzen  
learned about an officer at holloman who saw  it apparently there was also a nurse at a local  
hospital who quote knew a couple on the highway  near orogrand when the end when that engineer  
stokes saw that saucer but the couple refused to  come forward because they saw how stokes had been  
treated in the press but they told the nurse  that the thing they saw was definitely a machine   of some kind and not a natural phenomena as  some newspapers have reported so yeah stokes  
stokes's case was definitely front page news  here's a little news story about what he saw  
reports keep coming in of a mysterious brilliant  object being cited in areas of new mexico and  
texas the latest report is from james stokes an  engineer from the air force missile development  
center at holloman air force base in alamogordo  new mexico he has told of seeing a brilliant  
colored egg-shaped object yesterday and he's  quoted as saying some force emanating from  
it stalled 10 cars on an isolated desert road  between white sands proving grounds and alamogordo  
stokes also told terry clark the news  director of a radio station in alamogordo  
that as the object passed in a shallow dive across  the sky he could feel a kind of a heat wave like  
radiation from a giant sunland but he said he  heard no sound earlier reports in recent days  
told of a big ball of fire spotted over much  of west texas the air force is investigating
and now the news from the united states the air  force apparently is convinced that an electronics  
engineer actually saw an unidentified flying  object over the new mexico desert the engineer  
who works at the air force's white sands missile  proving grounds said the egg-shaped objects with  
rings around it was spotted at the same time as  his car and ten others were mysteriously stalled  
monday a spokesman said the air force is trying  to locate other motorists whose cars are set by  
stokes to have stalled so meanwhile i mean this  is still november 4th there are sightings still  
going on all over the world kodiak alaska a police  officer sees a ufo close up and his radio fails  
same evening it's around 7 p.m miss van fleet is  in her home in new mexico when she sees a gold  
colored object she says it's larger than the full  moon it's hovering at about 45 degree elevation in  
the western sky for at least five minutes about  a half hour later a border inspector in el paso  
uh was driving through el paso when his car  stalled he got out and saw a giant blue egg-shaped  
object approaching from quite some distance goes  directly makes a b line for his car passes right  
overhead at about 100 feet moves off at which  point his car now works a few hours later 10 45 pm  
this same ufo multiple ufos is back this time  it's over kirtland air force base in new mexico  
and they're able to track this thing on  radar controllers are on duty in the 100 foot  
high airport tower at kirtland air  force base and are tracking this thing   and this case made it to project blue book uh  and base blue book officers uh said that the  
controller saw quote a white light traveling east  between 150 and 200 miles per hour at an altitude  
of approximately 1500 feet they called the radar  station which confirmed that they had it on radar  
that it was at the east end of runway 26 and  moving in a south westerly direction before  
beginning a steep descent so the controllers grab  a pair of binoculars and actually see this thing  
they said it was definitely a vehicle it  reminded him of an automobile standing up on  
end according to the blue book report this was  this object it was about 15 to 18 feet uh high  
it had one light one white light on the lower side  it was slowed down at some point to about 50 miles  
per hour disappeared behind the fence in a very  restricted area which by the way was brilliantly  
lit with floodlights this is just about a  half mile from the actual control tower itself  
this point the object reappears it's now about 200  300 feet and they're still wondering could this  
be a helicopter or a plane in distress and  according to the blue book this is what they said  
although completely cooperative and willing  to answer any questions both sources appeared   to be slightly embarrassed that they could not  identify or offer an explanation of the object  
which they are unshakably convinced they saw so  you know while this object is being tracked on  
radar it's it's being seen it's going over at a  very low altitude over kirtland air force base  
it's obviously controlled and uh lasts for about  five minutes and uh reappeared a number of times  
in fact during this incident at some point it  reappeared and uh it was flying at a high rate  
of speed about a mile south of the east-west  runway where it made an abrupt turn to the  
west and started to follow a c-46 aircraft that  was had taken off so it follows this c-46 plane  
uh from a half-mile behind it or so for the next  14 miles and they're again tracking this on radar  
for about you know 20 minutes uh  before it finally fades from the scope  
so yeah this was investigated by project  blue book and projects blue books conclusion  
uh was that this was probably a plane  and that the controllers were just   unable to identify it jl and heineck uh  learned about this incident and he was  
pretty much uh in shock at blue book's  conclusion he couldn't believe it  
and disagreed uh because here's what the officers  at blue book said that this may possibly have been  
an unidentified aircraft possibly confused  by the runways at kirtland air force base  
the reasons for this opinion are one the observers  are considered competent and reliable sources  
and in the opinion of this interviewer the blue  book officer actually saw an object that they  
could not identify two the object was tracked on a  radar scope by a competent operator and three the  
object does not meet identification criteria for  any other phenomena so they're basically saying  
it's a plane but the officers couldn't identify  it and heinek was absolutely exasperated by this  
and here's what he says about this incident  that is the observer's reliable the radar  
operator was competent and the object couldn't  be identified therefore it was an airplane  
in the face of such reasoning one might well ask  whether it would ever be possible to discover  
the existence of new empirical phenomena in any  area of human experience what indeed can we say  
of a radar visual case like this the basic  agreement of the radar and visual reports  
and the competence of the three observers in  my opinion rules out questions of mirage false  
returns on radar etc something quite definitely  was there if it was an ordinary aircraft one must  
ask how it was that the two visual observers with  a total of 23 years of control tower experience  
could jointly not have been able to recognize  it when visibility conditions were good even if  
there were no radar confirmation of the slow and  fast motions of the object or indeed just of the  
presence of an unknown object this question would  still have to be answered this description of the  
object's appearance through binoculars like  an auto on end would also demand explanation  
so yeah blue book was neck deep and having a lot  of trouble dealing with this they got a lot of  
negative feedback from their handling and their  mishandling rather of this incident so this was  
causing waves at this point in very high levels  of government and was just causing a meteor  
circus uh and it was still going  on at 4 24 a.m on november 5th 1957  
don clark he's an electronics and radar  technician employed by as a civilian contractor  
at holloman air force base he was in his home  east of alamogordo when he saw an orange red  
cigar-shaped object hovering at about 15 degrees  elevation in the western sky directly over  
holloman he ran to get his camera but by when he  returned the object was gone five minutes later  
lyman brown jr is in his home in alamogordo  and he sees a yellow orange light at about  
45 degrees moving quickly to the east and it  winks out over the sacramento mountains seconds  
later he sees a very bright searchlight  where this object had been looping around
so yes on november 5th at fort oglethorpe  people were inside their home when their  
tv blacked out and they went outside  and saw this object hovering outside   same day in hedley texas same  thing happened people watching tv  
tv goes out they go outside and it's a ufo uh  november 5th same night philadelphia pennsylvania  
people are in their apartment when the lights  go out the apartment fills with a flash of light  
uh their electric clock stops and uh they're  they're awakened by this whole incident and uh  
yeah it's another ufo affecting  electromagnetic instruments so  
another incident same evening 7 30 p.m  el paso texas cars driving through the  
city when the car stalled and the lights go  out 15 minutes later 7 45 pm a bus driver  
delbert boyd is driving about five miles southwest  of albuquerque now when he sees a mysterious light  
it's flaring up in brilliance and becoming dim and  eventually appears to land right outside the city  
45 minutes later or so 8 30 in hobbs new mexico  a car is driving and other engine and headlights  
fail as this ufo comes swooping down over the car  a few minutes later same exact exact thing happens  
to another person driving again through hobbs  new mexico their engine fails and their car  
headlights go out same evening in ringwood  illinois a couple was followed home by a ufo  
it starts off they go inside they're watching tv  and their tv fails they go outside the ufo's back  
another case same night but this is in springfield  ohio a cab driver in a car were driving along  
when a ufo showed up and both their  cars stalled simultaneously 9 30  
p.m same evening back in san antonio texas  people are driving along and they see this  
ufo hovering over a field at a very low level  suddenly the engine quits their radio goes out  
and the headlights dim so yeah those media is  still going crazy over this there's all kinds  
of news stories it's causing very high waves  at high levels of military and government  
they're not quite sure how to deal with this uh  initially they're calling it ball lightning and  
heineck actually agreed with this at first uh  when he heard about the loveland sightings uh  
he agreed that yep it's probably ball lightning  but he would later retract his statement
so yeah november 5th it's crazy that evening  there was another incident in pell city alabama  
where a driver came upon a ufo  causing his car to stall uh it was  
later that same day it was just  after midnight so it's now november 6   1 15 a.m santa fe residents jay martinez and  a golegos were driving their car when they saw  
an egg-shaped object with red green and yellow  lights approaching them at a very low altitude  
it was moving very slowly and like all these  other cases it comes directly over their car  
aluminum illuminating the entire area around  it was a great glow all over is what they said  
the same time they did hear a very loud  humming noise and as soon as this object is  
directly overhead their car engine dies both their  clocks and wristwatches also stopped functioning  
object is there for just a second hovering and  then darts off to the southwest and disappears  
a couple of hours later same uh evening or  early morning rash actually it's 4 30 a.m  
it's not we're now in houston texas a gentleman  is driving through houston when his car fails  
and his radio becomes all staticky and  a ufo appears and swoops over his car  
i don't know what this ufo is doing uh but clearly  has this uh agenda of turning car engines off so  
uh later that day uh it was around 6 15 p.m now an  anonymous tourist is going through tucumcari new  
mexico and he calls the police and reports this  huge red object that's hovering just outside of  
vaughan on u.s highway 54. that same evening  two residents from santa fe called the police  
to report a huge ball of fire that was traveling  in a southwest trajectory as they drove  
towards santa fe uh but again all over the  world danville illinois a police officer  
saw a ufo and gave chase to it and it caused  their radio to malfunction and they weren't able  
to report what they were seeing back to their  station in monteville ohio people ran outside  
because their tv was acting very strangely  and sure enough there was this ufo hovering  
back up to ottawa canada a guy who is a radio  technician has a normal radio and a shortwave  
radio both failed as a ufo hovered over his home  another case occurred the next day on november 8th  
or let's see november 7th at 1 45 a.m so it's just  what a just a few hours later after the above case  
five people five airmen bradford ricketts james  cole dennis murphy wayne herlbert and harry ulrich  
were on duty at a salvage yard on the north side  of the base when uh they observed a cigar-shaped  
object moving overhead they said it made a  strange whistling noise and changed from white  
to orange to red so same evening now we're  in lake charles louisiana cars driving  
along when a ufo swoops down causing the car  electrical system and engine to completely fail  
seven hours later another really major  case this one had some very strange effects  
this is in the morning 9 20 am a daylight  sighting november 7th outside of oral grand  
this is just 20 miles from where st james stokes  has had his encounter a couple by the name of mr  
and mrs trent lindsay and their 22 year old  son byron were driving south on highway 54.  
byron byron their son was the first to notice that  the speedometer under 1954 mercury was behaving  
very strangely even though he was driving a  steady speed the stick on the dial started  
to weave erratically back and forth from about  60 miles per hour the speed they were actually  
traveling going upward to 110 miles per hour which  was not accurate they weren't overly concerned at  
this point they didn't see any objects they only  noticed this weird effect on their speedometer  
and we're talking about and trying to figure out  what the cause could be when suddenly they see  
this strange object in the southwest sky and i'll  just quote byron lindsay about what happened next  
according to byron lindsay and i'm quoting here  the needle kept skipping back and forth between   60 and 110 miles per hour and making a clattering  sound while the needle was jumping around dad  
pointed towards the southwest and said i suppose  you think that is something and it was something  
it was cylindrical in shape silvery and moving  we traveled some 15 miles before the speedometer  
corrected itself and we had no trouble during  the rest of the trip strangely the needle kept  
wavering to the side where the object was instead  of towards the zero mark on the speedometer  
according to byron lindsay the object was   highly polished metal in appearance with sharply  defined edges had no visible means of propulsion  
no controls or lights or glows  or anything that he could see   and was moving in kind of an arcing trajectory  towards the oregon mountains to the southwest  
so by this time there were so many sightings  being reported that although the air force  
tried to debunk them uh documents now clearly show  that they were not only aware of these sightings  
uh contrary to their official statements they  were taking these reports extremely seriously  
on november 7 1957 an article from the el paso  times printed the following editorial and i'm  
quoting some of the nation's top scientists  are pretty shook up about the mysterious  
flying objects cited in new mexico and west texas  skies this week said charles capen a scientist at  
white sands this is something that hasn't happened  before and it's not over yet two days later 7 20  
p.m a tularosa new mexico housewife uh this is  november 9th a college student and several others  
observed a large brilliant fast-moving light which  approached their car very closely on us highway  
54 this is about 70 miles north of alamogordo and  it caused their vehicles entire lighting system to  
fail the object approached from the south flew  directly over the car then changed course to  
the southwest accelerating at high speed off into  the distance at the same time as this setting was  
going on investigators jim and coral lorenzen were  in the area they were traveling east on highway 3  
380 about 10 miles from carriozo new  mexico when they became witnesses they saw  
quote a brilliant or rather a bright light  silhouetted against the mountains to the east  
and which moved erratically until it appeared to  move south so this is crazy next day it continued  
november 10 7 50 p.m another car stalling case  at sweetwater texas when this ufo approached  
at a very low altitude right over a vehicle  about one hour later in carriozo new mexico  
ufo approached over a car the engine uh remained  running but the car headlights dimmed and failed  
so by this point the air force is getting pretty  upset over all the publicity of some of their   officers and after this wave of sightings and  media coverage the following item was published  
in the official section of the holloman daily  bulletin which by the way is mandatory reading  
for all base personnel both military and civilian  and i'm quoting now the title of the memo is  
unidentified flying objects and here's how  it reads on november 7 six airmen claimed  
they cited an unidentified flying object and  did not report this to proper base authorities  
they did however give this information to the  local press request that each member of the  
military and civilian employed at this center  refrain from any public statement on political  
diplomatic legislative or scientific matters or  any controversial subjects such as ufos without  
first contacting the center information services  officer this request is in accordance with  
afr 190-6 disciplinary action may be taken against  the offender signed lieutenant colonel mccurdy  
so yeah they not only knew about this and  were no longer being forthcoming they were  
trying to cover it up coral lorenzen heard  about this and this regulation she says  
i'm quoting restricts individuals at air force  installations in relating details of ufo sightings  
and this regulation is a violation of the  constitutional rights of civilians and  
should be challenged the air force radar network  is watching for strange flying objects reported  
in various sections of the country the air force  alerted its radar installations after sightings of  
unidentified flying objects were reported in the  gulf of mexico texas and the missile test center  
in new mexico and in other areas of the country  unidentified flying objects brown cigar shape  
and starlight were reported across vast areas of  the united states today a grain buyer in kearney  
nebraska said he talked with six occupants of  the transparent spaceship last night officers  
investigating the report found impressions in the  earthquake funding to a landing gear in footsteps  
where the incident was alleged to have taken place  near knoxville tennessee a 12 year old farm boy  
said he saw a long round spaceship land near  his home and two men and two women got up two  
news men checking the report found a weird imprint  in the ground it was in the shape of a fat cigar  
or slender egg some 24 feet long elsewhere across  the nation persons reported seeing objects flying  
through space whisking along the ground or  just sitting here some were trapped by radar
so yeah blue book after this was all over uh it it  trailed down pretty quickly following this first  
week in november there was a few more scattered  incidents mostly in texas and new mexico but yeah  
all over the world but slowed down dramatically  to the rate it was which is just one or two car  
stalling cases every now and then uh blue book  originally called this ball lightning and highneck  
did as well and as i mentioned earlier retracted  the statement i'd like to read a little quote by  
jay allen heineck because it's definitely worth  listening to and here is highneck talking heinek  
was of course the astronomical consultant at  this time for project blue book he later said  
gave this statement i am not proud today that  i concurred with captain gregory's evaluation  
as ball lightning on the basis of information  that an electrical storm had been in progress  
in the levelland area at the time this was shown  not to be the case observers reported overcast  
and missed but no lightning besides have i  given it any thought whatever i would have soon  
recognized the absence of any evidence that ball  lightning can stop cars and put out headlights  
so yeah he now believes this was obviously  an unexplained type of incident uh this  
is a very interesting case because there were  so many landings and apparently yeah there were   some cases of landing trace one lady by the name  of carolyn reno who lived in levelland at that  
time she was 10 years old said that her father uh  took her to a location at the edge of town someone  
somewhere between levelland and lubbock texas and  uh where there was a pasture where there was no  
buildings nearby and they came upon an area of  scorched grass round in shape and about 15 feet  
across and this was confirmed by her mother as  well so i first became interested in this whole  
wave of sightings when i wrote my book ufos over  new mexico and discovered this incredible wave  
of sightings in the first week of november at  the time i didn't realize how extensive it was  
and honestly i didn't realize until i  started doing research for this video here  
and i'm sure we've just touched the tip of  the iceberg blue book received like 50 reports  
in this month and you have to remember  you can probably times that by 10   or 100 because 1 in 10 maybe 100 people report  their sighting so it was a lot more than that and  
this again is completely unprecedented while there  have been a lot of electromagnetic effect cases  
nothing like this has ever happened before  before this incident investigators previously  
thought that electromagnetic failures were  sort of a byproduct of ufos flying over  
and perhaps it was the engines from the ufo   uh making a side effect and causing machines to  fail and now a lot of people began to speculate  
perhaps that this is not the case at all that  these stallings these electrical interferences  
were intentional and maybe not a weapon but sort  of a beam of some kind or intentionally done we  
can really only speculate but i think there's  probably some truth to this simply because  
ufo electromagnetic effects well not rare are  not common either and the vast majority of  
ufo sightings even close up ones involving  vehicles being chased down the road   do not involve electromagnetic effects and yeah  people have objects hovering right over their car  
and their engine is fine and so are their  headlights so what is going on here is this  
intentional you know why are they doing this why  are they landing in front of the road blocking  
passage why are they causing headlights to fail  car engines to fail affecting planes affecting  
speedometers watches televisions radios of all  kinds yeah i do feel like this was intentional  
it's got to be more than one object but as  the ufo flies i mean they can be all over   the planet wherever they want in seconds  so it's very hard to say but it appears  
there was some sort of agenda a ufo fleet came  down and decided to just play these cat and mouse  
games for a week or week and a half first week of  november 1957. we don't know why it was so thickly  
concentrated in a couple of areas levelland and  new mexico mostly but again it was worldwide  
it could be because the atomic testing and all the  rocketry going on at white sands uh but there's  
nothing like that going on in leveling levelland  was just a little town of like eight ten thousand  
people it's still a little town so it's really  hard to say there was a very famous incident  
some years earlier 1952 in nearby lubbock texas  which also got a lot of publicity there's a very  
famous photograph of this object as it hovers  over lubbock texas that could be a factor  
but yeah we don't really know why there's a lot  of questions surrounding this incident could it  
have been a display of power is there a message  there we really don't know but it's clearly a  
very important event a very strange event  and unique in ufo history and for that reason  
i think it deserves a lot more attention and  now whatever exactly happened on this first week  
of november 1952 it deserves to be remembered so  thanks once again for watching and keep having fun!
