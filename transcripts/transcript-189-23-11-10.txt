LANDINGS,HUMANOIDS AND ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS: TEN TRUE CASES
Nov 10, 2023

Summary:
Nov 10, 2023
When UFOs land and people have face-to-face encounters with humanoids or are taken onboard a craft, we find ourselves at the very heart of the UFO phenomenon. While sightings are undeniably fascinating, the answers to the many questions surrounding this subject lie with direct contact. These kinds of cases contain the most data and show us exactly what it’s like to have close interaction with extraterrestrials. This video presents ten cases coming from across the globe, spanning several decades, and involving many different types of humanoids. These cases provide the kind of evidence that cannot be ignored or explained away, including landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, medical effects, animal reactions and more.

ITALY’S FIRST HUMANOID? On Aug 14, 1947, Luigi Rapuzzi Johannis was hiking in the mountains near Raveo, Italy when he came upon a landed saucer-shaped craft. Standing next to it were two of the strangest figures he had ever seen. Attempting to communicate, he found himself being struck by a beam of light and unable to move. The ETs approached him, then retreated into their craft and departed.

A UFO IN TROUBLE. On the evening of Apr 24, 1950, Bruno Facchini stepped outside his home in Varese, Italy to investigate strange flashing lights. To his shock, he came upon a landed craft and human-looking figures who appeared to be trying to repair it. Not yet realizing that these figures were ETs, he asked if they needed help. They struck him with a beam of light, knocking him to the ground. Later, he found evidence at the site.

ENTITIES EXAMINE A FACTORY. One night in 1967, the supervisor at a rubber factory in Goshen, Indiana was called outside by a fellow employee and saw a large craft hovering low overhead. Through the windows, they saw strange figures looking down at them, apparently inspecting the factory. After only a few moments, the craft moved away. But the witnesses remain convinced they saw a genuine UFO.

ETs AT SEA! On Jun 27, 1970, the Machado family and a friend were enjoying lunch on the balcony of their home overlooking the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Seeing a splash in the water, they saw a silver saucer landing on the surface of the ocean just offshore. And inside they saw two short figures. The encounter had only just begun.

THE VIRGINIA GIANT. On evening of May 16, 1971, three high school students decided to go camping in the fields near their homes in Passapatanzy, Virginia. “Mike” was alone at the campsite with his dog. Suddenly a UFO landed right next to him, and out stepped a giant figure. When it walked towards Mike, he told his dog to “sick ‘em!” The figure quickly fled to the craft, which took off. But two days later, the UFO came back, this time at Mike’s home.

ETs ON THE ISLAND OF FUR SEALS. On Oct 28, 1972, a group of military personnel were staying on the Isla de Lobos off the coast of Uruguay. One of them went to check on the lighthouse generators, and came upon a landed craft and three strange humanoids. The officer pulled his gun, only to find himself unable to move. The UFO and occupants quickly departed, but news of the encounter would go to the top of both the Uruguayan and US governments.

“IT CAN’T BE HUMAN.” Around 2:30 am on Oct 24, 1974, Mrs. R Heitfeld was woken up in her home in Covedale, OH by a light shining in her window. Looking outside, she saw a UFO and a strange ape-like creature standing inside it. She woke up her son, and called the police. Even though the craft and occupant were still there, the police refused to come.

THE TINY DOLL-LIKE ALIENS. On Sep 3, 1976, a grandmother and her niece were walking in Fence Houses, England and came upon a landed craft and two doll-sized ETs. They found themselves unable to move and experienced possible missing time before the craft suddenly left. The next day, the witness experienced a very odd incident in her home.

TRUCKER ABDUCTED. Nothing could have prepared trucker, Harry Joe Turner, for what happened on Aug 28, 1979, while driving his truck along Route 17 outside of Winchester, VA. A huge craft came down and lifted his truck into the air. Harry found himself being examined by ETs, and taken to another planet. His strange adventures had only just begun.

ET PHONE HOME. On Jul 4, 1989, David D was driving in Tbilisi, Georgia (in Russia) when his car engine failed and he felt compelled to walk to a certain location. To his amazement, he came upon four figures, nearly nine-feet-tall, and a landed craft. He was taken onboard and given an examination and shown very advanced ET technology.

These ten cases provide only a brief glimpse into the many thousands of ET contact cases that have been occurring across our planet for many decades. They show that we still have a lot to learn about UFOs and about ourselves. They also make it very clear that we are not alone, and that many different types of life abound in this infinite universe.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today's episode is called Landings humanoids and onboard encounters 10 true cases these are the 
kinds of cases I really love to explore because they're the most extensive and I think the most 
interesting they're the ones that contain the most information they're the ones that are least likely 
to be misidentified or misinterpreted and and they have a lot of the answers as to who these ETS are 
why they're here their agenda on this planet and what ET contact is like how it affects a person so 
that's why I really like exploring these really extensive cases and it's so interesting because 
each one of them is provides another piece of the puzzle so to speak some have unique elements and 
yeah they're just plain fascinating it never gets old not to me so that's what I'm going 
to be talking about today I've got 10 cases I've chosen specifically because they have something 
to provide to our understanding of UFOs and ET contact and as always I like to choose cases 
from all over the world so I've got cases from England a couple from Italy across the United 
States South America as well Brazil Uruguay so really again a global phenomenon I also love 
choosing cases that stret over a long period of time some older cases and some more modern cases 
so we have cases spanning about 50 years from the 1940s all the way up to 1989 and each one 
of these cases does involve humanoids every one of them and of course a couple of onboard experiences 
as well those are probably the most fascinating of all certainly to me but a WI variety of humanoids 
and as always these cases do have evidence kind of always makes me laugh when Skeptics say there's no 
evidence because there is and these cases have it Landing traces medical effects all kinds of 
electromagnetic effects as well so yeah the evidence is there and really as I've always 
said it's the huge number of cases that I think provide the best proof that we are being visited 
because it's not just one or two or 10 or 20 or even hundreds it's so much more than that so 
yeah 10 cases quite a lot to explore some very extensive cases so let's just get started and 
the first case I want to talk about I call Italy's first humanoid and this is a question mark because 
this is what many investigators believe to be true that this case does involve what appears to be the 
first report of a humanoid in Italy but that might be overturned at some point when new information 
comes about but this case is super fascinating it took place on August 14 1947 in Via Santina Italy 
does involve one primary witness though there are some other corroborating Witnesses it's got some 
super interesting information what I like about this case it being one of the first reports of 
a humanoid that makes it groundbreaking and yet as we shall see it echoes a lot of reports that 
would come later on so a super interesting case the witness in this case is Luigi rapuzzi johanes 
he was an accomplished artist and after his encounter he actually became a writer of Science 
Fiction however he claims to have had a remarkable encounter with the landed UFO and humanoids while 
digging for fossils outside the small town of Roo very near via Santina in Italy so this all 
began one morning when he hiked up a small Valley along the mountain stream chiaro he hiked to the 
foothills of the carneo Del Cole Gentile mountain and this is when he saw a quote large lenticular 
object of a vivid red color so being nearsighted he immediately put on his glasses and saw that 
this object was in fact a metallic disc with a coupla on top and what appeared to be an antenna 
he had never heard of flying saucers which at this point had not yet reached the Italian media 
but he saw this object which was actually kind of stuck in a Clift of rock at a 40 45° angle 
but quite large he says about 30 ft wide was not that far away from him just up over the 
Stream So he decided to climb up to it and get a closer examination but the first thing he did 
was look around to see if there was anybody else in the area who might also be seeing this thing 
and this is when he noticed what he first thought were two young boys he actually shouted at them 
pointed out this disc to them and as he began to walk towards it he stopped because he realized 
that these were not two boys these were two short humanoids as Luigi says in his own words the two 
boys were dwarfs the likes of which I had never seen nor even imagined they were coming towards 
me slowly with tiny strides with their hands at their sides and their heads motionless would they 
had come to a few Paces from me they they halted I had no strength left I seemed to be paralyzed or 
to be dreaming but I was still able to observe them in every detail they were no more than 90 
C cm in height that's about 3 ft and he says they were wearing dark blue colored overalls 
made of some material that I would not know how to describe translucent is the only term for it they 
had collars and rather deep belts all of a vivid red color even the cuffs and The Shins of the legs 
ended in colors of the same type the heads were bigger than the head of a normal man so these 
are details we often see short little humanoids wearing full body overalls and the fact that he's 
paralyzed unable to move all of this are details that we often hear in these close encounter 
reports he said that these beings were wearing tight fitting caps their skin complexion was sort 
of an earthy green they had small straight noses just a slit firm a mouth and eyes that he said 
were quote enormous protruding and round with what looked like vertical pupils so he was absolutely 
astonished and did have some fear at this point he watched them he estimates for about 2 minutes at 
this point he was able to raise his pick which he used for digging fossils and he shouted out 
asked him who they were where they come from and do they need assistance and he thinks they may 
have been threatened by the way he lifted his pick because at that point one of the figures 
reached down to his belt and suddenly a beam or a ray came out and struck Luigi as he says before I 
had time to move or do anything I found myself laid out full length on the ground my pick shot 
out of my hand as though snatched by an invisible force now prior in life Luigi had once received a 
an electric shock and he said that's how it felt like a violent electric shock so at this point 
he's truly unable to move and he watched these two figures approach him they came right up to him 
one picked up his tool and this is when Luigi saw that the being's hand had what looked like eight 
claws four on each side he also said that the ETS appeared to be panting Breathing heavily now with 
great effort he was able to sit up and he watched these figures return into the craft and it was 
just a few minutes later that this craft took off at this point as it took off Luigi says as he was 
struck by a blast of wind which was strong enough to roll him over so the craft is gone afterward he 
felt weak and trembling he looked around for his pick could not find it apparently it was taken by 
the ETS now there are some accounts where he's the reporters say that he was actually painting 
and the etes took his easel but according to Luigi's firsthand report he does not mention 
this at all he says they took his pick so needless to say he cut his hike short and left but he did 
return he and he went directly to bed early but returned the next day and was unable to find any 
evidence of where this craft had landed he did inquire about the village of REO asking people 
and he found two different sets of witnesses who had actually seen a red Craft on the same morning 
he had his encounter so so at the time of this encounter again he'd never heard of UFOs and he 
kept wondering if this craft and the beings he had encountered were from a foreign country on Earth 
but he knew it was an unusual encounter he was very reluctant to talk about it and he actually 
kept it secret for a while as he says I had no wish to be considered a crazy Visionary or worse 
and I don't think anyone could blame me but it was some weeks later he had an opportunity to to 
travel to the United States and at that time this was just after the Kenneth Arnold sighting and the 
Roswell crash in fact there was a huge superwave of UFO activity going on and it was all over the 
newspapers and he heard about it including the Kenneth Arnold sighting and the Roswell UFO crash 
and this is what encouraged him to come forward and share his experience with researchers and and 
being an artist he was able to provide sketches of the beings the craft he saw and for a long 
time he believed that these were biological beings but later he speculated that they might in fact 
be robotic Gordon kraton who was the editor of the Flying Saucer review and certainly a 
well-respected and pioneering researcher he calls this case quote an important early contact claim 
I find it very difficult indeed not to take this s story seriously and those to whom I have shown 
it have been struck by many points that seem to have the authentic Ring Of Truth so yeah it's 
got many details that we see in these modern-day accounts and it is believed by many to be Italy's 
first modern account of a humanoid from a UFO so yeah there's a lot to like about that case 
the fact that the witness was an accomplished artist and was able to provide detailed sketches 
of the humanoids he saw that's fascinating and the details he describes are so similar to modern-day 
reports of humanoids which I think lends a level of credibility like many witnesses he did not want 
to talk about it but finally felt compelled to come forward yeah an amazing case on a lot of 
different levels and moving along to the next case which is super interesting and another one 
as it turns out from Italy I call this one a UFO in trouble and it took place on April 24 1950 in 
V Italy and what I like about this case is while it is a single witness case it was very thoroughly 
investigated it involves some pretty intense evidence in terms of medical effects Landing 
traces and apparently some actual physical evidence evidence metal fragments which were 
studied in a laboratory to and had some results that I think were not expected but certainly an 
important case that received a lot of attention at the time this case was investigated by Italian 
researcher Antonio giichi and it involves an apparent UFO landing to make repairs which 
is quite rare in fact as researcher Gordon kraton writes and I quote so far as we recall there have 
been only a few cases in which UFO percipients claimed to have observed entities walking around 
a landed craft and seemingly inspecting the Halls rarer still are the cases where it is claimed that 
actual repairs were being carried out here is a remarkable story involving as we may speculate an 
object which may have been damaged in in a storm and metallic material is alleged to have been left 
by the occupants of the UFO so it there had been a storm that day in V Italy April 24 1950 was around 
10 p.m. and the main witness Bruno fi who was A 42-year-old worker at an industrial firm he 
was in his home on the outskirts of a little town called abiat Zoni this is Inver Italy and he just 
stepped out for a breath of fresh air and this is when he saw strange flashes of light in front of 
his house and he thought is this lightning is this perhaps electrical lines that had been damaged in 
the recent storm so he decided he was going to go inside and put on his boots and go investigate so 
he did and went outside and didn't see anything at first and was returning to his house and this is 
when he saw these strange flashes of light again so he hiked back out into this field next to his 
home and he was shocked to see a very large craft shaped kind of like a flattened sphere 
sitting in the field on the ground and he saw a little ladder along the side with a green light 
on top what looked like a little sort of device to get up to the craft sort of like scaffolding 
and getting closer he saw this strange figure F who was on the scaffolding and appeared to be 
performing a welding job on the dark craft and looking at this figure Bruno could see that he 
wore what looked like a diving suit and a mask as you can see in this illustration and as Bruno says 
my curiosity now aroused I stepped closer and now saw two other individuals likewise in diving suits 
and masks moving about very slowly around the machine which caused me to think that the suits 
they were wearing must be very heavy for them the machine which was of a dark color showed metallic 
Reflections when lit up by the flashes coming from the welder so not too far away there was 
an airport the LA malansa airport and he thought that perhaps there had been a forced Landing of 
an aircraft so he told these ETS these men he thought that his house was nearby and did they 
need help and I'll just let Bruno describe what happened next as Bruno says in his own words the 
only reply I got were some incomprehensible guttural sounds I tried to guess what their 
intentions were and I got the impression that they wanted to invite me to get up into the machine I 
then heard a noise like the sound of a gigantic beehive or a big Dynamo and I saw inside another 
ladder going up and all around on the walls tubes cylinders and gauges in that precise moment I 
realized that it couldn't be an aircraft and I was seized by a sensation of panic and fled so 
he says that these figures did look entirely human could easily pass on Earth for normal people but 
realizing that they weren't he became afraid and started to run away and he could hardly believe 
what happened next and as Bruno says again in his own words after I had run a few Paces I turned 
around and saw one of the pilots grab a sort of camera that he was carrying around his neck and 
shoot a beam of light at me I carried on running and simultaneously I had the impression that I 
had been struck by a blunt instrument or to put it better by a powerful jet of of compressed air 
and I fell to the ground it seemed as though they were no longer interested in me I got the 
impression that they had wanted to punish me for my Disobedience but I was sure that they 
did not desire to do me any harm so yeah this is another case of someone being struck by a beam of 
light probably I suspect but rendered him unable to move or approach these figures he was still 
fully conscious and Bruno watched as the figure who was doing the welding came down picked up 
some equipment that was next to this craft at this point all the figures returned into the craft and 
closed the door all the lights on the craft were extinguished and according to Bruno the buzzing 
sound increased and the object Rose at quote fantastic speed and vanished into the darkness 
so Bruno he was stunned amazed confused he stum stumbled back into his home and couldn't get any 
sleep at all that night he stayed up all night in the morning he returned to the spot and this is 
when he found some strange evidence as Bruno says I saw some marks there not very visible however 
as the soil of the meadow which was under grass was pretty hard but the marks consisted of four 
round Impressions about 1 m in diameter and set in a square about 6 M apart I also noticed burnt 
grass and a few bits of metal which I picked up so Bruno was pretty sure that these metal pieces were 
from the apparent UFO repair job so he picked them up and actually had them sent out for analysis and 
the analysis came back is quite surprising turned out to be Leed bronze and seemingly terrestrial o 
Bruno was told by the analyst that this was quote an anti-friction medal so disappointing that this 
was not more strange but hard to say metal is same all over the universe perhaps at any rate 
following this encounter Bruno did report the event to the police uh who he says conducted 
a very thorough investigation and in fact he ultimately regretted going public Bruno did 
because the police would not stop questioning him just interrogated him endlessly he said and then 
following that came hordes of curiosity Seekers and journalists who he had often misrepresented 
his encounter so ultimately he wished he had never talked about it as he says if I'd have 
known all that was coming I'd have kept Jolly quiet about it and this is was an encounter 
that would affect him for the rest of his life uh in fact in the days following the encounter Bruno 
had back pain where he was struck by the beam of light and he noticed that his skin looked 
blackened but as Bruno says I have never got over the shock that I suffered even today years after 
from time to time I feel hot flashes on the face without any signs of fever I really feel for that 
witness Bruno fi um and the fact that he regrets coming for forward is not surprising to me makes 
me wonder just how many people do not come forward I suspect it's the majority of them but he did and 
I'm glad he did because it's an important case it's got a lot of evidence to it I think there's 
some very interesting elements to it the fact that they were human looking ETS is also super 
interesting I love those kinds of cases the Grays the so-called grays get so much attention but the 
fact is there's all different types of humanoids but all humanoids more alike us as I've said many 
times then different and now we move to the next case which is quite brief but I think important I 
call this this case entities examine a factory and we don't have the exact date for this one but it's 
sometime in 1967 and took place in Goan Indiana and what I like about this case is it shows a 
pattern of UFO activity that we often see this case was reported to muan the mutual UFO Network 
by an anonymous witness who was a supervisor at a factory in Elkart County again in Goan Indiana 
now he was not the first witness actually he was inside working when a fellow employee who is on 
a break called him to come outside and look at something in the sky that was approaching the 
factory from the Northwest and I'll just quote the witness directly because he describes what 
happened next in good detail as the witness says in his own words due to Bright security lights 
we could not see the whole shape of what was a craft what we did see was part of a circle 
with solid windows or openings in it there was a red background light inside the craft while we 
watched we could see several silhouetted figures moving about one was looking over the craft Edge 
and appeared to be looking in our Direction the window that the figure was looking down from was 
sloped out at the top and bottom forming a V shape whatever it was it was moving along at a leisurely 
pace of approximately 10 milph and approximately 200 to 300 ft from the ground I could see that 
as as it floated along it did not have a smooth movement but seemed to wobble on its axis the 
vehicle was moving silently towards the southeast all of this took place after 8:00 p.m. it was 
dark outside and we were unable to determine the size of the craft I have kept this pretty much to 
myself over the years due to the jibbing that I had received for even mentioning it I have always 
been a structured type of individual and tell things as they are I've given the approximate 
dates on the sighting is I had never written this event down but PS the window that the figure was 
looking down from was sloped out at the top and the bottom forming a V shape so there you go a 
very strange encounter I think it's significant that he's reporting this craft which was quite 
low again did not have smooth movement but was wobbling and this is something we do see with 
I think what are genuine encounters I wish you got a better look at these silhouetted figures 
because we don't know what they look like in this case has apparently never been fully investigated 
yet it remains an intriguing report not only because it was a low-level multi- witness  encounter involving humanoids but because of the fact that it moved directly over a factory and 
this is something that has long been noticed UFOs are attracted to technological installations it's 
unfortunate that case wasn't more thoroughly investigated but it is a multiple witness  case that's significant but I bet that there are probably other Witnesses out there but as I said 
this is an important case because it shows once again that ETS have a penchant for hovering over 
technological installations and I suspect that's exactly what was going on here a super interesting 
case and now we move to the next one which I call ETS at Sea this one took place on June 27 
1970 70 in Rio de Janeiro this is in Brazil of course and what I like about this case is it's 
a daylight case it's very long lasting I think it's about an hour also many witnesses an entire 
family as well as a Brazilian police officer this case was professionally investigated as well so 
that is important and has some super interesting elements to it and of course humanoids this case 
involves at least eight Witnesses seven who lived at 318 avenita neem in Rio De Janeiro Brazil and 
one who lived next door at 210 avenita neem so this location actually affords them a very 
closeup view of the coast and we know exactly who the Witnesses are the Witnesses were aristu 
Machado his wife Donya Maria Nazar Machado their five children and their friend Senor jaia aguar 
who is a member of the Brazilian federal police and all of them were out on The machado's Veranda 
overlooking the ocean playing games eating was just before noon and it was aristu who 
first noticed a craft of some kind throwing up spray on the ocean's surface so apparently it had 
just come in for a landing though this was not specifically seen but it was throwing up quite 
a volume of water they first thought it actually might be a motorboat in need of assistance but of 
course later it would become clear to them that this wasn't a motor boat at all whatever it was 
it was about 15 ft wide gray metallic and in color and it had this large transparent Dome a coupa on 
top and inside of this Dome they could see two thick set small men wearing shining clothing 
and helmets and it was weird because these two men were signaling with their arms so all the 
witnesses were looking at this was immediately apparent to them that this was unusual they began 
discussing the incident trying to figure out what they should do now this object was quite close 
to shore estimates are somewhere between 1,000 to 3,000 ft at one point much closer as close as 300 
feet but Senor aguar the neighbor decided he would go leave the location to notify authorities and 
when he returned 40 minutes later this craft was still there all the witnesses were still watching 
it but it was shortly after he returned this disc without warning suddenly took off first gliding 
on the ocean and then becoming Airborne climbing at a 45° angle and going off into the distance of 
course this is when they could now clearly see this was a classic Flying Saucer and they said 
as this thing took off the lights on the craft began flashing in sequence multicolored lights 
green yellow and red and it was Dona Maria who noticed a strange sort of design on the bottom of 
the craft as you can see here she also said that she could still see the two figures in the craft 
in the dome as this object went Airborne but at no time did this thing make any noise noise not that 
they could hear now when this craft left it had apparently left behind an object called described 
as a white hoop-shaped object it was quite small only a few feet in diameter they're trying to 
figure out what it was when it disappeared beneath the waves it then reappeared and as they watched 
something strange happened this hoop shaped object ejected a yellow oval object small only 
about 1 and 1/2 ft wide and this yellow object began to move deliberately in a controlled way 
towards the beach they then saw this is so weird a green object detach from it and follow behind it 
and this yellow object approached to about 360 ft from the shore and then it made a right to angle 
turn to the left and seemed to continue up the coast which by the way is contrary to the current 
meanwhile this white hooped object continued to sink and Rise back up several times before 
finally disappearing so a really strange case that has never been fully solved and as it turns 
out this area has produced a number of reports over the years but this was apparently the first 
to involve humanoids this case was investigated by researchers Irene granie a very well-known 
researcher and Walter bu but no conventional explanation has ever been found to explain 
what these Witnesses saw what's cool about that case is they got to see this UFO or technically 
a Uso very close up didn't immediately jump to the ET explanation that's something they were 
quite resistant of until this craft actually flew away at a 45 degree angle into the skies silently 
um yeah a a really fascinating case with so many witnesses so long lasting very closeup seen during 
the day and now we move to the next case which I call the Virginia giant that's actually how the 
case came to be known as it's a pretty well-known case but I am not sure how many of you have heard 
of it certainly deserves to be more well known it was investigated by uh Nik cap actually 
investigators from the national investigative Committee of aerial phenomena took place on May 
16 1971 in a little town in Virginia called pasap panzi This is outside of Fredericksburg and an 
unusual case in a number of ways because of the followup of what happened the aftermath of this 
case this case was investigated by researcher John Carlson and Bruce mcabe who's a very well-known 
researcher they described it as quote one of the most interesting cases that they have worked on 
for naikap the national investigation Committee of aerial phenomena and as I said this case has come 
to be known as the Virginia Giant and we shall see why the main witness is an 18-year-old high school 
student known only as Michael D he and two of his high school friends Bill and Dave had decided to 
go camping about 1 and 1 half miles from their home in rural panszi outside of Fredericksburg 
they had found a nice spot in a field next to a pond surrounded by forest with them and this 
is significant was Mike's pet German Shepherd so they pitched their tent and were exploring 
the surrounding Terrain when they heard this horn coming from a house on a ridge overlooking 
the field it wasn't too far away curious Bill and Dave decided to hike to the edges of the field to 
investigate while Mike stayed behind with his dog and this is when his encounter actually began as 
Mike says in his own words I felt like something was following me and I turned around and there 
wasn't anything there in a split second I turned around again and there was this huge object just 
like it was floating according to Mike this object was hovering over the power lines by  the pond and then began to move in his Direction and when he saw this Mike immediately laid down 
in the high grass with his dog trying to hide the object approached to about 100 ft away from 
Mike and came in for a landing as Mike says in his own words legs came out from under it and 
it bounced as it hit the ground I couldn't move I was stunned I kept watching it and finally a door 
came down finally I saw this man he had long arms and everything finally he started walking 
he looked around he had some type of object in his hand I don't know what it was like a small 
little box that was glowing he looked at me put his hands up and started to come at me finally I 
just told my dog to sit him and he went after him so this apparent ET who Mike described as 
quote powerfully huge apparently saw Mike's dog who was now snarling and approaching the figure 
so when this happened the figure turned around and walking in sort of a stiff bouncing gate returned 
inside the craft the object remained on the ground for another 10 minutes or so and then took off
so Mike was absolutely stunned by this encounter to the degree that when his friends Bill and Dave 
returned they found Mike lying down in the grass moaning and clearly frightened he quickly told 
them what happened pointed to where the craft had left over a nearby Hill and Bill and Dave 
looked and they could see a strange glow there that was not normal all three of them at this 
point became so frightened they decided to cut their camping trip short and they returned home 
purposefully avoiding that hill where the light was still glowing but as it turns out events were 
still in progress cuz it was two nights later on May 18 that Mike's two sisters Kathy age 18 and 
Susie age 14 were returning home and they were driving up the family's driveway which is quite 
long when they heard this strange humming noise and they saw a red light coming down around them 
from above it was at that exact moment the car stalled the headlights went out the radio quit 
so they became quite frightened at this point and they tried frantically to start the motor  but of course it wouldn't go on meanwhile they're looking up and they can see this huge disc-shaped 
object glowing white with four red lights on the side and it was so low they estimated it 
was only about 50 ft above their vehicle and it was just staying there this standoff lasted for 
about 5 minutes when finally the car started the girl raced up the driveway and the object actually 
followed them now their brother Mike the original witness was in the house at the time and he heard 
the car roaring up the driveway kicking gravel from the gravel driveway so he rushed outside 
and he saw this quote gigantic saucer-shaped thing following them so once they pulled up to the house 
Kathy who was driving immediately fled inside but poor 14-year-old suszie remained in the car too 
frightened to move meanwhile Mike's older brother came running out he also saw the object Kathy ran 
inside to call their parents their parents were not far away they rushed home but before they 
could arrive the object had begun to move however the father was able to use a pair of binoculars 
and he watched the object through the binoculars as it moved away and was gone also another weird 
interesting electromagnetic effect the whole time the saucer hovered the TV in the house was 
not functioning normally so everyone was quite Shook Up by this they called the police this is 
is when Mike explained about his prior sighting in a nearby field two days earlier so the police and 
two members of his family went to the location and this is when they found seven evenly distributed 
holes in a circular pattern the investigators were quite impressed by the sincerity of the witnesses 
how emotional they were and they studied the case they interviewed all the witnesses in detail who 
were quite concerned about about publicity and their identity being kept secret but what they did 
find was that about 30 m away less was the naval weapons laboratory at dogran they thought this 
might be a factor because as we know UFOs do seem to be very interested in military installations 
well there you go what's interesting about this case is this UFO is apparently following 
this family or certainly at least the primary witness uh it's also interesting because it 
involves Landing traces as well as electromagnetic effects as well as animal reactions it's a super 
interesting case I do wonder if the UFO was there because of the the naval weapons laboratory not 
too far away at dalren certainly a possibility but it seems like it was more interested in the 
witness himself super hard to say I wish that this was more thoroughly investigated in terms 
of a followup because I suspect this wasn't a one-off there were being two encounters one day 
after the other but unfortunately this case has sort of faded off into history and that's one 
of the reasons why I wanted to present it here because it definitely deserves to be well known 
and now we move on to another Super fascinating case which I call ETS on the island of fur seals 
this took place on October 28th 1972 on a little island off the coast of Uruguay this is called the 
Isla de Lobos which translates to the island of fur seals meaning Lobos Marino which is how you 
say F seals so it's just fascinating case on a very isolated island with a little lighthouse 
on it a little military Outpost I definitely wonder what the ET craft was doing there but 
as we shall see it's a very close encounter with a landed UFO and humanoids this very interesting 
case was investigated by Dr Willie Smith PhD a physicist and a UFO researcher from the University 
of Michigan this case took place on a remote island again right off the coast of Uruguay 
uh and it's called the Isla de Lobos because this island is really only inhabited by fur 
seals besides them there is a lighthouse which is maintained and occupied generally by four or five 
officers from the Uruguay Navy and on this night there were five officers there there was Corporal 
Juan Fuentes figuroa Jose Gomez and Hector HZ they were two inlisted men there was Jose Lima 
the telegraph operator and Francisco cascudo who was an the sub officer and it was about 1010 p.m. 
the men had just finished dinner they were playing cards and it was time for Corporal Juan Fuentes 
to go inspect the G generators at the bottom of this 66t tall Lighthouse you can see here so he 
W walks up to this Lighthouse and this is when he sees some strange lights and realizing they 
were unusual he ran back inside got his pistol and went to investigate and getting closer he saw that 
these lights were actually coming from an object which had landed on the Terrace was very unusual 
looking it had white yellow and purple lights and as he got even closer he saw that there was 
in fact a figure standing next to it and then a second and a third figure coming out from the 
craft and almost immediately these three figures noticed Corporal fentz they seemed to briefly 
consult each other and then turned to face him and he says they looked like normal humans he 
couldn't really see that well cuz it was dark and they were mostly silhouettes but he saw that they 
were about 5T tall two of them one was closer to 6 feet he says they appeared to be wearing heavy 
black rubber suits which kind of restricted their movements so they also appeared to have elongated 
heads though he's not sure if this could have been due to a helmet or a hood of some kind but 
it was the craft which really caught his attention because it was a classic saucer metallic red a 
dome on top long Landing legs and at this point he was about 80 ft from the craft that's pretty close 
and realizing that whoever this was they were Intruders they were not supposed to be there was 
his job to defend this installation and he raised his gun he intended to shoot but for reasons not 
fully understood by him he found himself unable to do so he says he felt a strange vibration his hair 
lifted on end he felt as if he was paralyzed he felt mentally confused he says he received what 
was apparently a telepathic communication which as he told researchers was quote don't shoot because 
it is useless so again these are details we often hear people describe their hair standing on end 
strange vibrations being paralyzed receiving telepathic messages but as all of this is going 
on these three figures quickly re-entered the craft using the same ladder type device they had 
descended on and after they entered uh he watched this door close sideways and this craft moved 
straight up emitting a humming sound and once it was about 140 150 ft in the air he says it emitted 
sort of this blast of fire from the bottom section and disappeared at extremely high acceleration but 
totally L silently to the southeast so this really impressed him uh somewhat traumatized him he 
returned to the building with the other officers still in it playing cards and they noticed he was 
very pale something was wrong and they asked him what happened and he told them and they thought 
he was joking pretty much all of them thought he was joking except one officer cascudo who believed 
Fuentes and said that f was quote a simple and honest man incapable of inventing a story of 
this nature but it really upset Fuentes that the others didn't believe him he planned to go to 
the newspapers to report his experience however before this he was actually ordered to describe 
his experience to a higher ranking officer and he learned that the US Military at the American 
Embassy there were were interested in his story and did receive all the details about it which I 
think is significant a truly interesting case I don't think it was helicopters it's quite clear 
that the US was also very interested in this case given that this report apparently went to 
the Pentagon so something is going on there if they're interested in it a fascinating case to 
say the least and now we move on to the next case which I call it can't be human this is of course a 
direct quote from the primary witness took place on October 24 1974 in Cincinnati Ohio it's a 
super fascinating case because it's an object and humanoid that was seen very close up landed on the 
ground for a good period of time there's Landing traces there's electromagnetic effects and a very 
unusual humanoid this case was investigated by very well-known researcher Leonard Stringfield 
and it involves a woman known only as Mrs R heitfeld and as Stringfield writes I was impressed 
by her sincerity in relating the bizarre details describing the UFO the occupants and the various 
collectible residues which she thought might relate to the case so this case began around 2:30 
a.m. when Mrs heitfeld woke up to get something to drink and noticed a bright light shining 
in through the window of her little trailer and opening the curtains she saw six lights blue and 
silverish hovering only about 4T off the ground pretty much directly outside inside her window she 
said they were quote like stars as beautiful as Christmas lights lit up inside strangely she said 
they cast no illumination around them but at this point she looked past the lights to a car parked 
about 10 ft away and this is when she saw quote an ape likee creature she said it appeared to be 
interested in this car freaking out she ran to her son's bedroom and screamed for him to wake up and 
look outside now he did not wake up immediately he was sleeping pretty heavily so she ran back 
to the window and saw that this apik creature was now about 35 ft away and was encased in a dome of 
light she's not sure if this was a solid object or what but it looked like it she said she saw 
this creature in a side view profile it appeared to have a grayish body body what looked like a 
snout no visible neck and a thick waist she said his arms were moving very slowly up and down kind 
of stiffly almost robotic like not moving the elbows at all she said it almost looked like 
it was trying to move a lever though she couldn't see any visible panels or controls but it did look 
like a glass Dome or a shield was encasing this creature this Dome home was about 15 ft wide and 
again there was nothing in it but this strange figure and finally at this point Mrs heidfeld's 
son Carl stumbled sleepily up to the window and he saw it too he saw the whole thing he verified 
it later to Leonard Stringfield but at this point with this craft and this being still there right 
outside her home she called the police who were very uncooperative and skeptical they told her 
listen we just went there there was a fire alarm we were called to the site there's nothing there 
and she told them that she was seeing a UFO and the occupant she said it's still here and it 
can't be human but the police were skeptical and uncooperative and she hung up on them because at 
this point uh she wanted to go back and see what this craft was doing so at this point A car pulled 
up to this first car where this all was taking place and apparently it was there to give this 
car a battery jump and when she returned to the window and saw all this of course the creature 
in the craft were gone she ran back to the police officer and told him never mind no to the phone to 
tell the police officer told him never mind it's gone and hung up on him so Mrs hefel to estimates 
this encounter lasted for a total of about 5 minutes later she was able to locate the people 
who jumped this car and they said no they hadn't seen anything unusual that the car itself was 
already having problems but when morning arrived the next day she did go out there to where this 
craft had been and she found this weird swirl of ashes and little bits of debris she collected them 
and turned them over to Leonard Stringfield hoping for an analysis which unfortunately was never done 
but there was another strange thing because as it turned out a fire alarm at the warehouse next door 
had been triggered by what ended up being unknown causes at the exact time of the encounter so that 
seems to be a direct relation here at any rate the witness said that the experience itself was very 
frightening she had never believed in such things as UFOs and she called the police because she was 
afraid that this creature might actually come into her trailer and Leonard Stringfield came 
away absolutely convinced that this was a genuine encounter as he writes I believe that she had a 
real conscious experience and was witnessed to an unusual anomaly Beyond her ability to understand 
the incident was not a hoax her descriptive phraseology to compare the unconventional to 
familiar objects lends Credence to her Endeavor to relate the truth the electromagnetic effects are 
in the time frame of her observation as confirmed by the fire department and the powdered substance 
is in my possession and available for analysis I'm glad that case was investigated by Leonard 
Stringfield he's a very well respected researcher I think very thorough he certainly did his job in 
investigating this case and it's got some weird elements to it yeah there are a number of cases 
where people have seen sort of apik beings but in connection with UFOs that's pretty rare and now 
we move to the next case which has probably even stranger looking ETS I call this case the tiny 
doll-like aliens this took place on September 3rd 1976 in an area known as fence houses this 
is in England there are two witnesses it's quite a close-up case I mean the one of the witnesses 
actually walked right up to the craft and touched it with her own hand that's super rare also some 
interesting physiological effects there's an interesting aftermath to this case as well well 
and that it was apparently being covered up or the witnesses being silenced just a really unusual 
case there are two witnesses in this case a 63-year-old grandmother and her 18-year-old niece 
they had just finished visiting relatives and were walking by the little village of fence houses 
when they noticed a small and very strange object resting on the ground they estimate it was about 
5 ft wide 3 and 1/2 to 4T wide oval in shape uh they said it had a glasslike compartment a bright 
orange Dome on top and chromik metallic Runners kind of like you'd see on a sled but seeing this 
object on the ground was strange enough but the high strangeness quickly escalated but because 
upon seeing it both Witnesses had no fear but they immediately felt like they went into this weird 
hypnotic trance and couldn't help but approached the object which of course they did and as they 
got close to it other weird things started to happen it had been a pretty windy day but now the 
wind completely stopped also the traffic on the road disappeared later they would discover that 
their watches also stopped and the grandmother walked right up to this craft and actually touched 
it she walked alongside it running her hand along the surface she said it was very smooth like glass 
and felt warm and it was at this point that two tiny humanoids appeared they reminded both the 
witnesses of little dolls that's what they looked like these entities were no more than 1 and 1/2 ft 
tall they looked human or humanoid they said but had long white hair down to their shoulders parted 
down the middle very large eyes and what looked like claw-like fingers fers and as the grandmother 
says they were just like little dolls only 18 in tall sporting long white hair parted down the 
middle and huge staring eyes like marbles now at this point both Witnesses reported that something 
weird was going on with time it felt like time stopped at this point they did become afraid they 
held their hands to their faces at this point they became also very confused and disoriented 
and the next thing they knew these little doll likee figures had disappeared this craft was now 
humming loudly and it quickly took off Upward at great speed so terrified they fled the site and 
they later of course discovered that their watches were now working normally but had stopped but one 
weird after effect is almost inexplicable cuz it was the very next day the grandmother decided to 
vacuum the house and she was trying to plug the vacuum cleaner cord into an electrical socket and 
felt some weird Force pushing her hands away from the light socket and she tried several 
times but still couldn't do it and she eventually had to get her daughter to do it who was able to 
do it with no problem so perhaps there was some weird electromagnetic force her bioelectric field 
perhaps a altered in some way hard to say but this is something we see in these encounters both the 
Witnesses were very reluctant to talk in fact the story reached investigators only through a series 
of fortunate circumstances and the whole Affair ended on a very strange note when researchers 
discovered that they knew somebody whose partner was apparently a secret government UFO agent who 
worked for the Department of Defense and told the person his partner that quote an old lady and her 
niece had an encounter with what looked like an egg on skids and two alien beings so at this point 
this encounter had not been publicized at all and yet he's telling all of these details and 
this person who knew him the I guess I'll call him a whistleblower she said that she believed 
that her partner was quote trying to get to the UFO Witnesses before investigators like 
yourselves and destroying evidence before it got any further and according to this lady her former 
partner was reportedly very well paid he owned a flashy new sports car and a new van and would 
have repeated visits from apparent government men and he became quite uh abrasive and truculent you 
know uh disagreeable when The Whistleblower the lady brought up this information and as Jenny 
randles writes there are also strange reasons why this case was never properly studied and clear 
evidence that the Witnesses were silence so judge for yourself what this means yeah that has to be 
one of the stranger cases on record the weird electromagnetic effects that occurred afterward 
are totally inexplicable I I don't even know how to explain that but I'm glad it was investigated 
by researchers from England even though the investigation was somewhat cut short because 
the main Witnesses were quite frightened about and were apparently being silenced so an extraordinary 
case in that regard and now we move on to the next case which is an on board encounter quite 
an unusual one I call this one a trucker abducted that's certainly how he felt this one took place 
on August 28th 1979 outside of Winchester Virginia and what's interesting about this case is it was 
very thoroughly researched it involves some profound electromagnetic effects some really 
profound after effects in terms of how this Witness was affected medically spiritually 
mentally emotionally psychically so some really profound aspects to this case which is not super 
well known and definitely deserves to be that's why I wanted to present it to you today this is 
such a strange case again August 28th 1979 outside of Winchester Virginia the main witness Harry Joe 
Turner is an ex-navy Sharp shooter a welder and a plumber a 254b amateur boxer with 24 wins a 
martial arts student and a truck driver so a pretty tough guy though none of this prepared 
him for what happened to him on that rainy night of August 28 he was on Route in his 80,000 lb 
tractor trailer which was loaded with ketchup and mustard and he was traveling along Route 17 from 
Winchester to Fredericksburg Virginia and this is an 80 mile trip but he was only about 17 miles in 
when his journey was interrupted the first hint of strangeness began at 11:15 when Harry Joe's 
CB radio began to emit strange static the same time he heard a high-pitch noise he saw strange 
lights in both of his side view mirrors both his headlights began blinking on and off this weird 
high-pitch noise got louder and louder these weird lights swept over his truck and this is when he 
saw a craft come over the top of his truck cab and it was huge he said it was bigger than his entire 
truck he heard two loud thumps on the roof of his vehicle and he says he seemed to lose control of 
the steering it was almost as if the truck was floating in the air now the next thing he knows 
he's at the end of his route in Fredericksburg sitting in the passenger seat it's weird because 
the driver's side seat belt was still buckled and he trying to reorient himself and he instantly 
remembers having seen this craft he started doing a check of his belongings he found that his money 
and credit cards were untouched but his personal belongings were scattered all over the truck his 
tools were laid out on the ground next to it his watch read 1117 but it was obvious to him it was 
later than that and checking the clock in the warehouse he saw that it read 3 a.m. so that's 
about 4 hours of missing time and looking at his odometer this absolutely floored him it showed 
that he had only driven 17 miles but the fuel tank showed that he had actually used 114 gallons which 
is several times more than what the trip required also his radio antenna was sheared off and there 
were other After Effects the next day he noticed that his eyes were extremely sensitive to light 
his ears were sensitive to sound later that day he fainted and was rushed to the hospital this 
is when Harry revealed his UFO experience and he was referred to a psychiatrist back at home he 
know noticed that the gun he had carried on that trip showed that all eight rounds had been fired 
and this is when he started having flashbacks he remembered this craft coming over and that 
was when you know next thing he knew he woke up at this warehouse but now he remembered an 
entity coming down to his door he remembered firing his gun at the entity he remembered his 
truck being levitated by a beam of light into this object he found himself inside this craft he was 
pulled into a room where he says he was examined by human looking figures who are wearing kind of 
white shirts and pants and white caps kind of like doctors said it was really strange because 
their foreheads had what looked like numbers on them he says they were very pale complected and 
when they moved they darted from place to place very quickly much more than a normal person could 
move he said they surrounded him examined him using strange tools he thinks they may have 
put an implant inside of him he said they spoke in what sounded like a recording going backwards kind 
of high-speed gibberish at one point an entity approached Harry Joe and asked him what his name 
was so Harry told him and the entity said that his name was phonetically speaking Alpha laulu 
so this entity asked him a series of questions Harry has not been able to remember what these 
questions were for the most part but he does remember the ETS asking him about his truck's 
transmission which was an unusual transmission so Harry Joe says his memory came back in bits 
and pieces at one point he does recall seeing a strange star-like symbol on board the craft he 
also remembered being taken to what he believes is another planet with big domes on them which 
were covering large cities he says quote in a land that looks like the future of this planet 
so he had the impression that they had suffered some kind of nuclear war though apparently he  was not directly told this he says at some point when he was being returned they took him to the 
surface of the Earth's moon Moon close enough to see the footprints left by the astronauts 
I found this interesting because a number of contactees do report this kind of thing but the 
whole encounter left him pretty badly traumatized before he had been a moderate smoker but he began 
smoking heavily he started taking sedatives to handle his anxiety he began suffering from Sudden 
crying spells he says he heard this ringing in his ear ears he believed that the ETS were looking 
through his eyes the encounter actually left him very emotionally depressed to the point of 
on occasion being suicidal with 10 days following this encounter he felt compelled to return to the 
site where he had been taken so he went there and he was apparently taken again he doesn't have all 
the memories of this but as Harry says they told me they wouldn't take nothing aboard their ship 
unless it was St paralyzed I asked them where were we going and they said nowhere we only 
need you for a moment and we're done with you now of the etes Harry does not believe that they're 
malevolent or evil as he says they want to help us but they say things have gone pretty far here 
and the end is coming soon so that's certainly a theme we hear a lot in Communications with 
ETS but the weird events continued according to Harry Joe he says at one point he was visited by 
what he describes as sort of a jesus-like figure this caused him to become more religious he was 
traumatized to the point that he began sleeping with a gun under his pillow again he doesn't feel 
that the ETS are bad or harmful and he says given the opportunity he would definitely go 
back on board he says following his encounter he began having all kinds of paranormal experiences 
with ESP and what sounds like remote viewing and there's other weird things that happened 
he created a file and started documenting his experiences and putting all the evidence he had 
gathered in it but in December of that year it came up missing along with his Navy records his 
birth certificate and a UFO questionnaire he had filled out so there are some who know him 
who question his credibility but all of them agree that something very unusual and traumatic happened 
to him and as Harry himself says ever since it All Began I've just been sitting here going over and 
over it in my mind trying to piece things back together I'd feel pretty good if I could just 
figure out where I've been if somebody would just come up to me and say I was drunk or something 
that would be great because it would give me an explanation a reason but I wasn't drunk nothing 
makes sense so that's certainly something I have heard from other UFO experiencers who have told 
me personally you know I wish you would have just said I was crazy that would be an explanation but 
no I don't think these people are crazy too many people are having this kind of experience that's 
another case where I really feel for the witness because he obviously had a very hard time dealing 
with this which is not unusual and understandable I think particularly if an encounter takes takes 
someone by surprise but an important case for the reasons I stated all the physical evidence 
and how this witness was affected afterwards and now we move to the last case of this collection 
which actually comes from Russia and I call this one ET phone home don't mean to be cliche but as 
you shall see there's an interesting element to this case or I think that title is appropriate 
this one took place on July 4 1989 in tibilisi Georgia this is in Russia of course and it's a 
super interesting case that was investigated by experienced researchers and has some interesting 
collaborations and some truly unusual elements to it as we shall see this case another onboard 
experience comes from the Georgian eological Association the witness is largely Anonymous 
known only as David D and it was around 9:30 p.m on July 4th 1989 and he was driving along 
the matac minda road in ortachala and suddenly his car engine failed and he says David says he felt 
himself being overcome by a strange invisible sort of force field which compelled him to walk about 
600t Fe down the road and he walked right up to a landed Flying Saucer and as David says in his own 
words it was standing to the left of me and had three legs all around it were colored lights at 
the bottom were stairs and illuminated windows from this saucer 15 to 20 M away were standing 
four figures they were 2.53 m in height so that's tall I mean that's up up to 9 ft and 
as David says I wasn't scared maybe because of that hypnosis like force which was taking me to 
that place kept me from being scared they were also not afraid when they saw me one of them 
came close to me and tried to establish contact I was trying to understand first he was talking 
in this strange language next he started talking in Russian he asked how old am I I answered next 
he told me that they aren't the first here and they will come again he told me we come when 
it is a necessity he said that we are undeveloped and that we have SIMPLE primitive technology next 
I felt behind me something warm I turned and saw that one of them was measuring my height talking 
to only one of them I put my hand on my watch and gave a sign that I was late and I am in a hurry 
he asked do you have a phone at home I answered I have but how can I call from here uh he went into 
the saucer walked up a gang way where the light was coming from and when he came back he held 
a strange apparatus the device was lit up with different colored lights and strange signs which 
looked like hieroglyphs I understood that it was a phone and I dialed my home number the voice that 
was coming from the apparatus and Light which lit up from The Voice understood me that nobody was 
taking my phone call at home then he took the apparatus back without speaking afterwards he 
came back and told that they want to take us I don't understand what they mean by us but they 
want to help that they aren't coming with a bad intention I asked what if I come with you will 
you bring me back he didn't answer because on the small transmitter in my mind it was a transmitter 
all four of them had it on their breasts was a lighted red colored bulb and I heard a low 
siren-like voice when he heard that signal he went into the saucer and took me with him inside the 
saucer I saw a TV like as apparatus I saw all of my body the picture was color and clearer than on 
an X-ray set I saw how my heart worked my stomach and other organs at that time my interrogator came 
back he told me that I was free and I can go home I said my car isn't working he calmed me and said 
don't worry your car will be okay I came back and sat in the car I saw how the UFO pushed the stairs 
in and lifted into the air approximately at 60 M altitude it reduced speed turned on its side and 
climbed into the air I heard a low humming sound the car started and I went to home so 
all of these details are quite interesting because they're certainly reported in a lot of other cases 
in terms of how this craft rose up turned on its side and darted off silently that's very commonly 
reported of course a car are failing being hypnotically compelled to go to a craft all of 
these details are quite commonly reported though this telephone like instrument I've not heard that 
before but later the witness did go back and found some weird evidence as he says on July 
11 at the same place I saw a black spilled liquid which had an oil smell I want to tell you that the 
liquid on the third day wasn't there consequently after our meeting they were there once more at the 
same spot and they stayed that time so again this was investigated by a Russian UFO group and they 
found out that one week later a scientist and her daughter saw a UFO sending down a beam of light in 
that exact same area certainly a very bizarre case you'll agree that's a very interesting case quite 
unusual with corroborating Witnesses supporting it afterwards a lot to learn from that case which 
yeah is more unusual perhaps than most but as I've often said High strangeness seems to be a 
regular aspect of these encounters and on the other hand High strangeness is kind of our own 
interpretation of it only seems strange because we don't fully understand it so that's our show 
for today I hope you found this very interesting and hopefully educational as I've said many times 
this is a global phenomena it stretches back I think Millennia but it's pretty clear people have 
been directly contacted for decade after decade after decade and we're seeing a wide variety of 
humanoids but almost always humanoids and again all kinds of evidence to back these cases up it's 
certainly not just one person's testimony a lot of these cases have multiple eyewitness testimony and 
the whole variety of effects we see from medical effects to animal reactions to electromagnetic 
disturbances and most significantly I think Landing traces so always a lot of questions 
and Mysteries surrounding all of this but I think we're making really good progress in understanding 
and getting close to accepting the fact that we are not alone that we are being visited and that 
we are only one of many different humanoids in this universe that is awesome so again that's 
it for today thanks so much I truly appreciate you watching and until next time keep searching 
for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun right now
I
