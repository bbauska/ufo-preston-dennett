EXTRATERRESTRIAL GARDENERS
Aug 28, 2020

Summary:
Aug 28, 2020
ETs are abducting people and collecting their genetic material. They are abducting animals. And 
they are also abducting plants! As these accounts will show, ETs have been collecting a wide 
variety of plants for a very long time.

And that's not all. If you are taken onboard a UFO, the last thing you might expect to see is a 
forest. And yet, this has happened more than you might think. 

And the cases get even stranger. In some cases, ETs  provide advice about gardening. In others, 
they use more direct methods. Imagine a UFO shines down and causes a plant to double in size. 
There's more than one case like it!

Why are ETs collecting plants and growing forests onboard UFOs? What is the motive behind this 
agenda? ETs have been warning people about Earth changes for many years. Perhaps they have 
decided to take action themselves. Could UFOs be like Noah's Ark, trying to save the species 
of our planet? 

Only one thing is for sure: ETs are here, and they are taking our plants.

Volume 2," available on Amazon.

hello everyone my name is preston  dennett and today i want to talk about   extraterrestrial gardeners cases in  which ets are taking our plant life  
it's pretty much accepted that  ets have been abducting people for   quite decades and uh collecting genetic  material there are many cases of ets collecting  
animals as well abducting animals and of course  their interest in our planet seems to extend  
to the plant life as well so there are  many cases in which ets have been seen  
taking plants of all kinds and several cases in  which ets have very unusual effects on plant life  
so yeah that's what i want to talk about today and  see if we can figure out what's going on because   some of these cases are really weird first case  i want to talk about took place in 1991 in puerto  
rico to a couple by the name of albert and marisol  camacho first strange thing they noticed was when  
their neighbors approached them and said that  they had seen a ufo hovering over their house   the camacho's hadn't seen anything at this  point but it was just a few days later that  
albert camacho did see a strange craft hovering  overhead darted away and it was a few days after  
that that marisol camacho was woken up early one  morning activity on her front porch and she looked  
out her window and got a real shock there were two  small figures there with big bald heads large dark  
eyes wearing jumpsuits and they seem to be very  interested in her swiss cheese plant swiss cheese  
plant is also called the split leaf philodendron  it's a common house plant but it does have some  
medicinal properties as well and yeah they seem to  be very interested in it in fact as marisol says  
they were taking leaves off the swiss cheese  plant they were stripping her plant of leaves  
and so she starts to open the window and they look  up and run away but it was only a few days later  
there was a repeat performance the et's were  back on her front porch she heard activity again  
looks out the window and sure enough there  they are surrounding her swiss cheese plant   again and taking a few more leaves so it's a  very strange case what interest would ets have  
in a common house plant hard to say  but there's quite a few cases like this  
a very well-known case took place in valencia  france to a farmer by the name of maurice  
mass maurice is a lavender farmer he had a field  of lavender flowers which was used for soap and  
other uses and he was having a lot of problems  with missing plants this is in june of 1965  
he noticed that some of his lavender  plants were missing just completely   gone and he could not figure out who was doing  it until july 1st 1965 he wakes up early one  
morning to check on his plants and he catches the  perpetrators red-handed when he sees this object  
uh drop down from the sky and land in the  middle of his lavender field two figures  
come out and start plucking his lavender flowers  he approaches and one of them takes this little  
device like a pistol points it at him and  maurice finds himself completely paralyzed  
these two figures take the lavender plants that  they had collected and go back into the object  
which takes off straight up it's an amazing case  because it left very prominent landing traces  
which caused quite a bit of attention  and maurice became a little bit of a  
a celebrity and which was not what he  wanted and did not want all this publicity  
but yeah it's another case of et's taking plants  and there are quite a few cases like these  
researcher artie six killer cleric has a  couple of these kinds of cases one occurred  
um not that long ago 2010 around there she  doesn't give the exact date this occurred  
in honduras to a farmer by the name of hector he  saw a ufo hovering over his cornfield in honduras  
and uh this little man suddenly appeared in his  field he was wearing a full body brown suit and  
started collecting uh ears of corn which he  would take and put in a little pocket in his suit  
so hector was watching this  and so is hector's brother   hector's brother decides to approach at which  point the little figure sees both the men  
and paralyzes them apparently but hector and  his brother were unable to move as the man took  
the ears of corn and floated up into the flying  saucer which took off the two brothers were unable  
to move for another hour and finally did recover  were very weak and actually suffered long lasting  
ill effects from this encounter which are still  persisting today weakness and things like this  
so yeah et's are taking our plants here's another  case that's occurred on september 10 1965 it was  
investigated by jim and coral lorenzen there  was a farmer in pernambuco brazil his name is  
antonio powell and he was out in his maze field  his corn field when he sees this object come in  
for landing it doesn't actually land it floats  about one foot above his cornfield and he sees two  
three foot tall humanoids emerge they're normal  looking they look like little humans they're  
clean shaven have a reddish brown complexion and  are wearing tight tight-fitting one-piece suits  
uh one of them approaches the farmer right walks  right up to him and starts speaking in a foreign  
language antonio cannot understand what he's  saying he's pretty frightened and one of the ets  
picks a tomato and these two figures return back  into the craft which takes off with a loud hum  
and he was not the only witness many  people in this area heard the craft as well
another case occurred this is also  from jim cora lorenzen this occurred in  
pontal brazil uh on december 4th 1954 jose alves  was fishing on the pardo river when this typical  
flying saucer drops down and he sees three little  men in tight fitting suits and they immediately  
start start taking samples of various plants they  said he said they took samples of the grasses and  
the herbs and various leaves and actually took  a little tube and filled it with water from the  
river before suddenly leaving that was december  4th was only five days later that there was  
another case nearby this is also investigated  by jim and cora lorenzen this took place in  
brazil but to a man by the name of olmira de costa  and he said on december 9th this cream-colored  
object hovered over his farm and all the animals  scattered there were three humanoids that he saw  
two were on the ground and one was in the ship  looking down one of these humanoids approaches all  
mirror um he drops his hoe one of the humanoids  picks up the hoe and hands it back to him  
meanwhile the other one bends over and starts  picking some of the beans and maize plants  
and heads back into the craft uh el niro his  farm animals start approaching and he offers  
to give them one of the farm animals but  they don't seem to be interested in that   they just want some of his plants and that's  what they did they took the plants and left and  
it was literally two days later and one mile away  that there is another case i'm thinking these are  
probably the same et's this was also investigated  by jim and coral lorenzen though many years later  
rd6 killer clark located this witness and also got  an interview with him and got the same exact story  
uh this is a farmer by the name of pedro morales  and uh this is took place in rio grande seoul in  
brazil yeah one mile from the above case uh pedro  first noticed something unusual when his chickens  
started making a fuss he went outside to see  what was wrong and saw this law this object  
it says it was kind of brass in color and very  loud making a sound kind of like a sewing machine  
and comes in for a landing on  his uh field of beans and corn  
and uh there are two figures on the ground one in  the ship uh the farmer describes these figures as  
being of about medium height broad-shouldered that  long blonde hair pale skin slanted eyes now this  
description is important because uh there's  another case with the exact same description  
at any rate he said that they were wearing  brownish suits or perhaps yellowish suits and  
uh were more interested in the tobacco plants than  the beans in corn at any rate uh he sees them in  
his tobacco field so he runs towards them one of  them holds up a hand in kind of a warning jester  
gesture and immediately one of them bends down  and picks a tobacco plant and returns to the craft  
and uh the other enters the craft and this  craft darts away making a loud humming noise  
following this incident the farmer did notice  that one of his chickens was missing and has  
never been seen since this incident so presumably  they may have taken one of his chickens as well  
so yeah i mean there's a lot of cases another one  from 1954 in march occurred in santa maria brazil  
to a farmer by the name of ruben helwig  he came upon a landed ufo and two  
male humanoids looking mostly like normal humans  wearing jumpsuits and one of them was collecting  
samples of grass he later had a repeat encounter  where he was able to speak to them briefly  
and they told him that they were interested in  this area brazil because it was very rich in  
natural resources bud hopkins of course had a  very famous case this was the one that got him  
interested in ufos this occurred in november  1975 outside the stonehenge apartments in new  
york uh the main witness is george obarsky who  saw little humanoids uh out in the park there  
digging in the grass and it turns out the the park  attendant had noticed these strange little holes  
appearing and could not figure out who was doing  it but yeah these were deep holes that actually  
took all the grass all the way down to the roots  so it appears that the ets were taking samples  
of grass or and or soil so yeah these guys  are collectors they're collecting all kinds of  
plants here's another case which comes from mufon  this occurred in may of 1982 in newport virginia  
the main witness is a field engineer at a shipyard  he was woken up around midnight one evening to  
see this bright light shining through his window  through the shutters from the backyard and he gets  
up and peeks through the shutters at which point  he becomes paralyzed unable to move the light  
finally blinks off he's a little frightened he  waits the next morning to go out into the field  
and doesn't see anything there's no evidence  that anything was there but two days later he  
goes out there again and sees that there are three  perfectly circular rings about 12 feet in diameter  
uh all right next to each other kind of forming  a little triangle uh he's very puzzled it looks  
like there's sort of they're made out of sort  of a fungus they're sort of donut shaped and  
he sees his neighbor out in the back of  gardening and brings a sample of the grass  
and shows us to him and his neighbor says oh  yeah this is a common fungus in the area it   grows in kind of a outward growing pattern making  little circles maybe two feet in diameter three  
but it usually takes two to three weeks to  form and the witness is like no these these  
circles appeared overnight which they both  found very strange and here's where the story  
gets even stranger and i'll just quote from  the engineer who was talking to his neighbor  
this is what the engineer says he then showed  me several places where some of his azaleas were  
missing the dirt was still fresh like they were  pulled out by the roots there was a footprint  
about five or six inches long near the plants  it looked like someone was wearing swimming fins  
with no obvious toe or heel marks he thought  some kids stole the flowers at night he had  
several varieties of azaleas and it appeared  that at least one of each color was missing  
so yeah here's another case where ets are  stealing flowers why et's would come from  
light years away or wherever they're coming  from to collect flowers it's hard to say but  
there's enough cases to say that they are in  fact doing this here's another one also from  
1954 by the way november 4th 1954 this took  place in orezo italy the main witness is a  
lady by the name of rosa de nelly lottie she's 40  years old she's on her way to visit a grave site  
it was a very dewy morning the grass was filled  with dew so she took off her stockings and was  
walking barefoot holding her stockings in one hand  and a bouquet of carnations in the other when she  
comes around the corner into a field and sees  this weird object like two cones placed together  
and it's there landed in the field  and there's two short humanoids  
standing next to this object they're very friendly  they're smiling and she approaches they seem  
very friendly at first until suddenly they lunge  forward and steal her stockings and her carnations  
this frightens her pretty bad so she runs  away and turns around she can still see  
them there the object then takes off and turns  out she's not the only witness there were some  
other people in the area two two children  who saw the whole thing the little men and  
everything and watched this object take off  so again here we have et's stealing flowers  
another case from mufon took place in february  2006 and at waynesville north carolina  
this is another very strange case the gentleman  a main witness says he saw this ufo hovering over  
a norway maple tree and it was bending the  branches and stripping them of all the newly  
formed buds and leaves so whatever this object  was whoever was inside it they seem to be very  
interested in this norway maple tree and  the newly emerging flowers coming from it  
probably the strangest case i found of this kind  took place on july 22nd in 1978 in phoenix arizona  
this is again a case from mufon it occurred at  6 pm a man was sitting outside his home with his  
friend uh when they heard a very loud thunderous  sound this was followed by a brilliant flash of  
light and there was this rotating silver craft  very low overhead it appeared to be triangular  
in shape and then something very strange  happened and i'll just quote the witness here  
the first craft says the witness emitted a beam  that lifted a 40-foot cactus out of the ground and  
fixed the sand so the earth looked untouched both  craft then disappeared as they had arrived in a  
brilliant explosion of light the witness ended up  moving to new york because this incident rattled  
him so much he's still in touch with his friends  as and as he says i still keep in contact with my  
friend and this always comes up in conversation  uh yeah i bet it does it's a very strange case  
which i would disregard except for the case  the fact that there are so many other cases  
like this uh one case that i investigated myself  took place in 1953 in livingston california to  
a group of philippine immigrants who owned  a strawberry field and were out there early  
one morning picking strawberries when three ufos  dropped down and surrounded the strawberry field  
on three different sides one was very close this  was a tiny little craft it couldn't have held more  
than two little people because it was maybe ten  feet across five feet high totally silent except  
for a soft whispering noise the main witness heard  a message in her head that says don't be afraid  
there's no reason to fear and  while they did not see this craft   actually do anything it was clear that they  were very interested in the strawberry field  
they stayed there for a good 10 15  maybe 20 minutes before finally leaving  
another very interesting case comes from whitley  strieber who i joined a ufo abductee support group  
and heard this case from a lady by the name of  mary who was a cosmetologist from new york city  
and she had experienced repeated abductions  throughout her life at least 10 times she believes  
she's been abducted over a period of 25 years or  her friends and family have all had experiences  
she's seeing et's that are the commonly described  grays with large bald heads large dark eyes short  
and grey skin and she says that she had a very  interesting experience and i'm quoting mary right  
now says mary for a whole year i was obsessed with  taking some little piece of the world with me i  
took my children to the park and i collected every  little seed and rock and twig that i could find  
my whole room looked like a nature study  then half the stuff turned up missing  
mary didn't see how this turned up missing but  she speculates that it was the grays and that  
they were kind of using her as a proxy to collect  various plant life and seeds from our planet uh  
she feels that the ets are probably benevolent and  are just there to study and there are some cases  
i think that show this a very interesting  case comes from researcher diane tessman  
she's a mufon field investigator and has been  researching ufos for decades and she reports in  
this very interesting case which took place  to a farmer by the name of john degroote in  
amsterdam netherlands now this is a place  very well known for growing tulips and flowers  
and turns out john was in fact a tulip farmer  and late one evening this is on september 24  
1989 he returned home to see that one of his  greenhouses was glowing with a strange light so he  
goes to investigate and is really surprised  to see this huge object parked behind his  
greenhouse it's a saucer-shaped craft easily  the same size of his greenhouse or larger  
and he sees this human-looking person dressed  in a strange jumpsuit who immediately approaches  
the farmer and gives him a  message the e.t told him quote  
your tulips are getting too much irrigation  they can't take that much water you know  
and that's all john remembers he blacks out  wakes up the next morning in his in his bedroom  
and uh finds out goes to the greenhouse to  investigate and sure enough he's surprised to  
see that his tulips are being over watered turns  out there was a leak in his irrigation system  
and uh the tulips were getting over water and so  apparently the et's advised him on this and uh  
told him that his ets were in fact being i  mean his uh tulips were being over watered  
another case from diane tessman occurred   in ireland in county temporary in  ireland this is on october 31st in 1990  
and the main witness's name is jerry and he's a  forestry worker now this area of county temporary  
is a beautiful area filled with all kinds  of really beautiful trees and it was jerry's  
job to watch over this forested area and uh while  he's out there on patrol he sees this very bright  
object come flying out of the sky and what looks  like uh aircraft accident that's what that was  
what he first thought was that an airplane  had actually crashed this object came down  
quite swiftly so he starts hiking towards where  he saw this object came down and is confronted by  
a strange looking humanoid it's a normal looking  human but has very long hair and is wearing sort  
of a weird jumpsuit and this figure told jerry  that the poplar trees in this area were very sick  
and then proceeded to give jerry a highly  detailed and scientific explanation on how to cure  
these popular trees and other trees of  various diseases so they spoke for some time  
at which point the men just suddenly walked  off into the forest later that evening  
jerry saw this object again zigzagging  through the sky and became convinced that  
he encountered an actual extraterrestrial who was  prescribing cures for various tree diseases and  
there were other independent witnesses at  least three who saw ufos on the same evening  
jerry was impressed enough that he went to  the dublin agricultural experimental center  
where he shared the knowledge that he was  given by this strange man in the forest  
so yeah there's more evidence that ets are very  interested in plants when someone's taken on  
board a ufo usually they're physically  examined perhaps perhaps they're shown  
hybrid babies or taken to the control room or  given warnings of some kind shown disasters  
but in some cases people are shown something  much stranger it might be the last thing you  
expect to see on board a ufo which is basically  a forest and this is what happened to raul manuel  
of belize this is a very early case uh the first  encounter occurred to a gent the main witness his  
name is raul manuel he was eight years old when  he had his first experience and this was in 1918.  
he was pulled up into a ufo typical ufo  he said it had metal walls corridors  
and finally he's being led around and taken into  a room and he couldn't believe what he saw and  
i'll quote here this is raul talking a door opened  and i walked into an area that was like a forest  
with trees and flowers he was shocked um he says  the et's uh were very short had dark slanted eyes  
white skin and white hair very much like a  previous case and uh they these ets wanted raul to  
help with uh studying and planting the local  native trees from this area of of bailey's  
so this turned out to be the first of  many encounters in which the ets would  
abduct raoul and then they would take him down  into the forest and raul would show him plants and  
here's raul talking again each time i went there  i taught them about plants i taught them as my  
grandfather had taught me about our medicine they  encouraged me to point out medicine plants in the  
forest they would gently dig them up under  my guidance and later i would plant them  
in their garden in the sky the garden contained  trees and plants from all over the world  
there were birds some had never seen vegetables  and fruits from all over the universe so yeah  
these are these ufos are in fact very much  like little arcs little noah's arks if you will  
where they're collecting plants of all kinds  and that case is not at all unique another  
case almost exactly like it comes from john mack  who interviewed a lady who he calls catherine  
and in christmas of 1990 catherine  was taken on board a ufo she was  
first given a physical examination she was then  taken to a room where she was shown hybrid babies  
but it was the next room that really shocked  her uh as catherine says and i'm quoting  
she says i'm confused but it's there it's in the  room and there's like trees and rocks and dirt  
and things off to the left i can see them from  where i am it was a full complete and totally  
natural pine forest smelled real it felt real  she said it was pretty large this room about  
the size of a high school gymnasium with curving  walls going upward on all sides and after being  
led through this forested room uh the ets led  catherine out of the ship and back to her home  
another very similar case occurred to a  family from malala oregon the twigs family  
who had repeated experiences that started out as  pretty scary abductions but evolved into a very  
unusual contact case in which the whole  family would be taken on board and visited  
with these mostly human-looking ets and these  ets had a very large craft in which they had an  
area which was devoted to plant life and i'll  just quote the twigs is here here's the twigs  
talking the vegetation on the mother ship for  the most part seems very much like the forests of  
evergreens here on earth specifically reminding  us of the black hills of south dakota although  
the trees are not as tall yet they do have other  plants that are not familiar to us like their fire  
bush a three foot tall bush in which a red liquid  courses through the almost clear branches from a  
distance its luminescent qualities and movement  make it appear to have a fire dancing across it  
there's also a tree in the shape of a giant banana  whose bark resembles something like the shape  
of a pineapple so yeah here's another  case with not only earth plants and trees  
but all kinds of different plants betty andreason  i've quoted her in a number of my videos and  
you won't be surprised to hear her saying  something very similar here in her case she was  
taken into a room which was a perfect reproduction  of a little pond in a forest in fact it was so  
convincing to betty that she initially thought  she was outside and as betty says and again i'm  
quoting here i'm in the woods i don't know how  i got here from there but i'm in the woods it's  
so green and beautiful and there's a pond right  there the water is so clear i can see fish there  
oh wow there's it's just loaded with fish loaded  all sizes of fish in there it's such a small pond  
too and i can see ferns and it's just so beautiful  she didn't see any sun or any um source of light  
but the whole area was evenly lit and quite bright  and as she's watching this beautiful scene the  
pond suddenly drains and this is when she realized  it's actually an artificial pond it's metallic  
and the ets explained to her very clearly that  they are saving our planet and all the plants  
and animals and people for that matter from total  extinction as betty says and this is her quoting  
he says that they are the caretakers of nature  and natural forms the watchers they love mankind  
they love the planet earth and they have been  caring for it and man since man's beginning  
they watch the spirit in all things man  is destroying much of nature they are  
curious about the emotions of mankind he's  saying that they have been collecting the  
seed of man male and female and that  they have been collecting every species  
and every gender of plant for hundreds of years so  that nothing will be lost when the last shall come  
so that's a pretty chilling message and  falls right in line with the many many   messages people have received of et's warning  of environmental and ecological destruction  
so that seems to be the purpose behind  this worldwide collection of plant life  
and it really goes beyond you know just collecting  plants and growing them on board ufos uh  
there's some very weird plant effects that occur  and i'd like to talk about a few cases like that  
this next case comes from researcher jacques  valet it occurred on august 2nd 1978 at developing  
concello italy and the anonymous witness saw this  ufo land in a field of grass the object left burn  
marks in the sort of strange jelly-like substance  on the ground and for two years no plants would  
grow where this object had landed then about  three years later in 1981 this area underwent a  
strange and unexpected transformation where where  this area where the ufo had landed became quote  
covered in moss and small cactus-like  plants that were not typical of the area  
so these were not necessarily alien plants but  they certainly weren't native and there's a  
number of cases just like this another case  occurred in corvallis oregon on november 12  
1973 a woman called the local newspaper the  gazette times to report what she thought was  
a crash landing of an airplane so local police  were sent to investigate and they found this large  
scorched area and not only that there was this  strange wild fungus that was growing there  
and what was very strange about it  is that the species were not native   and they were not only not native they were  oversized much too large than the normal fungus  
so that's strange another case i investigated  myself occurred in canyon country in  
california this is the santa clarita  area it occurred on november 16 1991 to  
a witness by the name of robert murphy an x-ray  technician who saw this ufo a red and black object  
kind of rectangular in shape hovering over the  fields behind his house he observed this object  
through binoculars for about 15 minutes before  it finally departed the next day he went out  
there to investigate and found areas where the  grash had been crushed but not only that he saw
you know a few months later this weird growth and  i'll quote robert here says robert there's a whole  
lot of growth new growth of wild onions i think  they're wild onions it's all breaking ground now  
coming through i was just wondering if heat  or anything could cause onions to spring up or  
something so while this growth is native to this  area it was very sudden perhaps even accelerated  
and in fact there are a number of cases  where ufos do accelerate the growth of plants  
one case again from researcher diane tess and  is a really interesting case this occurred in  
june of 1991 to a woman by the name of ita  in belfast ireland she was going to bed  
when she saw this ufo this object  hovering over her garden in her backyard  
she first thought it was a helicopter except there  was no noise and it was a very very bright light  
and her whole garden was just glowing with light  and it stayed there for about 10 minutes and  
she thought you know perhaps she was having a  religious experience she didn't realize what  
was happening until she looks out there and sees  that this object is actually spherical in shape  
and takes off straight up into the sky so she  goes to investigate the next morning and got a  
real shock it turned out that her garden had was  now the plants in it were much larger than they  
had been before this was a newly planted garden  and now looked as though three weeks or a month  
had passed and the plants were much much larger  in size and towering over her neighbor's gardens  
the neighbors were very shocked and asked her what  happened and here's what eda says and i'm quoting  
ita when people asked me what i did to my garden  this year i lied and told them i had a secret  
fertilizer because i didn't want the fallout of  people laughing about my ufo encounter so she kept  
it secret but yeah this is another case where ets  accelerate plant life and it's not the only one  
another case from researcher jacques valley  and bill murphy occurred in reading california  
in april of 1976 the main witness is jane kirk  jean was watching tv when suddenly her tv blacked  
out and looking outside her backyard she saw  this strange cloud-like object moving overhead  
the same time the neighbors the neighborhood  dogs began barking and this object moved off so  
in the months that followed where this object  hovered the weeds in the area began growing  
extremely fast and surpassing all the others  in size normally the weeds in this area would  
grow to a maximum height of about three  three and a half feet uh by april of 1977  
she says these objects i mean these  weeds had grown to an amazing height  
of eight feet and uh even the grass in this area  was growing about five feet tall and continued to  
grow for another year before finally stopping  another really interesting case occurred to  
the moore family or i'm sorry the james family  in colorado and this was in 1967 they were  
in their trailer uh and uh they had were in  colorado on their way to california actually  
and uh suddenly this object shaped like a child's  top but much larger hovered over their trailer  
and sent down a strong beam of  light which illuminated the interior  
and the next day the object hovered again over  the trailer and uh following this incident they  
couldn't believe what happened they had this  carrot that they were growing uh next to the  
window and i'll quote james here jerry james  jerry says something drastic and truly puzzling  
had happened to it to his carrot for the carrot  did not resemble a carrot any longer it had spread  
out as if having grown for weeks in a tempered  professional hot house roots were everywhere  
running outside the dish and reaching almost  to the floor now carrots are known for getting  
quite large but they certainly don't grow feet  overnight which is what happened in this case  
so yeah a lot of interest in plants on the  part of the ets and sometimes this transfers to  
abductees as well one lady i interviewed who  had an abduction experience during the topanga  
canyon ufo wave of 1992-1994 she was in her  home this is actually 1991 when this occurred  
when she had a visitation by an entity in  her bedroom who physically examined her it  
was initially pretty frightening but ultimately  she was not hurt and uh she visited james harder  
who hypnotized her and told her you know that  he does not believe ets are here to harm people  
so she takes a pretty benevolent view towards  all this but what's really interesting is she  
says she had a personality change following  this incident and uh i'll just quote her  
i'll just quote her about what happened and  how she changed as a result of this encounter  
says the witness i've become very much  involved in the environmental field   not necessarily politically  but on a personal level  
i'm not sure if this is tied into my own ut  experience which i now believe actually occurred  
i've had two visions that came as dreams the first  being to save seeds plant seeds so i've been doing  
that i've also become a total vegetarian although  i've been leaning in that direction for years but  
of all the fresh fruits particularly that i  eat i will save the seeds of grapes berries  
peaches plums anyway my plant my family thinks i'm  a bit nuts but that's okay i collect their seeds  
too don't throw away your grape seeds please i'll  take them she tells them and the second vision  
i that i had was to grow beans i'm going to become  a bean farmer before this life is over and i don't  
think those two visions are unrelated in the  experience i had i think they're somehow tied in  
so yeah another case that i think might be  related is a very famous case well known in  
the literature it occurred on april 24th 1964 in  tioga city to a dairy farmer by the name of gary t  
wilcox who saw a ufo land in his field as he  was spreading fertilizer and he approached and  
saw that it was a metallic object and there was a  number of strange-looking humanoids in black suits  
and uh it was a large egg-shaped object maybe  20 feet long 16 feet wide made of shiny metal  
and two small male humanoids we're standing next  to the craft dressed in seamless uniforms and  
uh each was carrying trays heaped full of earth  that appeared to have been removed from his field  
and so he ended up having a long conversation  with him they gave him some prophecies uh which  
a few of which ended up coming true and uh they  wanted some fertilizer that and we're interested  
in why he was spreading it in the field and he  explained what fertilizer was and so that it helps  
grow plants and so they asked him if he could get  a bag if if he could give them a bag of fertilizer  
so he went to get a bag of fertilizer and when he  returned his craft was gone he left the fertilizer  
there and when he returned the next day the  fertilizer was gone so yeah it's a strange case  
but he's got character witnesses his own brother  and other people and the case is pretty much  
considered a classic in the literature it's never  been uh proved to be a hoax or anything like that  
and fits in with all these other cases so yeah  this is this is pretty interesting stuff i did  
a study of these cases in my book not from here  volume two to try and figure out what's going on  
and yeah it just appears like betty andres and  said they're collecting various species of plants  
perhaps in a gent in an agenda to save  them from being destroyed or becoming  
extinct and that seems to be the agenda behind it  and yeah they're collecting species of all kinds  
and this matches up very much with their warnings  of environmental destruction and upcoming  
ecological collapse so for that reason i think  these cases are very important and people should  
know not only that we may be up for some very  rough times but that ets are collecting plants  
all kinds of plants because of it i think this  is also good advice for us and that we should  
start taking care of our planet for one thing  and everyone should start gardening themselves  
and becoming more self-sufficient so that we don't  have to go through hard times any rate that's what  
this video is about et is collecting plants from  all over the world and trying to save us from  
destroying our own environment that's it for now  thanks once again for watching and keep having fun
