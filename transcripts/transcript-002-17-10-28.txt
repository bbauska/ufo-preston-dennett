hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and I'm pleased to announce that my latest book inside 
UFOs has just been released it presents 10 all new cases of people have had extensive contact 
with UFOs we're gonna try and get through all 10 cases in less than three minutes.

Chapter 1 Kevin
The first chapter is about a man named Kevin. A Navy corpsman who is invited aboard UFO where 
he met 15-foot tall praying mantises who took him on a time travel trip it's an extraordinary case
chapter 2 is about a gentleman I call Taylor he's now a doctor he was a little boy his 

Chapter 2 Taylor
Mom sent him out to mail a letter and he instead had contact with friendly Nordic 
aliens and this began a lifelong contact with great Ike ET's. A really interesting case.

Chapter 3 Taylor
Chapter 3 is about a gentleman who is now a college professor. As a young boy he was 
delivering papers when the UFO came right down on top of them. He experienced missing 
time and some extraordinary after-effects as a result of his encounter. I think it's a very 
important case. 

Chapter 4 Jeannie
Chapter 4 is about a lady named Jeannie and she found out that she was having contact with a 9-foot 
tall grasshopper type ET. As well as gray type ET's. It's an extraordinary case. One of my favorite.

Chapter 5 Professor
Chapters is about a gentleman, a professor and writer who was driving along and had a UFO land right 
in front of him. Out stepped this handsome looking Nordic alien. It's a very interesting benevolent 
encounter with ETs. 

Chapter 6 Alien Outside Window
In chapter six the alien outside the window involves an office worker. A new mother who had just 
had a baby boy. She woke up to see a gray type ET looking through her window straight at her 
newborn son. It was a terrifying encounter for her.

Chapter 7 Two Greys
Chapter 7 is about a gentleman named Harry who's had some extraordinary UFO sightings his entire 
life. One of his very close-up encounters was with his wife. They were driving along the road and 
they came upon a UFO hovering right alongside the road. And there were two greys looking outside 
a large picture window right at them. Harry has had some of the most extraordinary Wow sightings 
of anyone I've ever interviewed. 

Chapter 8 Jim
Another one of my favorite chapters is chapter 8 about a gentleman named Jim who worked in the 
Navy as an electronics specialist. If you had an extraordinary sighting with several shipmates 
turned out to be much more than a sighting. He was contacted by ETs who taught him about alternative 
energy sources. It's one of my favorite cases in the book.

Chapter 9 Mary
Chapter 9 is about an amazing lady. A housewife and mother from Nebraska who became very sick and suddenly had an 
encounter in which she was taken to what appears to be an underground base where she was healed 
of her illness by a nine foot tall ET with orange spiky hair. It's a totally unique case.

Chapter 10 Kenneth
The tenth and final chapter is about a man. A medical worker named Kenneth. He's had extraordinary 
encounters, missing time, and face-to-face encounters with gray type ETs while fully conscious. An 
encounter in which the ETs explained exactly why they contacted him. He also experienced some very 
interesting after-effects so that's it Outro. That's my book, "Inside UFO's". I didn't quite finish 
within three minutes but I tried. Now you have a good idea of what's inside "Inside UFOs". Thanks for watching.
