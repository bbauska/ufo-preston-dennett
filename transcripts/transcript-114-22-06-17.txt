NEW MEXICO UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS
Jun 17, 2022

Summary:
Jun 17, 2022
There are many kinds of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face contact, onboard UFO encounters and more. But perhaps the ultimate type of UFO encounter is a UFO crash-retrieval incident. In these incredible cases, extraterrestrial craft and ET bodies are allegedly retrieved by military forces and secreted away in various military bases across the United States and the world.

The 1947 UFO crash at Roswell, NM is the most famous case of this kind, but it's not the only one. In fact, researchers have documented hundreds of similar events from all over the planet. UFO crash retrievals are far more common than most people think. The state of New Mexico alone has more than a dozen such cases.

This video presents ten cases of UFO crash retrievals in the state of New Mexico that you may not have heard of before. Moving beyond Roswell, Aztec, Corona or the Plains of St. Augustine (all of which are fairly well-known within the UFO community) -- we move to other lesser-known cases including:

--the 1945 UFO crash at San Antonio witnessed by two boys working at an isolated ranch.
--an incident involving the shooting-down a UFO at White Sands only days before the Roswell UFO crash.
--a UFO crash in San Miguel County in 1952 as witnessed by a young couple vacationing in the area.
--a crash in the deserts of New Mexico in 1953, coming from an anonymous Radar Specialist who claims to have seen footage of the crash and bodies.
--a UFO crash at White Sands in 1953 involving a craft that was recovered almost completely intact.
--a UFO crash in 1954 outside Walker AFB in which an officer (K.A.) was on a search and rescue mission and came upon a craft and ET bodies.
--a UFO crash in 1957 as reported by three military officers who investigated rumors of a downed aircraft and found more than they bargained for.
--a UFO crash in 1962 near Holloman AFB involving a 68-foot metallic disc piloted by two extraterrestrials.
--a UFO crash in 1963 along the highway near the small town of Santa Rosa, as witnessed by an X-ray technician who view the craft and bodies.
--a UFO crash in 1974 in the Manzano Mountains near the small town of Chili, as reported to APRO by an officer at Kirtland AFB.

It was only because of sheer luck and the courage of various whistle-blowers that these ten cases were reported to various UFO researchers. Likely these cases represent only the tip of the iceberg, meaning that there are probably dozens of other cases or more that the public does not know about in the state of New Mexico alone!

During the recent Congressional UFO Hearings in May of 2022, the U.S. government stated their desire to be truthful and transparent on the subject of UFOs and UAPS, and their desire to remove the stigma surrounding the subject of extraterrestrials. And yet, when asked if the U.S. military has ever shot at a craft, or if the military is in possession of any materials from a craft, they said, "no," and said that the stories of Roswell were mere rumors! Does this sound like truth and transparency?

No more cover-ups! No more lies! The time for truth is now! The subject of UFO crash retrievals can no longer be ignored or denied. The cases are numerous and come from many highly credible witnesses. UFO crash retrievals represent the cutting edge of UFO research and have the potential to prove the reality of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet to all of humanity.

NEW MEXICO UFO CRASH-RETRIEVALS: TEN TRUE CASES
my name is preston dennett welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal i call this 
episode new mexico ufo crash retrievals of course everyone knows about the roswell ufo crash in 1947 
and other very famous incidents around that time possibly the corona ufo crash 
the crash on the san augustin plains and definitely the aztec ufo crash 
but what many people don't know is that new mexico has many other crashes over a dozen in fact 
as far as i can tell new mexico leads the united states in the number of ufo 
crashes but there are literally hundreds it's not as uncommon as you might think 
and that's why i wanted to do this video i think ufo crash retrievals are one of the cutting edges 
of ufo research this really has the most potential i think for real pay dirt this is hard evidence 
there are enough whistleblower accounts to i think safely conclude that these are real 
cases and what i'd like to do today is present to you about 10 cases of ufo crash retrievals 
that come from the state of new mexico alone so that's kind of a lot and let's just get started 
and the first case i want to talk about has come to be known as the ufo crash at san antonio this 
comes from two gentlemen by the name of remigio baca and jose padilla who have co-authored a book 
about their experience titled born on the edge of ground zero living in the shadow of area 51 
Born on the Edge of Ground Zero
this is all about their being eyewitnesses to this ufo crash which occurred in august 
of 1945. and more recently the book trinity by ufo researchers jacques valet and paula harris 
revisits this incident which is now becoming much more well known so again this 
occurred in august of 1945 when two young boys again by the name of jose padilla and remigio baca 
JOSE PADILLA REMIGIO BACA
were working on the padilla ranch outside of san antonio when they stumbled upon a crashed ufo complete with live occupants and according to remijo bacca 
they were actually looking for a lost cow when they came upon this crashed ufo as he says 
what we saw was a long wide gash in the earth with a manufactured object 
lying cockeyed and partially buried at the end of it surrounded by a large field of debris 
we believe then and we believe today that the object was occupied by distinctly non-human 
life forms which were alive and moving about on their arrival minutes after the crash so they both 
approached the site getting quite close to it and according to them the area around this craft was 
littered with pieces of quote thin shiny material which reminded them of tin foil 
and in fact remigio picked up one of these pieces to examine and as he says it was folded 
up and lodged beneath the rock when i freed it it unfolded all by itself i refolded it and it spread 
itself out again so this is very much like the description of the roswell ufo debris and through 
a gash in the side of this craft remigio and jose observed the humanoid creatures moving in quick 
darting movements while making weird squeaking sounds that reminded them of a jackrabbit in pain 
and jose who was nine years old wanted to approach and examine the craft more closely but remigio 
was a little bit younger became afraid and as it was already getting late they returned home they returned to their ranch on their horses to tell the owner of the ranch 
a man by the name of faustino padilla what had happened and faustino agreed to check it out 
he believed it was probably a military experiment so he contacted state policemen eddie 
apodaca who agreed to help investigate and two days later faustino padilla 
and eddie apodaca returned with the boys to the site of the craft and once there however they 
discovered that this site had been swept clean of debris and that the beings of course were now gone 
however the large and nearly intact body of the craft still remained though it had been covered 
with dirt and debris as if to disguise it so this craft was quite large too big to move 
so after observing it for several minutes the witnesses returned to their rants 
and shortly later a man shows up at the ranch and said his name was sergeant avila 
and that a quote experimental weather balloon had come down on their property and he requested 
permission to remove one of their fences so they could bring in some heavy equipment to remove 
it and the owner of the ranch faustino padilla agreed and on august 20th a crane and a lowboy 
trailer were brought in and were used to lift the craft and carry it away the entire operation took 
A lowboy trailor truck was used to remove the craft.
about five days and was observed by the two boys from a secret vantage point up on their property 
and they watched as all the surrounding brute debris whatever was left was collected and then 
the large craft was lifted up onto the flatbed truck covered with a tarp and hauled away 
jose padilla says that they recovered some of the metallic debris which remained on the ranch 
for several years today they say only two pieces remain and both were sent for metallurgical tests 
which revealed that both samples were composed of what they believed to be aluminum dr smith 
who examined the samples said that the aluminum was not normal it has an unusually high percentage 
of carbon and that the metal itself has a very strange structure as remigio baca says and i quote 
there is certainly something unusual about that metal it apparently does not melt when subjected 
to the 2000 degree flame from an oxyacetylene torch for up to two minutes despite the fact 
that aluminum silicate would be expected to melt at about 700 degrees a blend of carbon 
aluminum silicate
and some other trace materials is used which dramatically increases the conducting power 
eliminating the resistance to electricity while the same time a transfer of heat takes place 
there appears to be the potential for heat shielding or computer chip manufacturing 
and again this is covered in remigio baca and jose padilla's book born on the edge of ground zero 
living in the shadow of area 51 and in the newly published book trinity it's quite an 
interesting case and by all accounts appears to be legitimate and is a very early crash in new mexico 
predating roswell by two years and again it's not the only one here's another report in which 
white sands allegedly shot down a ufo now this report comes from a gentleman by the name of c 
john kistner in some accounts his name is john andrew kistner and he is labeled 
as a republican state representative from las cruces new mexico 
WHO ISC. JON KISSNER (AKA JON ANDREW KISSNER) ALLEGED REPUBLICAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE FRON LAS CRUCES, NEW MEXICO, AND SOURCE OF UFO CRASH ACCOUNT FROM WHITE SANDS?
however i was not able to verify this and in fact there's no evidence at all that this man actually 
existed that i could find however this account is widely published in a number of sources so i 
include it here for what it's worth and according to kistner this was a crash which occurred only a 
few days before the roswell crash about a week on may 29 1947 at white sands proving ground 
and according to kistner radar technicians at white sands observed one or more unidentified 
radar targets hovering to the southwest of the white sands proving ground launch row 
and at 7 15 pm one surface-to-air missile with a 674-pound atomic warhead was fired at one of these 
radar targets and five minutes later the war had exploded at an elevation of sixty thousand feet 
meanwhile witnesses in las cruces including the editor of the las cruces sun news and 
his neighbors saw this rocket climb into the sky and move towards two star-like objects 
high in the sky and then explode and apparently this tactic worked following this explosion 
this target was tracked on radar moving south and 10 minutes later it impacted the earth 
about 30 miles to the south outside the town of juarez new mexico 
and also the missile itself impacted near there although us officials attempted to 
go to mexico and retrieve this object the town of juarez had already been closed off 
by mexican officials who refused to allow anybody inside the area and according to kistner whatever 
had crashed had been largely vaporized upon impact again this is widely quoted by many researchers 
including highly respected uh british researcher timothy good and the next incident i'd like to 
talk about i call the ufo crash in san miguel county and this comes from ufo researcher 
robert wood who has basically specialized along with his son on ufo crash retrievals 
UFO CRASH IN SAN MIGUEL COUNTY
and this fert case first came to light in an official declassified document from the afosi 
at tinker air force base which contained a letter written by a mr mclean of friona texas 
and in the spring of 1952 mr mclean who was a retired farmer and his wife both 
TINKER AIR FORCE BASE
residents of freona texas were camping in the mountains in the eastern part of san miguel 
county in new mexico and one evening they saw a dim light circling around up high they said 
this strange object performed a mile wide circle and was slowly descending and when it reached a 
low altitude it suddenly turned bright green and exploded quote showering lighted objects in all 
directions and according to this afosi document mr mclean said several of those fiery objects 
landed close to me most of them were buried in the ground but i gathered up three that were 
only partly buried and brought them home with me later he broke up open one of these strange 
objects and says quote in the center was a round hole or vacuum filled with a fine powder so he 
informed the pentagon who did not respond and he ended up writing a letter to senators lyndon 
johnson of texas and clinton anderson of new mexico and both senators did 
respond and ask that mclean sends samples of the material for analysis which he did 
and the report that came back to him came back as meteors now mclean says that he was later visited 
by a russian scientist who bought one of the objects from him and told mclean that the object 
was made of uranium and other materials so mr mclean was later contacted by ufo researchers 
and he changed his story saying that he had not actually seen the objects fall to earth despite 
what this document says and he said that he had found him while driving through the area he also 
said he never sold anything to a russian scientist but did remember being visited by an individual 
from the russian consulate in amarillo texas who expressed an interest in these samples so 
this case like many ufo crash retrieval incidents doesn't contain a whole lot of other information 
but bob wood who studied this case writes and i quote more than a half century on and with 
the key player in this case long departed this event remains intriguingly unresolved
the next case i'd like to cover comes from researcher leonard stringfield who is very well 
known for studying ufo crash retrievals in fact he's really the first major researcher other than 
perhaps frank scully who took ufo crash retrievals seriously and focused on them almost exclusively 
and this crash occurred in an undisclosed location in new mexico and how it came to light was a witness contacted leonard stringfield 
and said that he was a radar specialist who had actually viewed a film of this ufo crash 
according to this gentleman 1953 when he was only 20 years old he was a radar specialist 
at fort monmouth in new jersey and while stationed there he was given a secret security clearance and later he and a small group of radar specialists were summoned 
to view a special 16-millimeter film at the base theater this is what he told leonard stringfield 
and this witness who is anonymous says that the film opened with a desert scene 
and immediately apparent according to stringfield was quote a silver disc shaped object embedded in 
the sand with a domed section at the top at the bottom a hatch or door was open 
at this point the scene in the film shifted to show a group of 10 maybe 15 military personnel standing around the craft which appeared to be quite small about 20 feet 
in diameter the hatch itself appeared to be about in three feet tall and one and a half feet wide 
the film then showed the interior of the craft which had only a quote panel with a few 
simple levers and muted pastel colors the scene shifted again in this film to show three dead 
e.t bodies on tables inside a tent and as leonard stringfield writes the witness 
mr t said the bodies appeared little by human standards and most notable were the heads all 
looking alike and all being large compared to their body sizes they looked [ __ ] he 
thought with small noses mouths and eyes that were shut he didn't recall seeing ears or hair 
ET Drawings from files of Budd Hopkins
the skin he said was leathery and ashen in color each wore a tight fitting suit in a pastel color 
at this point the 16 millimeter film ended without any credits it was only about five minutes long 
and seemed to the witness mr t to be filmed by an amateur at this point the officer in charge 
told the radar technicians to quote think about the movie and don't relate the contents to anyone 
the witness obeyed did not tell anybody not even his wife however shortly after viewing the film 
two top security officers told him that a ufo presumably the one he viewed in this film 
had been shot down in new mexico somewhere in new mexico in 1952 it was two weeks after viewing this 
film the witness was approached again by an air force intelligence officer who told him quote 
forget the movie you saw it was a hoax so years later mr t revealed his account to researcher 
leonard stringfield at that time he was no longer employed by the air force and instead 
RESEARCHER LEONARD STRINGFIELD
he held a highly technical position in civilian life and as leonard stringfield says and i quote 
considering the credibility of my informant i believe he saw the movie and describes the 
subject matter to the best of his recollection regarding the subject matter he believes that 
the crashed craft and the dead bodies were bona fide it would have been difficult even by a major 
hollywood studio to have made dummy bodies look so real for use in an otherwise so makeshift film 
so this does appear to be your standard typical gray type ets with the large heads 
and the grayish skin hard to say for sure but it's another case of a ufo crash in new mexico 
that is not well known and there are many other and they all seem to circle around white sands or 
that general area certainly this next case does which involves an apparent ufo crash 
at white sands and this comes from researcher todd zechel todd zetchel is best known 
UFO CRASH AT WHITE SANDS, NM
for being one of the co-founders of the citizens ufo group citizens against ufo secrecy cause 
again i tried to verify todd zechel's identity 
definitely he was one of the founder founders of the citizens ufo group which was quite influential 
and quite active for many years however i could not find a single photograph of him out there and 
i did find out that he was at one point employed by the military as an intelligence officer 
which could be why his identity remains somewhat hidden at any rate it's a very interesting case 
and according to researcher todd zetchel an anonymous army helicopter pilot who served as 
an aide to an air force general totem told him that a crash saucer of ovoid shape 
was about 18 by 30 feet in diameter and had four four foot tall bodies of 
ets in it and that this object was retrieved near white sands in 1953 and then was later shipped 
to langley air force base in virginia and according to the witness air force personnel found 
the craft in perfect condition with the doors wide open all four occupants were dead though no cause 
of death could be found the bodies were reportedly hairless but otherwise very much human looking 
because of his association with the general the witness along with him the general viewed the bodies and the craft inside the craft they were puzzled 
because there was no visible means of controlling or propelling the craft they were also shown three 
other ufo craft that had been recovered and these craft were about 25 feet long and 13 feet wide 
according to the witness despite many years of intense research leading scientists have been 
unsuccessful in discovering the means of propulsion of this recovered craft 
so this doesn't re this case does not rest solely on todd zetschel in 1977 researcher 
richard hall spoke with the anonymous lieutenant colonel who confirmed the incident and said that 
he had seen four of these bodies at langley air force base in virginia and was told 
that they had been quote recovered from a crash in 1953 near white sands new mexico 
so this case has been widely quoted not only by richard hall by leonard stringfield and his 
status reports and of course by ufo researcher robert wood the next case i'd like to talk about 
is a ufo crash at walker air force base and this occurred in 1954 and again comes from researcher 
leonard stringfield who interviewed an anonymous witness who goes by the initials k a according to 
stringfield in early 1954 ka completed his basic training at samson air force base in geneva new 
york he was then immediately sent to walker air force base near roswell where he began quote 
special training in the sikorsky h-19 helicopter in relation to desert search and rescue operations 
ka told researchers fred schaefer gerald misker and linda robinson that on the evening of april 
12 1954 he and his crew were told to launch a search and rescue mission for a crash in 
the deserts of new mexico this was published in leonard string's field status report number three 
and according to springfield the crash site was located about 25 miles away 
from walker air force base out in the desert wilderness and according to ka and i quote as we 
flew overhead at an altitude of about 40 feet we could plainly see below us the outline of a round 
silver object at this point the stranger in the cockpit gave the order to turn on the spotlight 
when the light was turned on we saw below us a round metallic saucer-like object 
approximately 40-50 feet in diameter the craft appeared to have crashed edgewise into the sand 
according to ka there were four small bodies each about four and a half feet long dressed in 
dark blue tight-fitting uniforms scattered outside the craft each of which had quote extremely large 
heads which were out of proportion with the rest of their bodies ka was ordered to photograph the 
bodies which he did though he was not allowed to approach any closer than 40 feet he says that an 
overpowering stench came from the bodies which caused one of the ground crew to actually vomit 
he talked to another member of the ground crew who learned that there were two more bodies inside the craft after photographing these bodies and the craft ka was then removed from the scene 
and the next three days says ka were a quote living hell 
he says he was interrogated for three days straight regarding the incident being alternately 
asked what happened and then told that he did not see anything and one day after finally 
being released from interrogation he was flown back over the crash site which appeared as if 
it had been quote gone over with a fine toothed comb and one of the interrogating intelligence 
officers told him see i told you guys that you didn't see anything of course rumors on the base 
were that the crafting bodies had been recovered and secreted at the base and later ka's superior 
accused him of having leaked the incident which he denied ka was then accused of going awol 
and was summarily dismissed from the air force having served for less than four months 
according to ka the stories about the movie in the movie hangar 18 about crashed ufos 
stem specifically from this incident as the craft itself was allegedly stored in hangar 18 
after which it became top security and according to ka and i quote no one but top brass 
could enter or leave the area k.a says that the hangar was totally reconstructed 
he was able to speak with one of the construction workers who told him that it was expanded 
quote to a height of nine stories and a depth of 11 stories and that heavy equipment and large 
computers were also installed ka also heard that another ufo crash occurred only a few weeks later 
on april 24 1954 near bandelier new mexico and after speaking with researcher leonard stringfield 
ka continued to receive threats and warnings not to talk about his role in this incident 
k.a says he has suffered from nightmares ever since this ordeal occurred and he and his wife continue to fear government reprisals so i think this is a reason why probably 
what we're hearing about ufo crash retrievals is really just the tip of the iceberg this is a very 
serious situation people have lost their lives for coming forward and this goes to show that 
there are far more ufo crashes than we realize in our government does in fact have these materials 
these craft these bodies in their possession there are so many of these incidents being reported 
another case comes from ufo researcher robert wood and this one is a ufo crash 
at clovis new mexico this is a small town and in the summer of 1957 possibly 1958 an anonymous 
former air force officer was traveling through new mexico when he heard that a crash of some kind 
involving an unusual aircraft had occurred at a ranch about 30 miles southwest of clovis 
at the time he was in the military and he was intrigued so he and two of his air force buddies 
decided that they would trek to the site in hopes of examining this craft and upon arrival they saw 
numerous military vehicles in the area and that this area was scattered with small pieces of quote 
unusual lightweight wreckage so here again we have echoes of roswell long before roswell had 
become public and this witness and his friends could see evidence that quote something large 
had hit the ground however before they had a chance to examine the area and get closer 
he and his friends were approached by military personnel and were ordered to leave and remain 
silent about the incident so there you go another incident and there's another one 
not long after that involving an apparent ufo crash not far away at holloman air force base 
UFO Crash at Holloman
and this report comes from long-time researcher robert d barry ufo researcher 
Robert D. Barry (UFO Researcher)
for many years and would lecture on this topic and according to robert d barry 
on june 12 1962 officials at holloman air force base tracked a ufo that appeared to be 
having flight difficulties across two southwestern states and when this object came over new mexico 
military jets were set up to intercept it at this point this craft which was described as circular 
seemed to lose control and began to descend and moments later it impacted bottom first 
into the sands at an estimated 90 miles per hour and according to robert 
d barry and i quote this craft was 68 feet in diameter and 13 feet in height typically circular 
two beings were discovered inside the craft and they were 42 inches in height 
each being was dawned in a one-piece suit that contained no buttons or zippers 
this is certainly what we hear in all the other accounts researcher kevin randle also 
looked into this case and reported on it and according to kevin randle the craft was dull 
Kevin D. Randle (UFO Researcher)
aluminum in color and had skidded for a distance on the ground leaving a trench 
according to robert d berry's source he said that the heads of the ets were abnormally large 
the eyes larger than normal with small thin lips and only an ear hole for an ear their skin color 
was a grayish pink and the creatures were believed to have died upon impact they were immediately 
removed and placed in a secret location for study they certainly do sound like your typical greys 
the craft the witness learned later was allegedly an exploratory craft 
it was also removed and taken to a secret location for study and robert d barry's source writes that 
only 20 individuals were actually involved in the retrieval and investigation and that three of them 
had actually died according to kevin randle this craft was taken back to holloman air force base 
with sections of it being distributed to los alamos and other research installations 
leonard stringfield also wrote about this in his status reports and he writes quote there are more 
and stronger data concerning the 1962 mexico crash which are not publishable at this writing and 
stringfield never did reveal this data but did say quote the 1962 crash site was near holloman air 
force base in new mexico and that this incident is known by an astronaut who prefers anonymity 
there you go another crash and here's another very intriguing case which comes from abduction 
researcher the late bud hopkins this is a very unusual incident which occurred in the small town 
of santa rosa new mexico and the main witness is an x-ray technician who allegedly goes by the name 
of beanie or his nickname bd and this occurred in early 1963 when this anonymous medical technician 
was working in a hospital in the small town of santa rosa she was not a registered nurse but 
it was her job to do x-rays and ride with the patients in the ambulance this was a very small 
hospital with only one doctor and a few rooms because the town and the hospital were so small 
things were usually very quiet and slow and therefore when the accidents occurred they were considered big news and generate generated considerable gossip for weeks afterwards 
but this particular incident was different it started out normally when the hospital received 
a call from the town's only police dispatcher that there had been quote a crash with fatalities 
so beanie the main witness and the ambulance driver raced 18 miles from the hospital 
to the scene of the accident and when they arrived there were two police cars and two state troopers 
on the scene and on the ground there were three bodies each three and a half feet tall 
and very badly burned and the witness assumed that they were children and asked the state trooper 
where are the parents and this state trooper replied enigmatically i don't think they have 
parents this is something unusual we have here and she asked him what is this and he said 
i'm going to have to notify the air force i don't know what this is so this witness 
from bud hopkins is still thinking this is children but she's 10 feet away from the 
bodies and looking at this vehicle which is right there she sees quote a pile of wreckage of metal 
it was about the size of one or two cars so she bent down and checked for signs of life 
with her stethoscope and found no sounds of life thinking that they might possibly still be alive 
she and the ambulance driver quickly put the bodies on gurneys and loaded them into the ambulance and she said that when she did this the bodies oozed some kind of brownish colored fluid 
they returned to the hospital and the witness immediately took the bodies to the x-ray room and x-rayed them she was eager for the doctor to examine them because they looked so strange 
with very thin bodies and very large heads which reminded her of photos she had seen of children 
dying of famine in africa so the doctor came in and after examining the bodies pronounced 
them dead and he started filling out the reports and signing the necessary paperwork 
at which point an air force colonel stormed into the hospital and demanded that the bodies 
be removed he then according to the main witness beanie proceeded to remove quote every single 
thing he could that bore on this trip and he asked the witness do you have any notes 
she said yes and he took them away he unhooked the x-rays which were hanging up on a wire drying 
she said you can't take those they're still wet and he replied i'm taking the x-rays 
after removing the bodies and everything associated with them the air force colonel and his associates descended upon the ambulance and retrieved the evidence from there and according to 
bud hopkins who interviewed the main witness the air force took every single thing they could out 
of the back of it the sheets any objects anything movable cleaned out the whole thing she said we 
were never paid for anything so after removing all the evidence of the event the air force colonel 
approached the witnesses and threatened them not to talk saying quote this did not happen 
you are never to speak about this and remember this the government has a long arm according to 
the witness and again i quote what was so strange was that whenever we had a fatality a wreck 
a crash we would all be down in the cafe going over the details and talking about it as it was 
a big event in our area but nobody ever mentioned that there was some kind of understanding or fear 
not to mention it i have no idea what it was we had there of course she is now convinced that 
these bodies were not human and that they had become unwitting participants in a ufo crash 
retrieval this witness remained silent for years but finally contacted ufo researcher bud hopkins 
who revealed the details of this case in the 2003 ufo crash retrieval conference in laughlin nevada 
researcher kevin randle looked into this case and he had some doubts about it because apparently the 
main witness uh said that there were two bodies when initially she had said three 
but bud hopkins of is of course absolutely convinced that this case 
is legitimate and even if it's not there's always another one to take its place 
this next case occurred in the manzano mountains i call this the manzano mountains ufo crash 
The Manzano Mountains UFO Crash
and this comes from a researcher from afro their aerial phenomena research organization 
his name is r c hecker and this incident allegedly occurred on may 17 1974 at around 10 22 p.m 
an anonymous gentleman who worked at kirtland air force base's east manzano labs was monitoring 
Kirtland AFB
electrical scanning instruments and saw that the sensors had observed an unexplained burst 
of energy in the range of 250 megahertz this blast was so intense that it threw all the instruments 
off scale and the source was quickly traced to an object in a certain location in the earth's 
upper atmosphere a trajectory was plotted which showed that this object had just descended 
down to the east side of the manzano mountains about 30 miles southwest of albuquerque 
this employee later learned that this object had allegedly crashed just outside the town of chile 
new mexico a team was sent to locate the object which was immediately surrounded and cordoned off 
and within hours this object which was described as metallic circular and about 60 feet in diameter 
was dismantled and secretly moved into an unidentified hangar at the base and according 
to rc hecker who interviewed the gentleman who worked at the space he writes and i quote 
this individual has given me leads to sightings in the past which have always proved valid 
after being told of this incident i was stopped by a man who identified himself as a kirtland air 
force base officer and he ordered me to forget everything i had been told about this incident 
so this is another case that has been fairly widely written about in the ufo 
literature by kevin randle by timothy good and others so it appears to be a legitimate case 
and as can be seen new mexico has an enormous number of ufo crash retrieval incidents 
and it is apparent that our government is lying about this and they do in fact not only have 
material from other worldly vehicles as was insinuated by the pentagon but have the actual craft and the e.t bodies and that people who pursue research in this area or 
who are whistleblowers are doing so at their own risk just considered what happened to clifford 
stone who is a well-known proponent of ufo crash retrieval incidents sergeant clifford stone had 
investigated many crash retrievals and was a vocal critic of the military policy regarding ufos and 
on june 21st 1987 a news article about clifford stone's research appeared in the roswell daily 
record and according to clifford stone immediately following the publication of this article 
Sgt. Clifford Stone
his supervisors at the new mexico military institute where he was assigned at that time began 
to treat him differently his efficiency ratings which had always been excellent began to receive 
lower scores he's he was relieved of his position as an administrative non-commissioned officer 
and was assigned to a low-level filing position he was then sent to fort bliss for 
a psychological evaluation which found that he was in fact normal but the harassment continued 
and on february 1st 1988 clifford stone filed an affidavit with the fourth rotc 
region inspector general alleging that he was being wrongfully forced to retire from the army 
army officials have refused to comment on his case but clifford stone said that he believes that 
officials are displeased with the fact that he has sent numerous letters to new mexico's republican 
senator pete dominici questioning various ufo incidents so he still remained a vocal critic 
Senator Pete Domenici
of the government and an advocate saying that ufo crash retrievals do in fact happen so those are 
the cases from new mexico that i wanted to present to you today again i didn't talk about roswell 
or the aztec crash or the other ones surrounding that i already covered them in my youtube episode 
the top 20 cases in new mexico but as you can see new mexico has an awful lot of ufo crashes 
it's hard to account for these where there's smoke there's fire and it's clear that these are 
not the only ones i've written a number of books about various states and they occur these crashes 
in pretty much every state i've researched i wrote about these cases in my book ufos over new mexico 
UFOs Over New Mexico
and i think it's clear from these eyewitness testimonies that these cases do in fact occur and judging from the fact that this information is so very vigorously 
and ruthlessly covered up we can safely assume that there are many other cases like these 
that we never hear about it appears that our own government is neck deep involved in this subject 
has the material and is lying about it just recently in the congressional hearings they were 
asked about whether or not they had material from other worldly vehicles and they flat out said no 
so i think that's probably a lie we are still at this point relying on eyewitness testimony while 
there are is allegedly some of these materials in the public arena this remains quite controversial 
but i still think that ufo crash retrievals are one of the cutting edges of ufo research 
the one that has the greatest potential to actually prove the reality of ufos and the 
alien presence on our planet and that's really why i wanted to do this video for you today 
i hope you've enjoyed it i want to thank you once again for watching i truly appreciate it until 
next time keep searching for answers keep digging for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
