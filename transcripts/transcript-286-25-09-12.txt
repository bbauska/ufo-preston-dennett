Summary:
Sep 12, 2025 (1:08:44)
The extraterrestrial presence on our planet has reached a point of undeniability. The vast number 
of reports of metallic craft and humanoids speak for themselves. In the past 100 years alone, there 
have been millions of documented cases coming from across the world. This video presents ten 
firsthand accounts involving close-up encounters with humanoids of many different kinds. The 
humanoid cases represent the heart of the UFO phenomenon. Most researchers agree that they 
represent a superior intelligence and a more advanced technology than that of humans. For 
these reasons alone, these cases are of tremendous importance to all humanity.

A TRIP TO UNKNOWN PLACES. December 9, 1954, farmer Giovanni Aquilante of Gricignano D’Aversa, 
Italy went missing. Two days later, he reappeared with an incredible story to tell. He said he 
had encountered two small humanoids who had lifted him into the sky. He couldn’t remember much 
of what happened to him and came back confused and traumatized. He was also healed of a serious 
bone disease.

TWO BEINGS APPROACHED US. On the night of July 10, 1965, a couple was motorbiking in the forests 
outside of Ganserndorf, Austria when a large disc-shaped craft hovered overhead and landed in a 
nearby field. They approached on their bike, but the engine failed. Walking on foot, they were 
shocked to see two tall humanoids in uniforms observing them. Shortly later, the ETs returned to 
their craft and flew away.

LITTLE MEN OF GREAT LEARNING. On September 10, 1965, Antonio da Silva was in his farm fields in 
Pau Ferro. Brazil when two small silver discs landed nearby. Two little men about 3 feet tall 
emerged and approached Antonio, speaking a foreign language. Antonio was terrified but said that 
the men seemed very friendly. After a short meeting, the little men returned to their craft and 
departed the area.

THE SING-SONG ALIENS. On July 17, 1967, a group of young children were playing in the fields outside 
the small town of Arc-Sous-Cicon, France. One of the little girls was shocked to encounter four 
little men in black suits. She ran off. Soon another witness saw and heard the beings. Afterwards, 
strange marks were found in the field and over the next two nights, a wave of UFO sightings hit the 
area.

SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY. On the night of September 25, 1967, a young, engaged couple 
was driving through the hills outside of Sant Feliu de Codines, Spain when their headlights 
illuminated a strange figure in the road. They described it as short, fat, green, with long arms 
and thick legs. It walked directly in front of their vehicle, so close they almost struck it. The 
couple drove off in fear.

I THINK THEY TRIED TO TAKE ME. On the night of March 17, 1986, farmer Rito Melgarejo was walking 
home in Santa Ana, Argentina when a flying saucer hovered and then landed in front of him. He was 
paralyzed in fear as two small humanoids in jumpsuits emerged. They spoke a strange language and 
used hand signals to persuade Rito to come onboard the craft. Terrified, Rito turned and ran.

DO YOU BELIEVE IN ALIENS? One night in Fall 2008, Valerie woke up in her home in Breezewood, 
Pennsylvania to see a strange praying mantis reptilian humanoid standing by her bed. She was 
unable to move as the being told her telepathically that it wanted to borrow something from her 
and promised to return it. Valerie protested. Moments later, it departed, leaving Valerie with a 
strange mystery.

YOU WILL KNOW IN TIME. Late on the night of August 24, 2013, Shawn was alone at Lake Arcadia in 
Edmond, Oklahoma, when he saw a strange glowing object moving underwater in the lake. Suddenly it 
shot out of the water. He soon saw a huge craft hovering nearby. Moments later, three tall human-like 
ETs appeared, and one of them had a message for him. Shawn had missing time and woke up two hours later.

I NEVER ONCE FELT AFRAID. One night in Summer 2020, two young men saw a strange craft over Laramie, 
Wyoming. A few weeks later, one of the men was in his bedroom when a strange paralysis gripped him. 
Coming through the ceiling he saw three grays. One of them connected with him telepathically, 
providing a download of information, leaving the witness with more questions than answers.

THE STRANGEST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD. On the night of November 24, 2024, Oscar stepped out of a 
rented home in Monterrey Nuevo Leon, Mexico to get some air. A strange man approached. Oscar was 
shocked to see that the man had unusually large eyes, no visible ears and extra-long fingers. When 
the man began to communicate telepathically, he realized that the man was probably not human.

These ten cases share remarkable similarities that appear consistently in humanoid reports. They also 
show unique details of high strangeness that raise many questions about extraterrestrial contact. 
Only by continuing research will we come to a consensus about the nature and origins of the UFO 
phenomenon.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
Today I'm going to be talking about one of my favorite aspects of UFO research and that is humanoid 
cases. The title of today's episode is I met an extraterrestrial 10 firsthand face-toface encounters. 
There are so many of them far more I think than most people realize. I've got 10 cases today that 
are really spectacular because in these cases, people got a really good look at these humanoids. 
They were literally face to face with someone that was clearly not from around here. All different 
types of humanoids. I think you'll find it really fascinating. 

I've got cases from all over the world, including Austria, France, Italy, Spain, as well as Mexico, 
Brazil, Argentina, and three from the United States, including Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming.
These cases range quite a long period of time. The earliest is 1954, and the latest is 2024. I think 
you'll find them really fascinating. So, let's just get started. 

First case I want to talk about I call a trip to unknown places. This one took place on December 9, 
1954 in Grecigno Diversa, Italy. This is a very small town. This case received almost no publicity 
at the time it occurred, but it eventually got a lot of publicity because it's a very unusual case 
and one of the earliest apparent onboard cases. This amazing case first appeared in newspapers, but 
has been reported on by several major Italian researchers such as Roberto Pinati, Pao Fiorini, and 
Ombberto Telerico. It is in fact widely considered to be Italy's first case of alien abduction. The 
primary witness is a peasant farmer by the name of Giovani Aqualanti. He was 57 years old at the 
time of his encounter, not 100 years old, as has been mistakenly reported in several versions on 
this case. 

Giovani was wellknown and respected by his neighbors. It was on the rainy morning of December 9, 
1954 that Giovani left his home in the small town of Grecano Dava, Italy. He was going to work in 
the fields as he always did every morning. But when evening arrived, Giovani did not arrive home. 
So his family was concerned and his two sons, Andrea and Paulo, set out to search for him. Unable 
to find him, they alerted the police. But a search failed to find any evidence of Giovani. So the 
next morning and throughout the day, Giovani's family and others continued the search. But again, 
they could not find the missing man. As the evening ended around midnight, Giovani's sons, Paulo 
and Andrea, and another relative, were returning home after searching for Giovani all day and most 
of the night. They had just about reached their home when the three men were petrified to see two 
very oddlooking figures with phosphorescent eyes hiding behind a low wall in the field next to them. 

After just a few seconds, Andrea, the younger brother, dashed towards the two figures, but by 
the time he reached the wall where they were hiding, the figures had mysteriously disappeared. So 
that's unusual. Now, on December 11, the next morning at 6:00 a.m., exactly 48 hours since Giovani 
was last seen, Giovani returned home. He was shocked and hungry, but not tired, he said, despite 
the fact that it had been raining continuously for two days. Giovani's clothes were mysteriously 
perfectly dry, and so were his shoes. His wife and two sons immediately bombarded him with questions. 

But Giovani was in such a state of shock that he was unable or unwilling to answer. But it was a 
few hours later that one of Giovani's relatives finally got the story from him. Giovani said that 
on the morning of the 9th, he had just left the house and was passing by the villages railroad 
bridge, as you can see here, when two, he called them dwarves, emerged from behind the bushes. 
Per Giovani, they had quote, faces the color of fire. He said they had very shiny eyes and wore 
clothes with quote colors like the rainbow. They spoke to him in an unintelligible language, then 
grabbed him by the hands and he said, lifted him up into the sky. 

Now, from this point, his memories become somewhat confused and disjointed. He said that at times 
these dwarves would become giantsized, but would then shrink back down to dwarf size. He said that 
they made him walk continuously, but that his body was so light that he never got tired. He said 
that they took him on a trip to quote unknown places. At some point, he flew through the sky with 
them again and they deposited him right next to his house, somehow communicating to him that they 
would return one day and come back for him. Now, Giovani's family says that Giovani was never the 
same after this incident. They said he lived in constant fear that quote, "They might come back to 
get me." He was perpetually confused. He had difficulty speaking. And in fact, he stuttered from 
that time onward. One interesting and significant detail that is left out of most of the accounts 
on this case is that before the encounter, Giovani suffered from a painful bone disease that caused 
him enormous discomfort and pain. 

But after the encounter, the bone disease had completely disappeared. This case received only modest 
publicity, but again would later become fairly wellknown. And in fact, after his encounter, Giovani 
earned the nickname Giovani on the moon. He lived for about 20 more years before passing away in the
early 1970s. Now, this case did take place during the tail end of a massive wave centered mostly in 
France, but also in surrounding areas and definitely in Italy. In fact, in December of 1954 alone, 
there were three other cases involving humanoids in Italy. 

For example, on December 4th, a waiter from Casel Dara in Italy reported his sighting of a circular 
object which had landed in a pasture about 150 ft away from him, 50 m. He said it was blue in color 
and had symmetrical glowing red port holes. He said a very tall figure emerged from the craft, at 
which point he retrieved his rifle and fired two shots at the being. Immediately, and not surprising, 
the being returned to the craft. At that point, there was a strong wind and the craft took off. 

Another case occurred on the morning of December 11, 1954. The very same morning that Giovani 
Aqualanti was returned to his home. This case involved an 11-year-old girl by the name of Nanda 
Frasenetti. She had left her home in Cassina, Italy, and was walking to school in the morning when 
she says she saw a cylindrical or kind of cask shaped object sitting in a field and glowing with 
intense light. She said it had a window on the side, and through the window she could see a small 
person staring out at her. The object disappeared pretty quickly, leaving behind a strong odor. 
And at the site of the UFO landing, five holes were found in the ground with the one in the center 
being the deepest. Turned out other people in the area also reported seeing apparently the same UFO. 

And it was just two and a half weeks later on the morning of December 30th, 1954 that a gentleman by 
the name of Petro Trusardi was at Clusone, Italy when he says he heard the rumble of a motor and 
looking up saw a strange object flying at very low altitude. He said it stopped and hovered about 60 
ft up 20 m. And he saw that it was brasscoled, spindle-shaped, and had what looked like three 
motionless propellers on the top and the bottom. One end of the object did have a transparent cockpit 
inside of which he saw two short olives skinned humanoids wearing helmets and black jumpsuits. He
said he was so shocked and afraid that he almost fell to the ground. But then the two little men 
smiled at him. The craft took off at high speed. Pro says, "The beings didn't do anything to harm
me." That case is so interesting to me in so many different ways. These ETs, of course, are described 
in very unusual ways. They're changing sizes. I very rarely hear that, but it is not unique. What's 
also interesting to me is that there are multiple witnesses. The main witness's sons also saw these 
humanoids and the guy was missing for two days. That is very unusual. It's unfortunate he doesn't 
remember more about what happened to him. But what's also interesting is this is apparently 
Italy's first so-called alien abduction. I think that alone makes this case particularly important. 

But now let's move to the next case which I'll bet you have never heard of. I certainly haven't, but 
I found it to be a pretty interesting case. I call this one two beings approached us. This is on July 
10, 1965 in Gansernorf, Austria. This is a multiple witness case involving two witnesses and I think 
it's an important case because it really illustrates the electromagnetic effects that can occur when 
people get very close to a UFO. This case is quite brief but still very interesting and it is provided 
by the firstand witness, Mr. Herb Brett Schneider, who sent in his testimony to a popular UFO magazine. 
Again, this is a good example of a UFO affecting a vehicle's engine. It was 10:15 p.m. on the moonlight 
night of July 10, 1965, as Herb and his girlfriend, Miss Hanzi Schroel, were traveling by motorcycle in 
a forested area near Ganzernorf, Austria, when they had a very close-up encounter with a discshaped 
craft and humanoids. 

As Herb says, "it approached us floating at a level of 5 m, that's 15 ft, slightly inclined until it 
landed 100 m away from us and 30 m away from a high power electric line. I started the motorcycle 
and approached". Now, per Herb, the craft was glowing with intensely bright white light. But once
the witnesses got about 40 meters away, 120 feet from the craft, the engine on the motorcycle went 
dead and the headlights went out. They proceeded to back up and at 50 m, 150 ft, the engine turned 
back on as did the headlight. So apparently there's a force field right around this craft which 
affected the engine at precisely 40 m. The witnesses then decided to approach on foot. As they got 
closer, the intense light coming from the craft dimmed, which allowed them to see two humanoids
looking at them and moving closer. 

As Herb says, two beings could be seen approaching us, their left side illuminated by the moon, their 
clothing tightly on their body in a dark color in a seemingly floating gate. We receded since we hadn't 
any flashlight with us. When we reached our motorcycle, we turned on the big road light and saw that 
the figures were approximately 1.8 to 1.9 m tall. That's just under 6 feet. And as Herb says, they 
then stopped observing us. After some seconds, they turned and nolessly returned to their machine, 
which was nearby, floating above the ground. Slowly, I followed them on the motorcycle. When they 
reached the machine, we could see when they inclined forward a bit, disappearing beneath. I turned my motor
off, and we could now hear a buzzing sound like that of an electric motor with a pitch rising to a higher octave.

The disc rose easily to a height of 5 m, inclined itself, and flew back to the
point from which it had come. There it changed its color to a whitish blue, seen well against the dark sky, and then
with a big speed, it vanished in seconds from our view. I think in most respects,
that's a fairly typical case of a UFO landing, humanoids coming out, briefly
greeting the witnesses, and then getting right back into their craft. There's countless cases like this. It's really
interesting type of behavior that to me makes me wonder if this is really more of a display than anything else. Sort of
introducing people to the idea that we are not alone. Certainly worked for
those two witnesses. All right, let's move to the next case. 

This one is super fascinating. I call this one Little Men of Great Learning. This occurred on
September 10, 1965 in a little village called Pao Pharaoh.
This is in Brazil. This is technically a single witness case. So, there are some
corollary witnesses, some sort of corroborating witnesses who didn't see the humanoids, but definitely had reason
to believe that something unusual was going on. This case is so interesting, I
think, because it shows how ETSs are concerned and trying not to scare people
while at the same time definitely trying to make contact. This amazing case of a UFO landing with humanoids comes from
Dr. Walter Buer and was published in the Brazilian publication soad Brazila de
estudos so discos voadores. In other words, the Brazilian society
for the study of flying saucers. This is an issue number 54. The witness is a
farmer and caterer by the name of Antonio Pa Pharaoh Dasilva. With on the
morning of September 10, 1965 that Antonio was out in the fields of his farm, which is located at a little
village called Pao Pharaoh in Peramuko, Brazil. was 8:30 a.m. and he was about 300
meters from his house, 900 feet, waiting for his wife to bring him a cup of hot coffee. So when he heard rustling in the
corn behind him, he turned around expecting to see his wife, but instead he saw two metallic discs shiny like
aluminum, making a high-pitched hissing sound and causing a gust of wind. These
saucers began to lower themselves simultaneously to the ground about 8 m away, 24 ft at a lower elevation since
he was standing on a hill. The sound coming from the craft became lower pitched. Antonio was absolutely
terrified by the sight of these two craft. He wondered if he was having a vision, if God was punishing him, if an
atomic bomb was being dropped and he was going to die, or it was the end of the world or something. So, he was quite
frightened. He steadied himself with his garden hoe in one hand and grabbed a
cashew tree in the other. Now, no sooner had the saucers reached the ground when
they immediately rose back up again, hovering about 5 m or 15 ft high, and
Antonio could now see the bottom surface of these saucers was slightly concave.
He estimates that they were about 1.5 m wide and 60 cm thick. That's not very
big. About 4 and 1/2 ft by two feet. He said as they rose up, what he described
as quote rootlike appendages seem to retract into the craft. Now, immediately
below where each craft head landed were two short humanoids just under 1 meter
tall. He estimates about 2 and 1/2 ft. Still frozen with fear and shock, these
two little men approached him. But apparently seeing that he was in a state of extreme fear, they turned around and
walked back beneath these two saucers which were still hovering in place. Now reaching that point, they looked over
their shoulders, glancing at Antonio in a very friendly way, and they then
turned around and began to walk towards him again, but this time with a much slower and gentler pace, and in fact
they stopped and were admiring the wild tomato plants growing between the rows of corn. One of the little men picked up
a tomato, showed it to the other little man, and spoke in some sort of foreign language, and then dropped it on the
ground. Antonio could not understand the language, but he said it reminded him a little bit of Japanese. These two little
men then walked right up to Antonio and he asked them what they wanted. The men
did not answer, but just smiled at him. But Antonio could now see that these two little men looked entirely human. They
had very smooth, flawless tan skin with no wrinkles. He said it did look a
little strange, almost waxy, but he said they were very friendly, or as he says in his own words, "They were well-built
with good ears, and the impression was, they were fine people. Those little men were of great learning. Nevertheless,
they didn't make fun of me." He said that they were clearly adults, not children, although their size was very
much similar to his four-year-old daughter, again, 1 m or 3 ft high,
coming up to about his knees. He was too shocked and aruck to really pay
attention to their clothing. The only thing he could say was that it was one piece and tight fitting. Now, at this
point, the men turned around again and approached their respective craft. Antonio thought to himself, "Are those
the much spoken of flying saucer men?" At that moment, the men turned around again and approached him for a third
time. Very briefly, they then returned to their craft, which lowered down, scooped them up somehow, though Antonio
couldn't say how because the steepness of the terrain blocked his view. And
these craft flew away again, making a sound that rose in pitched and caused a
gust of wind. After the craft left, Antonio was astonished. He grabbed the
tomato that one of the beings had dropped. He picked it up and ran over to the home of his neighbor, Oligario Guier
Dar Rosha. Oligario immediately saw that his neighbor and friend was shaken and
pale. Antonio actually handed him the tomato. He was in such a state of shock
he couldn't stand. He sat down on the ground and explained what had just
happened. Now, both of these men were later interviewed by UFO researchers, including Walter Beller. During this
time, two other witnesses actually came forth, a woman named Unice and a girl
named Ivanilda. They were both in the area at the time and said that at the exact same time
that Antonio had his encounter, they both heard a quote strange noise, but
they were unable to see where it was coming from. This case was published in several magazines and Walter Beller says
that when he interviewed Antonio, he was still trembling with fear. How
interesting is that? There's several different aspects to that case that I found particularly fascinating.
Mostly how these ETs approached very slowly at first, went back and then approached again, clearly concerned
about how the witness was reacting to them. I also found it interesting how he described these ETs as being very much
humanl looking only 2 3 feet tall so quite small just an absolutely
fascinating case and now let's move to another one which did get a lot of attention at the time it's very well
confirmed it's a multiple witness case there are landing traces as well I think
you'll find this one fascinating I called the singong aliens this occurred
on July 17th 1967 in a beautiful picturesque little
village in France called Ark Succon. It's an amazing case. This case comes
from French researcher Joel Minard and was published in several magazines such
as Phenomenon Spacio and Lumiere Donui and Flying Saucer Review and several
others. And at the time it occurred, it was also published in local newspapers and featured on radio, so it got quite a
bit of attention. There are several witnesses to a number of strange events involving very unusual humanoids. It was
about 300 p.m. on July 17, 1967 as a group of young children left the
small picturesque village of Arsu Sikon, not far from the border of Switzerland
to go for a walk through the fields just north of this town. This town is tiny.
It has about 700 inhabitants. One of the children was 5-year-old
Patricia Bipa. She was about 20 m or 60 ft ahead of the other children when to
her shock and fear she came upon a group of three or four very short humanoids
which she described as little China men dressed in black. She said that they were hiding behind a bramble bush and
upon seeing her one of these little men stood up and per Patricia attempted to
grab her. Needless to say, she was terrified and she immediately turned around, screaming at her companion that
she saw something strange and ran straight back home as fast as she could to tell her parents. Now, the next
person to notice something strange was one of the boys in this group, a 10-year-old boy by the name of Msie
Ravier, who noticed what he first thought was smoke, but later described something more like a glowing vertical
beam of yellow light going upwards. Meanwhile, his sister Joel Ravier, age
15, was back in town when Patricia came running and screaming. So Joelle and her
friend Marie Ren Muol went running off to where the other children were. This
was about 300 to 400 m away from the houses, less than a fifth of a mile. The
other young children stood back while Joel went to where Patricia had seen the
little man. Arriving at the spot, she saw a strange little creature running
from bush to bush at extremely high speed, moving its legs much faster than
any human. She described this creature as 1 m tall, 3 feet, black or wearing
black clothes. And per Joel, this being wore a short jacket or a vest which
seemed to float behind him as he ran. This little man had a protuberant belly,
very short legs. She couldn't tell if it had arms or not, nor was she able to
make out its face. Now, when it disappeared behind a bush, Joelle, this
time accompanied by her friend Marie Ren, approached the bush, and they could both hear a voice talking in a strange
singong fashion. And this scared them both enough to cause them to retreat and join the other children. Now, later,
adults inspected the area. They did not see the humanoids, but they did find a
dozen very peculiar dry yellowed marks in the otherwise green grass field.
These stained areas were warm to the touch and also gave off an odd odor.
None of the adults had ever seen anything like it, they said, and they could not attribute it to the cows which
roamed the area, so it was a mystery. 5-year-old Patricia was really too young
to describe her encounter in much detail. But 15-year-old Joelle was held
in high regard by those who knew her and providing some possible confirmation of
her encounter. That evening, two astronomers at the observatory in Bessan
Khan, a short distance north of the village saw a quote luminous round
object which after remaining stationary for 30 seconds over the horizon, made
off towards the south and vanished at high speed. This was followed by a flurry of reports of glowing objects by
people all across Europe, both from the night of the 17th and the 18th. And in
fact, on July 19th, a 12-year-old boy from the village says he saw a bright
glow in the forest just outside of town, which lasted for a long time. So there's that's pretty good confirmation. And
there was more. On May 22nd, 1967, less than two months earlier, in the small
town of Avle, France, about 16 kilometers away from Arsu Sikon, a Msur
Tur, a 45-year-old teacher says he was driving outside of town when he saw a
craft shaped like a quote upturned soup plate. He said it glowed with a yellow
green light. Here's a drawing of it. It's clearly a solid craft about 20 m
wide by 2.5 meters tall. This is 60 feet by 8 feet. This craft proceeded to move
over his head no more than 20 m 60 ft high. It moved in silence, but as it
passed overhead, Mr. Tro could hear a quote crackling sound. Two months later,
around the same time as the Arsu Sikon encounter, most of the residents of the
village of Ava observed a strange machine hover for a full 3 hours over
the village. And these are just a few of the many, many cases that occurred around that time in this area. How
interesting is that case? I mean, you have all these kids who are witnesses, and while only a few of them saw the
actual humanoids, there were landing traces. And the wave of sightings that night and the next few days, I think
really lends a level of corroboration to the initial sighting. Also super
fascinating is the description of the humanoids that these children saw, which is definitely not one I've heard often,
if ever, but it's a fascinating case on many levels. And so is this next one
which I call something unusual and extraordinary. This is another multiple witness case which occurred on September
25, 1967 in Santelu de Codinz, Spain. Uh this encounter
occurred while the two witnesses were driving. But what's fascinating to me about this case is how closely the ET or
the humanoid resembles the case I just spoke about in France. This one is an
unusual one. This case first appeared in the March 1971 issue of the Spanish UFO
magazine Stend, but was later published in a number of other magazines. It
involves two witnesses, Mauricio Weisenthal and his fiance Maria Rosa
Font was on the evening of September 25, 1967.
The engaged couple had spent the day with Mauricio's family. But when evening arrived, they began the drive to their
home in Barcelona, Spain. It was around 9:30 p.m., a warm, clear night, as they
traveled along regional road 1413 between the small villages of Sir
Safajia and Selu de Codinz. Curiously, this area had recently
experienced a series of unexplained fires which were being blamed on a quote
mad arsonist. The couple was just a few kilometers outside of the village when
suddenly the headlights of their car illuminated a small glowing green humanoid figure emerging from the
shadows on the right hand side of the road. It at first appeared to be walking in a ditch alongside the road. Mauricio
estimated it was about 120 m ahead of them, 360 ft, but surprised by the site.
At first, he didn't say anything. But a few seconds later, Maria Rosa shouted
out in fear, "Look!" They were approaching this figure very quickly, and as they got close, they could see
that this was definitely humanoid, walking like a person. And suddenly, it
walked right in front of their car, straight across the road. And as their car was almost upon it, it began to walk
faster at a diagonal. And at this point, they could see that this was a humanoid creature. It was right in front of their
car. They both felt a mixture of fear and disgust at its very unusual
appearance. In fact, they were so close to this being as they drove past it that they were afraid they might have
actually struck it with their vehicle. They said it was about 70 cm tall. It's
about 2t 3 in. It had an egg-shaped head, no visible neck. They really only
saw it in profile. They did not notice any eyes, nose, or mouth, but they did
notice that its arms were abnormally long, and that it either had very large hands or had something in its hands. It
was swinging its arms as it crossed the road, but never turned its head. It had very large feet, short, thick legs, and
it also had a very fat stomach, and very large buttocks. They weren't sure if the
creature was naked or if it was wearing a skin-tight suit like those worn by scuba divers, but whether it was skin or
clothing, they did see that it was phosphorescent neon green and very satiny, shiny. It was in view, they
said, for quote, eight very long seconds. This filled them with fear, so
they did not stop, but raced away at high speed. And upon arriving home, they
shared their experience with family and friends who were somewhat skeptical and suggested that perhaps they had seen a
very large badger. Something, of course, which both Mauricio and Maria Rosa
vehemently disagreed with. Both insist that they did not see an animal, but saw
something out of the ordinary, something unusual and extraordinary, something inexplicable and definitely humanoid.
Interestingly, only two months earlier in some distance to the south, one evening in July of 1967,
a lady, the daughter of the Count of Reeves, was asleep in her home in the Balieric Islands. This is located about
5 kilometers from Palma de Malora when around 300 a.m. she was awakened by a
powerful light coming into her bedroom from the interior courtyard. Looking out
the window, she says she saw two child-sized figures who appeared to be talking to each other. There shouldn't
be anyone in there at that time, so this frightened her. Also, they had an enormous head, perhaps with a helmet on
and very large eyes, so definitely not normal figures. Frightened, she tried to
wake up her sister-in-law, with whom she shared a room, but curiously her sister-in-law would not wake up. She
then tried to turn on the light, and it wouldn't work. So, she went to fetch some candles, but by the time she
returned, these little beings were gone. And of course, now the room light worked fine. The next morning, they did find
two strange, unusual marks near the window, which had to be scraped off to be removed. The ultimate result of this
encounter was that the young woman remained bedridden for 3 days, and from that point forward, she refused to sleep
alone. That case does raise a lot of questions. It's funny to me that the witness's family decided to explain this
encounter away as badgers perhaps when obviously this wasn't badgers. It's
interesting that there were all these unexplained fires going on in this area at that time. Not sure there's any
connection there, but it's enough to make you wonder. Also, the other humanoid cases in this area, rarely are
these events a one-off. There was no direct UFO con connection with that
couple who was driving down this road and saw this green skinned humanoid. But
it wouldn't surprise me if there was a craft there that other people didn't report because as we know most people do
not report these sort of events. And you may be skeptical of it but
there's always another one to take its place like this next case which I call I
think they tried to take me. This one occurred on March 17, 1986
in Santa Ana, Argentina. And this case, if there's any in this compilation that
you've heard of, it's probably this one because it did get considerable publicity. It's a really fascinating
case. Technically a single witness case, although again, there are some outside witnesses, some really well-confirmed
landing traces. And this one is just a fascinating case. physiological effects,
a really interesting interaction with the witness and these ETs. Really unusual ETS as well. Within a few days
after this next incident occurred, it began to appear in newspapers and magazines and it got a lot of attention.
The witness is a farmer by the name of RTO Melgarejo on the evening of March
17, 1986. He had visited a group of friends to play cards at one of their homes in Santa Ana delos Guacaras. This
is in Corientes, Argentina. They played late into the evening. Rto
lived some distance away in a place called El Mangal due to the many mango
trees in the area. It had rained heavily that day. The ground was wet with many
large puddles. It was prone to flooding. It was around 1 or 2 a.m. Rita was
walking home and he had almost arrived when suddenly he was confronted by something amazing. Now, he had never
gone to school or read anything about UFOs. But when he saw a light moving towards him from behind a small hill, he
thought at first it was a plane, but then it quickly approached and became much brighter, and he realized he was
seeing something quite unusual. As RTO says, I saw a very powerful light
illuminating me completely, so much that I could clearly see my shadow on the
ground. It was a very bright object which practically fell on top of me and stopped on the ground about 10 m away. I
didn't know what the thing was. I was really scared. My head started hurting and I couldn't move because my legs were
cramping. So E estimates that this craft was about 6 m wide and 4 meters high.
That's 18 feet by 12 feet. It had landed very quickly in a large puddle in the field he was crossing. And as RTO says,
when the object descended into the water, it made a noise like someone splashing, like ducks paddling. Now
before RTO could react, a door opened in the craft and two humanoids stepped out.
He estimated that they were about 1 meter tall, just over 3 feet. And RTO
describes what happened next. As he says, "I saw two little creatures, two
big-headed dwarfs about the height of a six or sevenyear-old quickly exit the
device. They looked like small Martians. They were like us humans, only tiny.
They undoubtedly looked human. They had black hair cut like military personnel.
They were wearing some kind of dark uniform, tight fitting. One of them spoke in a language I couldn't
understand, was not Spanish. They made a noise like a broken radio. He spoke very
fast. He made hand signals that looked like something in a circle, but I told
him I didn't understand. Right then and there, I felt my waist to see if my knife was in place. It was going to be
difficult for them to take me. All I could manage to say was that I didn't know anything. They were making signs to
me as if they wanted me to come closer. I froze and at that moment I felt a kind
of cramp and tingling all over my body. I wanted to run but I could not even
move. One of them signaled with his hand as if calling me. I told them I didn't understand anything, nor did I want to
understand anything. I couldn't see them well because of the bright light because I was dazzled. I was terrified. Then I
thought they wanted to take me and that's when I got scared. I was astonished and afraid. I didn't look at
it much because I was afraid that they would take me and then never bring me back again. These beings spoke among
themselves, turned around and got into the device. I turned around and tried to get home fast. Now Rito again had the
impression that the UFO occupants were gesturing to him to quote, "Get on board
and go for a ride." So he turned and ran, and when he looked back, he saw that this craft was now up in the sky
already and quickly receding off into the distance. And as RTO says, after
that, I was lost in the field for a few hours because I became disoriented and
didn't know how to return. I tried to return home, but I was bewildered and disoriented. I walked in the countryside
until 400 a.m. when I was able to reach my house, which wasn't very far away,
about 1,000 meters from where I was. Now, arriving home, his wife, Maria Magdalina, was shocked at her husband's
appearance. She was skeptical at first, but after she saw him, she realized
something had happened to him because, as she says, he was almost crying and very nervous. He was terribly scared.
Following the encounter, Rito suffered from a very bad persistent headache. As
he says, "I've had a severe headache that hasn't gone down. Nothing will relieve it, and if it continues like
this, I'll have to go to the doctor." This was 3 or 4 days after the incident. And his wife confirms this and says,
"The cramps have gone away, but not the headache, which is still intense." Now later upon returning to the site where
this craft had landed, RTO and other researchers saw that all the water was
gone and there was a 6x4 meter oval mark of burned yellowed grass. This is about
18 ft x 12 ft. And within the circle were the remains of a deceased eel which
looked almost as if it had been desiccated by the heat from this craft. Even days after the event, this eel
showed no signs of decomposition or odor. There were also three marks on the
ground which appeared to be made by the landing legs of this craft. They were 6 cm in diameter, 2.3 in, and 10 cm deep,
3.9 in. Outside of the landing traces, the grass was healthy and green. So, you
can see the landing traces here. Many photographs were taken. It's very well verified. Eventually, Rito's headache
did go away. However, one month after his encounter, he did lose sight in one
eye. Though investigators could not definitively link this to his experience, nor by his own admission
could RTO, as he says, I don't know if it has anything to do with what happened to me. The only real lasting impact was
emotional. As RTO says, in town today, this is almost 30 years later, they
still know me by the nickname UFO, but it doesn't bother me. I know very well
what happened to me. Honestly, it was something very strange. And to this day,
I remember it as if it were yesterday. At first, many didn't believe me. But
later, when they saw the prince, and many people came from all over to investigate, they agreed with me. The
first person to see the footprints, the landing traces, and believe everything I said was my neighbor, Don Filipe Sosa,
who has since passed away. He also saw light that moved around at night in those days. Now, RTO admits that he now
spends a lot more time looking up at the sky, afraid and wondering if these beings might one day come back for him.
And when he thinks back to the incident, he says, "I think they tried to take me." I really like that case. The
witness is so obviously sincere. He was so close to these ETs. There's no
possible chance of misperception. I also thought it was interesting. He describes them as being very much humanl looking
but just tiny little men who came out of this craft uh and apparently tried to
take him but he wasn't having it. Just an amazing case as I think all of these
cases are like this next one which I call do you believe in aliens. This one
occurred one evening in the fall of 2008 in Breezewood, Pennsylvania. This is a
single witness case, but it's so fascinating because there's an event which occurs during this encounter that
I have never heard before. nor do I think I've ever heard a description quite like this witness says of this
type of ET. So, there's a lot to unpack with this particular case. This case was
reported to MUN by an anonymous witness. I'll call her Valerie. That's a pseudonym. She provided her firstirhand
testimony of her very unusual encounter. It was around 400 a.m. one evening in
fall of 2008 when she woke up in her home in Breezewood, Pennsylvania to go
to the bathroom. As soon as she got out of bed, this is when she saw a strange
humanoid in the room with her. And as Valerie says, "When I reached the foot
of the bed, I made eye contact with a short black entity and immediately was
in its hold emotionally, mentally, and physically. I knew instantly when I saw
it that it was an alien creature, but not a typical gray like you read about or see in the movies. The creature was
about 4 feet high and was totally black and stood like a human shape, but its
face looked similar to a preying mantis, and some of its skin looked like reptilian. It had dreadlockike thick and
long hair. It also looked like it had a black reflective chest plate. I am not
sure if that was part of its natural body or some kind of armor. The creature had huge black pools for eyes, and it
spoke to me through telepathy. So at this point, Valerie was unable to move. She could only stand in place. Valerie
at the time was wearing a necklace that she loved and cherished as it was a gift
from her daughter who had purchased it for her when she had visited the pyramids of the sun and moon in Mexico.
This was a silver necklace holding a round pendant. And this pendant had an image of a warrior on one side and a
pyramid on the other side. was composed of multicolored materials encased in resin. This is important because what
the creature did next was both surprising and shocking to Valerie. As
Valerie says, the creature held out its arm and hand towards my neck, and the
necklace I was wearing floated out towards its hand. It was still clasped
around my neck. It told me through telepathy that it wanted the necklace. I
answered back through telepathy that I did not want to let it take the necklace. And she explained why to this
entity that it was a gift. As Valerie says, the creature told me that it just
wanted to borrow the necklace and promised to bring it back. I continued to protest through telepathy, but the
necklace floated off my neck and into the creature's hand. It did not even have to undo the clasp. It just floated
off with ease and no pain to me. During my encounter, I felt like the
being had a great deal of control over my emotions and thought. I still felt a
shock and horror and despair as it took my necklace, but my heart never raced at
all. I remember seeing a side view of the creature, and I saw it from the other side of the bed. The thing looked
very scary and menacing, but it was not mean to me other than to upset me by
taking my necklace. I do not remember anything else. I woke up and remembered
what happened and reached for my necklace, but it was gone. I scoured my room for the necklace for weeks, but did
not find it on the hardwood floor or anywhere in the room. And in fact, Valerie enlisted the help of her
daughter to search for the necklace over and over. But despite searching for it everywhere over a period of weeks,
including both sweeping and vacuuming the hardwood floor, the necklace was nowhere to be found. was a few months
later. Valerie's boyfriend was sleeping over and she decided to tell him what happened. She started by asking him, "Do
you believe in aliens?" And he replied, "Yes." So she shared her story of this
alien encounter and the missing necklace. And he replied, "Maybe you
cannot find it because you are looking for it with your eyes." That baffled her and she said, "What is that supposed to
mean?" He told her, "Just get up and reenact what happened that night." And
as Valerie says, "So in the dark room, I walked to the foot of the bed where I
had met the creature and reached down and there was the necklace on the floor. I was totally blown away. Apparently, as
the creature had promised, it had returned the necklace." Valerie is not sure if anything else happened on the
night of her encounter, but admits it's possible as she has had a lot of quote strange things and quote a lot of high
weirdness happened to her for as long as she can remember. As Valerie says, but
this is the only time I can consciously remember actually seeing an unknown entity. I would like to have
hypnotherapy sessions to see if more details and information can be dug up from my consciousness. Now, this area
does have a history of UFO encounters. It was just one year earlier at 11:30
p.m. on May 27, 2007. A witness was sitting outside his
Breezewood home. It was a cloudy night when he noticed a light shining through the clouds, eventually revealing itself
to be a discshaped craft, as you can see here. As the witness says, the light
grew brighter and brighter until it became almost as bright as the moon. As it dimmed out, it began to move slowly
to the northwest. 20 minutes later, at 11:50 p.m., another green light
appeared, heading north. This object slowly pulsated, dim, then bright, with
a bluish glow as it brightened. Now, the investigator to this case writes, "The
most interesting aspect of this sighting is the picture that the witness drew depicting what he saw. The witness's
drawing and verbal description certainly indicate that he saw an unconventional
craft. Definitely a unique case, but it's interesting to me because there are
other cases where ETSs have taken a personal possession of of a witness and
then later returned it. I mean, that happened to Betty Hill. She had one of her rings taken and later found it on
her table. There's a number of cases like that. I know the exact same thing happened to another witness I
interviewed personally. She had a ring taken and then it was later returned. So, I'm not sure what's going on with
this, but certainly a fascinating aspect to that particular case, as well as the
unusual description of this ET, which she couldn't decide whether this was reptilian or perhaps praying mantis or a
combination of both. A fascinating and unusual case. And this case is also very
interesting. This next one which I call you will know in time. This occurred on
August 24, 2013 in Edmund, Oklahoma.
This apparently is a multiple witness case. Other researchers have looked into it. It's a little bit controversial, but
I think there are aspects to it that really ring true. You can make up your own mind about it, but this is an
apparent encounter with missing time involving humanlooking extraterrestrials. This case has not
been formally investigated, but it has caught the attention of several researchers. It comes from an anonymous
college student, I'll call him Shawn, who provided his firsthand written testimony of his experience only 3 days
after it occurred. At the time of his encounter, Shawn was a member of his college fraternity, and they had just
finished having a back- to-school get together with other students along the shore of Arcadia Lake, which you can see
here. Some of the students had been partying, but Shawn had been selected for the responsibility of ensuring that
nobody drove home while intoxicated, and he also had to make sure that the campsite was cleaned up and in good
shape following the party. So, as he says, as a result of my duties that
night, I was completely sober and had not been drinking or using any drugs.
So, he was finishing picking up all the trash and was putting it in his truck. And this is when he had an odd impulse,
which marked the beginning of his very unusual encounter. It was now 1:00 a.m.
on August 24, 2013, when, as Shawn says, I had this strange urge to look at the
lake. The best way to describe that feeling was as if I had been daydreaming. There was nothing unusual
going on. Then all of a sudden, there was a bright glowing light under the water. At this particular distance, I
couldn't tell exactly how large the circle was, but it was big. The shape was circular and had a light green
yellowish glow with occasional pulsating red and blue lights. I stared at it
dumbfounded as it was moving slowly under the water, from one side of the lake to the opposite side. The object
moved from one side and back to the other two or three times for about 5 minutes. Then it stopped almost near the
center of the lake. The object glowed brighter and brighter, then shot straight out of the water and into the
sky. So shocked and frightened by this unusual sight, Shawn immediately reacted. as he says. I turned around and
ran as fast as I could to my truck. Once I got to my truck, I stopped and fumbled
around in my pockets for a couple of seconds, looking for my keys. And seemingly out of nowhere, a bright light
appeared suddenly above and behind me. I turned around to see what was behind me,
and there was this giant ship. It wasn't saucer-shaped like everyone talks about,
but it had more of a cake shape. It hadn't landed, but just hovered about 20 to 30 feet off the ground for a couple
of seconds, then shot back up into the sky. Now, it was at this point that
things went from very strange to truly bizarre because, as Shawn says, I turned
back to my truck door and tried to unlock it when I caught something out of the corner of my eye. I jumped back
against the side of my truck. About 15 ft away stood three people staring at me
that had not been there prior to the incident. There were two very attractive women and one very tall man that was at
least 10 ft high. All of them had blonde hair that was almost white and blue
eyes. They did not say anything to me directly, but I heard one of the woman's voice in my head. Speaking
telepathically, this woman said, "Shawn, please do not be afraid. You have an
important role to play if you would like to help us." So Shawn replied out loud in a shaky voice, "Okay, but I don't
know how." The woman replied, "Don't worry, you will know in time." Now, what
happened next is a very common feature in close encounter cases like this. As Sean says, right after she said that,
everything went black. Eventually, I woke up around 2:30, lying about 30 feet
away from my last remembered position at the side of the truck. So, Shawn was now
missing about 1 and 1/2 hours of time. He decided to report his encounter to
both Muon and Newfork, writing, "I know you're probably thinking that I am
crazy, but it did happen." Now, incredibly, there does appear to be another witness to this case who
reported it to New Fork one day after Shawn. I'll call this other witness
Jamie. It was the same night, August 24, at the same time, 1:00 a.m., but Jaime
was apparently on the opposite side of the lake. As the witness says, I was at
Lake Arcadia around 12:31 in the morning fishing for catfish out of this old Juan
boat. There was absolutely no one else on the water. The only other people that I saw out there that evening was a group
of 12 to 15 people around a fire on a campsite on the opposite side of the
lake. Believe me, you could tell and hear that they were there. However,
there was no one at that site for a while before the sighting. I was getting ready to leave when about 60 to 75 yards
behind me, a giant bright and glowing light appeared under the lake's surface.
It was fairly large and had a light green color to it with a rhythmic flashing of red and blue lights. Then
the light began moving from the western side of the lake's shore to the eastern side and back to the other side a couple
of times. Then it stopped almost near the center of the lake. At that moment,
it grew brighter and slightly larger, then shot straight up in the air and into the sky and seemingly disappeared
for a couple of seconds and reappeared, hovering right over the campsite that I mentioned earlier and disappeared again.
Then it reappeared again, maybe a minute later, and shot up into the sky and went out of sight, and I never saw it again.
Now, here's where the story gets even more interesting, as Jaime decided to go investigate. As he says, "I drove my
boat over to this site where the craft was hovering as fast as I could get there. However, I did not recognize
anything out of the ordinary. Just a white Ford truck with several bags of trash in the bed and a couple others
sitting beside it. I did not see anyone by the truck or in the immediate area.
So, it appears that Jaime arrived right after Shawn blacked out and was experiencing missing time, presumably
being taken on board this craft. Now, efforts by various researchers to locate
these witnesses or confirm these encounters have yielded no results. I do
find that case quite credible. There are certain details that the witness describes that I think really ring true
to me. how he described this feeling of almost like he was having a daydream. I've heard that sort of thing. People go
into a slightly altered state of consciousness sometimes when they're having an encounter. And the message he
got from these apparent extraterrestrials, it's just an amazing case. It is
interesting to me that it was reported almost immediately to both New Fork and
Muon that the other witness did the same thing. I wonder about that. But again,
you can make up your own mind about it. And it's a fascinating case on multiple
levels. And again, there's always another one like this next case, which I
call I never once felt afraid. I've never heard a case quite like this one.
This one, at least for the first part, does have multiple witnesses. But in
many respects, this case follows the pattern I see in quite a few cases.
Starting with a sighting leading to a much closer encounter and a really
interesting aftermath. This one occurred one evening in the summer of 2020 in
Laram, Wyoming. This next very unusual case begins with a sighting was late one
summer evening in 2020 that Kurt, that's a pseudonym, and his roommate decided to
take a walk. They lived in the northern section of Laramie, Wyoming, and were heading south towards downtown. And
that's when Kurt looked up and saw something strange. As he says, I looked
into the sky and saw a large black object shaped like a jelly bean concave
side down. It was dark, but I could clearly see the edge of the object because it was reflecting the lights
from the city and the sky. It traveled slowly and silently eastward. After a
few seconds of observing the object, my roommate, unprompted, pointed into the
sky at the object and said, "Do you see that?" I responded, "You're seeing that,
too?" We now both watched the object float silently through the sky for a few minutes until it disappeared behind a
cloud. Now, that seemed to be the end of the encounter, but it proved to be only the beginning because it was later that
summer that Kurt was alone in his apartment. was around 10:30 p.m. and feeling tired, he retired to his bedroom
and lay down in bed. He was going to put on his pajamas and go to sleep. But before he could, something very strange
happened. As Curt says, I decided to sit up and get off the bed, but found that
my limbs were very heavy. I could not lift my body up off the bed. So, I
slumped back down onto the bed and immediately noticed a small blackish dot
in the middle of the ceiling above me. As soon as I noticed the small black dot, began to expand until it was a
shadowy circle about 3 ft across. It was transparent but dark, and I could still
see the ceiling through the circle. I realized that I was now fully paralyzed,
but I never panicked, which I find strange. I remained calm. When the circle stopped expanding, I stared at it
and suddenly noticed three humanoid tall gray figures waist up approaching me
through the circle. I could not see their facial features because the circle acted like a tinted window. Next, the
central and taller figure extended a beam of green light from the center of its forehead into the center of my
forehead. I remember being excited to have the experience at that point and
never once felt afraid. As soon as the green beam of light disappeared, the
dark circle shrank and also disappeared. So Kurt was stunned. Ever since he was a
little kid, he had always been interested in aliens. He had never seen a UFO or had any strange encounters, but
he had always wanted to have an encounter, but never believed it would ever happen to him. Immediately after
this experience, he had a pretty interesting reaction to it. As Curt says, I stayed up all night after that
encounter, filled with physical and mental energy. I furiously wrote down
every single thought that came to my mind for the next 5 to 6 hours, hoping
to uncover some kind of psychological artifact that the entities may have left in my mind. I poured over my notes that
night for weeks afterward and never found anything of importance. All that I
wrote was several drawings of indecipherable symbols and long rambling
paragraphs about quantum physics, aliens, technology, and the future of
humanity. So unsure what to make of this experience, he later speculated that perhaps it had all just been just a
bizarre waking hallucination. But four years later, in 2024,
this experience still had not left his mind, and he began to wonder if it might all be real. His friend had recently
told him about his own encounter while camping in Colorado. And this reignited Kurt's interest in his own encounter and
in the subject of UFOs. So, Kurt shared his own encounter with a coworker who
took his story seriously and encouraged Kurt to report it officially, which he did. I think that's a really amazing
case because I do see this pattern of where people will have a close-up sighting and maybe the next night or
sometime shortly later, this is when they have a face-to-face encounter with an apparent extraterrestrial. That's
exactly what happened to this gentleman. Also really interesting to me is that he had some sort of telepathic connection
or information download and after his encounter stayed up all night writing down all these equations and symbols and
messages from the ETSs which clearly had him quite baffled. But that is a pattern
we see so much. These encounters affect people profoundly and often they do get
information from the ETSs that for some people is very hard to make sense of.
Now let's move to the last and final case in this compilation which I call the strangest experience I ever had.
This one occurred on November 24, 2024 in Mterrey Noeo Leon in Mexico. This is
a fascinating case, not only because it's so recent, but it looks to me like this would be an indication of humanoids
living among us. It's very hard to say because this gentleman did not see a UFO
or flying saucer or anything like this, but as you'll see, this was definitely not a normal person that he met. This
final case was reported anonymously to MUON by a firsthand witness about three
months after it occurred. I'll give the witness the pseudonym Oscar. It was
November 24, 2024, and Oscar was staying with friends at a rented Airbnb in the
Los Nagali's area of Mterrey Noeo Leon in Mexico. As the evening grew late,
Oscar decided to step outside and sit by the fire pit just to get away from the noise. And this is when his strange
experience began. As Oscar says, "As I was sitting by the fire, I saw someone
walking at the edge of the property. They were coming in my direction, so I just thought it was one of my friends
walking back to the house. As they got closer, I realized that they were not one of my friends. So, I asked them what
they wanted, and they said nothing to me. At first, when he looked at me, I noticed his eyes were a little bigger
than normal, and I thought maybe they were on drugs that made their pupils huge. But when he talked to me, it was
like I heard him, but I didn't see his lips move at all. He asked for water to
drink. It was at this point that Oscar got a good look at this figure and realized that he probably wasn't human.
Certainly not a normal human because, as Oscar says, as they got closer, I
noticed they didn't have ears. They had ear canals, but no ears. It looked as if
they were cut off. I didn't want to leave the person, so I called my friend Louise and asked him to bring water
outside and to hurry. He came outside and noticed the person was standing about 10 yards from me. Now, the second
his friend Louise saw this person, he was visibly surprised and actually cursed out loud. Oscar noticed that the
stranger seemed hesitant to come any closer. Perhaps Oscar was speculating because of the fire pit. So, Oscar took
the water bottle from his friend Louise and walked out towards the man. And as
Oscar says, when I got closer, I realized its eyes were not just big from
drugs, and I actually got scared. Instantly, as I got scared, the sound of
its voice in my head said, "Do not worry. It is okay." When it reached out
for the water, I noticed its fingers were rather long. It grabbed the water and walked off. So Oscar saw that in
addition to the strange eyes and ears and fingers, this stranger also had a quote slightly different skin texture
and color. Now his friend afterwards, his friend Louise told him that it was
the devil from the mountains. Oscar's not so sure as he says, "I have no
explanation for what it could have been. I met a strange being. I have never thought about reporting it because I
just figured maybe it was a deformed person. But then I could not explain to myself how I heard it talk, but it was
like in my head. Then I have doubt myself that maybe its lips really moved
and it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. But then that still doesn't explain the eyes and the ears. To this
day, it is the strangest experience I have ever had in my life. Definitely a
very unusual experience and not unique. I did a whole episode called
Extraterrestrials Walking Among Us. Uh I think there are some of these people on
this planet who are walking among us. People are seeing extraterrestrials and humanoids in very public places. So I
think this is an aspect of euphology that does deserve a closer look because it's not just a few cases. There are a
lot of them and that I think is a good example of it. So there you go. 10 cases
from all over the world. All different types of humanoids. We've got grays.
We've got short little humanoids. We've got very tall whites. I think uh all
types of, you know, perhaps praying mantis or reptilian. Just goes to show
there's a huge variety of humanoids out there, which is certainly what we see on
our own planet. So to me, that's no real surprise. And as many contactes have
gotten the message, we are you, you are us, we are one, which basically the
message is that we all share a common ancestry. Almost all reports of extraterrestrials
are humanoid in form. I think this has tremendous implications and goes to show
that probably our relationship with the ETSs is much closer than we know. So
there you go. Thanks so much for watching. I hope you found it interesting, perhaps learned a few
things. Always fascinating to see how many cases there are. I look forward to
the day when this subject is fully accepted by all humanity because I do
believe these cases are true and what we're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg. So, thank you again and until
next time, keep asking those hard questions, keep searching for the truth, and most important of all, keep having
fun. I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
