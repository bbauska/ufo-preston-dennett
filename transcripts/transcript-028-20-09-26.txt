RESCUED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS

Summary:
Sep 26, 2020
Some UFO encounters are scary. Some are friendly. And some UFO encounters actually save people's 
lives. In case after case, people report that ETs have intervened to rescue them from dangerous 
situations such as car accidents, drownings, assault, natural disasters and more.

Trapped on a sinking boat, caught in quicksand, lost on an unfamiliar highway, suffering from 
poverty, about to experience a seemingly unavoidable collision, in danger of being overwhelmed 
by a hurricane...ETs suddenly show up and rescue people right when they need it most.

Are ETs truly here to help people? Are they our friends? As these twenty cases show, sometimes 
the answer is yes! These cases reveal a benevolent side to the UFO phenomenon that deserves 
more attention. ETs are not only healing people, they are saving their lives. Talk about 
friends in high places! 

For those interested in these and other fascinating cases, they are presented in detail in 
my  book, "The Healing Power of UFOs."

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  the title of today's presentation is rescued by  
extraterrestrials i've done a lot of research into  ufo healing cases that's not what i'm going to be  
talking about today these are about cases in which  ets have directly intervened in people's lives  
to help them save them or rescue  them from some type of situation  
there's quite a few different  cases i've got about 20 here   in which people have been rescued from various  things such as car accidents being stranded  
drowning assault poverty uh natural disasters so  yeah this i think shows a much more benevolent  
and altruistic side to the ets that we don't hear  a lot about we hear a lot of fear-based cases  
but the truth is there are a lot of cases in which  ets have helped people in really dramatic ways so  
that is what we're going to be talking about today  and some of these cases are just truly amazing  
first case i want to talk about comes from one  of my favorite researchers artie six killer clark  
she reported about this case in her book sky  people it's an amazing case this occurred  
off the coast of the yucatan peninsula in a small  mayan village outside of tulum this occurred in  
2004 when this little mayan village was being  battered by a very strong hurricane hurricane  
force winds and rain and everyone was freaking  out they were getting ready to evacuate  
one of the residents his name was  geraldo he and his family uh were getting  
what they could together and getting ready to  evacuate when suddenly all the winds just stopped  
all the rain stopped at the same time  there was this very very bright light  
over the entire village and i'll just let geraldo  describe what he saw in his own words says geraldo  
overhead just at treetop level there was a ufo  it was round and it lit up the whole village  
the rain stopped the wind stopped the ufo  was like an umbrella it was protecting us for  
several hours the ufo stayed over our village  when the wind in rains lessened it moved on  
uh yeah an amazing case geraldo says that everyone  in the village saw the cr the craft and a few  
actually reported being taken on board uh after  this whole event he approached the village elders  
and asked them about the event and they had a  response and this is what geraldo says they said  
the sky gods came back to protect us they said  our village survived because it was a reminder  
of the injustice visited upon the  mayan people by the mexican government  
so that's one case in which ufos show a  real benevolence toward humans and there  
are many others here's another case which  comes from mufon this occurred in 1977  
1978 to in forest hills texas this is comes  from an anonymous witness who finally reported  
their case to the mutual ufo network and i'll just  let him describe what happened in his own words  
i was about 21 years old and had bs my way into  a job in which i had no skills one skill i needed  
was typing so i had immediately enrolled in a  night typing course which was in fort worth texas  
i was traveling home on i-20 east there was not  much traffic that time of night in fact i do  
not remember any traffic at all which now seems  rather strange to me all of a sudden there was  
a huge light the brightest light i have ever seen  before or since i slowed down to see what it was  
but could only see the light i then realized what  the light was showing me there was a mattress in  
the lane ahead of me that i would never have seen  which would have caused me to have an accident  
i pulled to the side of the road forgetting  about the mattress and rolled down the window  
my first thought was that it was a helicopter  but there was absolutely no sound when i say  
no sound i mean no sound as in any normal night  sounds or traffic much less a helicopter sound  
i wasn't scared as a matter of fact i felt a  feeling of peace like i have never felt all of  
a sudden the light was gone the witness drove home  and a short later called carswell air force base  
which was nearby and asked them about it and they  had no information at all about the experience and  
finally after uh some time later after seeing  a television show on ufos he reported his case  
to mufon and as he says what i experienced back  then was the most awesome and peaceful event that  
anyone could experience i do not know what it was  but i do know that it was real very real whatever  
or whoever it was saved me from what could have  been a horrible accident it could not have been  
something from this earth one of the most common  types of et intervention is people being rescued  
from car accidents here's another case in  which someone was rescued from a car accident  
this was reported to the national ufo reporting  center new fork but also appeared in tom dongo's  
book alien tide this case occurred outside  of cave junction in in oregon around 1980  
when a lady was driving on this old logging  road outside of the town of cave junction  
and i'll just let her describe what happened  in her own words it's an amazing case this is   her talking i somehow got off on a logging road  which was winding along a steep mountain after a  
while i noticed that the road was narrowing  and i was afraid to follow it any further  
i decided to try and turn my car around and drive  back to cave junction which was about 30 minutes  
away as i was backing up the car it went off  of the road the rear end was off of the road  
and the car was tottering i slowly got out and was  trying to figure out how to get my dogs out which  
were in the can on the back of the car if i tried  to reach them the car could tumble down the cliff  
while i was trying to decide what to do a big   car pulled up and four tall oriental men with a  strange skin tone too orange got out of the car  
in spite of the hundred plus degree heat of the  day they were all wearing black trench coats  
i said hello they did not reply without a word  they went to the front of my car and picked it up  
and sat it back on the road facing the direction  back to home i do not think that even twice that  
number of humans could have lifted my car from the  front to end only and placed it back on the road  
i do not remember how i got past their car or  they passed mine as they were headed up the  
fire break road as i was originally as well  the afterthought of the encounter left me  
really scared and as soon as i was back in town i  rented a hotel room and slept for a couple of days  
those weird men on the mountain saved  our lives but they still scared me  
very strange case involving benevolent men in  black who appear out of nowhere and disappear  
out of nowhere uh yeah car accidents do  seem to be the most common type of rescue  
and here's another case which which is just  really interesting this case comes from a lady  
by the name of lillian richter she's written  about her experiences in an excellent book  
called visitors behind our stars  this case occurred around 2001  
when lillian had gone to visit her mother who  lived in the deserts of southern california  
and it was quite a drive out there and after  visiting her mother all day lillian decided it  
was time to leave at this point it was 4pm and she  wanted to get home before it got too late so she  
had to leave at four and she got on the road and  had only been driving a few minutes this is a very  
isolated area she's driving along the highway  and is about 20 minutes away from the freeway  
uh and then this strange thing happened and she  said suddenly her red warning lights started to  
blink on and off she's traveling at about 70  miles per hour at this point and she starts  
to slow down to stop when suddenly something  takes over her car and it starts accelerating  
by itself uh first going up to 70 again and up to  80 and 90 and approaching 100 miles per hour she's  
trying to stop but the car won't stop the hood  is banging as lillian says and i'm quoting here  
i continued to apply pressure on the brakes  but instead the car started to accelerate again  
now i was moving at a speed of 100 miles  per hour but now is starting to panic it was  
like someone else had control of my vehicle so  she's totally freaking out and this goes on for  
just a few minutes when uh suddenly the  car slows down and she's able to stop  
and she pulls over to the road and is sitting  there trying to gather her uh wits and  
she decides she's going to continue the drive back  home tries to start the car but it will not start  
it's totally dead so she's like okay my  car's broken down and she gets her cell phone  
to call someone for help and her cell phone is  dead and uh so now she doesn't know what to do and  
this is when a huge black craft appears right over  her car flashes this super bright brilliant white  
light so bright she can't even see for a second  and as soon as her vision restores to normal  
this craft is gone and uh so she's freaking out  again when suddenly you know she tries to start  
a car again it still won't start and she's not  sure what to do when this craft appears again  
it's very low it's about 10 feet off the ground  and maybe 300 feet away it's very large it's  
shaped like a manta ray totally black it's got a  couple of lights on it a red and a white light on  
the underside and it's got a greenish glow about  it especially towards the back of it and she can  
see what appears to be a porthole perhaps and so  she's kind of freaking out she's shouting at the  
craft blaming it for her uh stopping her on this  highway and she grabs her camera this is a brand  
new camera she had just bought she remembered  she had it and this craft was right there   and uh she grabs it and points it at this thing  and at this point the camera completely fails  
and does not work and she  keeps trying to start the car   and this is when she hears a voice and  it said in perfect english a male voice  
do not start your car she looked around her  thinking someone was next to her but there  
was no one around and she decided she's going  to get out of the car and you know search and  
get a better look at what's going on and as  soon as she does she hears this voice again   it says do not try to get out of your car and i  said it was as if someone was in the car with her  
and she shouted out i have to go home i'm afraid  to stay here i need to get back on the highway  
before it's dark and there was no response and  she had no choice really about to just sit there  
and stare at this craft and after a few  moments it said the same voice you can go now  
and she was somewhat relieved but still  shaken up and she tries to start the car and   of course it does work and she drives off and  uh this object paces her car all the way to  
the freeway and she gets a really good feeling  from it she's for some reason not afraid and and  
at some point it just darts off right before she  gets to the freeway and she gets on the freeway  
and she knows it's extremely trafficky lots of  traffic and suddenly all the traffic comes to a  
complete halt and looking ahead of her she can  see that in fact there is a five car accident  
right in front of her she had gotten there pretty  much immediately after it happened and she got  
this cold chill and as she says and i'll just  quote her here directly i stood there stunned  
all of a sudden it hit me that i would have  been in this accident if i hadn't pulled over  
i realized that it could not have been  coincidental that the black craft held me back  
this black craft had pulled me over for that  reason and saved my life it convinced me  
right then and there that that craft had done  this remarkably kind act and saved my life oh  
yeah she asked other people who were there and  learned that this accident had just happened   and looking at the vehicles that involved  in this accident she saw that they were suvs  
just like her own same model same make so that  also kind of freaked her out but it's another  
amazing case in which ets have intervened  to save someone from a car accident  
here's another amazing case very much like this  but even perhaps more dramatic this occurred  
in 1956 the main witness is dave schupp he's  actually a really amazing man he's been having  
encounters his whole life but as an adult  became very well educated he's now a college  
professor has a phd in agricultural  engineering has worked in various capacities  
including developing mres meals ready to eat for  the military and food sterilization techniques  
and other applications of environmental science  so yeah very highly educated and a great witness  
back in 1956. he was just a little boy had  already had a number of ufo experiences  
when he had another really dramatic case  involving a rescue at the time he was outside of  
the hospital the saint elizabeth hospital  in lafayette indiana his mother had recently  
contracted polio and was having regular  treatments there and since he was there a lot  
dave would often go out into the park next to the  hospital and play games with some of the other  
children who also had parents in the hospital  there was another little girl a year older than   him mary ann who he would often play with and  one day he was out there in the park and they  
were just kicking this can around when uh um one  of them kicked the can and it went out into the  
street and she chased after it and right when she  jumped into the street a car had come screeching  
around the corner and was heading right towards  her it was literally inches from her and it was  
very clear to everyone who was there that she was  about to be struck by this fast-moving vehicle  
and i'll just let dave describe what happened  next this is dave talking then just as the car  
was a fraction of an inch from her everything  stopped i could see the driver's face clearly  
his face was frozen in a position of shock  the passenger was an older lady whose eyes  
were frozen wide and her mouth wide open there  was no sound no movement i looked around me and  
saw that nothing was moving no birds creaked  no dog moved people in the park looked like  
statues i looked above me and saw the familiar  shiny flying saucer suspended above the scene  
it was soundless and only wobbled slightly nothing  was moving i moved forward to catch marianne but  
she fell to the ground so i dragged her to the  curb at that moment everything started moving  
sound resumed and the ufo was gone time as far  as i could tell had stopped just long enough  
for me to enter the scene and prevent the car  from hitting marianne and probably killing her  
i sat on the side of the curb and my body shook  uncontrollably people who were driving the car  
at this point got out and were completely freaking  out they said that they thought for sure they had  
hit the girl but uh they hadn't she did break  her arm from being pulled onto the sidewalk  
but everyone who was there saw that uh somehow  dave had miraculously saved her life and  
he was hailed as a hero and received a lot of  accolades for this it's a very interesting case  
we're seeing a lot of very interesting  aspects in some of these cases in this case   we see that time stopped i've seen that in  other cases and in the other case where uh  
the person was rescued from a mattress on  the road we saw that there was no traffic   on the road we've seen that before where  traffic disappears in places where there  
should be traffic or perhaps the case involving  the men in black in which they lifted a car uh up  
and moved it on the road this involves  obviously what seems to be super human strength  
so definitely some very weird aspects to these  cases and uh one of my favorite cases you know  
i'm often asked what's the strangest case you've  ever personally investigated and sometimes this  
case does come to mind it's a very strange  case the lady uh wants a pseudonym to be used  
so i call her sherry and i know her really well  she was a part of actually the sea seti group  
that we formed here in los angeles  and we go out and see ufos regularly  
so she was part of that group and  uh really amazing lady she was a  
real estate agent for many years and very  successful at it and changed careers and became  
a therapist so really a good witness and has had  ufo experiences her entire life as a little girl  
she would sometimes wake up in her room and her  pajamas would be put on wrong she'd find sticks  
and twigs and leaves in her bed and her uh parents  would get really upset at her and she's not my  
fault she remembered once suddenly finding herself  outside and she's running in terror from this ufo  
and comes up against a barbed wire fence and this  beam of light comes out of the ufo and hits her  
suddenly she's very calm she's being pulled up  into the craft that's all she really remembers  
so she's had a number of missing time incidents  but this one strange incident that i'd like to  
talk about occurred in the early 1960s  in the wachong mountains of new jersey  
i actually covered this incident in uh my book  extraterrestrial visitations and it's just an  
amazing case sherry was driving a motorcycle  through the watchung mountains late at night  
this is an old-style motorcycle which didn't have  an electric ignition it had an old kickstarter  
these motorcycles to start them you had to kick  start them with a sort of a little kickstand type   thing and uh she's driving through the mountains  when she had an accident for some reason she just  
slipped and the car the motorcycle slipped out  from under her and slid across the road and uh  
thankfully she was fine she was not injured about  the motorcycle was in fact the kickstarter had  
been completely bent out of shape to a  point where she couldn't start her bike  
so she was stranded at this point she's stranded  in the middle of the mountains late at night   this is a very rural area she's not  expecting to see any cars driving by  
so she's not sure what she's going to do  and this is when it became very strange  
these two beings figures appeared right next  to her and she says it was pretty frightening  
these looked like not quite grays but kind  of grays they were about five feet tall  
they were bald had very large dark eyes very pale  skin but looked almost human and probably could  
have passed for humans she said if they had been  wearing sunglasses and hat perhaps she says they  
were wearing these sort of tan jumpsuits and  they didn't say a word they just looked at her  
one took the motorcycle and stood it up while the  other bent down next to the motorcycle and began  
straightening the kickstarter with its hands and  actually appeared to fix it and i'll just quote  
sherry here briefly there were two of them they  looked at me and silently picked up the motorcycle  
took the kick bar and straightened it i  nodded and kicked it and off i went uh so  
yeah they were able to fix this motorcycle just  without any instruments it appeared that they   just used their hands and the whole incident  occurred very quickly maybe a minute and she  
never saw any ufo she just got on that motorcycle  started it up and drove off she didn't look  
back at the time it did kind of freak her out and  she regrets not staying and at least observing a  
little more closely as she says i wish now i  could not have been so worried or disturbed  
that i could have paid more attention but they  weren't threatening it was just very strange
so yeah i mean not sure what to make of  these cases other than that these ets are  
intervening for altruistic reasons and  there's a lot of these types of cases  
i think most people probably don't report them  because they're so strange here's a case which   was reported to the national ufo reporting center  this occurred in the fall of 1959 to four friends  
four young teenagers actually who had driven  away from hollywood uh and uh in california  
and we're just driving through nevada on sort  of a joyride just a way to get out of la and  
they found themselves outside this very small town  in nevada it's called goldfield goldfield nevada  
and they were just driving through the desert and  on these desert roads when they became trapped in  
the sand and they tried to dig themselves out and  couldn't and just got themselves dug deeper and  
deeper in until pretty much the truck was half  buried the wheels in the sand so they decided  
they're just gonna have to spend the night and  one of them will walk out in the morning and  
they all get in this sort of uh car and laying out  in the bed of the truck there it's a pickup truck  
and uh talking about things and uh they started  talking about ufos at some point the subject  
came up and one of the guys uh i call him bradley  uh that's a pseudonym bradley's girlfriend says  
just joking let's see if we can contact  a saucer to help us and so they also are  
just telepathically calling out to ufos and uh as  bradley says started to trying to telepathically  
contact a saucer and i'll just let the witness  bradley say what happened next here's him talking  
not long afterward we all saw a light approaching   i don't know the direction it came from it  looked just like a bright star except it  
was moving toward us it got much brighter as it  drew overhead at that moment we felt a truck move  
it rose straight up in the air about a foot or two  off the ground floated to the middle of the road  
and gently set down then the light moved back  in the direction it came from and blinked out  
bradley remembers the time that they all screamed  in fear and immediately drove off some years later  
he contacted his girlfriend and she immediately  remembered the incident pretty much exactly the  
same as he did except she remembered they were  all laughing where he remembered they were all  
kind of screaming in fear and i know how unusual  this case sounds but i have to tell you there are  
dozens of cases in which cars have been lifted  up we call these car lift cases and sometimes  
it's just a few feet sometimes it's all the way  up into a ufo sometimes it's just two wheels  
so this case is not as unusual as you might  think and yes there are cases which people  
have telepathically called out for ufos and they  have arrived so it does fit the pattern of other   cases and it's just this really amazing benevolent  case perhaps the ultimate case of this kind and  
certainly one of my favorite involves a group  of people who are lost at sea or stuck in a  
very bad storm and this is truly an  amazing case this occurred in june of 1994  
and every year there's sort of this annual  regatta in which a bunch of amateur boaters  
and professional boaters do this sort of regatta  in their boats traveling from new zealand to  
tonga to the island of tonga and a bunch  of people were participating on this day  
and weather conditions had seemed to be  fine when out of nowhere a very strong storm  
developed and just kept getting worse and worse  and suddenly it became a force 12 storm which is  
very bad these involve waves of a hundred and feet  winds that are traveling at 100 knots and there  
were dozens of boats who were caught in the path  of this storm and while some were able to make  
it to safety a lot were not they were caught  dead center of this storm and one by one these  
boats became swamped and uh their mass were  breaking and the sails were shredding and they're  
was becoming breaking and some of these craft  started to sink and so all of them were turning  
on their emergency beacons all at once and this  caused all kinds of problems because the emergency  
beacons were becoming crossed and the rescuers  weren't able to locate a lot of these witnesses  
so this whole story is told in the book  rescue in the pacific by tony fairington  
and that's where i originally got part of this  story though one of the witnesses did later write  
a book about it and we'll get to that but this  amazing case that involves one particular boat  
which is called the ramtha after you know  the channeled entity by jay-z knight rampha
and the owners of the boat  are bill and robin forbes  
they own this boat called the ramtha and they  got caught right in this storm and it wasn't long   before their sails got stripped and their steering  mechanism broke and they radioed in for help and  
while they were in radio contact with the rescuers  the rescuers could not find them because there  
was so many of these emergency beacons going  off all at once and by this time it was night  
and these hundred foot waves were battering all  these boats uh some boats had sunk people were  
losing their lives at this point so this is a very  scary time very serious and bill and robin form  
forbes uh their boat is becoming swamped  and it's getting battered by these waves  
and it's not gonna be long they're pretty sure  pretty sure that their boat is going to sink  
and as they're clinging inside their small cabin  suddenly this bright light appears over their boat  
and at first they thought it was a flare but there  was a very strange quality about it and i'll just  
quote tony farrington who wrote the account of  this case here as farrington writes something had  
changed something was different at first robin had  trouble identifying it then she realized they were  
bathed in light she moved out of the shelter and  stared in awe at a green orb that hovered to port  
illuminating the angry world about them she  couldn't believe her eyes it was impossible  
to pinpoint the exact source of the light it  was unlike anything she'd experienced before  
certainly completely different from the lightning  that had shattered the darkness earlier in the   evening bill come look at this robin said what  the hell is it he asked this light was 20 feet  
over the mast it was very large and actually was  changing in color initially it was green but it  
changed to white then to orange back to green  then to white into orange and it was blinking  
in all these different colors clearly not ball  lightning bill forbes was a pilot and as he says  
i've never seen anything like it it's massive  maybe it's a fireball it's not lightning it's just  
hovering meanwhile uh the rescuers who are on  board a ship called the mono y a very large ship  
saw this light and they're like what is  that and they started sent out a radio call  
to the survivors who they were in contact with  and said ask them if anyone had launched a flare  
and no one had and when bill and robin forbes  heard this message they responded and said no  
we haven't launched a flare but we do have  this weird light hovering over our boat it's  
directly over our boat and a short time later  the light blinks off but at this point the mono y  
has located this the uh location you know  they've got the location of where this light was  
so bill and robin forbes so they're not in the  most distressed their other boats they're um in  
much more danger are put first on the list because  they're close by and they know exactly where they  
are and as soon as dawn arrives the monoi shows  up and rescues bill and robin forbes their boat  
by this point is completely swamped and uh they  are pulled right on board the manoa and are among  
the first saved meanwhile there's other people  in this storm who are still struggling to survive  
and there's another really amazing case that  involves extraterrestrials there's another ship  
called the heartlight this is being piloted  by the wheeler family diviana wheeler the wife  
is actually a ufo contactee and uh she's traveling  with her family on this regatta when this storm  
strikes it's funny because earlier she had gotten  a very strong premonition that they would be put  
in peril to the edge of peril is what the  premonition told her and they had just gone  
through a pretty severe storm so they thought  that was it but as soon as this storm struck  
they knew that they were wrong and in fact this  storm was what the premonition was referring to  
and uh this yeah with this is a very severe storm  and diviana started getting direct messages from  
her e.t contacts and uh they told her that  quote the kingdom of heaven is now at hand  
and they activated their rescue beacon because  their boat was getting severely swamped  
uh it was being hit broadside by the waves over  and over again there had been several near-cap  
sizes and diviana started to get messages that  the boat would in fact capsize and she got a very  
strong premonition that the boat was in fact going  to sink she got a very clear vision of the boat  
sinking beneath the waves so she didn't tell her  family this she told them exactly where to stand  
in case the boat should capsize or sink  which appeared appeared imminently to do  
and they did their best to steer this thing but  at some point the steering became jammed and  
the boat was hit so hard by the wave the hull  actually cracked and water started to pour in  
and so this point she knew that they didn't  have much time uh the storm was beginning to  
blow itself out at this point but  they were on the verge of sinking  
and we're very worried because so far no  one had been able to find them and it wasn't  
long thankfully after this that they were in  fact found and a fishing boat driving nearby  
came upon them and pulled them from the heart  light and got them on board the fishing boat  
and it was about two hours later their boat sank  to the bottom of this ocean never seen from again  
and they survived they survived through the  guidance and the premonitions given to diviana  
uh by these et's she ended up writing a  book about this it's called heartlight  
rescue at sea and a truly amazing case and there  is sort of an interesting endnote to all this  
regarding the other boat the ramtha owned by bill  and robin forbes because they had lost their boat  
they had sunk all their life savings into that  boat and had pretty much lost everything well  
they did have insurance it was not going to cover  nearly the costs of the boat and their belongings  
so they were pretty upset and it was about  two days after this storm when the new zealand  
air force uh got a call about a light that was  hovering over this area where the storm had been  
and it was another ufo this giant unexplained ball  of light and it was hovered long enough that they  
decided to vector a plane out to this area and  they did and the ball of light disappeared by  
the time they got there but they did find a  boat and it turned out to be no other boat  
than uh the one owned by bill and robin forbes  the ramtha so they got their boat back and i don't  
i mean here we have a ufo apparently not only  saving bill and robin forbes but saving them  
from financial ruin by showing them where their  boat was so they were able to recover their boat  
and their belongings and it had a real happy  ending tragically some people did lose their  
lives in this incident but it's an amazing case  where ufos rescue people who are lost at sea  
and people are helped in various ways i went to  a convention a ufo convention once in northern  
california and met this amazing guy by the name of  chuck weiss who had written a book called abducted  
by aliens and he was a really nice man we ended up  trading books it's a very interesting book and uh  
what i found fascinating about it was he was  healed several times but he was not only healed  
he was helped in the most unusual way  this is one of the most unusual cases  
i've heard really of how ets have intervened to  help people in their lives he has a lot of what  
he calls these dreams these alien dreams in which  grays appear and he had one of these greens as  
chuck says in his he was having one of these alien  dreams and in the dream he had this weird thing  
happen as he says i was given a sheet of paper  by my supervising gray and told to look at it  
very carefully he did and he saw all these  columns of weird letters as he says it  
didn't make any sense to me and that's where the  dream ended and at the time chuck was unemployed  
and it was getting pretty desperate he  needed a job he was out of funds and he was  
not having any luck with any of these  jobs and finally his employment agency   sent him to a company that specialized in copying  and dubbing radio and television commercials  
and weiss was given the job of reviewing the work  orders to making sure they were coded correctly  
and i will just quote chuck here as he says  after a round of introductions in my new office  
i was shown the paperwork that  i was expected to proofread   my jaw dropped to the floor when i saw a column  of station call letters running down the left  
side of the paper is it it was exactly what i had  been shown months earlier by my supervising gray  
it was suddenly obvious to me that it had been  determined long before i went to work there that  
i would find employment at that particular company  and in that particular office of the company i was  
blown away aside from a couple of spontaneous  healings that i couldn't be sure weren't to  
just keep their rat running the maze this was my  first real indication that for whatever reason  
i was somehow special to them i had never heard  before of the et's going out of their way to find  
a job for an experiencer nor have i since after  five months of working for the company as a temp  
i was made a permanent hire with vacations and  full benefits so it appears as if the grays  
were acting as an employment agency that actually  found him this job for him or at least shown him  
that he would be getting this job because what  he saw in the dream was exactly what he saw  
in real life and while chuck says that's the only  case of people being helped financially or to find  
a job there are in fact some similar cases and  here's actually a very early case which occurred  
in july of 1939 to a gold prospector by the name  of zhao lucindo this case was first investigated  
by a ufo researcher brazilian ufo chur researcher  jackson louise camargo and in this case jiao  
lucindo was out camping and gold prospecting in  a remote area of brazil called sarah de gordo  
and she was out there camping one night heard  this very loud whistling noise at that moment he  
sees two tall humanoids they're wearing  these silvery jumpsuits they tell him look up  
he looks up and sees this enormous kind of  shaped craft a ufo next thing he knows he finds  
himself on board along with these two humanoids  he's laid on a table he's physically examined  
afterwards he's told that this encounter would  benefit his family in some way and uh he wasn't  
sure how but the next night he had a very strange  dream in which these same humanoids appeared  
and they showed him this map and this location and  they said this is where you should dig for gold if  
you dig here for gold you will find it and that's  what he did he went to this exact area where they  
had pinpointed and found a vein of gold which  he told researcher uh jackson louise camargo  
that he was able to extract quite a bit of gold  from it uh so yeah in a really amazing case  
and uh certainly although strange not unique in  fact a lot of these cases do have uh similarities  
or very similar in various ways there's a couple  of cases in which people were saved of drowning  
and reptilians often get a bad rap but in this  case it was actually reptilians who did save this  
20 year old man by the name of jose alvarez from  drowning this case occurred in january of 1977  
it comes from researchers janet and colin  board and it occurred in the high basin area of  
amazonia this is sort of east of lima peru and  the witness jose alvarez was hiking around in this  
very remote area and was looking for a spring or  some place where he could get some drinking water  
and walking along a path slipped and fell into  this swampy area and tried to get out but found  
himself trapped in this kind of quicksand like  mud and i'll just quote the witness directly here  
as jose alvarez says in spite of my efforts i  could not get out of it and i had lost all hopes  
to survive when suddenly four small beings  appeared they were less than one meter tall  
the body covered with green scales and their  hands had three fingers with claws uttering  
growls and gesticulating they held branches to me  that allowed me to pull myself back on firm ground  
it took all he had in him to get out of this  swamp he said he was absolutely exhausted and  
as soon as he got pulled out he passed out just  lost consciousness and when he woke up these  
beings were gone these short like three foot tall  green-scaled beings were gone and wow what a case  
but actually not unique here is another case  that's really almost identical i got this case  
from albert rosalie's book the humanoids amongst  us this occurred in a very young boy he lived  
on a six acre farm with his family and uh he was  around six years old and was just walking around  
out there in the wilds picking flowers for his  mother when he slipped and fell up into this  
into this mud and before he knew it as he's  struggling to get out he was up to his neck  
in mud and he was sure that he was not going to  make it and uh he was that he was going to die  
uh and he lost consciousness at this  point he's up to his neck and mud  
unable to get out he loses consciousness and then  suddenly he wakes up and he's no longer in the mud  
he's lying next to this  mud puddle and there's this   figure wearing reflective clothing kind of a  reflective jumpsuit standing next to him and looks  
at him just briefly and disappears in a flash of  light so he feels sure that he was rescued by this  
figure wearing this kind of silvery jumpsuit  and believes it was an e.t because following  
this incident he started being pulled from his  room into a ufo on a bi-weekly basis i mean once  
or twice a week and as a result following this  incident his intelligence improved dramatically  
he became very intelligent and  was the star pupil in his school  
and graduated out of a class of 400 kids a head  of the class and he completely attributes this  
to the et's it's actually not the only case i  know of in which ets have improved a person's  
intelligence so they are intervening in a  lot of ways uh here's another case which i  
uh personally investigated this was reported  in my book extraterrestrial visitations  
and it occurred to a woman by the name of rose  shellheart who's married to william shellheart  
and they've both had lifelong experiences  william was healed they both had a very friendly  
onboard ufo encounter in sedona arizona but once  as a child when in germany when uh rose was just a  
very young girl she nearly drowned and could never  understand quite what happened until years later  
when she went under hypnosis and realized that  she had in fact been saved by extraterrestrials  
so what happened was she  was in the mid-1930s she was   about four or five years old and was uh playing in  the woods behind her home next to the stream when  
she slipped and fell into the river and as she  says i'll just quote her directly i was playing  
with some children's dishes and all i remember  was i'm drowning i don't know which way is up or  
down then somebody pulled me out and didn't say  a word and when i looked around to see who it was  
they had disappeared it wasn't until yeah  years years later that she went under  
hypnotic regression and saw that she had been  saved by these uh largely human-looking et's  
they were sort of hybrid-looking perhaps half gray  half human had large dark eyes pale skin bald but  
looked very much human and these were the ones who  saved her and throughout her life she would have  
encounters which appeared to be mostly benevolent  here's one of the strangest cases i've ever heard  
a lot of these cases are strange i know but  this one wow this was reported to mufon and  
the witness reported this case because it  was so unusual and she wanted to know if   anyone else had ever reported anything  like this and i can't say that i have  
this is a very unusual case for sure it  occurred in august of 1986 this occurred  
at the wahweep campgrounds at lake powell  this is in page arizona and yeah august 1986  
the witness who is anonymous was uh just  camping there at the huawei campgrounds  
and walking along the shore of lake powell it's  a very large lake there are lots of very rural  
areas where few people are although this lake  is very popular and it was at night nobody was  
around that she could see and she's walking  directly along the shore when suddenly this  
bald-headed man attacks her just jumps out of the  darkness and pins her to the throws her to the  
ground she's half in and out of the lake and uh  is on her back and this man just crawls on top of  
on top of her and is beginning to assault  her she knows what's going to happen she's   terrified and is fighting back as best as  she could but this man is stronger than her  
and she's just terrified because she knows what's  about to happen when suddenly this ufo appears two  
actually two bright lights up here one's sort  of the distance there one's at the other end  
of the lake and another's a little bit closer and  swooping closer and as it get closer it takes on  
the appearance of a big sort of swirling ball of  fog this glowing ball of foggy light and the wind  
starts picking up and getting more stronger to  the point where it starts picking up pebbles and  
small stones and starts pelting both of them with  these rocks it's like very close at this point  
right over the lake there and they're both getting  hit by these rocks and the wind is very strong and  
finally the man just jumps up turns around and  sees this thing his eyes get wide in terror and  
he looks down at the witness and says we better  get out of here and he starts to run away well  
the witness you know took one look at the ufo  and the this other guy and she makes her choice  
and is i'll just quote her directly as she says  i looked at him in the ball of fog and decided i  
would rather go with the ball of fog so i started  walking out into the water toward the ball of fog  
then it just vanished the water and  wind calmed down and it was quiet again  
i did not know what to make of this i  have not heard of many reports like this  
but it seemed like it made a special trip down  from the sky just to rescue me from this man  
uh yeah i have to agree i think that's exactly  what happened here and this is the case in which  
et's apparently intervened to rescue a person  from being assaulted by another person and  
while it may be largely you and unique there are  other cases that are in fact similar one case i  
investigated personally uh i wrote about in my  book on board ufos and the witness in this case  
is dolly i'm amazing lady the more i get to know  her the more i'm impressed i think she actually  
might be one of the most intelligent people one  of the most accomplished people i've ever met  
so i'm just really impressed by her she's had  experiences ufo experiences her whole life  
she's had sightings as a young  girl as a teenager as an adult  
one time she was driving with her girlfriend  and very late and she was extremely tired and  
had gotten lost and didn't even realize  she was lost when a ufo appeared   and actually guided her home so that was  an amazing incident she had another amazing  
incident in which she uh her health was unwell  she was suffering from a blood sugar shock she was  
suffering from diabetes and was having a real  problem with her blood sugar and had was passing  
out when a gray appeared and woke her up and urged  her to get to the hospital and helped her do that  
so that was another amazing incident but of the  most amazing at least for me occurred in 2008.  
dolly at this time was working as a munitions  driver at fort benning this is in georgia and uh  
she was driving uh i believe home from  uh oh no actually she was driving to work  
uh one evening this is late at night and uh she  sees this light and she knows instantly it's  
unusual because it's very large and as she looks  behind her she can see this thing approaching  
you know she first thought it was stadium  lights but there couldn't be a stadium there   uh this because it was a very rural area and  as she sees these lights she realizes they're  
approaching her car and it's very large she knows  aircraft you know something this large would have  
to be making quite a bit of noise and it was  completely silent so she slows down her car  
when this thing comes buzzing down right over her  car does kind of a u-turn and parks there and so  
she stops in the middle of the highway there and  looks at this thing and it's very large it's very  
light's all over it's clearly unusual and very  low and she gets this telepathic message from it  
it's a very clear message and it says home is  not a good place home is bad home is not good  
and while the message was very clear she wondered  if they meant home as an earth you know the  
entire planet or her her home in particular she  was having some problems at home with her husband  
he was acting very sort of aloof and they  weren't getting along that well and she was also  
having some health problems she was feeling quite  unwell she couldn't quite figure out what's wrong  
and uh she was just very impressed by deciding  it shook her up because this thing had   clearly singled her out she got  to work she made some queries  
and found out that there was no unusual  traffic in the area that she could find out  
she went home and had some chinese food  with her husband that he brought home and  
got really ill after that and had to be  rushed to the hospital and uh they could   not figure out what's wrong what was wrong  with her they thought she had food poisoning
but she had a strange dream  that night when she got home   and uh again she was go it was about  this ufo experience but the only  
thing this time her husband's name was added to  the message that there was something wrong there  
and uh now her ex-husband i should say because  she started to watch him much more closely  
and he was acting very strangely and at some point  he said tr you know she's just her hot health is  
just taking a real strong downturn she's gonna get  going back and forth in the hospital they can't  
figure out what's wrong at some point they think  she's having a heart attack and uh she nearly dies  
and they just can't figure it out and her husband  is very aloof and uh makes an announcement he says  
i'm handling the finances i'm gonna handle  all the finances from now on and she says no  
you're moving out that's what you're doing and so  they became separated and at this point you know  
she was rushed back to the hospital and  they conducted some more tests and found out  
that she had in fact not had food poisoning or  a heart attack she had anti-freeze in her blood  
and an investigation filed and she found out that  her ex husband had in fact been poisoning her  
he had taken out a 500 000 life insurance  policy and was feeding her anti-freeze  
so this caused her all kinds of health  problems but thankfully she did recover  
and probably would have died she believes  if not had this ufo shown up and warned her  
that her she was married to basically a sociopath  and uh she had to get out of that situation  
uh which she did thankfully and uh this ufo  saved her life and there are a lot of cases in  
which ufos have intervened as we've seen to save  people's lives i know another case reported to  
mufon actually investigated couldn't find the case  unfortunately but i remember it vividly a lady was  
at her home when her refrigerator fell over on  top of her and she couldn't get it off and she  
was gonna die unless some somebody came to help  her and that's when ets showed up they weren't  
typical grays but it was definitely not human  and was able to lift this refrigerator off of her  
and i know of many other cases i have done  a couple of other videos about people who   have been rescued one involved the case of pat  kate who in 1985 had an amazing experience in  
which thousands of people were apparently  rescued from the nevada del ruiz volcano  
so you might want to check out that video because  that goes into that case in detail and another uh  
video i did is about the case of stan hughes  who also had a benevolent encounter in which  
e.t showed him up and warned him that there was  a situation at home that needed his attention  
so definitely there are cases in which ets do  intervene in a way that seems to be altruistic  
benevolent kind-hearted and there to help people  in a wide variety of ways uh from you know as we  
have seen helping someone to get a job find  employment improve their financial situation  
all the way to avoiding a car accident or  being prevent prevented from a car accident  
from happening to being you know having your life  actually saved from drowning or a hurricane even  
and i know there are other cases out there like  this i'm sure as i mentioned earlier a lot of  
these go completely unreported i did a whole  study of these kinds of cases in my book the  
healing power of ufos uh so i know there are a lot  of cases like these and that i think they're very  
significant and that people should know about them  because they do show a benevolent side to the ets  
which often get a bad rap so i think you  know people who believe that all ets are  
demonic or evil should remember that they are  in fact cases in which ets do help people and  
these are just some of them   so that's this presentation thanks once again  for listening and until next time keep having fun
