Oct 25, 2024
While there are still those who remain skeptical of UFOs and extraterrestrials, there are many who not only believe, they KNOW. They have moved beyond belief to actual experiential knowledge. A firsthand encounter with extraterrestrials changes the way a person views the universe. They know beyond doubt that we are not alone in this universe. And a lot of people have had this kind of experience. This video presents ten firsthand accounts of people who have met humanoids face-to-face. These cases come from all over the world. They show that we are not the only people in this universe. We are one of many!

THE ALIENS AND THE SHEPHERD BOY. In the Summer of 1938, Mariano Melgar, a seven-year-old shepherd boy from Munico, Spain was minding his family’s herd of cows when an ET craft landed nearby. A door opened and three men stepped out. Mariano approached to get a closer look and one of them shot him with a beam of light. Mariano thought they might be from another country. Later he would change his mind.

USO AND HUMANOID AT LAKE LANGELMAVESI. When Ilona Johansson-Paasonen went to enjoy a vacation in August 1945 at Lake Langelmavesi, Finland, she was awakened one morning by light blazing into her room. Looking outside, she saw a fiery object zoom towards her. She dove to the ground in fear. Peering outside again, she saw two figures in a boat that clearly was not normal. Weirdly, she passed out.

THE ALIENS AT THE WATER FOUNTAIN. On the night of December 24, 1950, ten-year-old Antonietta Chiara was sent outside her home in Cossoine, Italy to fetch a pail of water. Going to the nearby fountain, she saw three thin humanoid figures with oversized heads and big dark eyes, and all three were staring right at her. Realizing they were not human, she panicked and fled.

THE MEN IN THE TRANSPARENT SPHERE. On the night of October 18, 1968, three people were enjoying dinner in their home in Medulla, Florida when suddenly the TV quit and the dog freaked out. Looking outside, they saw a transparent sphere floating near their house. And inside it were two short men working a strange device. Little did they know, people all over the area were seeing UFOs.

A UFO REPAIR CASE. One night in February 1970, Leona Nielsen and her friend were staying in a cabin near Coram, Montana when a light outside caught their attention, and they saw a classic flying saucer landed along the river shore. It seemed to be in trouble and was shooting out colored sparks over a wide area, while two human-looking figures rushed around it. Leona had the impression that the craft was damaged.

THE ETS ON THE SIDEWALK. It was 11pm on June 18, 1980 as Antonio D’Amico walked along a sidewalk in the small village of Barrancas, Argentina. Suddenly he noticed two short humanoids wearing skintight luminous jumpsuits standing a short distance away. Both were staring at him. Fearful, Antonio decided to leave. But to his shock, the strange figures followed.

ALIEN ROBOT ON THE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND. One afternoon in mid-April 1990, five children were on the playground of the Yerevan Primary School #111 in Yerevan, Armenia when a spherical object landed behind the school. Three robotic beings came out. One approached the students and spoke to them about the future of their country, but not before striking one with a beam of light and levitating another boy.

ALIENS AT SUMMER CAMP. It was 1991, the last night at summer-camp for a group of girls in Pelrhimov, Czech Republic. As they sat around the bonfire, a brilliant beam of light shone down on them. It was a UFO! The camp leaders ordered all the girls to their tents. But shortly later, a few of them sneaked out and came face-to-face with three tall humanoids in divers’ suits. The UFO remained overhead.

THE ETS BY THE CHAPEL. On the night of December 27, 2006, a college student was walking by the chapel at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, Africa when a glowing egg-shaped craft dropped from the sky and landed in front of her. Moments later, an ET emerged. The student was unable to move as two more figures appeared, then one of them approached her. Thankfully, two other students came on the scene.

THE HUNTERS BECOME THE HUNTED. It was 3am on December 12, 2011, as three hunters and one of their sons were hiking back to their car after hunting in Kaimai Ranges of New Zealand. When a glowing object appeared overhead, they became puzzled. When it moved closer and revealed itself to be a craft, they became concerned. Shortly later, they came face to face with a strange humanoid that would leave them all shaken.

These ten cases provide just a brief glimpse into the nature of contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. The truth is that there are thousands upon thousands of cases, each of them unique, each providing another piece of the puzzle that is the UFO mystery. The only thing we know for sure is that UFOs are real, and we are not alone in this universe.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal today's episode is called beyond belief 10 incredible
extraterrestrial encounters I love covering these humanoid cases they're endlessly fascinating and there are so
many of them far more than most people realize and in fact the vast majority of these cases go completely unreported
undocumented and even those that are reported and investigated most people don't know about them it's why I do this
research I think this subject is very important I've chosen 10 cases from all
over the world including the Czech Republic Italy Finland Spain Armenia
Kenya and Africa New Zealand Argentina and two from the United States including
Montana and Florida these cases are supported by
most of them multiple eyewitnesses as well as some very compelling evidence
the four main types of evidence we see which are landing traces physiological
effects electromagnetic disturbances and animal reactions the cases that I'm presenting
today began as early as 1938 all the way to
2011 and of course a wide variety of humanoids I think each and every case
has something to to teach us so let's just get started and the first case I
want to talk about today I call the aliens and the shepherd boy this occurred way back in the summer of
1938 in Muno Spain this is a small little village but this is a really
interesting case this amazing and early case of a UFO landing and humanoids
comes from Spanish researcher JJ bidz the witness was a 7-year-old Boy by the
name of Mariano Melgar it was around noon in the summer of
1938 and Mariano was watching over his family's herd of cows he had just taken
them out to pasture in the fields about 3 km or 2 miles outside of his hometown
of Muno this is near a Vila in Spain so he had just arrived the cows were
beginning to eat and drink from a small spring and this is when he heard a strange buzzing sound
and looking up saw a bright flash in the sky so he looked up to see what was
causing this Flash and this is when he saw a round metallic object descending downwards emitting flashes of silvery
light and it came lower and lower until it suddenly landed in the field right along the edge of the Woods at this
point the buzzing sound stopped and Mariano now curious but cautious hid
behind an old tree trunk about 30 m away way 90 ft and stared at this object he
could see it was about he estimates 20 m in diameter 60 fet it had a small Dome
on top was resting on three or four Landing legs he said the perimeter of
the craft had numerous blinking colored lights the craft itself was kind of
aluminum silver in color and had several round Port holes or Windows around the
edge as Mariano says it was a round machine sparkling like silver now at the
time of this encounter the Spanish Civil War was taking place and Mariano
wondered if he was looking at some new type of aircraft but almost immediately a tall
and wide door opened on the side of the craft and a long ramp came out and went
to the ground and it was at this moment that the area around him became completely silent almost like a vacuum
then this man came out of the door and stepped down the ramp and Mariano was
immediately struck by the man's unusual appearance he wore what looked like a onepiece silver scuba diver suit with a
helmet there was a squarish mask covering the face it had a small bulge where the nose would be same with the
ears two dark spots or holes for eyes so he couldn't really see any facial
features he did notice a very short antenna type protrusion coming from the
top of the the helmet this figure wore calf length boots gloves and a thick
belt around the waist so this figure descended down the ramp and was immediately followed by a second man who
walked down the ramp and then a third man emerged but remained by the door of the craft these first two figures then
walked a short distance from the craft and began to collect items from the ground either soil or plants Mariana
wasn't quite sure but he watched as one of the men knelt down and was placed specimens in some kind of bag so now
even more Curious the witness decided to get closer and he walked about 5 m or 15
ft closer when the humanoid by the door fired a beam of light from an object in
his right hand directly at the witness which basically knocked him flat onto his back but he was unharmed a little
frightened but unharmed he jumped up and retreated back behind the tree and the
two figures outside the crack continued to collect samples in fact Mariano could
hear them talking in a strange unintelligible language which sounded kind of like gurgling to him so as this
continued Mariano once again bravely tried to approach and again the humanoid
by the door struck him with a beam of light this time it caused some discomfort in Mariano's eyes he said so
it was clear to him at this point that they did not want him to get any closer so for the next 15 or 20 minutes he
watched as these two beings collected samples seeming to walk around the area
with some difficulty in fact years later in hindsight when Mariano saw the
astronauts walking on the moon this reminded him of the way the men were walking so after collecting their
samples the two humanoids returned to the craft one of them before entering
the craft turned and looked at Mariano gesturing at him with what he interpreted as a wave or a salute as if
to say goodbye this frightened Mariano because this was the first time they actually were looking at him and
reacting and he wondered if something bad was going to happen to him at this point but it didn't instead they just
returned into the craft the ramp immediately retracted the door closed
then the craft rose up about 50 to 100 m 150 to 300 ft was rotating at this point
multicolored lights FL flashed out from the bottom then the craft quickly darted
away now again at this time Mariano had never heard of UFOs or extraterrestrials
and assumed that had been some kind of military craft piloted by foreigners and that had something to do with the
ongoing conflict in his country but it quite frightened him the whole
experience and he told nobody but a close cousin a few days later he did
return to this site where the craft had landed and he found a circle of scorched
vegetation but it would be many years later when the subject of UFOs became publicized that the witness realized he
had probably seen a UFO and extra terrestrials as he says now I know that
this thing had nothing to do with our war I love these early cases especially
when the witness has never heard of UFOs or ETS as we see in this case it's also
really interesting because this case shows the pattern we see so often of a
UFO landing ETS coming out and collecting samples of some kind it's just overall a very compelling case now
let's move to the next one this one is super interesting I think I call this one the Uso and humanoid at Lake langel
mavisi this is in Finland actually it occurred in August of
1945 at Lake langal mavisi in Finland and and it's a really interesting case
for a number of reasons involving animal reactions a very close-up encounter with
a humanoid and a really unusual Uso Uso accounts unidentified
submersible objects with humanoids are pretty rare and this is a good one it
appeared in the number 3-4 1970 volume of the Finnish UFO publication
Viana it occurred in late August of 1945 the witness is Ilona Johansen ponin she
was on vacation staying at a sauna along the shores of Lake langel Mesi in
Finland was before 500 a.m. and Elona was alone in the sauna when the room
suddenly filled with light she was afraid because she was alone and the nearest house was a kilometer away but
she was also puzzled and curious so she raised the curtain and looked up out and as she says there seemed no limit to my
astonishment and I received a great shock approximately 4 km distance from
the shore where the sauna is situated a dazzling ball of fire as bright as the
sun and about 10 m in diameter was approaching the sauna at great speed
overcome by fear I threw myself down on the floor on my back to wait for the end
for I was sure that if the ball of fire maintained its course would sweep the sauna to the ground
rushing over the surface of the lake the ball when I first saw it could surely
have been no more than 200 to 300 M from the sauna for it was already
obliterating everything from view including the small Islands puzzled and
vastly relieved when the crash did not happen I stood up after a few minutes to take another look at the phenomenon but
the ball of fire had disappeared so she's now looking over this beautiful Lake and was very
surprised to see a quote dark loglike object this was about 2 m long gliding
through the water and approaching the shore she was no longer afraid at this point but was still very shocked looking
out to the window next to a small Pier that led out into the lake she saw the neighbor's lap dog and it was an
absolute Terror standing up on its feet all its hair standing on end its mouth
was wide open full of sharp teeth but then she turned her attention back to
this weird log shaped object which was now approaching the pier on the water
revealing itself to be some kind of craft and there was a humanoid inside it
as Elona says I saw that it was a narrow boat resembling a canoe a tall man of slender
build was standing in the prow he was wearing a greenish colored coverall when
the boat was just in front of the pier it swung around so I could see that in its aft another man dressed in a similar
outfit was steering an engine which was inside a big glass bulb I heard neither
any weing of a motor nor splashing of Billows but I observed quite a deep wake
in the water so this is clearly not a normal boat she saw at this point that
the dog was now running away and looking back at the craft she became even more confused and puzzled now she had never
heard of UFOs or aliens so she had no idea how to interpret what she was seeing she knew it was unusual and it
was at this moment that she says she became physically affected by the event as Elona says feeling extremely weak I
returned to bed and so failed to observe what happened to the boat perhaps I would have seen the fireball returning
to the sky perhaps I wouldn't have been shocked if I had known something of these things so it would take Alona many
years to understand she had probably just experienced a close encounter with a Uso and
humanoids but she does note that following this experience she saw UFOs
flitting around in the sky on several occasions there you go another case
where the witness did not immediately jump to the UFO explanation having never really heard of them I think that does
add a little bit more credibility these are not people seeking attention by any
means and there's just I mean it's case after case after case here is another
really compelling case it's quite brief but I think important this one I call
the aliens at the water fountain this occurred on December 24 1950 Christmas
time at kosu Italy this is a single witness case and the witness is a young
child but again she wasn't thinking this was ETS she really did not know what she
was seeing now we know that they were probably the typical Grays this case
again is quite brief and comes from researcher Pierre Giorgio mergia and it
occurred on a Christmas night in 1954 in the very small Italian Village of
kosene it was just after midnight and everyone is getting ready to retire for the evening and the fire had to be put
out so 10-year-old Anton Chiara was sent outside by her father to
fetch a paale of water from the fountain which is located about 30 ft from their home on Via Petro Basu you can see the
street here so antonetta left the house and was walking towards the fountain
when she noticed three humanoid creatures who had very thin elongated bodies she estimates they were about 5T
tall and were not human looking certainly not normal they had disproportionately large heads very
large dark eyes and all three of them were staring at her which as you can
imagine made her quite nervous she paused trying to understand what she was looking at what these creatures were and
at this point it dawned on her that these were not normal humans in fact she wondered if they might be demons she'd
never heard of extraterrestrials she was very afraid ran home in a complete Panic immediately
told her father what she had seen he went outside to check but they were gone he did not find anything a very brief
case but so unusual that appears to be just a chance encounter hard to say why
ETS would be there in the middle of a very small town right next to a water fountain perhaps they were just
collecting water all beings need water lots of cases involving UFOs over bodies
of water ETS asking for water as well so maybe that's what's going on in that
case hard to say for sure but another early and interesting case now let's
move to another one this one is super fascinating I call this one the men in the transparent sphere this occurred on
October 18 1968 in medulla Florida I like this case because it's got animal
reactions multiple Witnesses a very closeup sighting of UFOs and humanoids
supported by outside witnesses as well this case was first published in fate
magazine in an article by journalist Lee butcher was about 7:30 p.m. on October
18 1968 as William Buck McMullen his wife
Julia Grace and their soon to be daughter-in-law Sharon Burgess had just sat down to eat dinner in their home
this is located south of Lakeland in medulla County Florida suddenly the
television set filled with static and the audio stopped working and at the same time their dog who was outside
began to whimper and howl this was very strange as their dog was normally
fearless and had in fact attacked a number of people that forced them to chain the dog outside the house and also
the mcmullins did have four signs posted on their property warning people about
the dog so this was a ferocious dog but now this dog broke loose from his chain
actually tore through the front porch screen door ran into the dining room and
cowed in complete Terror underneath the dining room table where they were all eating so seeing this Grace jumped up
and ran outside to see what was wrong and she immediately saw the problem approximately 150 ft from the house was
a 30t wide transparent glass-like sphere which was hovering and rocking gently
about 10 ft above the ground right above a palm tree she said it had a band of blue light circling around the middle
and was emitting a Halo of purplish red light from the top section strangest of all however was that inside this sphere
she saw two men they were standing on either side one on the right one on the
left facing each other and holding on to a spindle type device sort of a
horizontal bar which was attached to a vertical bar she said these SE men looked human but were quite short about
4T tall and were wearing dull white tight fitting jumpsuits with high collars skull caps and Boots the object
itself was completely silent and Grace was really puzzled because there were no visible engines or sources of power that
she could see within this sphere she was stunned frightened and actually wondered
for a second if she was dreaming as she says I couldn't believe what I was see see I turned on the porch light to
attract their attention but they didn't appear to be interested so she knew she was seeing something highly unusual and
immediately became determined to carefully observe and remember every detail that she could moments later she
was joined by her husband buck and their son's fiance Sharon and all three of
them stood there dumbfounded watching this these two men inside the sphere were pushing on this horizontal bar up
and down which appeared to cause this sphere to rock back and forth to whichever side the bar was being pressed
down on the rocking motions slowly increased and the craft began to rise in
fact Grace had the impression that the craft may have been on the ground and that she came outside just after it had
started to take off so as they were watching this in absolute amazement the dog now came running outside tearing
another hole in the screen and ran down the road howling in Terror away from
this scene the UFO occupants continued to pump the bar inside this craft up and
down which seemed to cause the sphere to rise and increase in speed and eventually move off they estimate that
they watched this for a total of anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes as this object moved off increased speed reached
a distance of about a mile away when suddenly there was a burst of fire and
Sparks and the object took off at EX extremely high speed so they immediately
walked out into the field where this object had hovered and they smelled an overpowering odor of what they thought
smelled like ammonia they returned to their home and called the police the
police arrived but by then there was no evidence later they did test the area for radiation but nothing was
detected however there is some confirmation of this incident because it was later learned that just minutes
before the McMullen ing two men Wally Simons and Larry lose saw a glowing
object rise from the grounds near medulla school this is located just north of mcmullen's
house so these Witnesses thought that the object that they were looking at might be a low star in the sky but it
seemed to hover and then move left and right and then off into the distance so
clearly not a star and also that same week it turns out hundreds of people
were calling the local police stations throughout Tampa located only 30 m to the west to report UFOs and in fact 5
days before the mcmullen's encounter on October 13 at 11:20 p.m. something very
strange happened George Wimberly a dis dispatcher for the Watkins Motor Lines
said he saw this glowing object moving in a faltering halting zigzag motion
coming downwards seemingly not in full control and then apparently crash into
an Orange Grove causing a massive explosion and in fact it ripped the garage doors off the building he was in
shattering glass windows and dislodging ceiling tiles many people in the area
heard or felt this explosion people in nearby homes Dove to the ground as pictures were torn off the wall and some
witnesses described seeing a small sort of mushroom shaped Cloud as well as a
brilliant beam of white light coming from Above Down onto this area as though
searching for this object police immediately rushed to the site and they did find a 4ft wide 18in deep hole there
was nothing in it soil samples were reportedly sent to the FBI but no
surprise here that the there were no reports ever released to the public and whatever that was remains a mystery some
really interesting details to that case with the fact that the Witnesses are looking at this craft can see right
inside of it and there's not a whole lot in there they don't see any engines they don't see any panels or buttons or
anything really it's just the ETS and this little lever that's fascinating I
also find it interesting that they reported this strong odor many cases do
involve that sort of thing of course the animal reactions are really interesting and also fascinating is that this
occurred during a huge wave of sightings in this area which always adds a level of credibility these are not the only
people reporting something going on at that time so interesting now let's move
to the next case which is a rare type of UFO encounter I call this one a UFO
repair case this is speculation but this is what the Witnesses believe was going
on this occurred in the February of 1970 in koram Montana this is not too
far from Glacier National Park and this is a multiple witness case uh pretty
closely viewed it went on for a long time and some really unusual interesting
elements to it there were two witnesses to this case Leona neelen and her friend
Leona is the only one who actually came forward and again she feels like this was a UFO that landed for repairs which
are exceedingly rare and this could be a good example the two witnesses had spent
the day at a cabin along the Flathead river near the small town of Corum again
not far from Glacier National Park it's probably one of these cabins you see here because through the process of
elimination there are no other cabins around so it was around 1 a.m. Leona was
lying awake in bed when a blazing light came pouring in through her bedroom window bright as car headlight light the
problem was this window overlooked a completely rural area the Flathead River there were no roads out there it
couldn't be a car so as Leona says I got up and down in the lower field was a
shape quite long with a dome and a platform around it and Sparks were
flying across the river hitting the back and flying up into the air I saw what I
thought were two men running around my side of the platform the lights are sparks looked like building torch Sparks
all colors so she immediately called for her friend and for the next 20 minutes
they both watched this remarkable scene at one point strangely her friend became
quite ill had to lay down but then got up and both resumed watching this craft
and these weird figures as Leona says the men we saw were like earthmen they
were about 5'8 wore what seemed like snowsuits and their heads were bare they worked and
walked as an average person the rim which ran around the Dome was six feet
wide at least as these men ran around with ease not like one would on a narrow
area you could see them doing something near the Dome the top was so enveloped
in Sparks that it was only a shadow the Sparks flew from the rim up over the
Dome filling the whole area with bright yellow light the Sparks were mostly
yellow white and bright blue with heat like a welding torch these Sparks were
large and would fly over the top of the Dome skim across the river hit the bank on the other side fly up and back into
the river with a sizzling sound so this craft she estimates was
quite large about 50 ft wide but the area lit up by the Sparks coming from
this craft she said covered nearly two full acres in fact Leona said it looked
almost as if this whole area was on fire but it was just these Sparks uh and that's basically it uh one
last thing Leona says is why my friend and I didn't panic and run I don't know
neither were afraid so quite an unusual encounter to say the least I can't say
that I've heard of a case quite like that certainly the description of the ET
craft is very familiar and quite common but for it to be putting out all that
light all those Sparks to have these figures running around it for so long
it's a really unusual case and again hard to say for sure whether it was there to make repairs or what was going
on but certainly a very compelling case and that there were multiple Witnesses
and they did see it very close up for quite a long period of time now let's move to the next case
this one is all I mean all these cases are amazing to me this one is
particularly poignant I call this one the ETS on the sidewalk this occurred on June 18 1980
in baranis Argentina and this is a single witness case though it does involve
physiological effects and some really unusually described humanoids it was
11:00 p.m. on June 18 1980 as Antonio Gerardo damiko was walking along the
sidewalk at the intersection of fmat and IU Zeno streets in the small village of
baranis you can see it here this is the actual intersection and feeling a sudden urge
to look up Antonio was surprised to see two short humanoids standing in front of
a wall near the local coat hanger Factory said they were very short 1
meter 3 ft tall but had very muscular bodies and as they were standing under
the illumination of of a nearby street light he was able to see them in pretty good detail he said both wore tight
fitting almost luminous jumpsuits like divers suits one looked more silvery
while the other did have a pinkish Hue he said they both wore metallic boots
and had Roman type helmets with a Crest on top he didn't see any nose or mouth
but he did notice that they had large round googly eyes bulging eyes he say
they stood under a window window and were staring directly at him needless to
say this made him nervous and he immediately moved under the protection of a nearby large tree as if in response
the humanoid in the silver suit also moved this is when Antonio noticed a very strong discomfort in his eyes so he
quickly began to walk away and he turned around at one point and he was not happy
to see that both these little humanoid fellows were following him the silver
suited one was in front and the one with the pinkish suit was behind the first
one so now Antonio became even more nervous he looked ahead of him and saw a
parked vehicle with its lights on so he began walking directly towards that
hoping that there would be somebody inside this car then turning around again to see if he was still being
followed he saw these two humanoids were now nowhere in sight this greatly
surprised him as it seemed impossible that they could have disappeared so quickly there was really nowhere for
them to go so it looked to him almost like they had vanished Into Thin Air and
that was it however after the encounter Antonio did notice one thing his eyes
were extremely red and swollen and he also felt incredibly thirsty that was
clearly a pretty frightening encounter for Antonio it must be quite a shock to be walking around that late at night or
early morning and see something like that and then have these humanoids following you uh I wonder why they were
there I really don't know I looked up that town there's not a whole lot there there is a very tall Electrical uh Tower
or telephone high tension wires uh we do know UFOs are attracted to that he
didn't actually see a UFO so it's hard to say but man man what an amazing case
now let's move to the next one this is one of my favorite in this little compilation I've done a lot of research
into UFOs landing at schoolyards and that's what's going on in this case which I call the alien robot on the
school playground this is a multiple witness case it has some really unusual
elements to it some precursors some after effects that are just so strange
this one occurred mid April in 1990 in yavan Armenia I think this is
the first time I've ever covered a case in Armenia so that itself is also interesting but yeah a multiple inness
case of a UFO landing on a school yard so many cases like this in fact I did
write an entire book about schoolyard encounters didn't know about this one so I might have to do a sequel to
schoolyard UFO owners but I think you'll find this case super interesting this
case is a doozy lessons had ended for the day as three fourth grade students
all around age 10 were playing football on the grounds of yavan school number
111 you can see it here located on the outskirts of uravan
Armenia looking up they saw this glowing sphere drop from the sky very quickly
and land about 300 M away on a vacant lot behind the school about 1,000 ft
away less the object seemed to split in half and it immediately disgorged three
very tall figures two of these figures stayed with the craft while one began to
approach the kids in the schoolyard now there were two fences between the figure in the schoolyard where the children
stood the First Fence was about 1.5 M tall four or 5 ft it was a metal mesh
fence and the figure easily crossed over it but the second fence was four M tall
12T and after several attempts to cross it this figure suddenly seemed to
transform into a 1M wide glowing sphere and bounced like a ball over the fence
rolled for a moment towards the witnesses but as it hit the ground it immediately resumed the form of this
figure and moved towards the students now at this point two additional
students joined the first three and all five of them watched the approach of this strange figure which they said
looked almost robotic was 6 feet tall had a sort of greenish metal appearance
a hue to it a normal-sized head with square-like openings for eyes what
looked like a square grill for a mouth there was a light on its forehead area
the upper left side of its chest had what looked to the kids like some sort of screen and on its belly area its
stomach was a device that they couldn't identify but reminded them of a watch now this is when it gets weird
because the screen on the chest of this figure they said flashed the names of
each of the five children written in Armenian one of the boys became very
frightened at this point and tried to run away when they all watched as a beam of light came out from the light on the
forehead of this robotic figure hit the boy's hand and knocked him over it
actually left a mark on this kid's hand this is when when a strange conversation
ensued and from what the kid said this ET was talking to them about the future
of their country the future of Armenia it was during this conversation that the
light on the forehead of this being emitted another beam striking a second child and actually levitating him into
the air the boy next to this kid grabbed his leg in an attempt to hold him down
and he was also lifted up into the air they hovered for just a few seconds and then fell to the ground another really
strange thing was that the children said that they would periodically lose Consciousness and then wake up so this
was going on for some time they said the robotic figure continued to walk around the schoolyard sometimes kneeling down
and seeming to pick up things they saw it once pick up a small stone with its
left hand and then rubbed it on its right hand turning it red they said the
other two figures were standing by The Craft remained there but walked around it apparently taking soil samples the
robotic figure that was closest to them then returned to the craft they said in the same manner that it had arrived
transforming into this glowing sphere to surmount the taller fence then all three
figures returned to the two halves of this sphere which closed back up becoming one whole sphere again this
object sort of bounced up quote like a spring and then it hovered overhead sent
down one more beam of light directly onto the children hovered for a moment and then darted off disappearing into
the distance now again at this time the children had never heard of UFOs or ETS
the subject was completely absent from the Armenian media at this time but this
case did get a lot of publicity and these children were interviewed by a local television show and during this
show the interviewer asked if any of them had seen these objects before to which one of the children replied yes
these things actually fly here quite often look one is flying out and true to
the child's word everyone turned and looked and they could see this glowing sphere very much like the one that they
had described that had just landed so the newsman actually raised the camera
towards this and filmed it but only for a few seconds because at this point the
camera power cable became disconnected and the object disappeared apparently he
did manage to briefly capture a few seconds of film of this sphere the story
was televised and was reportedly the first show on the subject in Armenia and
really opened the floodgates for other accounts later an investigation of the
site did reveal Footprints where this robotic figure had stood and walked around also there was a deep indentation
on the ground where this sphere had apparently landed they also noticed that
the ants prevalent in this area completely avoided The Landing
traces they could also see a ring-shaped dut of dehydrated and Faded ve
vegetation and an analysis of the soil was done and it showed evidence of high
heat they also tried to grow seeds in this soil but the soil would not grow
anything though the control sample taken the nearby dis away was normal and would
grow and germinate seeds now the child who had been struck by the beam of light on his hand did
show this Mark which actually remained after 6 months totally baffling the
doctors who examined him researchers also learned something else quite unusual was about two weeks before the
incident one of the children was asleep in bed when he had sort of a hypnogogic
experience between sleep and waking wasn't a normal dream but he says he was
approached kind of in the dream state by this same described robotic figure who
told him soon you will be playing at the schoolyard there will be five of you we
will come and talk to you so yeah the boy assumed it was a dream but was it
because this prediction did come true and there's also this weird aftermath because it was about 4 months after the
experience this same kid was shopping with his grandmother when an old woman
called out his name and asked him how he was doing now the boy did not know this
woman so he asked how she knew him and this is when suddenly the woman took on
the appearance of a robotic figure for just a brief second and promptly disappeared right in front of him Into
Thin Air how incredible is that yes these Witnesses are young children but
there's Landing traces Left Behind medical effects the news camera team
shows up to interview these children and what happens a UFO shows up and
evidently they caught it on film I couldn't find the film unfortunately that would have been super interesting
but again just one of well over a 100 it's probably closer to 200 schoolyard
UFO encounters I think this is something they're doing intentionally to me the
most fascinating aspect of this case is that one of the children did get a message that he was going to be
contacted at the schoolyard a couple of weeks before this encounter even occurred and saw ETS afterwards so
something very profound and significant is going on here in these schoolyard UFO
cases now let's move to another one which is very similar this one occurred in the Czech Republic I call this one
aliens at summer camp this occurred in the summer of 1991 in pelm off this is
in the Czech Republic this is another multiple witness case not only children but adults as well and some very
compelling physical evidence as well this very bizarre case comes from researcher Carol rine of the exopolitics
Czech Republic it was in the summer of 1991 that he had sent his daughter to a
summer camp in pelov this is not far from prag and while there she and a
group of other children had an amazing encounter it was the last night at the
summer camp which was being spent gathered around a large campfire singing songs playing guitar telling stories
like they did pretty much every evening and the evening was winding down when around 10 or 11:00 p.m. suddenly a
brilliant light Shone down over the group of children and the camp leaders directly on them looking up they all saw
this very large saucer-shaped craft was sending down three beams of light
onto the ground one directly onto the group of campers and the other beams on either side said this was very bright in
fact the environment around them was lit up bright as day needless to say this
caused complete chaos as everyone was gazing up at the craft wondering what it could be the camp leaders took immediate
action and ordered all of the children to go into their tents telling them to stay there and not look out but some of
the children were very curious and disobeyed they looked out and they saw
that this saucer-shaped object began to descend and hover above a group of
spruce trees not far away then this craft sort of emitted a
large glowing sphere from beneath it which moved slowly to the ground and
seemed to land in the forest shortly later they could hear this loud sort of roaring sound sweep through the forest
forest and then this craft rose up and hovered above the trees again so very
curious about this a group of girls including Carol rosine's daughter Petra told the camp leaders that they had to
go to the restroom this was a lie a little RSE as they really wanted to go investigate the UFO they did go to the
restrooms the these were near the edge of the forest but they really wanted to go see
what this UFO was all about so after going to the room and looking up at this craft they began to return to the camp
and this is when two of the girls froze in their tracks because standing on the path leading to the camp right in front
of them blocking their way were three tall white figures dressed in what
looked like space suits with helmets they said these figures had boots and gloves looked to be quite tall 6 feet in
height their faces were hidden behind dark face plates so they couldn't see what they looked like but for the next
few moments this group of girls stared at the ETS and the three presumed extr
terrestrials stared right back at them almost as if each group was examining each other then moving in slow motion
these three figures turned around and headed back into the forest after the
Figures were out of sight the girls immediately fled back to the camp and told the camp leaders turned out that
several of the other children back at the camp had also seen these strange figures and also watched this strange
sphere ascend from the forest back into this saucer-shaped craft the Flying
Saucer then moved off silently and was gone so after calming down which took
some time everyone went back to sleep but when they woke up the next morning
everyone got a huge surprise because the wooden benches surrounding the campfire
turned out they had been splintered and demolished into little pieces no one could figure out how this had happened
also there there was an axe with a wooden handle this was also completely destroyed except for the metal blade so
nobody could come up with any reasonable explanation as to how this could have happened but it clearly had something to
do with the unusual events of the prior night nothing else showed any signs of
damage later that morning some of the children did venture out into the forest where they had seen this sphere of light
descend to the ground it was only 5 minutes away arriving there they found a
strange circular pit about 6 m in diameter almost 20 ft and about 1 M deep
3 ft and it had very precisely cut edges
so these are some pretty significant Landing traces these are the kinds of cases that just raise so many questions
why did this UFO land at this summer camp to me I think there's some int tionality going on here purely
speculating but the fact is one of the witnesses is the daughter of a pretty prominent UFO researcher could be a
coincidence I don't know but I find it fascinating also really interesting is
that the evidence Left Behind was undeniable that something really unusual
occurred again most of these cases go completely unreported I can only imagine
how much more common this type of thing is is and we know now let's move to
another really interesting case don't hear a whole lot of cases Coming Out of
Africa but every place on Earth is being visited I've shown this over and over
again uh there are cases from all over the world I call this one the E the ETS
by the chapel this occurred on December 27 2006 in Nairobi this is in Kenya
Africa and by and large this is a single witness case so there were some outside
Witnesses who were not interviewed so technically I guess it is a multiple witness case but again a really unusual
case of a UFO landing in an area where you wouldn't think it would pretty populated area right next to a
university and a chapel this case comes from African researcher Samson K maulo
alah it involves one main witness an anonymous college student from the
University of Nairobi located in Nairobi Kenya Africa was 10:30 in the evening December
27 2006 as the anonymous witness was walking by the Catholic church next to
the campus chatting on her cell phone with her boyfriend I think it's probably this church you see here which is
located right next to the campus the only nearby source of Illumination was a
street light at the bottom of a small hill just a short distance away and this is when without warning the witness's
cell phone was cut off and at the same moment a very bright light appeared near
her now she first thought this was a car and sort of signaled at it to move around her but then looking at it this
light became much brighter and closer and suddenly she found herself standing right in front of a very large
egg-shaped craft she said it had five or six appendages on the side of it not not
really described but she said two of them were pointing at her but even more
alarming was the appearance of a very short humanoid standing next to the craft so this being was not normal it
was silver in appearance had large reddish eyes and it was standing perfectly still staring directly at her
she could feel a very strong wave of heat coming from the craft she said it was as if she was standing next to a
fire she also felt a strange vibration under her skin and at this point found
that she was immobilized paralyzed unable to move and she was wondering how to get away from this frightening
situation when she saw two figures coming towards her from the hill by the chapel she immediately thought that
these were two students from the nearby University but to her enormous surprise
she saw that they were actually two more of these short silvery humanoids identical to the one standing next to
the craft so these two other humanoids joined the first one standing next to the craft and
then this first humanoid began to approach the witness she said it moved very quickly and just as it was about to
reach her one of the other two humanoids let out a loud cry which sounded to the
witness like an injured cat turned out at this exact moment two students had
appeared at the top of the hill and apparently seeing this strange sight did
not come to help her said they turned around and fled the scene immediately
the humanoid who had been walking towards the witness turned around and retreated back to the craft the witness
immediately found herself able to move again and wasted no time she quickly fled the area she again had never heard
of UFOs or extraterrestrials she wondered at first if she had encountered some type of demonic Spirit but later doing her
research she decided that instead she had had a close encounter of the Third Kind how unusual is that case I mean
each of these cases have unique elements to it and that one certainly does I have to wonder what would have happened if
those other Witnesses hadn't showed up because that's when the ET did turn around and return back to the craft so
this might have been a much more extensive encounter at any rate it's certainly one
more piece of the puzzle to what's going on here now let's move to the final case
in this compilation this one is a wild one really quite scary very compelling
with multiple Witnesses it's a longl lasting encounter I call this one the
hunters become the hunted this involves four Witnesses who were out hunting had
a encounter with a UFO that was very close up which ended up being a humanoid
encounter as well this is a fairly recent case occurring on December 12
2011 in the kai May range of New Zealand
it's a really really interesting case this final very interesting and
extensive case comes from researcher an Shasta it involves four Witnesses three
Hunters John Andrew and Lewis that last name is a pseudonym as well as Andrew's
12-year-old son all four of these guys were out in the wilderness of the foothill
of the kamay range this is located near the Bay of Plenty on the north island of
New Zealand and they had spent the night hunting and at around 3:00 a.m. were
returning through this remote scrubland area to their car located about 3.5 km
away it was a windy and rainy night and it was John who was the first to notice
a strange orange light in the distance they estimate 4 to 5 kilm away the
thought at first it might be another Hunter so they turned off their flashlights and sat down to watch when
to their immense surprise this light actually hovered in the sky zigzagged
violently then swung in a pendulum motion stopped suddenly and started performing right angle turns so this
clearly wasn't a hunter and they excitedly discussed all the possible theories they could think of as to what
this thing might be they thought perhaps maybe it was farming equipment or a
motorcyclist but the quick and unusual motions of the light didn't fit any of these theories one of the gentleman
looked at it through his rifle scope and said it looked like a triangular object
with two lights on it but he didn't get a really good look at it cuz it was off in the distance and they watched it for
about 20 minutes becoming increasingly puzzled and concerned by it and then
became even more alarmed when without warning this object suddenly zoomed quickly down the hill where it was
maneuvering and began to move slowly across the valley directly towards the
witnesses and this is when something weird happened immediately as it did this the environment around them seemed
to become dark the rain and the wind suddenly stopped and all the creatures
in the wilderness became totally silent normally there's sounds of all different types of animals but nope nothing and as
John says we thought oh time to leave boys we didn't stick around we started
moving rushing down the hill I couldn't see and was falling over so they decided
to just head straight for the car wiing through the brush until they reached a road this point they could now see the
light moving at what looked to them ground level pretty close several hundred yards away was now much brighter
much larger and all the witnesses had the distinct impression it was a massive vehicle of some kind and that it was
quote looking for something so they continued the Trek towards their car
entering into the woods at one point and losing sight of the object they rested for a moment at which time Andrew's
young son asked what they thought the light was but nobody knew yet at the
same time none of them were quite willing to admit yet that they were dealing with a UFO so continuing back towards the car
they noticed again an orange glow in the woods to their left much closer this time about 80 M away 250 ft they also
noticed an unpleasant smell like rotten eggs John said the Lewis said it
reminded him more of burnt pork so as they continued to walk this light the
strange light suddenly went out all the animal sounds started again it began to rain again and it looked like everything
was back to normal still they were quite unnerved by what had just happened as John says we didn't feel safe we all had
that flutter that feeling that something was not quite right so continuing
towards the their car they came through a break in the trees and now about 60 M
away 180 ft they saw the same light again and it immediately zoomed directly
towards them as John says we thought what the hell is that and within a split
second it was right along the fence line only five M away from
us again the wind and the rain stopped all the wildlife went deadly silent
which Lewis described as quote surreal and frightening now this terrified the four
men all of them froze and watched as this orange light faded to reveal a con
shaped craft hovering just above the ground with clearly metallic highly reflective sort of flattish on top was
studded with colored lights green blue yellow orange red and white lights
arranged in tears and they were flashing erratically the bottom part of the craft
was covered with very small orange lights and on one side were two brilliant white spotlights kind of like
headlights but very bright inset into the side of the craft and although all
the lights were very bright it was strange because they did not illuminate the environment around them the craft
itself was but they did see this Arc of red light coming out from the bottom which would
sort of move out in front of the craft as if scanning the area and when it did this it would make this weird ticking
sound so John as he says I said to the boys are you seeing
what I'm seeing I could hear them Breathing heavily right behind me we were just staring at this thing it
stayed there for a good 10 seconds and then the red light went out and reversed
so at this point the object began to move away and the light went out everyone felt a brief sense of relief
John says he felt abnormally calm and comfortable which was bizarre to him
considering the circumstances but again their relief was shortlived because suddenly this craft
reappeared 150 M away they said it made a voice a noise kind of like a vacuum
cleaner and then it moved and it blocked their forward path then to their great
fear it zoomed again towards them stopping only about 15 M away this
caused complete Panic John Lewis and Andrew's son Dove off the path into the
bushes in fact Lewis wrapped his arms over the 12-year-old boy to protect him he was quite frightened meanwhile Andrew
the boy's father quickly turned the light off of his phone and moved to join the others but tripped and this crap
continued to move directly towards him as Andrew says in his own words I was
looking up at it as it was approaching I remember seeing colored lights on the
road but the mass of bright white light was what stuck in my head because of the fact that it was so close I was actually
wondering whether to run back up the road but it would have seen me so I said to the others just stay there don't move
everybody was freaking out I couldn't help but think what will it do if it sees me will it attack will it take us
so yeah everyone was very afraid this was totally out of the realm of their experience Andrew's son actually shouted
out to his father I love you Andrew looked briefly at his son and then back
at the UFO which immediately turned off all of its lights now a split second later they saw it again but it was now
350 M away and moving gently off over the field that was bizarre it moved so
quickly immediately it began to rain again the wildlife began making the usual night
noises now the group now at this point was pretty close to their car 250 M 750
ft away so they just decided to make a run for the car and as they did all of
them became aware of this foul odor where this ship had hovered Andrew's son
was crying at this point so Andrew and his son were in the lead while John and
Lewis took up the rear and this is when John saw a bright small football-shaped
glow off to the left it seemed to be moving up and down and stopped about 1.5
m above the ground and as Andrew says we all stopped to look at it everyone was
saying look look my son was pulling me crying and saying Dad let's go so I took
him off down the road I left the other two boys standing there so at this point
the light began to waver and come closer they later realized that this was a figure sort of walking and that was
causing the wavering motion because John shown his powerful flashlight at this light and was shocked to see that the
light was actually the illuminated head of a tall humanoid did not appear to be
wearing any clothes it had pale grayish white skin with modeled Grays and pinks
only the top half was visible as the rest was hidden by bushes but the being continu to approach swaying back and
forth and what looked to the witnesses like an attempt to Shield itself from the flashlight so John was very curious and
moved forward to get a better look but his friend Lewis quickly grabbed him and pulled him back and the two men decided
to hurry back Retreat and go after Andrew and his son but while they did
this John continued to look back at the humanoid which was still there but when they reached the car it disappeared they
could no long longer see it they all quickly got inside the car talked excitedly comparing notes about what
they saw trying to explain it away they couldn't it was clearly unusual after a
few moments of recovering from the shock of the encounter Andrew started the car and drove off it said afterwards all of
them felt traumatized they were alternately trying to explain away what happened while at the same time going
over and over the details and realizing just how unusual this encounter was have
to give kudos to the witnesses for coming forth to talk about this again most people don't I really feel for the
12-year-old kid who had such fear associated with this encounter I can't
blame him when somebody has an experience that is completely out of their world viw it can be quite
difficult to process but the fact is there are so
many of these cases and I know there's a lot of controversy about why ETS are
here you know is contact beneficial or not I mean I'm
just presenting the cases factually you can make up your own minds about it but I think if ETS were truly here to harm
hurt take over we would already know by now fact is they've been here since
recorded history and probably a lot earlier than that I think if you take a close objective look at ET contact
particularly the onboard encounters you will see that there is no real clear evidence that
they're here to hurt people I think if you take a look at the totality of evidence it's very clear what their
so-called agenda is but you can make up your own minds about it this is why I present these cases factually with No
Agenda to push one narrative or another it's important that we all use
discernment to figure out what's going on on here uh don't believe me do your
own research on these cases I'm telling you there are so many I've literally
presented well over a thousand it's closer to 2,000 cases now on this
channel alone and again this is just a small representative sample of what's going on so thank you once again for
watching I hope you found this interesting and perhaps educational as well I truly appreciate you watching
this subject is so important I think it has the potential to really change the entire world how we view ourselves and
our place in this universe so thank you thank you thank you and until next time
keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth and keep having
fun I will see you next Friday bye for now
