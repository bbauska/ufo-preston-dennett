TEN STRANGE UFO SIGHTINGS
Mar 27, 2021

Summary:

Have you ever seen a UFO? 

A sighting is the most common type of UFO encounter. And each sighting has something important and profound to teach us about the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon. Often, a close-up sighting brings deeper levels of contact that might not first seem apparent. If someone sees a UFO, the chances are good that the ETs are showing themselves intentionally. Sometimes, what might seem to be a simple sighting is in fact a much more extensive encounter.

This video presents ten different sightings, each of which has something to contribute to our understanding of UFOs and extraterrestrials. A UFO-car chase; an object hovering over a busy airport; a man who has had more than 40 sightings; a saucer hovering directly over powerlines; a small town embroiled in the center of a massive UFO wave; two teen-agers targeted by a massive, fiery object; a family with a close-up encounter that only some remember, a group of objects over a city center viewed by hundreds of people; a mother ship hovering for hours and releasing smaller craft; a UFO that telepathically calls the witness outside to see it -- these sightings show how varied and complex the UFO phenomenon can be.

A UFO sighting has the capacity to totally change a person's life, and alter forever the way they view themselves and the world. Never underestimate the power of UFOs!

Intro
hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and welcome to another episode of ufos in the  
paranormal today's episode is called 10 strange  ufo sightings this episode is actually really  
special to me because these particular sightings  are among the first i've ever investigated many of  
them involved my family my friends co-workers  or their friends and it was these particular  
sightings that really sent me on a quest to  learn more about the nature of the ufo phenomenon  
you may be thinking oh these are just sightings  how much they can they tell us well no no no even  
a simple sighting can reveal some very interesting  insights into the nature of the ufo phenomena  
and i chose these 10 particular sightings because  i think each of them does contribute some valuable  
insights into the nature of ufos and answers  some of the many questions surrounding them  
and the first case i'd like to talk about is  actually the first case i ever investigated  
and it occurred to my brother mark in 1977.  
UFO CHASE IN RESEDA
i remember the evening very clearly i was 12 maybe  13 years old and mark comes running into the house  
saying i just saw a ufo it was amazing it was  really low it was just above the telephone poles  
it was so cool and we all just kind of looked at  him and shook our heads many people in my family  
were very skeptical of ufos i know i certainly  was i just didn't believe in them uh i was yes  
very young at the time but uh i remember thinking  no way mark you are out of your mind you must have  
uh misperceived it is what i thought and i  just refused to listen and it wasn't until  
1986 when i heard a report on the news about a ufo  sighting over alaska i thought my god this pilot  
he must be crazy he must be misperceiving or  lying or hallucinating he couldn't have seen a ufo  
but his whole crew saw it it appeared on radar it  was a very impressive sighting and it interested  
me and i remembered my brother mark had said  he'd seen a ufo some 10 years earlier and so  
stupidly i approached him and uh this ended  up changing my life forever i'm like mark can  
you tell me about that ufo you saw and he  was absolutely delighted to speak about it  
and that i was interested in it and he  told me this really incredible story  
the sighting occurred in resida california um  just outside of los angeles and uh he mark was  
with his two friends greg randall and phil stevens  and they were just out driving around at night  
as young men will do they were you know 19 20 21  years old young men and had uh just driving around  
through the san fernando valley and they drove  up along the hillside there which overlooks the  
city lights and it provides a really excellent  view of the valley itself and they had no sooner  
pulled over when suddenly this object just boom  appears right in front of their windshield it was  
just a few hundred feet away almost at eye level  and they instantly knew that this was unusual  
it clearly wasn't a helicopter it was totally  silent was covered with colored lights it was  
metallic had a bright white light on top it had  some sort of a triangular super structure on top  
and sort of a rounded bottom each of them provided  slightly different descriptions of what they saw  
but as they were watching this thing it started to  move and as it moved away they chased it in their  
volkswagen microbus and actually chased this  thing for several miles down reseda boulevard  
uh it almost appeared as if this object was  goading them along and that it was aware of them  
and it was very low level at some point as low  as a tree top level and it would hover and then  
it would dart forward really fast move it right  angles and then wait for them and then they'd   chase it along further in fact they passed several  other cars who were also chasing this object and  
i'll just let the witnesses describe what they saw  in their own words starting with my brother mark  
as mark says it was doing too many strange things  to be a helicopter it made a sharp 90 degree turn  
it zigzagged so we started to chase it phil  also agrees it was unusual and as phil says  
it looks sort of like a round bowl on the bottom  it looked like something out of close encounters  
looked like a pyramid almost with a triangle on  top there were lights going up on each side and  
it was pointed in the middle greg randall gives  a very similar description as he says it was disc  
shaped and it was hovering there was no sound it  had a row of lights below it in a u shape all of  
us were totally awestruck we immediately took off  chasing this thing it made a real big impression  
on us i don't know what it was but i know it  wasn't from around here it really freaked us out  
so these three young men kept this object in  view for about 10 maybe 15 minutes they believe  
they yeah they passed other cars also staring  at this thing and chasing it and they chased it  
as far as uh it would let them and uh seem to  be just playing this little cat and mouse game  
with them because when they finally got close to  it it zipped instantly all the way back where it  
had come from many many miles away and was just  this tiny little twinkling object and then it  
darted away and was gone so it looked as if it  really wanted to be seen and it deeply impressed  
all three of them of the three witnesses i think  uh probably greg randall was the most frightened  
uh phil and my brother mark were just deeply  deeply interested in it at any rate it convinced  
all three of them that ufos were real and mark  was really disappointed when no one wanted to hear  
about what he had seen what i find interesting  about this sighting is yeah not only was it  
very low level not only did it seem to be aware of  them but it was shortly after this that my brother  
met his girlfriend christine kisara who would soon  become his wife and i of course became very good  
friends with her as well and she and i began  to work together she's an artist and she would  
illustrate many of the sightings i investigated  and has done the covers for many of my books  
i would often go to ufo conventions together  turns out that she herself has had sightings and  
is in fact a contact tee she had a number of  experiences visitations when she was a little girl  
so i don't know if that's a coincidence or not i  tend to think not because it's just bizarre that  
my brother would end up uh hooked up with someone  who's also has a close relationship with ufos  
and for years and years i assumed  this was just a simple sighting   until something very strange happened uh  one evening mark and christy were just  
sitting on the couch watching tv and christy was  caressing his arm and suddenly she felt this weird  
object in his arm and she started touching it  and poking at it and she's like mark what's this  
and mark looked down he had never even noticed  it before it was this weird object just beneath  
his skin there's no scar there there's no entry  wound but it's like this sort of little tiny metal  
bar about the size of a matchstick and you can  actually feel it you can actually pull it out a  
little bit so you can see the entire shape of this  i've looked at it very close i'm like wow you know  
when did this appear mark has no idea and  finally i convinced him to see a doctor  
i i by this point i had joined mufon become a  field investigator and one of the gentlemen at  
the ufo meeting i became friends with him  he was a doctor and also a ufo researcher  
and i finally convinced mark to meet with him and  this doctor was very eager to see what might be in  
my brother's arm and he examined it and poked  at it and tried you know looked at it as best  
as he could you know beneath the skin and he was  very impressed his eyes went all wide he's like  
do you have any idea when you got this and mark  could only say well i did have a very close up   ufo sighting but i didn't have any missing time  well as far as he knows he didn't but sometimes  
missing time can be seamless but the doctor did  diagnose it as a foreign body he doesn't know  
what it was or what it is my brother has  declined to have it x-rayed or removed or  
doesn't really like to talk about it i mean  he's not shy about it it's just he's a little   shy about all of this but yeah now i'm wondering  if my brother mark may have had direct contact  
i don't know but this phenomenon certainly is in  my family because he's not the only family member  
who has had some very strange experiences and  that brings us to our next case the next sighting  
i want to talk about i call ufos over van nuys air  base my sister-in-law who married my other brother  
was with in her house hanging  out with her friends this was   around the same time as my brother's  sighting maybe a year earlier 1976 1977  
my sister-in-law was in her home in van nuys  california it's a very densely populated area  
and suddenly she and her friends noticed  this weird orange light glowing outside  
so they all went and saw outside all three of  them and they got a real shock there was this  
triangular formation of lights which appeared to  be hovering directly over van nuys airport at a  
very low elevation the formation was one light on  top two on the bottom in a pretty much equilateral  
triangle according to my sister-in-law these  could have been more than just lights because  
sometimes she detected what appeared to be a  metallic tinge to all of these things and it  
was her impression this was one solid  object as she says it was sort of a  
saucer shape they were hovering they formed sort  of a triangle they appeared shiny maybe metallic  
but all this orange glow was coming off them it  was lighting the whole area around them orange  
that's all she really remembers that  this object was hovering in place   and staying perfectly still she  does not remember them moving off  
i find this interesting because her friend  adley remembers things a little bit differently  
he recalls that yes these objects were very bright  and casting this orange light all around the area  
uh he remembers that they uh were very low  directly over the air base but according to  
adlai they weren't perfectly still in the sky they  were darting around a little bit and it was his  
impression that these were three separate objects  in a triangular formation and as he says and  
i quote we saw three lights that appeared to be  moving in unison it seemed like i could have seen  
a shape behind the lights but i couldn't be sure  but i sensed an intelligence behind the lights it  
was a ufo i just naturally accepted the fact that  i caught a glimpse of something going by so i find  
this sighting particularly interesting because  the witnesses do have slightly varying accounts  
of what happened and i now know that that's a red  flag that this could be more than just a sighting  
i don't know a bit on the fence about that but it  was very low level what i find most interesting  
about this sighting is its location it occurred  in a very densely populated area directly over  
van nuys air base ufos do have a tendency to hover  over airports i know of many many cases where they  
have done so they seem to be very interested  in technological installations and i think that  
shows something about the nature of this phenomena  that ets are keeping close tabs on our technology  
so that i think is significant and that's why  i wanted to include this particular sighting  
in this video and now let's move to our next  case which i call mark and the ufos i have a good  
MARK AND THE UFOS
friend by the name of jason hale uh his family and  our family are very good friends with each other  
and at some point jason and his family decided  to move out of california and to hawaii they  
bought some property on the island of maui and  built their own off-grid home and it was here  
that jason had a really interesting encounter  while on maui he befriended a gentleman by  
the name of mark and one day they're driving  along a dirt road on maui and this ufo appears  
as jason says the two of us saw a light around  five thousand six thousand feet up over the ocean  
just this bright light hovering there we stopped  the car to watch it we were watching it for about  
a minute then we started to hear the noise  of an airplane and this object rose up into   the cloud layer the plane came into view and  scared it away and jason was very impressed and  
his friend however was kind of blase and casual  about it and said oh i see these all the time  
and jason said really you've seen these before  and his friend mark said oh yeah yeah i've seen  
them many times and jason asked well how many  times and mark tilted his head and said well  
probably at least 40 times which really impressed  jason and he couldn't doubt mark because  
he had seen this object himself and mark proceeded  to tell talk more about his sightings according  
to mark he says he can sometimes sense  when these objects are going to appear  
because he gets this very strong static electric  feeling in his body whenever they're around  
and sometimes this static electric feeling gets  so strong mark has to take off his shoes and  
ground himself on the lava rocks because  this energy is just pulsating through him  
mark also said that there have been  a number of occasions where his   these objects appear or he can feel them around  and suddenly his walkman radio will turn on by  
itself he believes it's the et's doing it to sort  of announce their presence or play with them or  
because they want him to listen to certain songs  which i find very interesting and on one occasion  
mark got a telepathic message from the ets that  they would show up at a certain location at a  
certain time mark was very excited and gathered  as many people as he could to witness this event  
and that's exactly what he did everyone was  gathered and waiting for these ufos to show up  
and nothing happened it was a bust they did not  show up mark was pretty disappointed it's his  
impression that uh there was too many people there  and that some of them weren't ready to see the   ufos that the ufos had become shy about announcing  their presence to such a large group of people so  
what i find very interesting about this case  is this demonstrates what ufo researchers call  
the repeater problem some people see ufos not  once or twice but over and over and over again  
when investigators first heard about people like  this they wondered about their credibility but we  
now know that this is definitely a thing some  people seem to attract ufos and it's my belief  
that these people are in fact contactees and  that mark is absolutely a contactee on some level  
uh as mark mark believes they're his friends  and that he has some sort of relationship with  
these guys and i think that's exactly what's  going on here and that's why this particular  
sighting is important because it shows that  ufos are purposefully picking on certain people  
seem to be attracted to certain people and are  showing themselves to them on purpose and develop  
a relationship with them so the next case i'd  like to talk about actually occurred over neptune  
and when i say neptune i mean a little town  in southern new jersey the main witness is  
UFOS OVER NEPTUNE
a family friend actually a friend of my eldest  brother and her name is laura b harry and laura  
was staying at our house one evening when i asked  her if she believed in ufos and she says oh yeah  
i had a really interesting sighting when i was  about six years old and i asked her if she would  
share it with me if she'd let me interview her  and she happily agreed and described this really   incredible sighting and uh according to laura it  was 1957 and she was six years old walking home  
from kindergarten with her best friend they lived  only a few blocks from the school and uh this was  
a bright sunny day and as they're walking down the  sidewalk both of their attentions was cert were  
suddenly drawn towards this object that was  swooping down out of the sky towards them it was  
very obvious it started out as sort of a  star-like object in the distance and it   got bigger and bigger and brighter and brighter  and suddenly it was clearly a metallic saucer  
and heading for these electric power lines  right along the street this is a very close  
up very low level sighting laura has three  really distinct memories as a young child  
one is seeing two dogs fighting another is  seeing two dogs making love and the third is  
this incredible ufo sighting as laura says what i  saw was a strange object a silvery object it was  
coming towards us at a strange angle in between  myself and the object there were power lines  
and at the speed it was going it looked like  it was going to crash into the power lines this  
object had a bright bright white light underneath  it and in between this white light and the object  
itself there was this sort of array of rainbow  like colors so it was really beautiful red blue  
green yellow orange it was absolutely gorgeous  and this object comes swooping down super fast  
so fast i thought it was going to crash into the  power lines but instead what does it do it stops  
right over the power lines themselves and just  hovers there and there's all this electricity   going between it and the power lines for  just a few moments at which point this  
object takes off like a bullet and it's just  a blur in the sky and it's gone as laura says  
it zipped off in the opposite direction was  just a blur of light after that and moved like  
something i've never seen move i was amazed i find  this sighting particularly illuminating because  
it shows the tendency of ufos to hover over  power lines this was the first case i had  
in which this happened but it certainly  wouldn't be the last i think probably   ufos are sort of siphoning the electricity out of  power lines and the reason i say that i mean this  
is certainly something many other researchers  have speculated but at one point i was able to   interview a gentleman who had an onboard ufo  experience and he was inside a ufo when this  
exact thing happened and the ets said that that's  what they were doing so yeah i think that's why  
ufos are hovering over power lines and this case  is important because it demonstrates this behavior  
perfectly i think it's also important because it  shows that often many people have sightings at a  
very very young age they're just little kids  and i think ufos do that on purpose because  
kids are non-judgmental they don't discriminate  and they're also very impressionable so this is  
a really good way to sort of convince someone of  their presence i think that's what they're doing  
i think they showed themselves to laura and her  friend on purpose in a way to sort of say hi  
we're real and don't forget us and of course laura  never did it's the only sighting she's ever had  
but it left her with a very deep impression that  ufos are real and it's something she's recalled  
for the rest of her life moving on to the next  case this next case i call the bell vernon ufo  
THE BELLE VERNON UFO INVASION
invasion this occurred in the town of belle vernon  pennsylvania so a lot of sightings in pennsylvania  
and belle vernon is a particular hot spot  the main witness is marlene birkovich  
she's a friend of a friend and as a young  girl seven years old marlene lived with  
her uh two sisters and her family in this town of  belle vernon pennsylvania it's a pretty small town  
but what's interesting is there was a lot of buzz  going around at the time this is the mid-1970s  
about ufo activity in the area about half  the people in this town had seen ufos  
and these ufos had a tendency to hover in this one  particular area in these fields next to the town  
and in these fields there was an abandoned  coal mine so perhaps that was the draw that  
was what was bringing them into this area at  any rate marlene had herself never seen anything  
until one evening mid-1970s she's with her two  sisters her younger sister and her older sister  
in the room uh marlene's about seven years old  and uh suddenly this object shows up right outside  
their window it was actually below treetop level  and right next to their house as marlene says i  
saw one real close it was maybe 20 feet away from  my window like a big helium balloon moving really  
slowly like a big globe it was getting ready  to land up in the fields it was round and it  
had a whole bunch of round windows you could see a  bunch of lights panels flashing on and off inside  
i'm sure that there were people sitting  at the controls but i didn't want to look   i was too scared to scream for my mom because  i thought they might come out and take me  
freeze me or zapped me i didn't know what they  would do i was really scared yeah she could  
actually see in through the portholes of this  craft which was about as big as a small house  
she said and she could see the actual control  panels which were covered with colored lights  
yellow blue green red it was very colorful and the  object itself was a shiny sort of metallic silver  
and a perfect round sphere and maybe 10 20 feet  off the ground and 20 feet away from their window  
totally silent and as it started to move away uh  the girls who had been rooted to the spot at the  
time just watching this uh quickly ran downstairs  and alerted their parents they all ran outside and  
it was still there but now it's off in the  distance and moving away what i find interesting  
about this sighting is not only that it was so  so close to them and they could see inside this  
thing and see the actual panels and instruments  inside this obviously it was a craft of some kind  
but what i think is really important about it is  that this object was being drawn towards these   certain fields where there is an abandoned coal  mine and this is a pattern we absolutely do see  
in a number of cases ufos do seem to be drawn  towards areas where there are mines coal mines  
iron mines gold mines silver mines uranium mines  i mean you name it they're there and that seems to  
be what's going on in this case also interesting  is that following this big wave of sightings  
the government came in and fenced this  whole area off and put up big signs  
government property keep out no trespassing and  uh that i don't think that's a coincidence either  
certainly we've seen that in other areas such as  upstate new york where there are also mines and  
the government purchased a bunch of property and  again i'll put up signs government property keep  
out so it's clear to me our government is aware of  this activity and are doing their best to cover it  
up and keep people away from particular hot spots  also significant about this particular case in  
del vernon is it shows that there are some areas  that are particularly conducive to sightings  
it seems like each state has its ufo hot spot or  each area and certainly that's true in this case
all right moving along next case i'd like to  talk about i call the great san fernando valley  
fireball this occurred to a family member of one  of my co-workers the main witness is joel stein  
The Great San Fernando Valley Fireball
he was a teenager at the time 18 19 years old and  he and his friend were out hiking in the hills  
behind their house in granada hills california  this was a nice warm summer night in 1976.  
again that same time my brother saw a ufo  my sister-in-law must have been a wave of  
sightings at that time at any rate joel is out  there hiking in what was then a pretty rural  
area i mean there was a lot of uh undeveloped  countryside near their homes and they were just  
hiking through the fields having a good time when  suddenly they had a very frightening experience  
this very large object came swooping  down from a very high altitude  
and came right down over their heads  maybe a couple of hundred feet high  
and according to joel this thing covered a  good portion of the sky was absolutely gigantic  
and he said it reminded him of a what it looked  like was a house on fire flying through the air  
when i heard that description i was kind of amazed  because this i've had many people tell me that  
same exact phrase that it looked what they saw  looked like a house on fire flying through the air  
i mean if i had a nickel for every time someone  told me that i'd have well a dollar at least  
uh so yeah joel found and his friend found this  experience very frightening as joel says i look up  
and something caught my eye i remember it looking  so much like a house the size of a house like a  
like a roof it was dark red with an orange  outer layer it looked like a house on fire  
flying through the air it went across the sky i've  never been so scared in my life this scared the  
hell out of me we ran down the street and just  took off they saw it for maybe about a minute  
and uh we're really too frightened to keep  looking at it they were afraid it was chasing them  
uh this thing left a big contrail behind it and uh  scared the living daylights out of them they ran  
from the area kept running all the way up their  street and into the closest home of their homes  
so they ran into joel's friend's home ran upstairs  ran to his bedroom closed the door and sat  
down just breathless and amazed as joel says we  couldn't even talk we just couldn't believe this  
while he described the object as being shaped  like a house he says it was actually much   much bigger than a house he couldn't really tell  because he wasn't sure how high up it was but it  
seemed pretty low they didn't hear any sound but  it did seem to be like covered with this fiery  
sort of corona all around it and they were so  amazed they at first kept quiet they didn't  
want to tell anybody besides they were sure this  was going to be front page news this was going  
to be on the news for sure and the next day it  wasn't it wasn't on any of the news channels  
and they actually went to the newspapers  and looked at the newspapers and nope   there was not one article about it and they were  very disappointed and i asked them i'm like well  
did you report your sighting and no they did not  tell anybody well eventually they did tell their  
parents their parents were very religious and said  oh it sounds like a sign from god joel disagrees  
he thinks it's a genuine ufo and to this day  he's baffled why more people didn't see it  
and why it wasn't in the newspapers and i  think the answer for this is self-evident  
he didn't report it probably a lot of other  people did see it and they didn't report it either  
i think this is important because it goes to show  that any estimates of the number of sightings   is probably vastly underestimated i'm  sure there are a lot more sightings out  
there than are officially recorded because  most people do not report their sightings  
it's not one in ten it's closer to one in a  hundred people who actually report their sighting  
and uh this sighting um joel says was absolutely  the scariest experience of his entire life  
he's never seen a ufo before or since he  doesn't believe he had a missing time or   was abducted or anything like that but he  certainly will never forget it just because  
this thing came down and seemed to be targeting  them it swooped right over their heads and just  
scared the living daylights out of them joel says  he's been a lot of scary situations since then  
but nothing came close to the fear he  felt with this one particular sighting
so the next setting i'd like to talk  about i call a cluster of colored lights  
A CLUSTER OF COLORED LIGHTS
this occurred in 1965 in the town of gardena  california again this is a pretty densely  
populated suburb outside of los angeles  county and the main witness is adam reid  
and although adam was four years old just  a little tyke he remembers it vividly  
at the time his family was having a  party there was a lot of people there  
and uh the father went outside and suddenly came  running back inside and said everyone come outside  
there's a ufo so a group of about 10 people  ran outside including adam and adam was  
absolutely shocked because he saw this object  which he at first thought was a helicopter  
except it was making no sound and it was covered  with colored lights in fact it looked like a  
cluster of colored lights about seven or eight of  them each was a different color very soft pastel  
colors of orange yellow red pink blue green  it was really beautiful and it was maybe a  
hundred feet high and at first it was moving in  a straight line but then it stopped it hovered  
in place and it started darting around as if  quartering the neighborhood looking for something  
at least that was adam's impression as adam says  it was traveling in a straight line faster than i  
was used to seeing things move then it stopped and  hovered like a helicopter then it kind of scooted  
across the sky in a zigzag fashion like zip  zip zip it zigzagged across the sky quite a bit  
to me it impressed me very much that it was  looking for something it was almost right over us  
so they watched it for just a few minutes maybe  five minutes at most when it finally darted off  
and as adam says there was a long debate about  what it was it was one of those things in  
childhood that you just don't forget today as an  adult he's absolutely convinced it was a genuine  
ufo and what i find very interesting about this  encounter is some years later he brought it up  
to his family and some of the family members  who were there do not remember this sighting  
at all it was completely erased from  their memory and they were there  
which is interesting because other family  members remember it very vividly including  
adam adam was also impressed that it was looking  for something which really makes me wonder and  
having investigated ufos for many years i've come  to realize that one person's sighting is probably  
another person's abduction so it wouldn't surprise  me a bit if that ufo came down and had scooped  
someone up and was doing their thing and uh had  abducted somebody so that i find it interesting  
and also because the way it was looking  around and sort of quartering the neighborhood   searching for something and another thing i find  interesting is the this weird uh amnesia problem  
why is it that some family members don't remember  this at all i don't think that's the human  
mind doing this because often we do see memory  problems associated with ufos particularly with  
onboard experiences so that's a big red flag to  me that maybe this was more than just a sighting  
very hard to say but again i think it's important  because this sighting shows that there are weird  
amnesia problems associated not only with onboard  ufo encounters but sometimes with simple sightings  
or maybe this was more than a simple sighting  it was very low and when a ufo gets within a  
hundred feet of a witness that to me is another  red flag so we've got two major red flags here in  
this case that make me think that this could have  very well been more than just a simple sighting
the next case i want to talk about occurred  to a gentleman by the name of arnie  
weiler he's in the film business as my father  was he was a friend of my father's and uh this  
THE TERMINAL TOWER SIGHTING
sighting occurred in the early 1960s in downtown  cleveland ohio it was a bright sunny afternoon and  
arnie weiler was on a metro bus when he  was passing by this area the city center  
and in the city center of cleveland there's this  huge building called the terminal tower it's a  
very famous building it's a very famous landmark  and uh arnie looks out the window of the bus and  
gets a real shock everyone was watching this  hundreds of people saw this uh surrounding the  
terminal tower there was a group of metallic disks  four or five of them as arnie says i was on a bus  
there's a building in the square where all  the streets meet called the terminal tower   i looked up and saw what looked like discs  of light there were several of them and one  
larger one off to the side everybody saw them  and it was printed in the cleveland newspaper  
according to arnie these objects were mostly  white but they did have a sort of a colorful   corona surrounding them that was sort of a blue  purple color that would fade in and out in sort of  
this sort of pulsating fashion and these objects  just hovered there he wanted to watch them further  
but he was on the bus and the bus didn't stop and  they just drove by but he saw them very clearly  
and they were clearly solid disks and  couldn't tell if they were metallic or  
not because they were glowing so brightly but  as far as he knows they were completely silent  
very close to the building itself and really  impressed him deeply that these were not  
anything normal and yeah it did appear in the  newspapers the next day and as he recalls that  
there somebody did in fact capture photographs of  them unfortunately i was not able to locate the  
newspaper article but yeah it's a very impressive  sighting which is important here i think because  
this particular sighting shows the tendency  of ufos to put on a display often ufo behavior  
seems to be evasive as if they don't want to  be seen but sometimes it's the opposite they  
obviously want to be seen and will sort of put on  a little show for the witnesses and that seems to  
be what's going on in this case as if they want  to be seen as if to announce their presence  
so that i think makes this case particularly  significant that and also that it was in a very  
urban area and also that it was very widely  viewed which again makes me think ufos are  
putting on a publicity campaign announcing  their presence bit by bit to you know either  
to small groups of people singly or large  groups of people has happened in this case  
and that brings us to the next case which is also  a display i call this next case the pacoima ufo  
display this occurred in 1968 over the town of  pocoyma california and the main witnesses are  
THE PACOIMA UFO DISPLAY
the tanoe family the tanoi family consists of four  members the father the mother and two young boys  
uh ron to nowhere the gentleman i interviewed was  about seven years old at the time of this sighting  
and how it all began is they were driving  home one evening there were a couple of   miles from their home when his father noticed  this very bright star-like object harboring it  
what appeared to be a pretty low elevation  in the sky a couple of thousand feet up   at the highest he says look everyone what's that  keep your eye on it that does not look normal  
and uh he had to keep his eye on the road  and uh he quickly drove home and got you  
know parked the car and uh everyone got out  of the car and were staring at this thing  
ron's father rushed inside to grab his binoculars  he had been in the military and was able to obtain  
a pair of very powerful binoculars they were huge  and he looked at him through binoculars and was  
really impressed because through binoculars you  could actually see the shape of this thing which  
was sort of cigar shaped and it was very very  bright ron also looked at this object through  
the binoculars as did every family member but  as ron says and i quote it was very bright  
almost piercing to the eye it would lose  brightness and change shape it looked almost  
like an oval with two end points it would make  vertical movements up and down then a 90 degree  
angle to the left or right it was just so  quick it was amazing then it seemed like  
it was getting closer and closer and it got to  the point where you could see like portholes   or brighter lights coming out of certain portions  at this point some of them started to get nervous  
ron's mother and younger brother retreated  back inside the home but ron's father was very  
interested in this thing he was familiar with all  kinds of aircraft and was not able to identify it  
and kept looking out through the binoculars and  pointing out these strange features to his son ron  
and they were wondering if these were portholes  that they were looking at or lights along the edge  
of this object and as they were watching it it  started to release smaller objects first one came  
out and it hovered to the left side of this object  and sort of started darting around a little bit  
and then another object came out and it hovered  over to the right side of this object and at this  
point all three objects are just sort of moving  around in these tight sort of sharply defined  
motions wasn't going all across the sky it was  staying pretty much in the same area but going  
up and down and back and forth and moving in  ways that completely defy conventional aircraft  
couldn't have been a helicopter definitely  wasn't a plane or a balloon or a meteor or a   shooting star or a satellite or anything like this  they estimate it was yeah maybe 2000 feet high  
very hard to say because i couldn't quite tell  how large this object was but given that it was  
releasing smaller objects at that point they  realized that this object was a bit bigger than   they thought and that it was perhaps a mother ship  and that these smaller craft were maybe 10 20 feet  
in diameter pure speculation they really couldn't  tell but it impressed them very deeply and at this  
point ron was almost beside himself he started to  get a little antsy a little scared as he says i  
started getting scared i was getting skittish and  kept wondering if these guys were going to land  
here and take me away or something like that i ran  inside and told my mom call the police i was all  
excited i ran back outside and told my dad come  back in come back in his father of course refused  
his father wasn't the least bit afraid he was just  very very curious about what possibly this thing  
could be it was almost as if it was putting on  a little show for them and uh ron uh gathered  
his courage back up and kept stayed out there and  kept looking at this thing through the binoculars  
for over an hour this object stayed there  for a very long time and at some point these  
smaller objects either they darted away or perhaps  went back inside the larger object they couldn't  
quite tell but after these smaller objects  disappeared the larger object it didn't move away  
instead it slowly faded away became dimmer and  dimmer and or turned invisible perhaps and within  
a matter of seconds it was gone but this left  ron a absolute believer in ufos and impressed him  
very very deeply that ufos are real as he  says i'll remember it for the rest of my  
life i don't disbelieve in ufos i believe  in them i believe there is something there  
and i like this case because it has a number  of really interesting features that provide an  
insight into this phenomena one is that these  objects can be very large and sometimes contain  
smaller craft another is that they will put on  these displays and sort of show themselves off  
i think this behavior is very intentional and  i'm speculating that the purpose of this type of  
display is to convince people of their presence  sort of a grassroots publicity campaign which  
i think is leading towards the et agenda to  openly announce their presence and have direct  
contact with humanity at large i think  that will happen and perhaps very soon  
i sure hope so but we will see at any rate this  is the type of behavior investigators do call a  
ufo display and shows that in some cases ufos have  no fear of being seen but instead want to be seen
and now we get to the last case and the last case  i want to talk about i call an unsolved mystery  
AN UNSOLVED MYSTERY
this occurred in downtown burbank california  over a very densely populated area in fact  
this occurred directly over nbc studios and it  occurred on july 15 1992 at that time there was  
a huge wave of sightings uh in the nearby  mountains so that could be related to this  
but yeah this is over a very densely populated  area and how it all began was when one of the  
employees at nbc had an impulse to walk  outside of the building the main witness  
i interviewed actually interviewed two gentlemen  who saw this the first witness is eric weissman  
and the second one this is john dunn they  are both employees for the television program  
unsolved mysteries which is an interesting  coincidence in and of itself but at any rate  
eric weissman felt this impulse to just go outside  this was during the evening and they were doing  
telescening sort of getting the they worked  behind the scenes uh with the photographic uh  
group of uh this production company for  unsolved mysteries and eric weissman  
walked outside and had a feeling that someone  was looking at him and he looked around and  
didn't see anything at first turned around and  looked up and was shocked to see this object and  
he said that it was quote almost as if it was  calling me it was this very strangely shaped  
object you couldn't quite tell what shape it was  and it was just hovering there maybe two thousand  
three thousand feet high directly over nvc  studios as he says this thing was very steady  
very large and did not move it did not budge  in the sky it just sat there for a long time  
it looked like a square or a rectangle it was a  dark mass but at times i picked up a silverish  
red tinge it was definitely a solid mass well  eric could hardly believe his eyes so he did  
the first thing anyone should do when they see a  ufo is get another witness so eric ran back inside  
and told john come outside come outside you  have got to see this and john dunn thought  
that his co-worker was uh maybe had spotted some  pretty lady or something and so he casually walks  
outside not realizing he's just about to have  one of the most amazing encounters of his life  
and john dunn steps outside and gets a real shock  you can see this object hovering two thousand feet  
high and uh he gets a very strange feeling  because he's skeptical of ufos and uh didn't  
really believe in them never really gave them  much thought despite actually you know working on   unsolved mysteries the program and he was shocked  at what he was seeing as john says and i quote  
we were actually working on a ufo story that  day it's pretty strange it looked like a pen  
top it just sat there it was a really weird  feeling because i could not identify it at all  
it was just hovering just sitting there i was a  little startled by it your mind starts wondering  
what could it be we looked at it and the object  almost morphed a little bit almost as it was as  
if it was changing shape kind of like twisting so  as they watched it changed from a square shape to  
sort of a triangular shape to almost a cylindrical  shape and just a weird shape it was morphing and  
twisting and uh just staying rock steady in the  sky which again is a feature we see in many ufo  
encounters as if this thing is like stone still  in the sky just not moving even a little bit  
but it was changing shape turns out eric is a  kite enthusiast he has all kinds of kites he loves  
kites and that was his first thought  like well maybe this thing was a kite   it was a very windy night and  they're looking at this thing and  
that was his first thought but it clearly wasn't  a kite it wasn't moving even a little bit clearly  
wasn't a plane or a helicopter it was totally  silent obviously it couldn't have been a satellite   or a balloon or ball lightning or anything that  they could readily identify and they just stared  
at it and were really surprised when this thing  started changing shape which is again a rare  
detail that we do see in a number of these  ufo sighting reports and after staring at it  
for several minutes uh eric just couldn't take it  anymore he's like i have to go see if we can get  
closer to this thing because they were looking at  a kind of a 45 degree angle and so he decided he  
was going to get in his car and drive directly  underneath it and so he quickly walks over to  
his car keeping his eyes glued to the object he's  still watching it as he gets in his car and closes  
the door and he looks down to turn the car on  you know put the key in and start the ignition  
and he looks up and the object is gone it's just  disappeared he jumps out and runs over to uh john  
he's like where is it where is it and john's  like i don't know it just disappeared it's gone   they didn't see it move away it was  just there and then it wasn't there  
gone and both of them were very deeply  impressed that this was something that they had  
never seen before eric is absolutely  convinced it was a genuine ufo john who um  
tried to cling to his skepticism but admits  that uh he cannot explain it as john says  
it was just a really weird experience i have  no idea what it was i'm not saying it's a ufo  
all i know is that it wasn't anything i've ever  seen and it was just sitting there so i think this  
case is important uh for a number of reasons i  think it's a funny coincidence that they were both  
working with the television program unsolved  mysteries on a ufo story that day makes me  
wonder if the ufo knew that and i also find it  very interesting that john i mean i'm sorry that  
eric felt the strong impulse to go outside  and felt like somebody was watching them  
and actually stated that directly that  he felt like this thing was calling out  
to him uh this was one of the first cases i've  had where people describe this sort of strong  
impulse to go outside but i've since then heard it  many times and i don't think that's a coincidence  
i think ufos are telepathically calling out to  people and again this is sort of a display a  
way for these ufos to announce their presence  i'm wondering if these ufo occupants are like   hey these guys are working on a ufo program and  this other guy john doesn't even believe in us  
let's call them out and show them that we're real  of course that's pure speculation but having heard  
so many people describe these strong impulse  to go outside and then they see a ufo i really  
wonder and it looks like that's what's happening  in this case i also find it very interesting  
the location of this sighting that it was  directly over nbc studios a major media company  
so that also is significant i was always under the  impression that ufos were seen in very rural areas  
well that's actually not true certainly there  are sightings of ufos in rural areas but there  
are just as many sightings in suburban areas and  urban areas as well and that's true in this case  
and that's why i wanted to include the sighting in  this list so these 10 sightings yeah they're among  
the first group of sightings i investigated  and i chose these 10 sightings in particular  
because as i said they each have something  significant to contribute to our understanding  
of the ufo phenomena and each of these details  i pointed out are things that i've heard over  
and over again from other people one thing i do  find very interesting about these sightings is  
that none of these witnesses were alone when they  saw these ufos not one of them every single one  
of them had witnesses along with them sometimes it  was just a couple of people but other times it was  
you know a dozen or even like in a couple of  cases like arnie weiler's case at the terminal   tower at least a hundred people saw this thing  so yeah they've got many interesting things to  
say about ufos uh as we've seen many of these  sightings occur over dense population centers  
i think that's important the impulse to  look outside that turns up in many cases  
their strange morphing abilities the fact  that some of these craft are very very large  
and that they may contain other craft little  smaller craft i think that's important  
i think it's also important that none of these  ten sightings appeared in any newspaper or any  
television program none of them received any  publicity at all really so that i think shows  
that any estimates of how common ufo sightings  are way wrong they're way way low the national  
ufo reporting center new fork and the mutual  ufo network mufon each receive dozens of sites  
uh citing reports daily so if only one person in  a hundred is reporting their citing and we have 20  
say i'll give you a low figure i think it's more  than that 20 recorded sightings a day well we  
could if you were to times that by 10 that would  be 200 but if you were to times that by 100 well  
i mean that's 2 000 sightings daily uh which would  mean that at any given second really or any given  
minute someone is having a close encounter so i  think this is an ongoing phenomena and uh is much  
much more common than people most people believe  because most people do not report their sighting  
another thing i think that turns up in a number  of these cases is that weird display type behavior  
which again shows that ufos have a campaign an  agenda to announce their presence they're very  
carefully doing the sort of publicity campaign and  showing themselves to people which again i think  
is leading towards open official contact they  want us to know that they are real but they're  
announcing their presence in a way that won't  completely send off an atom bomb in society  
um they're doing it as gently as possible  and getting us used to their presence  
another thing i find very interesting is that  a number of these sightings could very well be   more than sightings i mean if someone is feeling  physical effects if these objects are getting  
very very low level 100 feet or lower if these if  someone walks away uh with some sort of physical  
reaction such as an implant i mean or memory  problems these are all red flags that is more  
than just a sighting and that some sort of  contact took place on a much deeper level  
including up to the possibility  of actual onboard ufo experience
another thing that i find interesting is at  least in one of these cases is this ufo's  
tendency to hover over power lines we've seen this  over and over again and again this shows uh gives  
us a little bit of insight into the nature of  these ufo engines and that perhaps are able to  
siphon electricity out of power lines and also  points to the you know relationship between  
ufos and power outages which has occurred  many many times a good example is the  
great new york blackout which was directly  tied to a large cluster of ufo sightings  
in new york state so the most important factor i  think is that each and every single one of these  
witnesses was deeply deeply impressed they do not  believe they saw anything that could be explained  
as weather phenomena or as you know astronomical  phenomena or any type of conventional aircraft  
or balloon or anything human-made all of them are  convinced pretty much without exception that this  
was something probably not from here  extraterrestrial uh all of them are very very  
deeply impressed to the point that they pretty  much all believe in ufos now and it's something  
that they will remember for the rest of their  lives and that i think is the real takeaway here  
so that's this episode for for today i want  to thank you once again for watching i really  
appreciate it i hope you've enjoyed it and  as i always like to say keep having fun
