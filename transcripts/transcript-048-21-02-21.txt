CALIFORNIA UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS
Feb 21, 2021

Summary:
Feb 21, 2021
When people think of UFO crashes, the Roswell UFO Incident is usually the first to be mentioned. But the truth is, the Roswell UFO crash is only one of hundreds of similar cases involving UFO crash/retrievals. California alone has at least a dozen documented accounts of UFOs that have crashed and been retrieved (and sometimes reverse-engineered) by the United States military.

Several military bases across California have allegedly been involved in UFO crash/retrievals including Edwards Air Force Base, Camp Pendleton, Sunnyvale Naval Air Station, Norton Air Force Base and more. What does our government know, and why are they hiding the truth? If California has more than a dozen cases, how many cases are there?

The time for disclosure is now. If the US government truly has obtained UFOs and alien bodies, they should disclose the truth. This video provides a little glimpse into the history of UFO crash/retrievals in California. More than likely, this is only the tip of iceberg.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and the title of today's episode is california 
ufo crash retrievals the most famous ufo crash is probably the roswell ufo crash of 1947 which 
took place outside of roswell new mexico but it's certainly not the only one there 
are hundreds of cases of these kind including many which come from the state of california 
these cases are very important I think they are one of the most important front lines  of ufo research because they represent actual conclusive proof of ufo reality and yet it's 
being all this evidence is being withheld uh from the public using our own tax dollars 
uh there are a dozen cases i'd like to share with you uh coming from california and these 
i'll tell these all in chronological order so we can just get a little glimpse into what's going on 
in just one state in the united states and the first case i'd like to discuss took place 
back in 1942 actually it was re first revealed a decade later in 1952 by a gentleman by the name of 
joe rohrer of pikes peak radio company joe told researcher harold wilkins that he had spoken 
firsthand with an air pilot who had actually been inside a recovered saucer which was being held 
in a california military base way back in 1942. according to joe rohrer and i'm 
quoting him directly a little man from a saucer is being tenderly cared for in the incubator room 
at san diego while cadavers of two saucer pilots are being dissected by surgeons of the u.s army 
air force medical division a california air pilot told me that in 1942 he had been right inside a 
giant saucer and seen giant flywheels sheathed in metal skins and found that the motive force came 
from electrostatic turbines whose flywheels created an electromagnetic field of force 
creating tremendous speeds the little saucer men have a small bony structure smaller than earth men 
but the bones are proportionally heavier and their stomachs smaller so that's a very early case which 
predates roswell by several years and uh there are many others here's another case which comes from 
mufon western regional director paul cerny this case took place in a little carrot 
patch outside of salinas california on a summer morning in 1947 really around the same time as 
the roswell ufo crash and as it turns out many others the main witness was anonymous is today 
a successful businessman but back then he was 19 years old and working at this little farm outside 
of salinas at the time he and his fellow worker were cutting hay when the ranch foreman told 
them that a strange object had come down in the field and it and that it was actually still there 
so they went and looked at it and the witness told paul cerny that the object was a large disc 
nine feet in diameter four feet high and was made of a dull gray metal there were small rectangular 
portholes around the rim of the craft otherwise there was no other markings and no evidence of 
any damage the witnesses walked around the object and finally stepped up to it and actually kicked 
it there was no reaction other than they heard a hollow metallic clanging noise and shortly later 
that the u.s military showed up and confiscated the craft warning the witnesses not to discuss 
what they had seen as uh mufon western regional director paul cerny says and i'm quoting they 
instructed the two men to get lost and warned them not to breathe a word about what they had seen 
from a distance the witness and his companion observed the military group proceed to struggle 
the vehicle onto the truck bed cover it with a tarp secure it and drive off that was the last 
they saw or heard of it inquiring before man later they learned that the ranch owners had informed 
the military authorities of the object's presence so that's another case of so many cases of this 
kind it makes me wonder just how many crashed and recovered ufos the military has out there
for example another very interesting tidbit of testimony comes from researcher 
leonard stringfield who's a true pioneer in the field of ufo crash retrievals he was the first 
researcher to systematically collect these types of reports and he talked to a gentleman uh from 
california by the name of leon christ according to leon he and his wife were watching a television 
news story about a crashed ufo and according to leon and i'm quoting it was about 1948 maybe later 
when my wife and I were watching the news on our new tv set that a disc shaped object was shown 
stuck slightly tilted in a sand dune it had a dome at the top and no windows according to leon the 
newscaster said the object crashed on the mexican border near the rio grande and said that bodies 
had actually been recovered and that the craft had been shipped to an air base in california 
at that point the sound on the tv was cut off and the picture went black so it was apparently 
censored and leon christ and his wife never heard another word of the incident but always 
remembered it remembered what they had seen and eventually did report it to researcher  leonard stringfield so it's more evidence that there's stuff going on at california 
air force bases then the public is being told another very early case and somewhat controversial 
comes from a gentleman by the name of roy dimick according to some sources his name is ray dimick
mr roy dimick was a sales manager for an explosives company in los 
angeles and was a fairly well-known amateur golfer so uh sort of a public figure and on march 9th 
1950 roy dimmick kind of dropped a bombshell when he told the la times that he was on a 
business trip to mexico when he observed a crashed saucer according to ray this object was 46 feet in 
diameter the wreckage contained the body of at least one humanoid about 23 inches tall with a 
big head and a small body and this is what the la times reported the article caused a sensation and 
roy was contacted by many people but he refused to give any further details 
and the case was later dismissed by some researchers as being a hoax though today 
other researchers are now raising questions and questioning if the case was in fact valid 
whatever the case may be roy dimick denied ever having seen this saucer he later denied ever 
having seen it and said that he actually only saw a piece of it and that the actual witnesses were 
quote his business associates so there was a little bit of back peddling there perhaps 
he had been threatened I don't know but as we've seen this sort of thing turns up a lot witnesses 
are threatened not to talk and sometimes even more severe action is taken for example uh 
here's another case which comes again from leonard stringfield involving a gentleman by the name of 
buddy hack he was a cpo radar observer who was stationed at sunnyvale 
naval air station this is again in california and while he was stationed at the base he witnessed an 
actual recovered extraterrestrial craft as leonard stringfield writes and i'm quoting him directly 
buddy hack according to testimony received from members of his family had accidentally entered 
a door of a large hangar temporarily unguarded and saw a huge round saucer-shaped craft with a 
row of windows a guard shut the door in his face and ordered him to forget what he had seen or else 
two years following this incident uh buddy hacks plane mysteriously disappeared without any trace 
outside of san diego uh researchers were able to confirm with buddy's family members the whole 
story and in fact buddy's mother recalls her son often saying it was certainly no aircraft of ours 
so it could be that buddy uh did have an unfortunate accident or that he was actually 
silenced by our own government for going public to his family and to researchers uh 
and I tend to think uh the latter because of what happens in several of these other cases 
another case which comes from leonard springfield took place at edwards air force base 
which has a long history of ufo encounters  and uh according to leonard stringfield and i'm quoting my information for one known ufo crash 
comes from a professional employee in a technical position at a large general electric plant his 
brother who wishes to be unnamed was on duty as a radar specialist at edwards air force base in 1952 
when he saw a ufo descending toward earth at great speed across his radar screen when the ufo 
was confirmed to have crashed the captain on duty gave him instructions you didn't see anything the 
specialist learned a short time later from base officials that an unidentified craft did crash 
in a nearby remote desert area the retrieved craft was more than 50 feet in diameter with a 
row of windows around its equator its metallic surface was in a burned blackened condition he 
also heard that the craft was occupied by humanoid bodies approximately four and a half feet tall 
so according to leonard stringfield's source the craft was only being temporarily stored 
at edwards air force base before being shipped to wright-patterson air force base 
in ohio which is of course well known for collecting extraterrestrial material 
so i'm telling you there are many cases here's another case which occurred in july of 1952 
which comes from pioneering researcher harold t wilkins who received the following letter from 
a gentleman in oklahoma as the letter reads on a business trip to san francisco last week I met a 
nice reliable fellow who heard from a pal in the u.s air force that they have captured a little 
a little fellow three feet tall from a forced down saucer and are keeping him alive in a 
pressure chamber somewhere in california he comes from another planet and was one of three others 
killed in a crash caused by radar in an arizona desert in 1950 they are showing him pictures and 
teaching him to read and write and understand so while that crash did take place in arizona 
apparently one of the humanoids was taken alive back to air force base in california 
where he is communicating with air force officials so really remarkable and there's 
just so many cases like these another really interesting case occurred at camp pendleton 
i find that interesting because camp pendleton has been implicated in other ufo cases and other 
cases of this kind actually this case took place in 1967 to a marine officer who was stationed 
at campbell camp pendleton he was an officer from the canine corps and reports that he and 
his team were flown to an undisclosed location uh somewhere in the california desert they were 
put on guard duty uh guarding this hangar and the officer whose initials are rc became uh curious 
about the contents of the hangar that they were guarding and on his fourth day at the location 
his curiosity got the better of him and he decided to take a peek inside this hanger to his shock he 
observed a 30 foot wide metallic saucer with a dome on top and the craft itself was surrounded 
by people who were working on the craft with a variety of instruments 
seconds later rc was grabbed by a security officer and immediately escorted to the headquarters tent 
where he was reminded of his security oath he had an alpha red top secret crypto clearance 
and he was sent back to camp pendleton for reassignment 
when he went public with his story several years later in 1980 
he suffered a series of harassments and threats from apparent government agents 
he continued to speak publicly but then his fiancee was killed in a mysterious hit-and-run 
accident after that rc severed all connections with researchers and refused to share any further 
ufo information so as you can see our government and governments across the world for that 
matter are very serious about covering up this information and this case is interesting to me 
because I know of another case which took place at camp pendleton involving a gentleman I call ramon 
i already did a prior video about that about ramon's experiences at camp pendleton but in short 
he was taken to a hangar and actually shown what appeared to be a captured ufo 
if you want to learn more about it it's in the video  called is the u.s military working with reptilians or are reptilians working with the u.s military 
but it's just more evidence that our government has in fact captured these 
objects and are reverse engineering them and another very interesting and compelling case 
i think was first uncovered by dr stephen greer and involves a gentleman by the name of kent 
selen in 1973 kent worked at edwards air force base in southern california as a crew chief 
for the experimental aircraft division one evening kent's supervisor told him to drive out 
to the north base to pick up a defective ground power unit this was not an unusual request 
however kent hoped to save some time instead of taking the longer more circuitous perimeter route 
the perimeter road to the north base he decided to just drive directly to it right across the dry 
lake bed this turned out to be an unlucky decision because as he's reaching his destination he came 
upon a series of a row of quonset huts and the door to the first hut was cracked open and he 
stopped and looked inside and to his shock he saw a typical flying saucer it was hovering right 
above the ground nothing attached to it and in fact as kent says and i'm quoting this thing was 
flat on the bottom sloping sides I wasn't there for 15 seconds when I heard footsteps running 
up to me and before I could even turn around and look there was a machine gun barrel at my throat 
a gruff voice said close your eyes and get on the ground or were going to blow your head off 
kent selen said that he was immediately blindfolded a hood was placed over his 
head and he was taken to a small room where he was debriefed for a period of no less than 18 
straight hours and during this very intense debriefing he was told that the craft was in 
fact extraterrestrial and operated using a form of anti-gravity so again might not be a good idea 
to just stumble upon something like this because our government will take 
very serious action against individuals who divulge this kind of information 
one air force base that has been repeatedly implicated in this these kinds of cases is norton 
air force base located in southern california one account comes from researcher john lear 
and it involves an air force photographer who goes by the name of mike in 1973 
mike told john lear that his security clearance was suddenly upgraded to top secret 
and he was flown to norton air force base for a temporary assignment upon landing at the base 
he was told he was going to photograph a ufo and the autopsy of three deceased extraterrestrials he 
was given a white smock and boots and was escorted into an underground installation where he observed 
a metallic disc shaped craft 30 feet in diameter it was suspended from a net 
hanging from a large crane mike was taken inside the craft itself and towed 
told to photograph the control panels and other fixtures which he did 
afterwards he was taken outside the craft and told to photograph it from various angles 
and finally he was taken to another room where he photographed three deceased extraterrestrials mike 
described them as being very much human-looking except that their eyes were larger their skin was 
very pale white and all of them were about five feet tall and dressed in blue uniforms 
he reports that afterwards he was driven back to norton air force base and was then sent out of 
state for reassignment it's a very interesting case uh here's another really interesting case 
which got leaked out through the grapevine so to speak this occurred again at norton air force 
base but on november 12 1988 the main witness is aircraft patent specialist brad sorenson who was 
with his client a former secretary of defense they had decided to attend a air show at norton air 
force base when they were both invited into this special room where ufo craft were being displayed
this was not something that the defense secretary had been expecting and actually he actually told 
brad sorensen quote there are a lot of things in here that it didn't expect they were going 
to have on display stuff you probably shouldn't be seeing so don't talk to anybody don't ask any 
questions just keep your mouth shut smile and nod but don't say anything just enjoy the show we're 
going to get out of here as soon as we can so brad sorenson realized he had gotten himself into 
a little bit of hot water here and just agreed to follow the defense secretary and keep quiet 
but after the event brad sorensen did spill the beans he talked to his associate 
a gentleman by the name of a mark mccandlish who's also an aerospace design expert 
and he told mark exactly what he saw according to mark mccandlish and again i'm quoting 
they go in and they turn the lights on and here are three flying saucers floating off the floor no 
cables suspended from the ceiling holding them up no landing gear underneath just floating hovering 
above the floor they had little exhibits with the videotape running showing the smallest of the 
three vehicles sitting in the desert presumably over a dry lake bed some place like area 51 
so he listened intently and collected as much information as he could and when  he came back he told me how he had seen these three flying saucers in this hangar 
at norton air force base on november 12 1988 brad said that in this exhibit at norton air force base 
a three-star general said that these vehicles were capable of doing light speed or better
so it's a very interesting case to say the least and again not the only one involving norton 
air force base one additional case comes from a gentleman who is very very highly placed within 
the us government a junction by the name of lieutenant colonel john williams back in 1964 
williams had joined the air force and he became a helicopter rescue pilot in vietnam he then 
obtained a degree in electrical engineering and was put in charge of major construction projects 
for the military air command and because of this sort of need to know 
status he was allowed access to numerous highly secure facilities including norton air force base 
and lieutenant colonel john williams says that he has actually been given specific permission 
by his superiors to discuss what's going on or at least some of what's going on  at norton air force base involving crash recovered ufos and reversed engineering of alien technology 
according to lieutenant colonel john williams and i'm quoting I can discuss norton air force base 
there was one facility at norton air force base that was close hold  not even the wing commander there could know what was going on during that time period it 
was always rumored by the pilots that that was a cover for in fact the location of one ufo craft 
the reason for that location was that folks could come out land at norton play golf be part of a 
golf tournament and so forth and during that process could go by the facility and actually 
see the ufo but I was never allowed in that area when I was there at norton air force base 
i heard this during my vietnam career when I was a rescue helicopter pilot it was there that I heard 
several stories along that line from different pilots all that was known because it was so close 
hold was the fact that this facility did contain a ufo the time period would have been in 1969 
to 1970 when I heard that first and I validated that the facility did in fact exist in the 1982 
time period because I was responsible for that basis facilities from 1981 to 1982. 
lieutenant colonel john williams also added that and i'm quoting it's my understanding that 
bob dole senator bob dole also candidate for u.s president was at that facility it's also possible 
that back in the early 1950s that eisenhower actually visited that facility 
so these are just some of the cases uh that have occurred uh across the united states 
uh specifically here in california there is of course the very famous incident in 1954 
when president eisenhower disappeared from public view supposedly during a golfing tournament 
and was allegedly taken to edwards air force base  where he had a face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials and saw craft that were 
at the base i'm not sure if that's specifically a crash retrieval type incident at any rate it's a 
much longer story and very controversial and too much information to go in here 
but as you can see from the dozen cases that i've just covered reaching back to at least 1942 
it looks like california has a very long history of these types of cases in fact 
during the battle of los angeles this was a very famous incident which took place in 1942 over la 
where a number of ufos were seen over culver city one actually parked over culver city for a 
period of four hours pretty high up in the sky while uh the army shot more than 2500 rounds 
of ammunition at it trying to bring it down the entire city was on blackout at this time 
five people ended up losing their lives because of falling debris a car accidents heart attacks 
things like this and it was later learned that possibly a couple of these craft had 
actually been shot down according to some u.s documents as uncovered by researcher bob wood 
yeah there was in fact ufos recovered back in 1942 during the la air raid the battle of l.a 
so california has quite a history of ufo crash retrievals in fact i'm guessing 
that most states do certainly the states i've looked at in any detail have I covered these 
california cases in my book ufos over california covered them all in detail 
and I was shocked to learn how many there are and how long this sort of thing has been going on 
the reason I wanted to do this video is because I feel like these cases are extremely important 
as I said they represent one of the most important front lines of ufo research that really have the 
potential to change the world of this technology were released we could move off of fossil fuels 
and solve the energy crisis and the economic crisis and environmental crisis all in one swoop 
so these cases are really crucially important also because they represent absolute conclusive 
proof of ufo reality while people often call ufos a mystery I think in military circles 
this is not a mystery at all they know exactly what these things are because they have them 
they have the craft they have the bodies they have the e.t technology and they're they've 
been trying to understand it and study it for a very long time and using our own tax dollars 
so that's why I think this information should be very widely known and that's why I did this video 
thanks once again for watching I hope you've enjoyed it and until next time keep having fun
