UFOS AND THE AMERICAN SITCOM
Dec 6, 2024

Summary:
Dec 6, 2024
UFOs appear in virtually all forms of media. Advertising, video-games, feature films, literature, radio, podcasts, social media platforms on the internet, and especially television. Countless documentaries, dramas, and reality TV shows have explored every facet of this subject. One form of television program that has prominently featured UFOs is the situation comedy.

Situation comedies first appeared on television in 1947, coinciding almost exactly with the dawn of the Modern Age of UFOs. Sitcoms are well-known for being accurate yardsticks measuring the current state of American culture. Sitcoms have the unique domain to express current values and morals. Whether it’s the wholesome family image of The Brady Bunch, or the satirical sarcasm of Married with Children, sitcoms broadcast a powerful message. They tell us what to wear, how to behave and what to believe in.

Sitcoms have tackled many controversial issues such as sexuality, crime, corruption, religion, economics, mental health, politics, racism, drugs, mortality, and more. And of course, one highly controversial subject covered by many sitcoms is the UFO phenomenon. Nearly every aspect of the UFO phenomenon has come under intense scrutiny and study. One avenue, however, that’s remained largely unexplored is how UFOs have been portrayed on situation comedies.

This video explores two dozen high-profile sitcoms that have had the courage to present this controversial subject, and then we will see what the treatment of this subject has to say about America’s attitude toward the UFO phenomenon. The sitcoms are presented chronologically in order of appearance, and reflect how Americans’ perception and understanding of UFOs changes over the decades.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal
today I'm going to do something completely different something I don't think anybody has ever done today's
episode is called UFOs in the American sitcom I'm going to take a look at the
situation comedy and how the UFO subject has been portrayed there's a really interesting
coincidence about situation comedies it turns out that the American first American sitcom appeared in
1947 coinciding exactly with the Modern Age of UFOs that's certainly an
interesting synchronicity but I think this is an important subject because the situation
comedy accurately reflects how we thought and you know what we wore and
everything that we do all our activities of that particular era so I think this is has some interesting things to say
about how we view the UFO subject UFO do appear in all forms of media including
of course books and science fiction but definitely movies and video games and
advertisings and songs I mean you name it UFOs are reflected there that's
absolutely true for situation comedies what's also interesting is that
situation comedies have very bravely portrayed many controversial issues
pretty much across the board which would include such things as crime and Corruption sexuality religion economics
poverty and the unequal distribution of wealth Health mortality racism drug use I mean you
name it politics all of it these have all been portrayed in the situation
comedy often in a hilarious way and of course this includes the UFO subject and
boy is it interesting to see how UFOs and ETS have been portrayed throughout
the years so in this episode I'm going to be looking at the more high profile
sitcoms CU there's a lot of them I found about two dozen that portray the UFO
subject at any length many have not touched it at all but many have and they
have a lot to say about how we view this subject so I did do a much deeper dive
into all of this in my book not from here volume Five I devoted a whole
chapter to all of this if you want to learn more about it please check that out so let's just get started and the
first situation comedy that I'd like to cover is probably one of the most famous
probably one of the best as well I'm a huge fan and that is of course I Love
Lucy this first aired on October 15th 1951 it was a huge success this it sort
of set the template for all other situation comedies and it was really interesting when they first tackled the
UFO subject although I Love Lucy was hugely successful it only ran for six
seasons producing 180 episodes and it was in episode 89 titled Lucy is envious
that they portrayed the UFO subject in this episode Lucy and eel accidentally
each pledged a $500 donation to their wealthy friends charity but
they had no way to pay so to recoup their losses Luc and eel agreed to take
part in a scheme to make some money and they were hired by an advertising
executive at a movie studio and agreed to participate in what is essentially a UFO hoax each of them dressing up as
quote woman from Mars This was to help promote a movie so they surprised a
group of UFO Bel on the top of a building and pretended to speak Martian all dressed up in Martian costumes they
approached the group picking curiously at their clothes and studying them like
ETS might study a human until they pointed a paralyzing Ray at
one of them a man of course who was in on the hoax and they CED him away essentially abducting him so Lucy and
Ethel of course did get paid their money but alas the subject of UFOs was treated
as a joke if you've seen that episode I'm sure you'll agree it's hilarious
Lucille Ball is an absolute genius when it comes to Comedy what I do think is interesting about that particular
episode is UFOs as a genuine real thing were not portrayed in that episode it
was all considered just a hoax which I think is how a lot of people viewed that
subject at that time so that is interesting in and of itself
but now let's move to the next sitcom and again we're going in chronological order here the next situation comedy I'd
like to cover is my three sons can't say that I've watched a lot of episodes of this situation comedy it
was a little bit before my time but I did track down this particular episode
My Three Sons first aired on September 29 1960 and again it was a huge success
it went for 12 seasons and they had a very interesting episode portraying the
UFO subject my three sons was very successful running for 12 Seasons
producing 380 episodes it was season 7 episode 15
titled you saw what airing on J January 5 1967 that featured the UFO subject the
episode begins with the youngest son Ernie asking his two brothers and father to play catch on a Saturday afternoon
fortunately everyone's busy so Ernie heads out into the woods with his dog and he throws the ball goes
to fetch it but instead starts barking at something and Ernie going to investigate is shocked to see a glowing
Flying Saucer landed in a clearing in the woods you can see it here this craft
is making weird beeping noises and seeing this craft Ernie shouts out to his dog come on let's get out of
here so he fle immediately to a group of friends who ask him what's wrong and he
tells them you'd never believe it unless you saw it come on I need Witnesses and
he returns with the three boys to this site but the disc is gone all that is
left is a circle of crushed and burned vegetation and broken branches in the trees so these are landing traces and
it's an accurate portrayal of Landing traces even with this still none of Ernie's friends believe him and instead
they ridicule him and tell him he needs to visit a quote head shrinker so Ernie
returns home tells Uncle Charlie who does believe him but as Ernie says now
let's forget it I've learned to keep quiet the hard way so Ernie has already
learned that there's ridicule surrounding this subject and doesn't want to talk about it but his uncle
Charlie is curious so they returned to the site and examined the landing traces thought going back home and
sharing all of this with his family Ernie is once again greeted with disbelief and ridicule his father tells
him I don't believe you saw a flying saucer but little Ernie is not to be
dissuaded he returns to the site with a camera and lo and behold the craft shows up again and this time he actually
captures a photograph of the disc as is hovering among the trees so later seeing this photo Ernie's
father Mr Douglas alerts the Air Force and seeing the photograph Air Force
General Car stairs decides he's going to cover up the
incident but when Mr Douglas refuses to destroy the photograph and tell his son
that it was all just his imagination like the general wants him to General cares admits the truth uh and says that
the saucer is actually our own a top secret classified program called project
Moonbeam that's interesting because I believe that is an actual project so when Ernie learns all of this he agrees
to cooperate and keep quiet about the photographs but the problem is Ernie's already agreed to go on television to
talk about his sighting so as he's interviewed on television he goes along
with the cover up lies about the photo says it shows nothing and helped to cover up the incident actually talked
complete nonsense about seeing quote Little Green Men in purple suits
this no surprise leads to merciless ridiculing from his classmates at school
and ultimately Ernie's photo remains a secret not even revealed to uncle Charlie or Ernie's two brothers and the
sighting remains explained as a secret government project how interesting is
that I thought that was actually a really good episode and portrayed this subject in a pretty well balanced way
unfortunately it turned out that this of course was a secret government project which is still really interesting
because a lot of what people are seeing I think probably is our own craft so
that is an interesting episode in that regard they didn't see an actual UFO so
it is a bit dismissive of the whole subject but still super interesting now let's move to the next
one I almost didn't include this one because it's an animated sitcom but I figured you know what let's be
comprehensive here let's take a look at all the portrayals of how this subject
has been put on TV and the next sitcom that I'm taking a look at is of course the very popular the Flint
Stones I've watched this episode many times or this series I should say but
UFOs were portrayed more than once on The Flintstones uh this is a sitcom that
aired from 1960 to 1966 and of course was so popular even was transformed into
a featurelength liveaction film but yeah they portrayed the UFO subject in a
pretty interesting way as we shall see first episode on The Flintstones to
feature the UFO subject was on season 4 episode 16 in an episode called 10
little Flintstones it talks about how UFOs come around the town of bedrock and both Fred
and Wilma are skeptical of the reports but when Fred goes outside to dispose of
the garbage a UFO lands actually scans him and get this produces 10 little
clones of Fred Flintstone which are released throughout town to gather information and ostensibly take over the
world unfortunately the only phrase that these ET clones can utter is Yabba daao
the aliens end up wreaking havoc in the town of Bedrock visiting the rubbles and Mr Slate and the other characters
causing endless problems for Fred before finally leaving but with episode seven in season
six titled The Great Gazoo that actually introduced Fred and Barney to a little
green alien named The Great Gazoo from the planet zetox he was a short green skinned alien
a huge helmeted head somewhat similar to reports we have today and he decided to
help out the modern Stone Age family on numerous occasions but his help always
seemed to come at a price for example he set up a dinner at a luxury restaurant
for The Flintstones and the rubbles but then split without paying the bill and
it wasn't long after the great gazo's appearance that the Fred Flintstone show
was cancelled pretty funny portrayal of the subject and I have to say it's the first sitcom to portray ETS as a real
thing I mean these were in the sitcom actual ETS coming down to clone Fred
Flintstone which is a theme that still crops up in some UFO contact accounts I
don't know how accurate that is but it's certainly interesting I also find it interesting that The Great Gazoo
appeared in The Flintstones and it was shortly after that that the sitcom was
cancelled that's probably pure coincidence but it's a very interesting portrayal of you know how UFOs might
invade a small town and how all of people react to this Invasion so to
speak of UFOs so yeah certainly an important
episode now let's move to the next one I'm a huge fan of the Dick Van djk show
again a little bit before my time but I've certainly seen quite a few episodes The Dick Van djk show ran for
six seasons from October 3rd 1961 to June 1st
1966 was a huge success made Mary Tyler Moore a huge star gave her a spin-off of
her own situation comedy and of course Dick Van djk I mean he's just the greatest when it comes to Comedy so
should come as no surprise that they tackled the UFO subject as well and it was pretty interesting what happened in
this particular episode with 158 episodes The Dick Van djk show was very
successful but it took him a while to cover the UFO subject it was during season 5 in episode 3 in a episode
titled on ups that featured the UFO subject Rob suffering from overwork and
exhaustion while working late at night on a script for the Alan Brady show he saw this Flying Saucer hovering outside
the window of his office and to his shock it utters this mysterious kind of
foreign language phrase h s now Rob is absolutely convinced he had an encounter
with ETS so he contacts authorities who no surprise here do not believe him and
ridicule him Rob is so impressed he even consults a psychiatrist when Rob does tell his
coworker buddy about the Flying Saucer Buddy says all the flying saucers in the
world he has to get one with a speech impediment so Rob is finally convinced
that this was all an exhaustion produced hallucination when both he and Buddy hear the same mysterious phrase coming
from the air vent so apparently that solves the mystery it's not a UFO at all
just a dream prompted by weird sounds coming from the air vent so kudos to the
Dick Van dijk show for Having the courage to portray the UFO subject but shame on them for basically explaining
it all away is basically a hallucination a dream so this was not really a serious
treatment of the subject and certainly not accurate but reflected how a lot of
people were thinking about UFOs at that time lot of skepticism back
then so times are changing the next episode i' or sitcom I'd like to talk
about is a hugely popular sitcom called The Beverly Hillbillies that we've
probably all seen in episode of The Beverly Hillbillies if you haven't check it out it's pretty funny I will admit it
is a hilarious show it's not one I watched regularly but I've certainly seen many episodes of it but I was quite
shocked to find out that they have portrayed the UFO subject I didn't remember that episode at all uh The
Beverly Hillbillies aired from 1962 to 1971 and was a huge Smash Hit and their
portrayal of the UFO subject is pretty interesting The Beverly Hillbillies was
always kind of known for its over-the-top comedy and in season five episode 16 titled the Flying Saucer they
definitely followed this pattern this episode centers around their neighbor an
opportunist a con man by the name of Milbourne Dale who manufactures the hoax
by modifying a New Year's Day balloon to look like a flying saucer he then hires
three midgets and dresses them up in Martian costumes secreting them along
with his Flying Saucer in the backyard and in true Beverly hillbills style nosy
granny clampet discovers the Flying Saucer and the little green men and this leads to all kinds of hilarious Antics
but ends up with the ETS eventually being invited over for dinner at the clampets and they eat so much that
Granny actually goes after them with her shotgun so the episode while filled with
hilarity and honestly really funny presents the UFO subject with no real
seriousness and ultimately treats it all as a joke so that's The Beverly Hillbillies and yeah they treated it all
as a hoax again this is how people viewed the UFO subject at that time so
no surprise but certainly an interesting portrayal of what happens when a family
has a UFO encounter or what they perceive to be a UFO encounter now let's move to the next sitcom which
was a very popular sitcom I enjoyed it very much thought it was really cute
this is of course Green Acres with Eddie Albert and Ava Gabor it was a really
funny sort of fish outof water comedy and absolutely this very interesting
portrayal of the UFO subject with a setting as a farm in a very rural area
green acres really was the perfect setting for a UFO visitation it was a very popular show
lasted six seasons and explored the UFO subject in season 2 episode 25 titled
the saucer season this was a term that had already been coined by
journalists and it begins with their goofy farmand who's not very well educated and kind of naive his name is e
he claims to have seen a UFO now Oliver and Lisa the main characters are
enjoying a picnic lunch Hank Kimble played by alvie Moore approaches them
and tells them there have been three saucer sightings in the last month
Oliver is skeptical but Lisa believes him because e claims to have seen an ET
face to face and he tells Oliver he saw a flying saucer and says quote it was
about 11:00 at night and I was getting ready for bed when this saucer buzzed the the barn so Oliver tells him to get
lost until that night at 3:00 a.m. he hears e talking to someone outside his bedroom window Oliver wakes up and E is
there claiming he saw the ETS and actually had a conversation with the ETS face to face the next morning Oliver
tries to convince e he was dreaming but e says no sir it was a real flying
saucer provided a vivid and detailed description he said it circled the barn and then dropped stra down so there were
two ETS one male one female that they had green skin and here's where the
ridicule comes in the male ET was wearing a purple dress nevertheless EV story catches the
attention of the local news reporter and gets reported in the Hooterville paper
and crowds show up wanting to meet e Oliver gets angry When the Crowds begin
to trample his fields of corn this is something many real UFO es in real life
have suffered with but then Lieutenant Bennett from the United States Air Force shows up claiming to be part of the Air
Force UFO investigation department he interviews e but as e tries to provide
details he strangely lapses into a trance and all he can say is bleep bleep
bleep now he has no memory of this he believes the ETS are blanking out his
mind as they don't want the military to know the truth but Ed took a photo
turned out blank when Oliver sees the photo he decides to put an end to all this UFO talk and just throws the photo
into the fire on the pot belly stove and this is how the episode ends as they leave the room the stove turns
mysteriously green ultimately that wasn't really a serious portrayal of
UFOs but certainly interesting once again we have a unreliable character as
the one seeing the UFO or the ETS but interesting too because it does
portray an accurate sort of representation of how our own governments are covering this subject up
and also leaves the whole subject open at the very end when there's that mysterious incident with the stove
turning green but really unfortunate with him the you know main character
Eddie Albert throwing away the photo that could have you know actually provided
evidence and now we move to another really popular sitcom called I Dream of
Genie this made its first appearance on September 18 1965 was hugely popular and I think
provided a really good background to present the UFO subject in that the main
character Tony Nelson is an actual astronaut how they treated the subject
well that's a completely different story as we shall see a dream of Genie was a huge hit with with audiences it lasted
for 5 years and it was episode 88 titled UFO Genie that appeared in 1968 that
featured the UFO subject now Tony Genie's astronaut husband and Roger
Tony's friend and also an astronaut were conducting a test flight of an aircraft
that as it turns out very closely resembles a classic Flying Saucer but in
mid-flight Genie magically transports herself into this craft and her added
weight causes the craft to fall off course and land in a rural area and this
is when a family of hillbillies comes up to the scene and believe that the object is an actual Flying Saucer and that Tony
Roger and jeie are actually human looking martians and they hold them at
gunpoint and contact NASA hoping for a reward of course at the end of the
episode the truth is revealed no mention is made of the reality of the UFO phenomena interestingly the UFO prop
came directly from the other show The Beverly Hillbillies so yes they did
portray the UFO subject in very much the way that my three sons did not as actual
extraterrestrials but rather as a government secret project such a shame I
mean that is accurate I should say but again pretty much bypassing the actual
ual cases where people are seeing genuine UFOs that cannot be explained as
Government secret projects or what have you but certainly interesting Now we
move to the next one the next sitcom I found that portrayed the UFO subject is
Bewitched I was a huge fan of Bewitched Samantha was an
amazing character uh who know it was just an interesting and show actually a
takeoff from a major film I married a witch hugely successful SI Comet ran for
eight years the first episode aired on September 17
1964 and lasted till 1972 tackled many different subjects it
was a very funny sitcom and of course they had a very interesting UFO episode
The witched featured the UFO subject in season for episode 30 with the episode titled Samantha's secret saucer it was
their first and last episode of the whole series to feature UFOs it aired on
April 18 1968 and the episode begins with Samantha's toddler daughter Tabitha
playing with her toy remotec controlled Flying Saucer but when Tabitha loses her
toy saucer outside Aunt Clara the incompetent witch casts a spell to bring
the saucer back back inside and instead causes the tiny toy saucer to expand to
a full-size craft which lands in the backyard and no surprise when nosy
neighbor Gladis Kravitz sees the craft and calls the Air Force soon the Air
Force arrives to investigate and Darren Stevens the harried husband is able to
explain away the life-size saucer as a prop for an advertising campaign but the plot takes a real twist
and this is interesting when it turns out the toy saucer is in fact lost and the Flying Saucer in the backyard is
actually a real honest to God Flying Saucer which was summoned Allah C5 style
close and cl of the fifth kind by ant Clara and this saucer is occupied by two
live humanoid doglike aliens they're named Orvis and Alpha and they're
friendly ETS but they just want to go home and of course Noy Miss Kravitz sees
the ETS and again calls the Air Force and annoyed by this Orvis hits her with
a ray gun which turns her sweet and kind absolutely the opposite of her normal
personality thankfully it ends on a positive note when the ETS Orvis and
Alpha are able to make it home and this was turns out the same UFO prop that
appeared in both the Beverly hill billies and I dream of of Genie you have to give kudos to Bewitched for
portraying ETS as actual living entities first sitcom to say that yes there are
ETS doglike ETS interestingly enough so yeah I mean that's groundbreaking in and
of itself it's a very funny episode uh so I think it's worth taking
a look at and again we're starting to see a pattern here where we're moving towards this subject being portrayed a
little bit more accurately Now we move to the next sitcom which was a huge Smash Hit and
I'm sure you've heard of it the Brady Bunch I always laughed at The Brady Bunch cuz I come from a family with six
kids and The Brady Bunch I mean it was just a little bit different for me my
experience with you know having so many brothers and sisters but certainly a fun show and groundbreaking of course with
two divorced parents coming together and forming a new family so it was
groundbreaking in a number of different ways and they did portray the UFO
subject and it was a fascinating episode The Brady Bunch was definitely a mega
hit UFOs were quite popular at that time so it's no surprise that they did Cover the UFO subject in season 5 episode 16
titled out of this world Peter Peter and Bobby are in the backyard when they may see what they
believe is a UFO a glowing disc hovering above their backyard little do they know
that this is a hoax they've become victims of a hoax pulled off by their older brother Greg it's quite an
elaborate hoax where Greg puts up a sheet and uses a flashlight with a little filter to make it shaped like a
flying saucer and a little whistle a whole deal to make this hoax seem very
believable and it absolutely fools Peter and Bobby but then Marsha the oldest
sister catches Greg in the ACT but decides to join in on the hoax so Bobby
and Peter not only see this UFO they capture a photograph meanwhile Bobby is
starting to dream about meeting ETS face to face and this whole hoax backfires
when their father Mike Brady actually phones Carter Air Force Base to report this sighting Air Force captain
McCartney shows up to conduct an investigation of quote things that don't
exist he says there are no such things as UFO but the whole story takes a Twist
when the captain himself sees the hoax UFO and falls for it believes it to be
genuine and reports it to the military himself then of course the hoax is
revealed Greg and the embarrassed Air Force Captain agree to engage in a cover
up of the entire event and in the end the episode leaves the viewing public with the impression that all UFOs are
the result of hoaxes hallucinations and misperceptions here we go again UFOs
being portrayed as nothing but a hoax such a shame I'm also starting to notice
another pattern the witnesses who see the UFO are usually those who are least
reliable sort of naive very young
uneducated uh with Bobby and Cindy falling for Greg's hoax of a UFO but a
very interesting episode overall and I think it's starting to show once again
how people feel about this subject moving along here's another sitcom that I certainly watched I wasn't
a regular viewer of it but I've enjoyed many episodes of Barney Miller this is a
very interesting sort of police uh Department sitcom It first aired in
1975 and tackled the UFO subject much deeper into its run of episodes but I
will say this is probably the most accurate portrayal of a UFO encer up to
this time in the situation comedy the Barney Miller show was hugely successful at one multiple Awards and it featured
the UFO subject in episode 79 titled the sighting and this follows the experience
of eccentric and dimwitted police officer Stan wji Hox Stan was on his way
home from work and saw a UFO hovering over Stanton Island New York so the next
day he tells his co-workers and his boss that he saw quote some kind of spaceship
no surprise they do not believe him Stan's credit he sticks to his guns
saying that the craft was quote a kind of silver metal color and was shaped like a
cigar so the Air Force arrives to interview him they refuse to validate Stan's sighting however the next morning
Stan is fully Vindicated when it's discovered that the local police station received more than a half dozen calls
from other Witnesses reporting the same object in the same area so other than
the fact that the UFO witness Stan is initially considered unreliable it's a
surprisingly accurate and fair treatment of the subject and really the first sitcom to ultimately affirm the reality
of the UFO phenomenon in a serious way yeah I'm just going to underline it that
was a good episode it was portrayed well accurately my only real complaint is
that the person who saw the UFO was considered again the least reliable
character in that sitcom and this is a pattern that turns up again and again and I'm really concerned about it
because it's just not accurate people of all educational levels people of every
strata of society encounter UFOs but a very good portrayal of an important
subject now moving along the next sitcom I'd like to cover is called soap this is
sort of a takeoff of soap operas mixed in with the situation comedy was a very
popular show it made its debut in 1977 and brought Billy Crystal into
stardom and really a very funny funny show on many levels and also
groundbreaking in some ways in terms of how the UFO subject is portrayed the
sitcom Soap lasted only four seasons but it was considered to be very successful
and did Garner several Emmy Awards was on episode 4 6 Bert who is absolutely
portrayed as psychologically unstable is driving along a road late at night when
he sees a UFO now his family is skeptical of all of this but bird is
driving again on that same stretch of road sees the UFO again only this time
he is taken on board and inside this craft he sees short aliens with huge
bald heads and large eyes they're wearing silver suits a pretty accurate
port trail of what many people report but it does go off the rails a little
bit when Bert is held captive With Another Man From The Far distant past
and eventually Bert escapes back to his home only to find that he has been
cloned by the ETS and there's an ET that looks just like him who has taken his
place for the sole reason of making love to Bert's wife so Bert with great
difficulty finally convinces his wife that he is the real Bert and that the alien is an impostor and now that his
identity is revealed the ET departs so while the storyline is admittedly
Preposterous UFOs are portrayed as real and it is again the first show that
portrays someone actually being taken on board a craft fascinating episode comes
showing that ETS might be living among us I thought that was interesting it's also the first liveaction sitcom to
portray somebody actually being taken on board a craft and seeing ETS face to
face so that in and of itself is groundbreaking but once again the
character who sees the UFO is not the smartest guy on the show don't know why
they keep doing that and I'm disappointed about it but still they did portray the subject so I'm glad about
that now we move to another show which was actually a spin-off of the sitcom
Soap and this is called Benson starring Robert Gom it made its first appearance
on September 13 1979 and it was pretty successful it ran
for eight years and eventually did Cover the UFO subject in a pretty good way I
was impressed running for eight years Benson was considered a very successful
show which is amazing for a spin-off they off have a real hard time but
Benson did tackle the UFO subject in episode 81 called Close Encounters on
the third hole the scene featuring the UFO features Benson and his employer the
governor playing golf when a UFO shows up and actually beams them both with a beam of light now Benson disappears
dematerializes while the governor starts searching frantically for him then the UFO returned turns sends down a beam of
light and Benson reappears so he's been taken on board however Benson has no
memory of this at all and in fact doesn't even remember seeing the UFO so
here we have the first portrayal of missing time the only evidence of this encounter is that Benson is missing his
watch now they do return to the golf course later and lo and behold the UFO
reappears and returns Benson's watch now the governor asks why didn't they land
and Benson says well they're probably shy but he does say that was really
something so this is a very interesting and somewhat accurate portrayal of the
UFO subject unfortunately the governor is portrayed as a clueless politician he
goes public with this sighting is disbelieved by almost everyone the Govern Governor really
wanted to go public his friends urged him not to but he did the governor told his Barber who leaked the sighting to
the press and that's when he got ridiculed mercilessly
surprisingly perhaps somewhat accurately the governor's favorability ratings actually go up either way the episode
ends with a firm conviction that the ET presence is real and that ETS are truly
visiting our planet even taking people on board and leaving them with little or no memory of the onboard segment I liked
that episode what I liked about it is the subject was portrayed as being 100%
real it also showed how people are profoundly skeptical of the subject and
get ridiculed because of it but again shows that UFOs are real and actually
portrays the missing time phenomena as well with someone having an encounter and having no memory of being taken on
board so that's also pretty pretty groundbreaking was a good
episode now let's move to the next show which is Night Court night court has
been recently rebooted I'm talking about the original Night Court which first
aired on January 4th 1984 it's a hilarious show which at one
point did cover an EP this subject involving extraterrestrials with nine Seasons
Night Court was definitely a very successful sitcom and it was episode 37
titled the hostage that featured the UFO subject this episode is all about this
gentleman who is brought before the court under charges of stealing electronic parts but the man claims that
he is not subject to the laws of planet Earth because he is not an Earthling he is actually an extraterrestrial from
Saturn he's dressed in flowing robes and the entire court of course believes the defendant to mentally deranged the man
takes attorney Dan Fielding played of course by John larette hostage and
demands that the rest of the parts he needs to communicate with his home planet be delivered to him the judge
gets very angry and the whole episode ends on this very interesting sort of
note when the defendant waves his arms theatrically and disappears in a puff of smoke leaving no doubt to everyone there
that something very strange and in in explicable just happened and it could
very well be an alien walking Among Us I'm going through these episodes pretty
quickly and summarizing them very briefly of course because otherwise we'd be here forever but certainly an
interesting appearance of an apparent extraterrestrial in front of the judge in a courtroom an ET walking Among Us
which certainly makes you wonder because there are accounts of this and that I thought was an interesting episode in
that regard and now we move to another sitcom which I'm a little bit ashamed to say I did
watch it's probably not the best sitcom I don't want to judge because it was a
funny show uh this is of course Charles in Charge starring Scott baale this
first aired on October 3rd 1984 and it was pretty successful it went for four
years and at one point they had a pretty interesting episode featuring UFOs and
and alleged extraterrestrials it was the 40th episode of Charles in Charge season 2
episode 18 titled UFO oh no that they featured the UFO subject the youngest
child of the family Adam comes running into the house one evening saying he just saw a UFO he says and I quote it
was round and it had flashing lights now his babysitter Walter doesn't believe him but his two older sisters not only
believe him but become panicked when they see an unidentified rodent-like creature running through the house so
they're screaming hysterically aliens there are aliens in the house Walter tries to convince them all that UFOs are
not real finally the grandfather comes home and he's upset saying that UFOs and
aliens are quote only hallucinations and hysteria in fact Adams mother tells him
to go upstairs and that she'll explain about things that quote look like UFOs
then Walter looks out the window and sees the UFO himself a quote silver
thing in the sky with blue flashing lights he's convinced it's a genuine UFO
he reports his sighting the local Observatory but is not believed he's still convinced it's a real UFO and then
the grandfather sees the UFO himself he's also convinced it's real so he calls the local
newspaper And the reporter arrives and starts an investigation and this is when
the whole story unravels when it turns out their neighbor buddy announces that
he pulled off a hoax he faked the UFO as part of an experiment to test the
effects of the Paranormal on the American family and it turns out the
furry creature running through the house is identified as nothing more than an escaped guinea pig but the whole episode
ends on a mysterious note when buddy explains that he only faked two of the sightings and that he can't explain what
the grandfather saw which was apparently a genuine UFO that was an interesting
portrayal of the subject in a number of ways it kind of shows the hysteria that can follow a UFO encounter people
jumping to conclusions people conflating various phenomena but I have to say I'm
glad that it did end on a very unequivocal note saying that UFOs are in
fact real and this is a pattern we see in a number of these sitcoms starts out
as an apparent hoax turns into an actual UFO incident very interesting Now we
move to another sitcom which I never really watched I'm certainly aware of it
this is of course Mr badier first episode aired on March 15
1985 but it wasn't until episode 80 that they tackled the UFO subject but they
did a good job I have to say again I was really impressed Mr B deer had a really
good run and it was episode 80 titled graduation that featured the UFO subject
the witness was of course the teenage son Kevin who returned home one evening very excited claiming he saw a quote a
big round silver thing with rotating lights said it was hovering in the sky he was deeply affected by this encounter
absolutely changed his outlook on everything began checking out books on UFOs and discovered that the subject was
being taken very seriously by many researchers he decides to do a UFO
Stakeout in his backyard hoping to have another encounter unfortunately the UFO
fails to arrive and Kevin becomes the subject of ridicule and disbelief and
various debunking explanations are raised to explain what he saw however at the very end of the
episode a genuine UFO shows up right over Mr Bader's head and this is a
little bit of a spoiler alert so if you don't want to know how this episode ends
uh skip to the next segment here but this UFO shows up to Mr badier speaks to
him and calls him slim Mr badier who of course is not exactly slim closes the
episode by acknowledging the reality of UFOs and says out loud to himself I have
developed a great fondness for extraterrestrials anyone who calls me Slim can't be all
that bad so while the subject of UFOs was first treated skeptically in the end of
the episode the existence of UFOs was unequivocably
confirmed I think that's an important episode because UFOs are I obviously
real I think the evidence supporting them is absolutely conclusive in my mind
at this point and what's interesting about this episode is again we have the least reliable character seeing a
UFO and he went through some good deal of skepticism and push back and ridicule
but stuck to his guns and it's also a very interesting episode because again in the end the subject was portrayed as
absolutely real and I have to say that the ending of this particular episode made me laugh out loud it was funny so
yeah I recommend this episode and I think it's a pretty accurate p trayal of this subject now let's move to the next
sitcom which I never watched sitcom is called Small Wonder it's about a little
girl who's basically a robot a humanoid robot and it did tackle the UFO subject
and had some interesting things to say about it uh but again I don't really
know this sitcom that well I only watched this episode because there was a
UFO theme to it and ultimately I was disappointed with how it was portrayed but still trying to be comprehensive
here so I'm covering Small Wonder Small Wonder was a surprise hit really popular
among children especially and again it's about a family whose father is a robotics engineer and the creator of a
human-looking robotic daughter named Vicki but important here is episode 81
titled My Favorite Martian and when the Dy neighbor sees a UFO Vicki father/
inventor calls the Air Force to investigate but little does he know the UFO is actually a projection created by
his robot daughter Vicki so to discredit their neighbor and debunk this sighting
they have Vicki create a projection of a little green alien and this Roose works
like a charm the neighbor falls for the hoax and is persuaded into believing that Earth will be taken over by aliens
and he will be the new world leader so the whole treatment of the subject is
entirely skeptical and frankly ridiculous ultimately for me a pretty
disappointing treatment of the UFO subject which is being portrayed solely as a
hoax fine you know this is how a lot of sitcoms as far as they apparently have
the courage to go with it but it's important because this is how people
seem to view UFOs certainly much more so years earlier now of course it's getting
a legitimacy that it's long deserved uh so times are moving forward
and I think we're definitely making progress with how this subject is being portrayed and perceived uh here in the
United States and all over the world but sitcoms are playing a role here you know they do shape our beliefs to a certain
extent and certainly reflect them so this is important stuff now we move to
the the next sitcom which was a huge Smash Hit I've certainly seen a number
of episodes I was never really a fan but I do recognize this award-winning sitcom
which is the Golden Girls and I have to tell you of all the portrayals of UFOs
and this subject in the sitcom I really liked this one except for the fact that
once again it's the least reliable character who is having the encounter featuring four older women as Prime
characters The Golden Girls was absolutely groundbreaking it was a runaway hit its Allstar cast really
struck a chord with audiences and the show remained on the air for a full seven years and still remains in
syndication today it was an iconic series that finally broach the UFO subject in episode 78 titled The One
That Got Away Now Rose the ditsy character played by Betty White was sitting on the porch
with Dorothy played by beatric Arthur one evening when a Hu huge silver object
covered with colored lights appeared overhead did you see that
Dorothy now Dorothy thinks it's just a plane but Ros is convinced a UFO but of
course Rose is not exactly reliable she's considered unintelligent naive
gullible however after she reports the sighting to the Air Force they all learn
that this object is in fact unexplained as Dorothy says Rose they
checked out what we saw and it actually was a UFO so this inspires Rose to spend
more time outside waiting for the UFOs to return this causes her to receive
some good-natured ribbing from her friends and then comes another plot twist turns out that the object they saw
wasn't a UFO at all but a secret military aircraft however the the episode ends
with Dorothy and Rose sitting outside Dorothy closes her eyes to rest and at that very moment the UFO reappears Rose
calls for Dorothy to wake up but by then the UFO is gone Rose sits back and
smiles knowing in her heart UFOs are real because she saw one I really liked
that episode of The Golden Girls I thought it was a pretty darn good portrayal of the UFO subject because
it shows two witnesses seeing a UFO one being disbelieving the other believing
turns out that is a real UFO with the plot twist that it was not a UFO as we
would think of it but a secret military craft then in the end the UFO shows up again Rose is absolutely Vindicated it's
a sweet episode I thought it was really interesting and now we move to the next
episode that to feature UFOs which was the hilarious smash hit Married with
Children a really sort of irreverent sitcom which was quite different from a
lot of the other family shows of the 1950s featuring parents who were not
exactly role model parents and it was a pretty longlasting
uh sitcom with 259 episodes and yeah
they did a very hilarious featuring of the UFO subject one of the longer
lasting live action sitcoms on television Married with Children lasted a full 10 years producing 259 episodes
it's interesting because it's usually in the 80s episode 80s or so that these sitcoms feature the UFO subject and
that's true with married with children in episode 87 married with aliens it
begins with Al Bundy waking up in bed to see several short silver suited aliens
in his bedroom or searching for something in his bedroom and finally steal his dirty socks he tells his
family who as you might expect do not believe him but a few nights later it happens again the aliens come into his
bedroom steal his dirty socks and again he is the only one who sees the aliens
and again nobody believes him so to prove his story Al Bundi obtains a
camera and baits the aliens with more of his dirty socks the aliens soon arrive
again their only interested in his dirty socks turns out that they can use them
as a fuel source Al asks to take their picture and the et's oblig with a series
of poses however in a stroke of bad luck which is normal for Al all the film is
lost at the film developers so Al ends up having no way to prove his story but
of course remains forever convinced in the existence of ETS it's a hilarious
episode but hardly an accurate portrayal of the phenomena but to its credit it
does stick to the premise that ETS are real all the sicom portrayals of the UFO
subject I have to tell you I think that one Married with Children was the funniest episode of all I mean it's
sidesplitting funny but yeah hardly an acccurate portrayal of the subject but ETS coming
into the bedroom and stealing dirty socks for fuel come on that's common gold it was
funny and now we move to the next sitcom to feature the UFO subject which was the
Robert Gom show Robert Gom of course was originally on Benson and had his own
show the Robert Gom show which aired on April 5th 1989 it was quite shortlived
but did feature the UFO subject so Robert Gom star of both soap and Benson
finally did get show titled the Robert Gom show which didn't survive past its
first season but on episode 8 titled they're here this did feature the UFO
subject Robert G's father Henry woke up in the middle of the night saying he saw
another one of those UFOs that he's been seeing lately now Robert G plays a psychiatrist on the show and doesn't
believe him saying was probably just a garbage truck Henry however adamantly
insists he saw a genuine UFO and will not budge from his story but neither
will Gom and finally Henry and G's secretary decide to conduct a nighttime
UFO stake out and this is when Henry excitedly points out the moon and calls
it a UFO and this is when the secretary realizes that Henry is actually deluded
or not mentally stable cannot tell the difference between a UFO and the moon
but not wanting to hurt the old man's feelings she says nothing but then Henry decides to tell his story to a TV
program titled weird and wonderful who actually portrays this sighting as a
genuine UFO even though it's clear to everyone in the know except gom's father
that the story is not true however the whole affair ends on a mysterious note
when one evening shortly later everyone is seated in the living room and a mysterious unexplained Eerie orange
light shines in through the front front door window so ultimately while unconfirmed the possibility that UFOs
are real remains in open question again the pattern we see so often in these
sitcoms is being laid out exactly almost in a cliche way where what starts out
with a misidentification or a hoax or something along those lines turns out to
end on a mysterious note sort of pointing towards the reality of UFOs it
was a bit ambivalent ambiguous but certainly left the idea open that UFOs
are real and now we move to another sitcom
I've never really watched this one this is the animated sitcom Dennis the menus
and it portray had a pretty interesting portrayal of the UFO subject with a UFO landing an actual ET lots of interaction
with this ET was pretty interesting the Animated Series Dennis the Menace managed to produce 78 episodes over only
2 years and it was season 1 episode 2 very early on that there was an episode
called a visitor from outer space little Dennis was asleep in his bedroom when a
miniature Flying Saucer enters through the window scares his dog wakes Dennis
up as Dennis fleases his room in fear the ET shoots a beam of light at him
shrinking him down to miniature size Dennis runs outside and the ET follows
saying that he's come from millions of miles away in search of friendly contact with humans the ET then returns Dennis
to normal size and Dennis gives the ET whose name is randar a tour of the house
then he brings the ET over to Mr Wilson and Mr Wilson wakes up to see Dennis and
the ET levitating floating in the air outside his window and calls the police
meanwhile the ET levitates Dennis back to his bedroom and departs the police
arrive to interview Mr Wilson who ends up looking like a crazy duded person
gets handcuffed by the police and hauled off to the station for questioning what
I liked about that episode was yeah there was a landing there was an ET IT shrunk Dennis down to miniature size
interestingly enough I do know of a few cases of that and his poor neighbor Mr
Wilson of course getting carded off by the police for spotting all this nonsense about UFOs once again portrays
how this subject is you know not real in many people's minds very skeptical of
this subject so that as well is once again showing how difficult it is to
move this subject forward when there's all this skepticism and now we move to one of the
most successful sitcoms of all times it's still in production and that is The
Simpsons and I have to tell you the Simpsons has portrayed UFOs on numerous
occasions I'm only going to cover a few of the incidents because you could spend literally hours talking about The
Simpsons portrayal of UFOs and extra terrestrials Simpsons actually first
aired on April 19 1987 as an animated short on the Tracy almond show but
became runaway characters and got their own show and very funny I watch watch it for years uh and I think it's really
interesting how they portray the UFO subject and do it in a really funny way
after appearing on the Tracy Olman show The Simpsons got their own show on December 17 1989 and it still Remains
the longest running and most awardwinning sitcom in American history still in production should come as no
surprise that The Simpsons have had a few run-ins with UFOs and ETS
often it's in their Halloween special episodes treeh House of Horrors that
this subject is brought up for example once while fishing in a lake a saucer
shaped object appears over Homer's boat a gigantic Piner emerges from beneath
the craft and pulls Homer on board Homer inside the craft is confronted by two
enormous oneeyed green skinned octopus-like ETS and Homer tells them I suppose you
want to probe me well may as well get it over with and Homer turns around and
pulls down his pants the two aliens recoil and one replies stop we have
reached the limits of what rectal probing can teach us so yeah very funny and making fun of
course of this whole idea that ET anally Pro people the ETS ask him take me to
your leader but when Homer explains that an election is about to occur and that
Bob Dole may replace President Clinton the ATS end up taking both candidates on
board strip them of their clothes and plac them in glass tubes and transform
themselves into the two presidential candidates Homer Witnesses this whole
procedure so to discredit Homer the ETS doue him in rum so that nobody will
believe him and they forcefully eject him from the craft so
that's them them covering the UFO subject but they do it over and over again in another episode the entire
family is taken on board by ETS and treated to a Sumptuous Feast it's a Twist of the classic Twilight Episode to
serve man where Lisa finds an ET book titled how to cook
humans and the ETS are said no no no they removed dust from the cover and reveal the title to be how to cook for
humans but then Lisa removes more dust from the cover and the title is revealed how to cook 40 humans and the twists go
on and on it's very funny there are many more episodes featuring UFOs and aliens
on The Simpsons and in each of them the various ET tropes and conspiracies are
explored with classic Simpsons hilarity and with the given premise to their Kudos that UFOs and extraterrestrials
are very real kudos to the writers of The Simpsons for really diving deep into
the UFO subject and covering every aspect of it from how it affects politics to people being taken on board
and anally probed and the whole deal I mean they really dived deep into this
subject so thank you to the writers of The Simpsons for Having the courage to
tackle this subject now we move to another sitcom which never Rose to Super prominent
status but it was certainly a successful sitcom having 172 episodes which is definitely
considered a success and this sitcom is called Wings this first aired on April
19th 1990 and was very successful and at one
point did do an episode on UFOs and it was well done the sitcom Wings tells the
story of a small Airline run by two brothers and it lands on the UFO subject with episode 2 2 plane nine from net Joe
and Brian the owners of Sandpiper airlines are flying over n Tucket in their plane when they see a strange
quote blue light as they watch it hovers Zips across the sky and then shoots
upward it's absolutely a genuine UFO both of them are convinced of this Joe
the conservative and sensible brother he wants to keep the SE sighting a secret
but Brian portrayed as impulsive and rash decides to tell everyone and now
with their encounter revealed both Witnesses suffer ridicule from their
co-workers Brian gets really disappointed when his brother Joe refuses to admit to the reality of the
sighting so Joe calls the FAA who sends over an investigator and as might be
expected the FAA investigator is profoundly skeptical and now Brian
regrets going public but then the brothers are confronted by a group of UFO Witnesses and under peer pressure
they admit that they did in fact see a UFO a UFO and the entire group takes a
flight up into the air and returns to the location of the sighting in fact a reporter joins them on the Venture
unfortunately no UFO appears and the Reporter ends up writing a really nasty
article R ridiculing the sighting but the message at the end of the episode is
it's very clear UFOs are real but those who go public are likely to be ridiculed
and disbelieved I did like that episode because this did portray a UFO encounter
by two pilots many Pilots are seeing UFOs and the UFO in this episode was
real what's important about this episode I think is the witnesses did decide
ultimately it's probably best to keep quiet because they got so much skepticism and ridicule from people they
loved and trusted and the mainstream media this is absolutely an accurate
portrayal of how people sometimes have to deal with having their own encounter
so that makes it I think an important episode now let's move to another sitcom
called step by step this is essentially a reboot of The Brady Bunch in many ways
involving a very large family with a lot of kids and having the regular Antics and
machinations that go on with a very large family its first episode was on
September 20 1991 Patrick Duffy Suzanne Summers were the parents and yeah it was
a funny sitcom I watched several episodes was never a huge fan of it but
they did Cover the UFO subject and it was a certainly an interesting portrayal
step by step featured the UFO subject on season 13 episode 13 on December 13
1991 with a t episode titled getting organized one of the children JT who is
portrayed it somewhat lacking in intelligence and I'm putting that nicely develops an interest in UFOs of course
he's also madly in love with a young girl who apparently despises him and
it's this young girl who decides to take advantage of JT's interest in UFOs and
she tells him that she was in fact contacted by the ETS who are visiting Earth for the purposes of obtaining
aluminum and she convinces JT and his best friend who turns out to be her
brother who's also kind of dimwitted she convinces them both to wrap their bodies
from head to toe in aluminum foil to attract the ETS and to wait for them and
meanwhile she hires a friend to fly a helicopter over the boys and shine a beam of light down on them it's a cruel
expensive and elaborate UFO hoax but everything apparently goes according to
plan the boys dress up in foil they make complete fools of themselves while the
girls film the entire prank the helicopter arrives on schedule beams the boys with light and convinces them both
that they've been visited by ETS but as fits the pattern of other
sitcoms who featured this subject the entire episode ends quite mysteriously when the girl's pilot friend calls them
and says that he did not fly that helicopter he was not able to get the
helicopter and do this whole stunt so apparently what JT and his friend saw
was a genuine UFO once again we have UFOs being
portrayed as nothing but a hoax at least initially of course it does and on a
mysterious note when it turns out that the witnesses seeing a UFO are actually
not a victim of a hoax after all even they were even though they were a victim of a hoax it turned out that this last
sighting was real it's that same sort of cliche pattern we see in a lot of these
sitcoms but it's encouraging because the writers of the show are recognizing that
this is a real subject but again I'm disappointed because it's the least reliable characters who are the
witnesses to this UFO such a shame cuz again not
accurate Now we move to the last sitcom that I'm going to portray today and that
is South Park South Park's Premier episode actually
featured uh one of the main characters being taken on board and having a fullon
UFO experience South Park was an immediate hit it's very irreverent very
Cutting Edge very unfiltered uh and uh it's really
interesting because as we'll see they embrac the subject in a way nobody has
ever done on any sitcom hudos to South Park for having their Premier episode
feature UFOs it's titled Cartman gets an anal probe and in this episode ETS are
visiting South Park Colorado for the purpose of probing various citizens and
no surprise that it's Cartman who is taken on board and probed this probe is apparently accidentally left inside of
him now when the ETS abduct one of Cartman's schoolmates they use the Forgotten ET probe to lure the ETS back
and rescue their friend so South Park was an instant success earning very high ratings
started winning all kinds of awards it's been continually renewed and is now on
its 26 27th season it's made over 300 episodes it's one of the most successful
sitcoms of all times and it's so interesting because ETS continue to make
regular appearances in at least half the episodes there's almost always this
little ET doing a cameo in the background I wonder if the writers of South Park have had their own
experiences having portrayed UFOs in so many of their episodes I mean ETS in
over half the episode appearing is little tiny cameos I think that's super
interesting I really wonder why they do that it's quite a lot of talk about it on the internet so I don't know it's
just interesting overall so I did cover all of these episodes in much more depth
in my book not from here so if you really want to take a another look at that check that out I've got a lot of
other interesting chapters in the book but yeah Dove deep into the subject of UFOs in the American sitcom but yeah
there's two dozen sitcoms portraying the UFO subject and as you can see our you
know understanding of this this subject is accurately reflected by these sitcoms
starting out with a lot of them being portrayed as absolute hoaxes
hallucinations misperceptions Mental Illness naivity but moving forward more
and more being portrayed is absolutely real the real disturbing pattern for me
was pretty much every episode the person who sees the UFO again is the least
reliable character which is certainly just not reflective of real life so we
still have quite some work to do in having this subject be portrayed accurately in the situation comedy and I
have to tell you there are a lot of other sitcoms that not only portrayed UFOs but basically embraced it as the
complete theme of their show such as my favorite martian or Moran Mindy elf of
course from 1986 Third Rock From the Sun an ET family living among us more
recently people of Earth in 2016 or very recently resident alien
just to name a few and of course each of these treat this subject as completely
real but I will say that a good number of sitcoms absolutely did not have the
courage to portray this subject whatsoever really prominent sitcoms such
as friends Seinfeld Modern Family The Cosby Show never portrayed UFOs Roseanne
did not as far as I know cheers didn't or lever and Shirley or good times or th
company All in the Family Mash didn't do it either marry Tyler M Leave It to
Beaver none of these portrayed the UFO subject Honeymooners Growing Pains who's
the boss most of them I'm going to say have not had the courage to portray this subject Family Ties one day at a time
The Partridge Family The Wonder Years and that could go on Frasier Facts of Life Happy Days and so forth Father
Knows Best nope Azie and Harriet Leave it to Beaver Malcolm in the
Middle no none of them did How I Met Your Mother brush off the boat The Fresh
Prince of ba a so most people have not portrayed this subject which is really a
shame uh The Big Bang Theory one of my favorite sitcoms did mention UFOs at one
point but it was in a pretty sort of dismissive way The Andy
Griffith Show almost portrayed it but it turned out that a person they all thought was an ET was just somebody who
was very much in love with the town of Mayberry the one thing is certain the
sitcom format continues to be popular there's going to be more shows coming
out and because this subject UFOs is increasing in popularity all the time
it's only a matter of time before the subject is portrayed in another sitcom very interested to see how the writers
will portray it I'm really hoping that they are more accurate in who sees the
UFO and portraying this subject as absolutely real but that's it for today that's the
portrayal of UFOs in the American sitcom it has a lot to say about how we view
this subject I think that alone is important it's time we take a look at
you know how this subject is being portrayed so thank you very much for
watching I truly appreciate it this show is definitely a little different than most so I hope you found it entertaining
and informative truly appreciate you you guys tuning in it's because of you I do
this research that I'm putting these episodes together so thank you thank you thank you and until next time keep
searching for the truth keep asking those hard questions and most important of all keep having fun and I will see
you next time bye for now
