SEVEN EXTRAORDINARY CASES OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL HEALING
Nov 18, 2022

Summary:
Nov 18, 2022
UFO contact has occurred all over the world to all kinds of people. While some people report being very frightened by their encounters, others report encounters that are not only benevolent, but healing. In fact, ET healings are far more common than most people realize. There are literally hundreds of cases on record, reaching back over 100 years and still occurring to the present day. This video presents seven extraordinary examples of extraterrestrial healings involving people from all across the planet. These seven cases show how truly advanced ETs are when it comes to practicing medicine, and also show that healing humanity is main part of the alien agenda.

CASE ONE: TERRY WALTERS: Terry Walters of England reports a lifetime of unusual events. In 2005, Terry suffered from severe spinal problems and chronic back pain. That is, until he found himself in an operating room onboard a UFO. Even more surprising, he was being operated on by a reptilian humanoid. Following this, Walters' back pain was gone. Soon Walters began having more onboard experience with beautiful human-looking extraterrestrials. This initiated a spiritual awakening and Terry began experiencing ghost encounters, precognition of disasters, memories of a past-life as an Egyptian Pharoah and more. Walters also found he had the ability to heal others of a wide variety of medical conditions.

CASE TWO: JEAN MIGUERES. On August 11, 1969, Jean Migueres was driving his ambulance near Rouen, France when a UFO appeared overhead. He heard a voice mentally tell him, "Do not be afraid." Shortly later, Migueres suffered a head-on collision with another vehicle, causing massive injuries. While trapped in the wreckage, an alien being materialized next to him and said, "I am going to regenerate you by a procedure that is not yet known on your planet." The being proceeded to heal Migueres of injuries to his spine and more. Migueres was rushed to the hospital where he had three near-death experiences, but ultimately recovered. He began having regular onboard experiences and discovered that he had been given "the gift of healing," and found himself in telepathic contact with ETs.

CASE THREE: Connie Isele of Divide, CO began having unusual experiences from a very young age. ln 1989, she woke up to see strange praying mantis-like creatures. Initially terrified, Isele soon realized that the ETs were actually there to help. In 1989, the ETs visited her and healed her of uterine cramping. Three years later, they returned and healed her of arthritis in her knee. Three years after that, in 1995, Isele suffered a near-fatal auto accident. Doctors feared she would lose her leg. Isele prayed to the ETs for help, and to her amazement, they visited her in her hospital room and healed her. The doctors were shocked and gave Isele the nickname "miracle legs."

CASE FOUR: After learning that Pine Bush in upstate NY was a huge UFO hotspot, researcher Ellen Crystall traveled to the area and began not only seeing UFOs, but photographing them. Before long, she saw an actual ET. Her sightings were so numerous, she wondered if she might actually be a UFO contactee herself. Ellen learned that as a child, she had been very sick with an undiagnosed intestinal disorder. She became so sick, doctors feared she would die. But one day, she was miraculously healed. Later, she learned in an unusual way that she had actually been healed by ETs.

CASE FIVE: Jerry Wills of KY was only twelve years old when he began seeing UFOs and having contact with human-looking ETs who taught him a variety of scientific and spiritual subjects. Around that time, he became bedridden with a dangerously high fever. As he lay in bed, he was suddenly visited by grays who took him onboard a craft and healed him. As an adult, Wills found that he had developed incredible healing abilities. 

CASE SIX: IVAN MORALES. A police officer from Puerto Rico, in 1980 Morales found himself very sick with rheumatic fever. After praying for help, Morales was shocked to be visited by two gray ETs who took him onboard a craft and to an undersea base where they healed him, then returned him to his home.

CASE SEVEN: In 1998, four-year-old Gabriel Flores of Chile was near death from a severe case of rheumatic fever. While being driven to and from the hospital, he had a UFO encounter which left him completely healed. Flores' healing was confirmed by doctors, and soon the whole family began to experience incredible events which left them convinced that they were all in contact with ETs.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I have a great episode for you today I think I call this one seven extraordinary cases of extraterrestrial healings healing I believe is one of the main 
ET agendas on our planet I've documented more than 300 cases coming from all over the world 
these cases stretch back actually more than 100 years and are still occurring to the present day 
and they involve all different types of healings everything from healings of injuries Flesh Wounds 
broken bones to minor conditions like backaches or stomach aches or even more serious conditions 
and chronic diseases as well what I'm doing today is presenting to you seven cases that 
I think involve really extraordinary healings ones that are very well documented and cover 
a wide variety of conditions and again I think these cases should get a lot more attention than 
they're getting I'm kind of surprised they aren't Front Page News because there are so many cases 
so I've got seven cases I want to talk about today so let's just get started 
and the first case I'd like to talk about today involves a man by the name of Terry durish Walters 
he's from England and he was actually healed of a very severe problem with his back with his spine
Terry Darice Walters is from priestwood this is in brachnell England 
and he has had encounters his whole life but in 2005 Terry was in pain from a very 
severe back problem that is until he was taken on board a UFO he found himself in 
an operating theater being given surgery by what looked like a reptilian humanoid 
and following this experience his back pain was gone as his daughter Julie Kendall says 
he reckoned they cured his bad back which had baffled even top medical professionals 
what's really interesting is Terry was able to provide proof um and uh actually shows 
doctor reports uh of how his back was cured and this turned out to be just the beginning for 
him I'm following this experience she started being taken on board regularly by human like 
ETS he believes from Orion he had also UFO sightings and again many onboard encounters he 
says he's never had any encounters with the grays but uh they are all about healing he says in fact 
as Terry says and I quote the illnesses they have cured are almost beyond belief 
what's very interesting about Terry's case is that he ended up becoming a powerful healer himself 
he reports that he is in constant telepathic contact with the ETS he ended up writing a book 
about his experiences which include not only his own UFO encounters but ghostly Encounters 
precognition of disasters memories of a past life where he was an Egyptian pharaoh and more 
what's really cool about his case is he has many well-verified cases of healing other people of a 
wide variety of conditions actually he healed someone of shingles another person of knee 
problems another person of a yeast infection another person of myalgic encephalomyelitis 
chronic fatigue syndrome and in fact he has testimonials from several of these people so 
this is pretty well verified and what I'd like to do is play just a small one two minute clip 
so you can hear Terry speak for himself about just a tiny portion of his encounters to a building or 
one person took you into a building yeah and then they took it I thought obviously okay did you not 
wonder why they were doing of course I did not object no but no because I just went in the flow 
I was in a State of Shock I suppose but I did have a feeling that there was no harm in what was happening okay you know you're quite at peace with the situation yeah and of course in later 
years I can only assume that it was a craft that I went on okay that's some sort of a if you like 
alien craft but my advantage of daughter said to me well you don't see UFOs Granddad how can you 
call them UFOs when you claim to be on board these things so you know what they are you know they're 
ships from somewhere else so that was probably a bit of a wake-up call when I was a kid but 
this is my friend telling me that at the time he remembered it it didn't go inside himself there 
was two boys there was Dave and a guy called Roy and they said that they felt as though they were 
so as you can see this is a pretty extraordinary case as you can see it's a very extraordinary case 
and the next case I'd like to talk about involves a gentleman by the name of Jean meguirees 
this case actually took place in France and involves a healing from of injuries resulting 
from a severe auto accident this case is very well known in France and is very well verified 
as well the case of Gene mcgueres was actually researched by French UFO researcher guy teraid 
and his case Jean Maguire's occurred on August 11 1969. Jean Maguires was an ambulance driver 
and was driving his ambulance near ruale France when you heard a telepathic voice say do not be 
afraid nothing bad will happen to you you will feel nothing so this voice came out of the blue 
and it was 20 minutes later while he was still driving when he saw a 60-foot wide metallic object 
shrouded in Mist moving towards him at this time his ambulance was traveling at about a hundred 
miles per hour and at this moment his Ambience was struck by an oncoming vehicle rajin Maguires 
didn't see it coming it was a head-on collision and quite severe and he was actually trapped in 
the wreckage of his vehicle and at this time he says a being quote materialized right next to him 
and assured him that although he was injured he was alive and would feel no pain this being told 
him and I quote I am going to regenerate You by a procedure that is not yet known on your planet 
and this being proceeded to remove a one inch wide glowing white disc from a pouch on his belt 
and placed it against the nape of Jean's neck he felt a prickling sensation moved down his spinal 
column and then the being said this accident was necessary for you but we will come back to see you 
as a result of this accident Gene suffered several broken bones and serious injuries he was rushed to 
the hospital he had to undergo multiple operations and was actually declared clinically dead twice 
and when his gallbladder actually burst the beings telepathically told him to leave this 
hospital he obeyed he left and was put in another hospital the Montpellier hospital near his home 
and there he underwent more operations and had yet another near-death experience 
but after three weeks in the hospital he recovered and was sent home and the beings 
told him he had succeeded in his mission and that quote we will continue to protect you
um unfortunately uh the injuries from this accident were still causing him all kinds 
of problems and in fact three years later he was still in pain and unable to walk and then one day 
this healing was completed in quote record time and he suddenly found himself able to walk even 
without a lamp and like the above case involving Walters uh Gene McGuire has discovered that he had 
quote the gift of healing uh he ended up writing a few books about his experiences and UFOs in 
general he's become a very well-known contactee in his country of France and to this day he says he 
remains in telepathic contact with ETS the third case I'd like to talk about involves a lady from 
Sacramento California by the name of Connie Isel her case is really amazing because all she has 
had lifelong contacts with ETS and has actually been healed on multiple occasions and in fact 
she reports at least three different healings one involving the healing of uterine cramps 
another involving a healing of arthritis and a third healing involving injuries resulting from a 
very severe car accident in fact so severe doctors thought she would lose her leg and of course as we 
shall see that didn't happen throughout her life Connie Isel says that she's experienced quite 
a few unusual paranormal events but never really attributed them to UFOs until 1989 
and it was that year uh she woke up one evening to find her bed surrounded by strange figures 
and although she didn't quite realize it at the time she now realizes that she was in fact being 
visited by extraterrestrials as she says and I quote the ETS are not too pretty to look at though 
one being I see frequently has a hideous head he hides behind a bright glow and a 
long thin torso that moves like an insect's body he reminds me of a praying mantis this 
being seems to be an advisor or teacher whereas the doctors are short little beings 
being examined or operated on by a human doctor is not exactly fun so being examined or operated 
on by non-human doctors with big bald heads and big black eyes can be even more uncomfortable 
yet I have no complaints for example in 1989 I received an ET Health checkup during which they 
injected me with a clear gel similar to white grape jelly I was informed that this was for 
my benefit and that this was a healing there were also lights involved in this procedure 
so she reports that when she woke up the next morning this jelly-like substance still clung 
to her skin and she washed it off in the shower but she is convinced that the ETS cured her of a 
problem she was having involving severe uterine cramping she had been suffering from this for 
several weeks prior to this experience but following this visitation all symptoms disappeared 
that was her first healing but it certainly wouldn't be her last it was just three years later in 1992 that she reported her second healing she woke one morning to find three evenly spaced 
bruises on her knee this was clearly unusual and since she noticed this she also noticed something 
else she had pretty severe arthritis in her knee but following this experience 
her knee didn't hurt at all and the arthritis completely disappeared she's had no pain since 
and it was three years later that she was involved in a severe automobile accident with her friend 
and Connie was left Gravely injured and in fact at the hospital her doctors told her that 
her right leg would have to be amputated Connie however believed that her E.T friends could heal 
her as she had already experienced healings from them before so while in the hospital 
and desperate she prayed to the ETS for health and she is absolutely convinced they responded 
and I'll just quote her directly as Connie says it was an extraordinary feeling to wake 
up alive out of the corner of my eye I saw an E.T a very tall being with whom I was familiar 
when I turned to look at him directly he was no longer there so while Connie doesn't remember 
if they actually operated on her or not she believes they did because to everyone's amazement 
and especially Connie's she recovered quickly and her leg was saved and the doctors were so 
stunned they gave her the nickname Miracle legs so they could not understand how she had been healed 
and this is typical of these cases where people are healed inside hospitals leaves a long trail 
of very amazed and Confused doctors I love Connie isel's case because it involves so many different 
healings and it's also interesting that she was actually healed on one occasion in her hospital 
room about 10 percent of the cases I found involve healings which took place in hospitals which 
sounds extraordinary but there's so many cases it's clear that this is what's actually happening 
and the next case I'd like to talk about involves a gentleman by the name of Jerry Wills I did have 
the wonderful opportunity to meet him face to face and talk about his healing and Jerry Wills was 
healed as a young boy of a severe fever and like many of these cases Jerry Wills also developed 
the ability to heal himself it's an extraordinary case and when I really wanted to include because 
he has so many testimonials of his ability to heal and its healing itself is also extraordinary Jerry 
Wills had his first contact with extraterrestrials in 1965 outside his home in Kentucky he was only 
12 years old at the time and he would often stay outside night after night watching these UFOs 
which looked like star-like objects starting at right angles very high in the sky above his house 
was just a few months later when he had a very close-up sighting of a typical Flying Saucer a 
hovering metallic ship with blinking colored lights and it was the next year when he was 
13 years old he was out in the same location out in the woods near his home when he was 
approached by a blonde-haired blue-eyed stranger dressed in a beige jumpsuit with a silver belt 
this man said his name was Zoe and that he was an extraterrestrial and this began a series of very complex contacts in which Jerry was taught at all different 
subjects about Science History philosophy religion and other subjects and in fact Zoe this human-like 
extraterrestrial visited him about three to six times a month for more than five years 
so this really uh changed Jerry's life forever and these teachings seem to have been highly effective 
for Jerry Wills has since invented several items including a sighting and control helmet 
for Pilots a virtual reality device a guardian Crystal which helps its user detect auras and in 
addition to teaching him many things Wills says that the aliens cured him when he was very ill 
it was night time it was around 1968 he was just a little kid Jerry was in his room suffering from a 
very high fever and in the middle of the night he found himself being taken on board a craft 
and to his surprise this wasn't involving human-like ETS but your typical gray type aliens 
and they told him speaking telepathically to quote relax and let them do their work 
so he did he just lay there on the table while they gave him an injection in each arm 
it's pretty much all he remembers but the next morning he woke up and found that his fever was 
gone he recovered completely in less than a day to this day he still remains in contact 
with his alien friends and today he has become a very well known and Powerful psychic healer 
he has an incredible number of testimonials of people who have been healed by him 
I'm going to put his the address to his website in the description of this video because if you 
want to go there you can read these testimonials yourself so he's yeah a very well-known person 
in this field he often speaks at UFO conventions he's written a book about his experiences called 
fantastic Journeys and has also had a book written about him by researcher Rod haberer this book is 
called healer and focuses on the many cases in which Jerry Wells has been able to heal others 
so this is a pattern we see over and over again with UFO contact people are visited they're healed 
and they themselves become healers the fifth case I'd like to talk about involves a very well-known 
researcher her name is Ellen Crystal sadly she has passed away but as a young child Ellen Crystal 
did report a very unusual healing involving an undiagnosed but pretty severe stomach problem 
and uh it's a very interesting case in might I say even extraordinary which 
is why I wanted to talk about it today Ellen Crystal first became interested in 
UFOs as an adult when she had several UFO sightings outside her home in Hollywood 
and she became very interested in this subject and began to investigate UFO activity in the pine 
bush area of upstate New York and she eventually wrote the very well received book silent Invasion 
about UFO activity in this area she was able to have many sightings and I was actually able to 
photograph UFOs on multiple occasions and on at least one occasion she herself saw a humanoid 
so it became clear to her that she had turned from UFO researcher to a UFO contact d 
ude so this was around the 1980s but after realizing that she was a contactee herself she 
realized that uh are discovered I should say that her contacts probably went much farther back than 
that perhaps as early as 1952 when she was only two years old and living in her home in New Jersey 
with her parents at that age she had developed a very severe illness as Ellen crystal says and I 
quote I had been sick for about nine months but no one knew what I had I recalled the doctors drawing 
outlines of my organs on my abdomen so my mother would could point to the ones that were enlarging 
I also remembered having to stay inside while my friends were outside playing I asked my mother 
what happened when I was sick how old was I what was going on she told me I was about one 
when I started getting sick but nobody knew why she gave me a long account of how I got sicker 
and sicker and no one knew what I had except to say that my stomach was enlarged and very upset 
my parents and the doctors feared I might die because I was so much sicker I said to my mother 
then what and she replied well one day in April you were perfectly fine it was very strange she 
said one day I was deathly ill and overnight I was completely better she never figured it out 
so this was an unresolved mystery for quite some time however years later Ellen Crystal 
went to visit a psychic reader and this psychic not knowing anything about Ellen said that she 
was healed by aliens who had hovered outside her home and affected a cure and Elm believes 
that this was accurate because this psychic was able to provide other information that 
turned out to be totally true such as the color of Ellen's house the date of her illness and more 
so it's a really interesting case of a UFO healing of a UFO researcher 
unfortunately the aliens did not come back to cure Alan Crystal of pancreatic cancer which she 
developed around age 50 to 52 in 2002 at age 52 Ellen Crystal passed away so Ellen crystal is not 
the only UFO researcher who's actually reported a healing have recorded several of these types of 
cases involved in healings of UFO researchers so I think it's an important case and the sixth case 
I'd like to talk about today involves a gentleman by the name of Ivan Rivera Morales I like this 
case because it involves a gentleman who actually asked for a healing and received it and he's also 
a very credible witness he's a police officer so it's absolutely an extraordinary case and 
deserves a place on this list in 1980 Ivan Rivera Morales who was a police officer from Puerto Rico 
began to pray for a miracle because he was in the hospital suffering from a severe case of rheumatic 
fever which was not getting better but he was in such severe pain that he was unable to move and 
the doctors were unable to help him they actually sent him home and one evening as he lay in bed he 
says two golden spheres of light appeared and then transformed into four foot tall gray ETS they told 
him do not be afraid speaking telepathically and the next thing Ivan knows he's inside this 
UFO which took off upward and then dived down into the ocean into an apparent undersea base 
I even described this space as being very dimly lit and freezing cold he was put on a metallic 
table you saw other Grays moving around him they gave him a bitter tasting drink this is something 
that does happen in a number of ET cases including healings he says samples of semen were taken and 
there was a strange mental bonding procedure which again is another procedure many people report 
but according to Ivan he says this imbued him with a great sense of Peace it really gave him a lot of 
comfort he doesn't remember a whole lot else but the next thing he does remember is waking up in 
his bedroom and it was three hours later than he had been taken so following this encounter 
his rheumatism was markedly improved while it wasn't completely gone he no longer suffered any 
pain or the any deformity caused by the disease so this is a very interesting case of healing 
in the last case I'd like to talk about today case seven is really a poignant 
case because it occurred to a four-year-old child who is suffering from rheumatic fever 
his name is Gabriel Ortega and his case is very well verified by doctors his mother was present 
when this healing happened it's one of my favorite cases really of UFO healings on September 28 1988 
a Woman by the name of asbell Ortega Flores she's from purine Chile was driving with her 
mother Alicia and her four-year-old son Gabrielle they're returning to their home actually after 
traveling to a city in Chile called Los Angeles to visit doctors Gabrielle had been diagnosed with 
rheumatoid fever which had severely damaged his heart in fact his condition was so critical that 
his doctors said that even crying or any slight agitation could cause a heart attack and death 
so they are driving along the highway between the cities of angle and Los sauces 
Gabrielle was in the back seat of the car asleep and asbell and her mother Alicia were in the front 
seat they came around a curve in the road to see a large round glowing object with a grayish band 
around the center this object they estimate was about 20 feet in diameter and hovered only a few 
hundred feet above the highway asbell says that they were driving at around 40 miles 
per hour but seeing this strange object they slowed the car down to observe it more closely 
and at this point both she and her mother noticed a strange sensation of heat 
inside their bodies neither of them felt any fear only awe and wonder but what's really interesting 
is at this point suddenly four-year-old Gabrielle woke up and as azbell says and I quote he was very 
animated and chatty before that he had been very limp and unable to even raise his head 
so as they were watching this object and as all of this was going on other cars began to approach 
from the opposite direction as Bell flashed her lights at them trying to get them to look at 
the UFO but oddly none of them seemed to notice it but she did notice an odd layer of quote Dark Mist 
where this UFO was hovering motionlessly so after about a total of 15 minutes this object now moved 
to the right and disappeared over the Treetops and asbell her mother Alicia continued their way 
to their home in Kirin they later returned to Los Angeles for more medical tests and here 
they confirmed that four-year-old Gabriel was no longer sick as able says and I quote 
the doctor was able to ascertain that my son was completely healthy the doctor admitted to me that 
he couldn't find any explanation to the situation so this healing is actually verified by doctors 
it was investigated thoroughly by researchers Ramon Nava asorio and Raul Nunez 
they conducted a full investigation interviewing the family obtaining statements from the doctors 
which said in part at the time events occurred for which there is no known logical explanation since 
this encounter the Flores family reports having many incredible coincidences which assisted them 
through difficult periods in their lives and which they attribute to the UFO they had encountered 
so the investigators ask and I quote is it possible that Gabriel's sudden healing had 
a direct connection with the incredible light that accompanied his mother's car that evening although 
we are always reserved and expecting some other type of explanation which we have not found up to 
this moment we believe that it was the effect of this light that not only affected Gabriel but his 
mother and grandmother as well as both women felt themselves invaded by an intense feeling of heat 
from head to toe this tells us that something was going on at that time on that dark Road so these 
investigators did a very thorough job Ramon Nava Osorio and Raul Nunez they were actually able to 
locate many other reports of sightings along this same stretch of highway around that same time 
not only sightings but Landings and car chases in fact on October 21st 1968 Which is less than 
one month following the flores's encounter an ambulance driver says that his ambulance 
was followed along the same stretch of road by a quote brightly lit UFO as Ramon Nava Osorio 
and Raul Nunez report and I quote an experience such as this is uncanny and certainly more than 
one reader will question its authenticity they are in their right to do so we can only say that 
as a policy we never publish anything without having confirmed the original sources and in 
this event the protagonists themselves restated their experience a fact that leads us to believe 
once more that we know very little about our surroundings much less about ourselves and 
leads us to think that on certain occasions higher intelligences manifest on our Earthly plane there 
you go those are the seven extraordinary cases of extraterrestrial healing and it's really just 
the tip of the iceberg I did Cover these cases in my book the healing power of UFOs 300 documented 
cases of extraterrestrial healing and yeah just the tip of the iceberg there are so many cases 
really cases from every major researcher out there people like Barbara lamb Timothy good Timothy 
Beckley Brad Steiger John Mack Bud Hopkins David Jacobs Edith Fiore Ray Hernandez I could go on 
this is not nearly as rare as people might think again this is a major ET agenda this is one of the 
reasons they are contacting Humanity these cases deserve a lot more attention than they're getting 
and that's really why I wanted to do this episode for you today to let you know that this is an 
ET agenda also how advanced the ETS are in their ability to heal people how widespread these 
cases are and the fact that they do deserve more attention so I hope you've enjoyed this episode 
today I really want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time 
keep searching for answers and most importantly keep having fun bye now
