Summary:
Jun 6, 2025
<p>There can be no doubt that the UFO phenomenon is real. Documented reports of UFOs number in the many millions. There is much debate about what they are and where they come from, but the evidence is overwhelming that they do exist. The same is true for humanoids. Such reports are more rare, but the fact that people are seeing humanoids is undeniable. Cases come from all over the world and have been reported for more than a hundred years. This video presents ten astonishing cases involving a wide variety of humanoids. These ten cases alone provide enough data to offer profound insights into the nature of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.</p>

<p><b>WE CAN’T LET YOU THROUGH</b>. One <b>day in 1930</b>, a woman was driving to her home in Texas when she came upon a saucer-shaped craft landed by the road. Standing in the middle of the road was a group of odd humanoids. She held a brief conversation with the strange beings and continued on her way, arriving home at midnight. She was missing 14 hours of time.</p>

<p><b>IT DOESN’T MATTER, IT’S A CHILD</b>. <b>One morning in 1945</b>, Julio (age 13) left his home in Lavadores, Spain to fetch a pail of water. He had done this many times, but on this occasion, upon reaching the fountain, he was confronted by two strange figures. One looked much like Jesus Christ and the other a tall gray ET. He dropped the bucket and ran.</p>

<p><b>THE GESTICULATING EXTRATERRESTRIAL</b>. <b>One day in August 1958</b>, a man stepped outside his home in rural Paraibo do Sul, Brazil. A shiny craft dropped from the sky and landed nearby. A handsome man with long blond hair and fair skin, wearing a skintight jumpsuit, emerged and began to communicate using a series of gestures. Unable to make himself understood, he re-entered his craft and left.</p>

<p><b>THE GLINIK HUMANOIDS</b>. <b>One summer day in 1950</b>, Sofia X stepped outside her home in Glinik, Poland and saw an odd-looking man standing in a field. Suddenly he levitated into the sky and disappeared. Years later, her 6-year-old son saw a bizarre UFO in the same exact spot. It turned out that many people in the small village were seeing UFOs and many different types of humanoids.</p>

<p><b>IT WAS BEAUTIFUL</b>. At <b>7am on February 15, 1963</b>, Charles Brew and his son milked their cows on their farm in Moe, Australia. Hearing an odd noise, Charles saw a silvery craft emerge from the clouds and hover above a nearby tree. His farm animals scattered, and Charles was amazed to see two humanoid figures in a clear dome on the craft. It darted away, leaving Charles with a bad headache.</p>

<p><b>SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED</b>. On the <b>night of July 20, 1968</b>, three teenage girls saw a glowing UFO over Lake Kaarnajarv, Estonia. Returning inside, their bedroom filled with light, and looking outside they saw a craft hovering nearby. It winked out, but one of the girls felt compelled to go outside and saw a female humanoid standing a short distance away. Later, weird landing traces were found.</p>

<p><b>GLOWING ORANGE HUMANOIDS</b>. On the <b>morning of August 24, 1970</b>, three witnesses from Olmstead Falls, Ohio, waiting for a bus, saw two humanoids dressed in glowing orange jumpsuits and conical hats carrying a strange disc-shaped object over their heads, then walk off into a field. Later another witness was found who saw them enter a craft. Landing traces were found, and more UFOs were seen in the area.</p>

<p><b>EYES LIKE BLACK MIRRORS</b>. One <b>night in July 1988</b>, an 8-year-old boy was awoken by bright colored lights in his room. Looking outside he saw a strange craft. Suddenly the doorway to his room blazed with light and a gray ET appeared. Time seemed to stop as two more beings came in and entered his room. As they approached, he blacked out. Later he wondered if they had come to cure an ill member of the home.</p>

<p><b>WE ARE YOUR SISTERS</b>. One <b>summer evening in 1990</b>, a 6-year-old girl woke up when bright lights streamed into the bedroom of her home in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Suddenly, two slender shadowy figures entered her bedroom. They were gray ETs. She was unable to move as they communicated with her telepathically and conducted a strange exam. It was an encounter that changed her life forever.</p>

<p><b>THE CHILD-LIKE ETS</b>. On <b>December 12, 1997</b>, Jakov Vrancic tended his sheep outside his home in Cvrljevo, Croatia. Hearing an odd buzzing sound, he went to investigate and came upon a landed UFO and several child-like humanoids with large heads and gray skin. He spoke with them for a few minutes until they returned to the craft which took off. Much to his dismay, his case brought him unwanted attention.</p>

<p>These ten cases are just a tiny sample of the growing worldwide database of similar encounters. While our govts have now admitted to the validity of UFOs, they have yet to acknowledge the many humanoid reports. This is strange because these cases represent the cutting edge of UFO research. After all, something or someone is inside UFOs. The evidence points towards UFOs being craft piloted by extraterrestrials.</p>

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
Today, as you may have guessed, I'm going to be talking about humanoids. I
love humanoid cases. I think they represent the cutting edge of UFO research. So much to teach us about who
we are and what's out there in the universe. I call today's episode 10
truly bizarre humanoid encounters. I think what we're dealing with in all of
these cases and in most cases of humanoids are extraterrestrials. I know there's all
kinds of theories out there, but that's certainly my assessment. And the 10 cases I've brought to you today cover
quite a wide period of time all the way from 1930 up to 1997.
And I love digging up those more obscure cases from all over the world. Pretty
sure you haven't heard of most of these cases, but we'll see. cases I brought to you today come from Poland, Spain,
Croatia, Estonia, Australia, as well as Brazil, and four
cases from the United States, including California, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Texas. These cases do involve a wide variety of humanoids. grays, of course,
bra grays are pretty prominent in the UFO field, but humanlooking ETSs, short
humanoids, some really unusual described humanoids I don't know that I've ever
heard before. And yeah, some of these cases have some real high strangeness to
them. I hope that one day we don't consider these cases strange or bizarre,
but I don't think we're quite there yet. Thankfully, this subject is going mainstream. I think we now have enough
evidence to really convince most skeptics, people who are willing to
examine the evidence objectively. And the cases I'm bringing you today, some have multiple witnesses,
corroborating witnesses. A good number of them have some form of evidence, whether it's animal reactions, some
really unusual ones actually, but also physiological effects, landing traces,
and so on. So, this is going to be a pretty long episode, I think. I'm hoping
you find it interesting cuz wow, some of these cases are just so
unusual. Now, first case I'd like to cover today dates all the way back to
1930. I call this one, we can't let you through. This is a direct quote from the
apparent ETSs that this lady from Texas encountered way back in 1930. I like
this case because it's a very early case. This lady decided to contact a UFO
organization after reading about the Betty and Barney Hill case many years after her encounter.
Unfortunately, she contacted the wrong UFO organization, which led to some
pretty disappointing consequences, but did result in her encounter being
documented, and I'd like to share it with you today because it is very
unusual. This case comes from the fall 2003 issue of the International UFO
Reporter in an article by researcher, as I said, Michael Swords. The title of the
article is Too Close for Condan: Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind. Now, as
you may know, the Condan Committee was an Air Force funded UFO study in operation from
1966 to 1968 and is well known in the UFO community for its biased,
unobjective attitude against the reality of UFOs. It's widely believed to be an
attempt by the Air Force to extricate itself from the UFO subject rather than a scientific study. Was widely panned by
UFO researchers. And in fact, one year later, Project Blue Book, the main Air Force study, was closed down. Most of
Condan's material came directly from Blue Book, but they did receive a few reports directly from witnesses,
including this one from a Texas woman. They actually ignored the report and declined to investigate it. The woman,
I'll call her Margaret, that is a pseudonym, wrote to the Conan committee in 1968 because she had an experience 38
years earlier that had left her with chronic nervousness and nightmares. She said she was elderly and suffering from
ill health. Her doctor told her that her deteriorating health was being exacerbated by something on her mind
that was a source of stress. But Margaret refused to tell her doctor about this encounter. She was afraid her
family would think, quote, that I'd lost all my marbles. So instead, she wrote to
the condent committee seeking help from them. But sadly, she got no help from them. But she was able to have her case
documented. Her story began around 1000 a.m. one morning in 1930 as she drove
alone along a road in an isolated hilly area somewhere in Texas about 15 miles
from her home which was her destination. And this is when she encountered a classic flying saucer by the side of the
road and a group of unusual humanoids standing in the middle of the road blocking her way. And she describes her
encounter in great detail. And this is what Margaret said. I remember turning a
curve in the road and running up to and under the side of a huge thing sitting
by the road. I was within a few steps of it, almost under one side of it when I
stopped. It was sort of a shiny gunmetal color, round and shaped like two dinner
plates face to face with a dome on the upper top side. It was about 100 ft
across, about 15 ft thick. So she saw a door was open on the craft. It had a
ramp leading down to the ground with steps on it. This craft had settled on uneven terrain. So the back section of
the craft sat on the ground itself, but the front part where the terrain was lower sat on two thin landing legs with
circular landing pads at the bottom. You can see her drawing. Blocking the road
was a group of eight or 10 child-sized figures and one six-foot taller figure
who appeared to be a man. Margaret's first impression was that she had actually come upon a boy scout troop and
their scoutmaster. But it wasn't long before things became strange cuz she saw that
these figures were not only dressed strangely, they looked strange and were acting strange. All of them were
identical tan colored uniforms. But as Margaret says, I saw that there were no
pockets, buttons, edges, wrinkles, or pocket flaps. Very clean, neat, and
nice. They wore tight little caps, cut like baseball caps with narrow little
bills. Now, their appearance was even more strange. She thought for a second that they might be Asian, but soon
noticed that no, they were much stranger. As Margaret says, they had very large, slanted eyes, very large
cheekbones, and very thin lips. The tall one walked up to her and as Margaret
says, forced me to stop while he talked to me, or at least I think he talked,
although I did not see his lips move, and he turned his face away and looked down. Now, as he spoke to her in what
was clearly telepathy, the smaller figures approached behind him, and as Margaret says, they did not look like
children, but adults. They smiled at me, but did not speak. I had to smile back
because they were sort of pushing each other around in horseplay, like each one trying to get in front of the other to
see better and acting like kids will. So, at this point, the tall man began to
argue with her. He told her, "Lady, you'll have to leave the highway and go around as we have the road blocked
here." So, she ignored this instruction, pointed to the saucer, and said, "What
is that?" The man evaded her question and said, "Never mind. You'll just have
to go around. We want the road left clear and open and can't let you through here." He pointed to the rocky golly
alongside the road and the steep hill leading back up to the road and said, "You are a wonderful driver, and you can
make it all right." Now Margaret started to feel some fear, and seeing that the way the man was pointing at was an 40°
angle down and very rough, she argued with him and told him, "I can't put this
big car down through that creek and rocks. It would tear my car all to pieces, and I could never get out the
other side. Besides, you don't own this highway. So, once again, events became
even stranger, as Margaret says. Somehow, I couldn't help myself and
daisedly drove very slowly and fearfully down into this creek and rough canyon. I
realized that the man was walking right along with me. I felt very safe then, and was able to make the crossing, and
was no longer afraid. I wonder why. So Margaret doesn't remember what happened
next. She seemed to lose consciousness and came back to awareness standing on
her home porch. It was now around midnight, so she was missing about 14
hours of time that she could not account for. And as Margaret says, where I was,
where I went, what happened to me those many hours, I have no idea. She did make
some inquiries and learned that her neighbors had actually driven along that road during the period of missing time
and saw her car parked on the hillside off the road. They continued driving and
informed her family. And when Margaret showed up, her father was just beginning to form a search party to look for her.
Now, in her letter to the condom committee, Margaret wrote that I was taken aboard this saucer and carried
away god knows where. I haven't a simple doubt. But if this did not happen as I
remember it, then what did I want to know so badly that I'm sick? Something
did happen. What? I want to know the truth, the whole truth, regardless of
what it was. So Margaret in her letter offered to be interviewed and even go
under hypnosis. Michael Swords in a scathing critique of the condom committee writes of this case
and the others similar to it that were rejected by them and I quote the project
ignored her. Condan filed the letter under the category psychological the
project and Ed Condan couldn't be bothered. This is an old and sickly lady
asking for some help. This inaction was a type of sin of omission that reflects
badly on Colorado. One must wonder what UFO research might have been like if
Colorado had been a serious open-minded dare one say scientific research
project. Might we have been able to establish an uncontaminated set of C4
cases with data gained under the opaces of a sanctioned academic study? This
element of the UFO phenomenon might have been established or at least clarified 15 years before it arose from the work
of a friendly UFO investigator and artist named Bud Hopkins. Congratulations Ed Condan, Bob Low,
David Saunders, and Norm Lavine. All of you, as usual, blew it. So, these were
of course the major players in the Condan Committee, but kudos to Dave Saunders. credit to him because he later
wrote a book called UFOs, yes, which stated unequivocally that UFOs are real
and the condom committee was a disaster. Thanks to Michael Swords for bringing
this case to our attention and shame on the condom committee. Here's a lady
who's just seeking help about her encounter and they don't help her. This is really, I think, the main purpose for
UFO organizations. But as I think we all know now, the condom committee was
hardly an objective scientific body. Really unfortunate, but what an unusual
case. I don't think there's any possible way that this lady would have normally
been able to drive her car off the road like did happen in this case. So, something really unusual is going on
there. But yeah, some very interesting aspects to this case. She did not jump
to the ET explanation right away thinking this might be a boy scout troop
with a scout master. I thought it was very interesting the way she described these short little guides as being very
playful almost like children make actually made her smile but also a
pretty traumatic case for her in some ways with gosh 14 hours of missing time.
doesn't look like we'll ever find out what happened during those missing 14 hours because by now sadly the witness
must most certainly have passed away. But what an interesting case and
definitely worthy of being wellknown. So now let's move to the next case. This one is also really
interesting and unusual. I call this one it doesn't matter. It's a child. This
one occurred way back in 1945 in Lava Dores. This is in Val, Spain. It's quite
an unusual case. It's not that rare for people to see multiple types of
entities, and that's what's going on in this case. But, as we'll see, the entities in this case are quite unusual.
It's also interesting because the winners encountered them in a public place kind of where you'd least expect
to see ETSs or apparent ETSs. But yeah, it's a it's a brief case, but I think
you'll find it really fascinating. The main witness in this case, Julio F, was
only 13 years old at the time of his encounter. He lived with his family in the Lavadores area of Vivo, Spain, a
largely urban area. And near his house, there was this public fountain where
people in the neighborhood went to gather fresh water or wash their clothes. This fountain was right next to
the street inside a small enclosure with access through an open entrance, a gate,
and in the center there was the small laundry room. It was one of Julio's daily chores to gather water from the
fountain each morning. This morning, at his mother's request, Ulio grabbed a water bucket and went to
go get some water, just as he had done many times before. But this time,
something happened that had never happened before. Going through the open gate entrance, he was astonished to see
two strangely dressed beings standing at the back of the laundry room and talking
to each other. And in fact, their appearance was so strange, and Julio was so amazed by them that he immediately
dropped the water bucket and stared in astonishment. One of these figures was
located in the innermost part of the laundry room. His right arm and hand were extended and was pointing at
something. Now, this being had very long hair, a thin beard, and was dressed in a
long tunic. And Julio's first thought was that this figure looked very much like Jesus Christ.
But the other figure looked completely different. This other figure was bald, had large, slanted eyes, and looked much
like a gray alien. It also wore an ankle length tunic. So Julio was so amazed by
this strange sight that he just froze in place. These two beings immediately noticed Julio's presence, and one of
them said to the other, "It doesn't matter. It's just a child." And at that
moment they vanished into thin air. Julio did not see them walk out. They just disappeared. Now seized by fear and
panic, he ran straight home, completely forgetting and ignoring his task to bring back water. And in fact, he
refused to go back until some time had passed. And when he did, the beings were of course gone. Years later, he looked
back on this incident as a possibly an encounter with religious figures and says that although it astonished and
frightened him, it did not really cause any profound changes in his life, but it
was something he remembered for a very long time. He and his family later immigrated to Argentina. So, there was
no apparent UFO craft in that case. So, possibly there is a different
explanation. And the witness did kind of take a religious viewpoint towards this
encounter. Very hard to say because certainly sounds like a typical gray ET.
As far as this Jesus looking figure, I don't know. It's very unusual. You can
make up your own minds about it. There is sometimes these mixed motif cases
that do have what appear to be religious elements to it but really unusual and
certainly a fascinating case. And so is this next one which I call the
justiculating extraterrestrial. This occurred in August 1958 in Paribbo dovil. This is in
Brazil in a rural area. This is a single witness case, but what a close encounter
this gentleman had. Actually saw this craft land. Saw this beautiful
humanlooking male ET come out and had a really interesting and fairly lengthy
interaction with this being. That alone makes this case, I think, super
interesting. And hopefully you will find it interesting, too. This case comes from longtime Brazilian researcher Dr.
Walter K. Bueller, a very respected researcher. The witness is anonymous,
though his name is known by Dr. Beller. For the purposes of this report, I'll
just give him the pseudonym Luis. It was one day in August of 1958 that Luis
stepped outside his home located about 30 kilometers from Paribbo Do in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. And this is when movement in the sky caught his eye. Looking up, he saw a shiny object
descending silently and apparently coming towards him. Before he could react, this craft landed a short
distance away, close enough that Louise could hear a whining noise coming from it. He could see it was yellow, golden
in color, shaped like two bowls placed end to end, and around the circumference
where these two pieces were joined together at the rim, he could see small rectangular openings which now appeared
to release a quote faint white smoke. Now, curious but cautious, Louise walked
closer, and getting quite near it, he saw a small round port hole opening on
the lower part of the craft. Immediately, the head and shoulders and upper torso of a human-looking male
emerged from the port hole. And this UFO occupant looked directly at Luis and
smiled at him. Now, Luis's first impulse was to turn around and run, but he found
that he was so afraid that he was rooted to the spot. This humanoid got out of
the craft and walked right up to Luis, who could now see the man clearly.
Louise said that this man was about 5' 7 in tall, had long blonde hair, an
unblenmished pink complexion with no facial hair, and was, as Louise said,
good-looking. He was dressed in a light colored jumpsuit with no pockets, no seams. And this man reached down and
picked up a stone and seemed to examine it. Now during this time he never spoke
a word nor did Luise receive any telepathic messages. Instead this man
began to make a series of gestures and gesticulations in an apparent attempt to
communicate with Louise. First he stretched out his open hand towards Louise who not understanding this
gesture just kind of stood there. The man then made a second gesture, pointing
forward, apparently trying to communicate something which Louise did not understand. Luis wondered if perhaps
the man was referencing the hills in the trees or something else around them in
the environment. But with Luis not understanding, the man seemed to react
with a movement of disgust or even anger, he turned away from Louise,
stroed back to the machine, climbed back inside. Shortly afterwards, this craft rose slowly at first and then after
reaching a certain elevation, zipped away at very high speed. Case after case
after case, you know, at that time when this encounter occurred, there really weren't a whole lot of humanoid
encounters. And the vast majority of researchers actually refused to even investigate humanoid encounters. If it
was a sighting, sure, they'll take it seriously. But investigators were very reluctant to deal with anything
involving humanoids, which to me is so unbelievable because clearly
something has to be inside these craft or someone. Certainly that's exactly
what we're seeing. Uh humanoid encounters now again, I think, are
considered the cutting edge of UFO research. the front lines, the kinds of
cases where we learn the most about who these visitors are. Uh so yeah, an
important case. Now, let's move to the next case, which is actually a series of cases that
I call the Glenique humanoids. This took place primarily in
1963 in the small Polish town of Glenique in Poland. And yeah, several
humanoid encounters in this one, but all types of sightings and landings, really
unusual events. Uh, there might be something about this
town that is drawing all this activity. I don't know. I tend to think that
everywhere in the world has a long, rich history of encounters, but definitely
this little town in Poland has its fair share. This series of really interesting UFO
events comes from Polish researcher Arcadia's Miyaza and were published in
his book UFOs in Subcarpathia in the Polish language. Now
the earliest incident involves a lady by the name of Sophia L who says that one
summer morning in early 1950s. She was outside her home in the
small village of Glenique about 15 mi south of the much larger city of
Rapsai. She was walking outside her home when she saw something she couldn't explain. Standing in front of her less
than 20 ft away in a field was a strange figure. Now, it was facing the other
direction, so she couldn't see its face, only its backside. But it was dressed, she said, in brown clothes and looked
like a broad shouldered man about 175 cm tall. But what really surprised her was
when this figure took a few steps forward, then seemed to push strongly off the ground and actually rose,
levitated into the air. He levitated upwards about five or 10 feet, and then
suddenly just disappeared into thin air. Now, she did not know what to think of it. She just kind of filed it in the
back of her mind. But many years later, in the summer of 1963, her six-year-old son would have an
even more remarkable encounter with a unusual
UFO. Her son Tomas, this is a pseudonym, was playing in a clearing near their
barn when he suddenly felt, as he put it, quote, of place. he said. Goosebumps
ran up and down his spine. And he looked around to see if anything unusual was happening. And sure enough, looking in
front of him to the north, he saw a very strange object sitting on the ground about 12 ft away from him. Was not
large, about 3 ft wide, 19 cm tall, gray in color with darker spots. It was
pulsating in brightness, seemed to be trembling slightly, but was completely silent. Now, although Tomas was only six
years old, he could see that this was something strange he had never encountered before. He was intrigued.
So, he slowly approached it. And as he got closer, he could feel heat coming from this object. He kept walking
towards it and stood right next to it, then placed the palm of his hand directly on it. He said it felt quote
cold and sticky. Now, the moment he touched it, he became instantly and
totally immobilized. He couldn't cry out. He couldn't move, although he wanted to. And as his fear mounted, this
object suddenly let him go. Tomas stepped back and armed with his
handkerchief, he threw it at the object with all his might and turned and ran to get his mother. They both returned to
the site and found nothing except Tomas's handkerchief. But Sophia did note that the spot where Tomas had seen
this strange object was the exact same spot where she had seen this humanoid about 10 years earlier. And as it turned
out, many other strange things were happening in this area. In fact, it was just a few months earlier that spring,
three young boys, all around 9 years old, saw a similarly shaped object, 30
cm long, 10 cm tall, moving about 20 ft above the ground, flying among the
trees. The boys were impressed enough to throw sticks at the object to try to hit
it. Now, this area has many sightings and of course humanoids. In the summer
of 1985, at least two residents of this town, Glenique, saw what looked like a
glowing yellow pink cross hovering at low elevation between two barns. It had
a weird wavering appearance, was totally silent, and disappeared after a few seconds. It was just a few months later,
one October night in 1985, a young boy who lived in the village came running into his home,
telling his family that he saw quote, "Something strange outside." Immediately, the room filled
with red light. So they and all the other neighbors came running out of their homes and saw this 9 to 10 foot
wide red sphere with vertical stripes hovering about 300 ft away moving over a
meadow. It appeared to be slightly transparent because they could see something more solid moving back and
forth inside. It was flying about 60 ft above the ground, then suddenly dissolved in the air, leaving behind a
trail of gray blue smoke. very strange. And later in November of 1991, at the
house next door, a lady by the name of Christina said that she went to bed and
moments later saw the silhouette of a humanoid figure near her bed. At that
exact moment, she became totally paralyzed, was quite frightened, and watched this creature glide in a sort of
floating fashion towards her bed. She could now feel a strange coldness as it moved by the foot of her bed and
presumably disappeared. Now, here is one of the more interesting cases in this area, also involving a humanoid. This
occurred in 1999 to a gentleman by the name of Jek. He's a 50-year-old
handyman. He was walking through his backyard around 11 p.m. when he noticed
a strange glow behind a grove of trees. He approached and saw that the glow was
coming from a dark figure surrounded by a glowing aura. It was standing about 90
ft away from him. So he approached to within 10 maybe 20 ft. But he stopped
because all the hair on his body started to stand on end. He was close enough to
see that this figure was just under 6 feet tall. It appeared to be a thin young man with short hair. But the
strangest thing was this strong aura of light surrounding him. But then the man
spoke to Jac saying quote come to me. This made Jek very afraid as he says
Lord I don't want to go anywhere yet. It was at that moment that this figure rose
up into the air levitating. The wind began to swirl around him. He rose 10 or
20 feet into the air and disappeared. J6 said he felt very cold, but at the
same time broke out in a cold sweat. He had no idea how to explain the appearance and disappearance of this
strange figure. Few years later, March 29, 2002, he was carrying buckets of
water into his house when he saw a reddish pink sphere flying about 150 ft
above the ground and coming close. It flew directly over his house, lighting
up the area as bright as daylight, he said, and then moved off, disappearing behind the house. One final encounter in
this area, also involving the humanoid, occurred on May 16, 2009. The witness was Maric. He's a
48-year-old farmer. It was around 400 p.m. that day that he and his neighbor had lit a small campfire to cook some
sausages. Marak was sitting on a bench among the trees when he heard a strange
echoing sound coming from the nearby barn. This is about 75 ft away. And
looking in that direction, he saw a strange mysterious figure standing completely motionless next to the barn
and staring right at him. This figure was about 6 feet tall, appeared to be
quite thin and frail, dark in color, and had long black hair. He was wearing a
cloak much like priests wear and then this figure moved behind the barn. So Markx jumped up, chased after it, came
around the barn, but this figure was gone. Had somehow completely disappeared. There you go. What really
drew me to investigate this particular case was the one involving the mother
and her son. She having an encounter years before her son did, but in the
same place where he encountered this very small craft, actually walked up to
it and touched it. So unusual. A really interesting series of events. Thanks to
Arcadi for investigating these. I wish I could read Polish. I would check out his
book in a heartbeat. But super interesting. All right, let's move to
the next case. I love this one. It's just really fascinating. Of course, I
think all these cases are fascinating, as you can probably guess. But yeah, this one, I don't know. There was just
something really unusual about it. I call this one, it was beautiful. This
occurred on February 15, 1963 at a small farm called Willow
Grove. This is located in Mo in Victoria, Australia. This particular
encounter got quite a bit of press attention at the time, but wow does it have some really unusual elements to it.
This case, again, often called the Willow Grove Encounter, comes from one of the first true scientists to look
into this subject, atmospheric physicist Dr. James Macdonald. It was 700 a.m. one
cloudy, rainy day on February 15, 1963, as Charles Brew and his son
Trevor, age 21, stepped outside their ranch, Willow Grove Farm in Mo,
Victoria, Australia, to milk their cows. They had a herd of about 40 cows, and
they were in the milking shed with 10 of the cows had just started about 10 minutes ago. The 30 other cows were out
in the fields and looking outside a window of the milking shed. This is when Charles noticed a strange craft emerging
out of the lowhanging cloud base. He remarked on it to his son and said, "It
looks like a flying saucer." And he watched as his craft moved across the sky, slowed down, and descended at a
steep angle, and then proceeded to hover about 40 ft directly above a large tree.
There were no lights that he could see on this object. It was emitting a worring sound which Charles described as
much like a bull roar or a digery do. Charles son Trevor also heard this sound
which he said definitely didn't sound like an engine but made it sound more like a yard stick sounds when you were
it in the wind as he said like a lump of wood being swung around in the breeze.
So basically the same sound that Charles heard. Now, shortly after this object
hovered above the tree, the nearby herd of 30 cows took off running with two
groups forming, each fleeing in the opposite directions away from the strange craft. The horses also took off
while his two farm dogs who normally followed him everywhere both took off. And as Charles says, the cows turned
somersaults and the horse reared up in panic. Now, Charles was close enough to
see this object in pretty good detail. said it was about 10 ft high, 20 feet
across, shaped very much like a child's toy spinning top, though flatter in
shape. You can see his drawing here. There was a bottom section which revolved slowly counterclockwise at a
rate of one revolution per second, slow enough that he could see what looked like small scooped holes on the edges.
This seemed to glow a pale blue color. But most amazing was that there was a
transparent domed top section. And inside this, Charles could see what
appeared to be two humanoid figures, though they were not clearly defined.
And he hesitated to talk about them. But Charles said that he felt almost as if he could not look away. And as he said,
it was quote as though a beam of magnetic current were keeping his gaze
fixed on the strange craft. Now his son Trevor rushed to the window
to view the object. But before he could see it, this object accelerated away at the same steep angle it had used upon
arrival and disappeared back into the cloud cover. The entire duration of the
sighting was no more than 15 seconds. But here's something interesting. As
soon as it arrived, Charles developed this strange headache. And the longer it stayed, even for just 15 seconds, the
stronger this headache became. And this headache lasted for hours and up through
the next day. Trevor did not experience this. But another weird aftere effect,
Charles noticed that there was a 10% reduction in milk production from the cows for one week after this encounter.
Charles did say that his neighbor Len Roswell had seen a UFO three years earlier, which he said was shaped like a
big long German sausage, and also that his friend Ron Dent had previously seen
a flying saucer. This case ended up receiving considerable press attention years after the fact. The military tried
to explain it away as a weird electromagnetic effect from perhaps a tornado. Now, while this saucer did
cause a headache and reduction in milk production, Charles does not view this encounter as negative, as he says, I
wish it would come again. It was beautiful. I could feel the life pulsating from it. Now, here's a really
interesting and weird coincidence. Following this sighting, just a month or two later, they found a meteorite, a
large one, over a foot wide, weighing some 50 lbs. Get this. Directly below
where the saucer had hovered a few months earlier. How about that? So interesting. And another case that could
easily have been lost to posterity if not for Dr. James Macdonald interviewing
the witness. Really, really amazing. And some of the aspects to this
case are just so unusual. Can only imagine what it must be like to see a cow doing a somersault trying to get
away from a UFO. So interesting how all the animals on this farm reacted. I'm guessing that
they can sense the presence of a UFO in ways that are beyond perhaps our own
senses. But also interesting because the primary witness says that he immediately
sensed the energy coming this from this craft. Could not look away almost as if there was a magnetic bond between him
and these ETs. Also interesting is he says that this headache developed
instantly and grew stronger the longer this craft was in view. Such an amazing
case considering it lasted less than a minute long. Also very interesting is
the synchronicity of him finding a fairly large meteorite just a month or
two after the encounter directly below where this UFO hovered. Could be pure
coincidence, but I don't know. Maybe that's why the UFO was there. I haven't heard of anything like that, but who
knows? It's just an interesting detail that makes you wonder. All right, let's
move on to the next case, which I call something strange happened. This is
another case that hasn't really gotten a whole lot of attention, but is certainly worthy of it. It occurred on July 20,
1968 in Lake Carnage, Estonia. Actually, on the shore of the lake. Like this case
for a number of reasons. It's got multiple witnesses, a UFO lands, there's
landing traces, and of course, a humanoid. In fact, what appears to be a
female humanoid. So, a really interesting case. This case comes from researcher Juri Lena and was published
in the Flying Saucer Review volume 24 number one. The witnesses are three
14-year-old girls, all anonymous. They had heard of UFOs because at that time
accounts were often appearing in the newspapers and magazines. And the girls were excited about it. They talked about
their desire to have a UFO encounter someday. And this actually happened when they were staying at the Vesy Sports
Camp located on the shores of Lake Carnage near the city of Otapa in
northern Estonia. It was on the evening of July 20, 1968, sometime between midnight and
1:00 a.m. when one of the girls, I'll call her Rebecca, that's a pseudonym,
says, quote, "Something strange happened." And I'll just quote her
directly. And she says, "We were sitting at a wooden table behind the house, our
usual dining place. I remember it was an unusually silent and beautiful moonlit
night. Suddenly, we noticed a bright star moving at high speed in the sky.
Soon, it joined a cigar-shaped object that had suddenly appeared, and in a short time, it was gone, out of sight."
As it was already late, we decided to go to bed. It is interesting to add that we
felt a strange threatening fear all the time. It was as if we anticipated some
curious event. The feeling paralyzed us and we felt it even in the room. The
large cigar in the air added to the fear. The sighting alone was exciting enough, but the strange events had only
just begun. As Rebecca says, "When I began to undress, the room was suddenly
filled with light. My girlfriend shouted, "Look, what's that?" I turned
towards the window and I saw a big bright object at a distance of about 50 meters. I thought it was like a bus. It
was surrounded by a reddish orange and yellow beams as of a search light. We
were dazzled by the light, but soon it went out and only a dark glowing nebula
remained in view. It began to radiate blue green light. We could also see a
blue green stripe around the object which seemed to diminish in size. It
reminded us a bit of a disc. This bluish light was very mysterious. It
illuminated the surrounding woods and filled us with fear. The object was in our field of view for about 5 minutes.
Then we heard a gentle buzz and it was gone. We could not see it take off. It
disappeared behind the bushes at the side of the country road. Now, when they viewed this thing, the object appeared
to be landed on the ground an estimated 450 ft away from the witnesses. And the
encounter now seemed to be over. But actually, the most exciting part was yet to come. Starting when Rebecca had a
very strange and overwhelming impulse. As Rebecca says, again, I quote, "Now I
felt an urgent need to go outside, although I felt stiff when watching the
object. When I reached the corner of the house, I saw a small human-shaped figure
which looked like a woman. This figure was standing in the place where the object had been, and it could have been
about 140 150 cm tall. This is 4 and 1/2 to 5 ft. And as she says, it had what
seemed like a shining silver ribbon across its breast. The creature vanished
suddenly into the air. I could see it for a very short time only. Then I went
back to my room. Now the girls spent a restless night as you can imagine. And
when morning arrived, there were several interesting discoveries made. Rebecca
and the other two witnesses shared their experience with their friends, but to their disappointment, they were not
taken seriously and were actually advised by their friends not to talk about it. They soon learned, however,
that there were other witnesses. The kitchen workers said that they had been rowing on the lake around midnight at
the same time of this encounter when they heard a very loud noise very close
to the lake, which was apparently unusual and unexplained. This really surprised the witnesses because they did
not remember hearing any noise. But even more interesting was that they went to
the area and discovered what appeared to be landing traces. As Rebecca says, in
the place where the object had been, the ground seemed burned as if a load of lime had eaten into the grass. The
burned place was vaguely circular with a diameter of about 2 m. It was strange.
In the region of 30 m up the road, there were most peculiar prints in the soil,
as if the object had jumped along the road. Now, researcher Juri Lena not only
interviewed Rebecca, he spoke with her mother who confirmed that Rebecca and
her friends had told her about the incident, but although there were a lot of other people at the Vesca Sports
Club, nobody else reported seeing anything strange. An amazing case by any
account and came very close to not being documented, as I think the vast majority
of cases do. there people are discouraged from talking about it. Many
of them keep silent for years. Most often cases are not
immediately researched. So a lot of the evidence that would support it gets lost
such as the landing traces in this case which people reported but unfortunately investigators did not get to examine
them directly. But so interesting and uh
I think important. It's an unusual case. To me, the most interesting aspect to it
is how the witnesses reported this oz effect that we hear so often about, this eerie silence, and also the feeling that
something else was going to happen, which makes me wonder if perhaps there was some sort of telepathic
communication going on with the main witness, something that made her look outside and saw this female humanoid.
Really interesting and so unusual. But if you think that's unusual, just wait. This next case is off the charts
strange. I call this one glowing orange humanoids. This took place on August 24,
1970 in Olmstead Falls, Ohio, right in the middle of the suburbs. During
daytime, multiple witnesses saw these very strange glowing orange humanoids
who appeared to be largely human, but clearly weren't and were dressed so strange. I can't say I've ever heard
anything quite like this. But I think we have to take it seriously because there are quite a few witnesses and apparent
landing traces and all kinds of activity going on in this area at that time. This
case comes from Ohio Muon and was first publicized at the 1971 National UFO
Conference in Cleveland, Ohio, and was later published by longtime researcher Rick Hillberg. The main witness is
Raymond L. His last name was withheld at his request. was 6:35 in the morning on
August 24, 1970 as Raymond and two others had just reached the bus stop
located at the intersection of Lindberg and West Road in Olmstead Falls, Ohio.
You can see the location here. And this is when all three of them noticed something none of them had ever seen
before. As Raymond says, we saw two strange figures approaching us on the
road which crossed our bus route. The two figures were dressed in orange suits
from head to foot. They were 5t tall. The headdresses were conicle. Only their
faces were uncovered and their skin was yellowish. He said, "These beings appeared to be
carrying a disc-like object above their heads, though Raymond does not describe how big this object was. But as they
watched, these beings walked about 50 ft up to a small house and then walked side
by side away to a railway crossing about 600 ft from the corner where the
witnesses were located. The beings then stopped by the railway. A car driving by
on a road stopped right in front of them. The passengers apparently looked at this strange being for a period of
about 10 seconds, then sped quickly away. The figures then walked a short
distance towards the witnesses. But at this point, the bus arrived. Raymond and
the others climbed on board. Raymond says that as they boarded the bus, one of the beings extended his arm upwards.
Raymond could now see that this being appeared to be wearing a cape and he had the impulse to get off the bus and
approach these figures. But as he says he was quote unsure of the
consequences. So that was the extent of the encounter. But later that night he went to the area where the beings had
first appeared and found the high grass in the field was quote quite disturbed,
twisted and matted and there were two fresh paths going to this spot. Now, a
few days later, he did find another witness to this event. As Raymond says,
I talked with the children who lived in the house which the figures approached. A girl about 9 years of age said that at
about 9:00 that morning, she saw an object like a huge bubble come down from
the sky to that very same place I found. She said two figures were waiting there.
When the vehicle landed, they entered. It then rose quickly and disappeared.
Now, researcher Rick Hillberg has since tried to locate other witnesses, but has not been
successful. Interestingly, this encounter occurred only a few blocks from his house. He did find a case in
that same area that occurred some 3 years later on October 1st, 1973. was 3:30 a.m. A lady by the name
of Barbara Marquart was driving in her car when she saw a glowing green sphere
move over her vehicle and then land in a field again in this area of Mstead. She
rushed home and called the police and as police chief Richard Nasiel says, "We
couldn't locate anything back there, but it's a large field. Several people did hear some strange eerie noises. They
have never heard anything like it before. It did upset the animals. One horse even ran off. Now, it turned out
that several other witnesses had also seen this green sphere. And all the witnesses agreed that it was quote real
bright. Now, three years before Raymond's encounter with these humanoids, on November 11,
1967, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Dort of the FAA in Northolstead actually
told Project Blue Book authorities that their office had picked up an unidentified quote primary target in an
area where there ordinarily was no air traffic. They could see on their scopes that it was moving at about 50 m hour.
Was also tracked by radar in Buffalo. As far as they know, nobody observed this
object visually. They really tried to explain this away as a balloon. However,
all attempts to locate any balloon in that area yielded no results. Such an
amazing case. Really unusual because there's multiple witnesses seeing humanoids quite close up during the day.
There's landing traces. That other case having radar confirmation is certainly
interesting. Can't say it's directly connected to this one, but clearly this area, Olmstead, Ohio, has quite a bit of
activity. Such a unusual case. Now, let's move to the next one, which is
particularly poignant. Really touched me. I This kid had such an amazing
encounter with a parent Graze in his bedroom at night. And you can tell from
his testimony how deeply it affected him. I call this one eyes like black
mirrors. This occurred one evening in July of 1988 in the small town of Lynen,
California. But wow, the witness's description of these ETs is just so
vivid. Eyes like black mirrors. That really gives you an idea of what it's like to look into the eyes of a gray ET.
Most often, people are very much impressed by the the entity's eyes.
There's something about them that that I think is particularly hypnotizing and they sort of look
through it and is how many people put it, but I think you'll find this case really fascinating. This case reported
to MUN has not, as far as I know, been officially investigated, so it's largely
anecdotal, but it does involve a clearly sincere firsthand testimony from the
witness himself. He actually kept it secret for almost 40 years. as he says,
"I have shared this story with two people only because I don't know what to make of it." The witness, I call him
Ethan, that is a pseudonym, was seven or eight years old at the time of his encounter. It was around July in
1988. He had gone to visit his brother in Lynen, California, and one evening in
the middle of the night, the sound of the dog barking outside woke him up.
As he woke up, he saw bright flashing lights through the bedroom window. He
first thought it might be a police car, but going to the window to look outside, he was shocked at what he saw, says
Ethan. I saw a cylinder-shaped object in the front yard with multicolored lights
spinning around the top in a circle was hovering close to the ground, 10 ft off
the ground. I remember a strange buzzing noise. Now, Ethan's brother was sleeping
in the same room but did not wake up. And per Ethan, he noticed a weird
effect. Time seemed to move at a very slow pace. Quote, almost like everything
stopped, but he could still move. And this is when he noticed a blindingly
bright light coming down the hallway. So bright it was almost like a spotlight.
Everything was so strange he wondered if he might be dreaming. But then he saw something even more shocking. And again,
I'll quote him directly because he describes this in detail. Says Ethan,
"What I saw I will never ever forget in my lifetime. I saw a tall, dark, skinny,
almost human-shaped body, a figure come out of the room and stand by the doorway. It was not dressed. It had no
clothes, no genitals. It had dark charcoal gray skin, long fingers, but it
only had two or three fingers. The figure had a strangely large head, no
hair, but the shape of the head was round with a point on the top. I remember the black eyes the most, like
black mirrors. They were teardropshaped. They slanted up on the right and left
side, and they did not close. It didn't have a nose, just two small slits below
the eyes and a small mouth. I stood there trying to figure out what I was
seeing. It stared at me. I wasn't scared at the sight of the first alien. It kept
tilting its head while it was looking at me. I was trying to understand what I was seeing, and I was curious as we just
stared at each other for about a minute or two, about 8 ft away. I had the urge
to walk towards it, but never did. Something initially was comforting to
me. I cannot explain that feeling. Then I saw two more. They looked at each
other. They didn't speak or make any noises at all. Now, Ethan had a distinct
impression that this first ET was mentally communicating to the other two that he Ethan was awake. At this point,
he was not afraid. But soon events began to escalate. as Ethan says. Then they
started walking towards me. At first, I froze. I was so scared I panicked. All I
could think to do was run. I got spooked when the other two of them came towards me. And I remember not feeling the same
way about them. I felt an uncomfortableness with them. I remember feeling like time stopped or slowed in
some way, and everyone around was completely oblivious to what was happening around me. So with nowhere to
go, Ethan jumped into bed, pulled the covers over his head, curled up into a fetal position, and closed his eyes. He
was shaking with fear, and just prayed to himself that it was all just a bad dream. And that was all he remembered
until he woke up the next morning. There was no evidence that anything unusual had occurred. Nobody else reported
anything strange, and he really wondered about what happened. This was a group
home for boys. At the time of the encounter, the group mother was sick with tumors in her body and would later
pass away from her condition. Ethan wondered if perhaps her illness was a
factor in this visitation, if perhaps the ETSs had come for her for some reason, or as he says, if they were
there to help her. This experience, as you can imagine, affected him profoundly. As he says, I question
myself if it was just a dream, but I can remember everything. The feeling, the
lights, the slow movements, the encounter, the fear. I do not have any
evidence. Also, another reason for not really discussing it with anyone because I thought people would accuse me of
making it up. There you go. Another case that very nearly went unrecorded because
this witness thought that nobody would believe him. Thankfully, he did find the courage and strength to come forward.
Kudos to any witness who does this because again, I keep saying this, but it bears repeating. Most people don't
report it in any official capacity. Such an amazing case. And so is this next
one, which is very similar, but equally poignant. This involves a young girl
actually who had a bedroom visitation by Gray ETS. I call this one We Are Your
Sisters. It's a direct quote from the Grays themselves. This occurred one late
summer evening in 1990 in Langghorn, Pennsylvania. This witness describes her
encounter with such vivid detail, such an honest and sincere account. It's
enough to bring tears to your eyes. really obviously an intelligent witness
and I think you'll find this case to be particularly interesting. What I am about to disclose is going to sound
absolutely insane. So writes Natalie, that's a pseudonym regarding this
encounter that occurred to her when she was only 6 years old. It was early
August in 1990. was a blazing hot night which necessitated leaving her bedroom
window open so she could sleep. And sometime in the middle of the night, Natalie woke up to very bright lights
coming from outside her open window. As she says it was as if someone turned on
a bunch of stadium lights at the same time. For Natalie, these bright lights were accompanied by a low buzzing
vibration. She leaned over the side of her bed to get a better look outside and immediately felt, quote, "This pulsating
energy like status electricity." She said the lights were too bright to stare at, and squinting at them didn't help.
At this point, she was more curious than afraid, and immediately wondered why her parents hadn't woken up. Their bedroom
window faced the same direction, so they should have woken up. still trying to peer outside, she noticed something or
someone moving in front of the lights, casting a long shadow across the lawn.
Now, this did scare her, and she hid under the blanket and closed her eyes, hoping this was all just a dream. She
tried to relax. One or two long minutes passed, and finally she opened her eyes,
and peering through the blanket, she could see that the lights had dimmed somewhat. So, she's thinking, "Perhaps
it's morning. This is all just a dream. But still wondering, she turned to her side, made a little peepphole through
the blanket, and looked to the window. And to her intense fear, there was a
tall, dark, shadowy figure standing directly outside of the window and looking in. Now thoroughly panicked, she
tossed off her covers, backed up as far as she could to the side of the wall and the headboard of her bed. She was
sitting upright with her feet out in front of her and her arms at her side. At which moment she says she was
immediately paralyzed by that same strong static electric energy that she
had felt earlier. And following this she felt as she says quote a wave of calm.
Now unable to move, unable to cry out, she could only sit there and watch as this figure climbed through the open
window and into her room. she said it and moved in a strange floating almost fluid way. Immediately another figure
followed, moving in that same strange manner, and she could now see that they were alien looking humanoids, a head,
torso, arms, and legs. And she describes them in great detail. As she says, they
were gray with a glossy look to their skin, almost silvery. Everything about
them was long and slim, except their heads. Their eyes were shiny, oversized,
and black, similar to a yellow jacket or a fly. I could see the lights coming
from outside reflecting on them, but they were expressionless. They did not blink.
Their noses were undefined, just two small nostril holes with a little flap of skin over the sides, similar to a
bird's nare. Their mouths were thin lines. They seemed nonfunctional and
like their eyes, their mouths remained motionless. One feature that really
impressed her was how thin their necks were. So thin that it seemed impossible
to her that they could support these huge heads. Now, as Natalie says, they
stood there for a moment looking at me. Then they looked at each other, almost like they were confirming something.
When they turned back to me, they spoke. Their mouths weren't moving, but I could hear the words they were saying in my
head. They later learned that this is telepathy. They spoke in unison in an
almost monotone voice, but one of them had a slightly slower cadence, so it
sounded almost like an echo. Now, the message they said really surprised her. They said, quote, "Do not be afraid. We
are not here to hurt you. We are your sisters." Now, one of the beings remained in front of the window beside
her bed, while the other moved to the front of her bed. She could see that the second one was holding two unusual
looking tools, one similar to a reflex hammer used by doctors to test human
reflexes, but the other was somewhat similar to a pulse oximter, but as she says, quote, different than anything
I've ever seen in my life. They then proceeded to conduct what Natalie believes to be some kind of physical
examination. They looked at her arms. They seemed to tickle her armpits. They looked at her legs, at the soles of her
feet. They felt behind her ears. She saw that their fingers were very much similar to ours, only much longer. And
she could, in fact, feel some warmth coming from them. Now, Natalie says
their expressions never changed, but I sensed they were communicating. I just couldn't hear it. They seemed satisfied
with either their task or their findings. I'm not sure. The one at the foot of the bed gave the smallest nod to
the other, and they left the same way they came in. I was conscious of them leaving, but I was more focused on being
unable to move. Now, Natalie says that as soon as the beings exited, the lights
outside became very bright and then flashed off. The buzzing sound immediately stopped. The paralysis
lifted as if a switch had been flipped and Natalie now saw that it was morning.
As she says, I was still in the upright position I had been paralyzed in, and it
had been the middle of the night just a second before. So, this was very confusing to her. She got out of bed and
without telling her mom what happened, asked if her sisters had come in and tickled her in the middle of the night.
and their mother's reply was a predictable, "Where did you come up with something like that?" So Natalie
realized that she was the only one who had experienced anything strange that night. Following that encounter, she
refused to go to bed unless the window was closed and her blanket covered her body, despite how hot it was outside.
This is a condition which persists to this day. A few years later, she was watching TV with her sister when an
illustration of a gray alien appeared on the screen. Natalie became instantly filled with dread because the gray alien
on the TV screen was an exact match to the two humanoid figures she had seen in
her room years earlier. So gone was any possible explanation that she might have
dreamed up the whole thing. And it really filled her with an anxiety that became chronic. Once as a pre-teen, she
did try sharing the experience with her friends who just laughed at her, called her weird, crazy, and as she says, other
hurtful things. As Natalie says, I never openly spoke about it again for fear of
being ridiculed and not believed. She grew up, got married, and the ETS never
returned. But after a few years of marriage, the subject of UFOs came up, and Natalie tearfully spilled out her
experience to her husband. He listened and asked her many questions and after
she explained it all said that he believed her. They ended up having five children. 35 years after the encounter
in 2024, Natalie and her husband were watching the congressional hearings on
the subject of UFOs and Natalie decided to report her case officially. as she
says, "I know I have waited 35 years to say something, but this encounter has
been burned into my mind, and I fear I will never forget it. I have been struggling with an overwhelming scent
that I need to talk about my encounter with someone qualified." Due to my age
at the time, I didn't have the vocabulary or the cognition to fully grasp what happened. I don't want anyone
reading this to think that my description is exaggerated or untrue because I am able to explain it more
coherently at age 40 than at age six. I am not looking for any kind of publicity
from this. In fact, I would prefer to remain anonymous. I am willing to take a
lie detector test or whatever is deemed necessary to validate my claim. But it's
time to talk about it with someone who has the experience in the field because I still have way too many questions that
I can't answer for myself. Such a profound encounter. I'm really glad she
did come forward. She told her husband who was very supportive. Kudos to him.
This is the kind of experience that can be very stressful for the family unit. Uh and people will even keep it their
encounter secret from their own siblings, their best friends, even their spouse. But thankfully he was
supportive, totally believed her, and together they worked through this encounter. So yeah, so poignant, so
amazing, and just really detailed. Now, let's move to the last
and final case in this compilation. I call this one the childlike ETS. This
one occurred in December 12, 1997 in a little town near Cyburn,
Croatia. The town is called, and I'm going to butcher this name, I'm so sorry, is
called Kever Levo. I tried. Any rate, I did cover this case
before in a previous episode, but it was so short. One of you lovely viewers out
there was able to find more information for me which really clarified some
details that were actually misreported in most of the accounts in this case and
provided a really comprehensive description of what actually happened including photographs of the location
and more. So yeah, that's why I'm presenting it again because the information
uh that this gentleman learned directly from the ETSs is super fascinating, a
really interesting encounter. He didn't have a lot of fear. So I think he was able to observe these ETs much more
lucidly than perhaps a lot of other witnesses who do have fear. But I am certain you'll find this case really
interesting. The witness in this case is Yakov Ransik, a metal worker who after
retiring at age 65 decided to move with his wife to a farm in the small village
of Sir Leivo. This is outside of Ciban, Croatia. It was around noon on December
12, 1997. Yanko was tending to his garden and his herd of sheep in the meadows next to his home when he
suddenly heard a loud buzzing noise. Much like he says, quote, "A
refrigerator buzzing." It was coming from behind him, and when it continued, he became curious about it, decided to
leave his herd and go investigate the source of this sound. And about 150 ft
away at the far end of this meadow, he found what was making this noise. as he
says. I followed the noise and when I got there, I saw some small beings like
children around some kind of aircraft which looked to me like a turned plate,
shiny gray in color, approximately 4 m in diameter. The beings were maybe 1.4 m
tall. That's about 4 and 1/2 ft. very skinny, longer arms, much bigger
heads and eyes than humans, very, very small nose and mouth, and their skin was
gray. They were dressed in gray overalls with some small caps on their heads.
They were doing something around that craft like they were fixing something. They looked at me, but they kept doing
their job. So, Yonko was amazed and intrigued. He could see that this craft
was not actually landed on the ground itself but was hovering about 1 meter or 3 feet above the ground and there was a
small stairway like structure leading to the ground and he was curious so he
began to ask them questions. His first question was what are you doing? One of
the ETs replied speaking a kind of broken Croatian but with a strange accent that reminded him of Russian that
they had some problems with their aircraft and they decided to land to fix it. Now when this being spoke Yakov
noticed that the ET's mouth remained closed when he spoke and ultimately researchers concluded that the
communication was telepathic. Then Yakov asked them about God and they
provided a puzzling answer. As Yakov says, they have two gods, one in the
south, one on the North Pole. I don't know what that means. Perhaps this is a
misunderstanding. At any rate, he next asked them if they were hungry. They said they don't eat food from here. As
Yakov says, the being showed me one pill in his hand and said, "It is enough for
them for the whole day." Now, Yakov says he had no previous interest in UFOs, had
never read about them. He had heard about them from television, so he understood what he was experiencing. He
says he had no fear of the ETSs. They seemed very friendly. So, he just continued to watch. As he says, I
continued to watch them. Then, I noticed through the window one shadow inside the aircraft. It was walking inside and did
not come out, so I could not see what it looked like. All this took about 3 to
four minutes. They told me not to speak about the encounter for 7 days and
boarded the aircraft and smoothly flew off then disappeared into the clouds. Now, despite the ET's request
for him to remain silent for a week, this experience was so strange that he couldn't do it. As he says, I tried not
to think about that, but just could not. Later on, I told my wife what had happened. She told my family in the city
and somehow the word spread to some local newspaper and they sent a journalist. Now to his disappointment,
this encounter caused all kinds of publicity and attention. Soon researchers showed up and interviewed
him. They tested the landing site for radiation which came out negative. Yakov
says that some of the newspaper accounts for his story were sensationalized and inaccurate. They talked about how he had
offered them food which they took. He said that that did not happen. He did
not offer the ETSs any food nor did they take any food from him. So that's the
UFO landing in humanoids seen in Croatia. How interesting is it that the ETSs requested he not talk about his
encounter for one week? I don't blame him for talking about it immediately to his spouse,
but her running and telling his family right away, it's it's kind of amusing,
but definitely led to this case getting some publicity and being fully
investigated. So, ultimately, I think that is beneficial. People deserve to
know the truth about what's going on. This cover up that is worldwide carefully orchestrated, heavily funded
is really nefarious. I don't think it's serving humanity's best purposes by any
means. The truth is going to come out sooner or later. I mean, you can distort it. You can hide it. You can lie about
it, but you can never destroy it. Truth is truth and it's eternal. So that I
think is why sooner or later the cover up is just going to collapse under the weight of its own lies. You can't hide
the sky. I've said it for years. The truth is going to come out one way or another. And that's exactly what we're
seeing. These 10 cases are just the tip of the iceberg. As you know, I've
covered well over I think 2,000 humanoid cases on this channel alone. And I'm
still just skimming the surface here. This is how common these kinds of encounters are. It's amazing to me all
over the world. So yeah, one of the most important subjects facing humanity today
in my opinion. It's time that all humanity knows the truth about this and that this coverup ends. It's one of the
main reasons I do this research. So thank you again, you guys. It's because of you I do this show and work so hard
to get this information out. I know a lot of you out there are having encounters and there's just not a lot of
places you can go for trustworthy information objectively reported. That's what I'm trying so hard to do for you.
So yeah, thank you again. I hope you've enjoyed this episode, perhaps learned
something. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions, keep searching for the truth. Most important
of all, keep having fun. I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
