A GRAY ALIEN NAMED SEN
Apr 22, 2022

Summary:
Apr 22, 2022
This is the story of Julia (pseudonym) and her encounters with a gray alien named Sen. At age 19, Julia left her family and home in Prunedale, California. Her childhood had been difficult, filled with unexplained events. She had tried to get help from her parents, but they were strict and didn't understand. So Julia left everything behind and decided to get as far away from her home as she could.

She ended up settling on the east coast of the United States, where she began to rebuild her life. She found a job, a place to live. She started her own small business, made friends, and met the man who would one day become her husband. Finally secure, she began to examine her childhood, trying to figure out the source of her trauma. She remembered terrifying events during which her room would fill with light and shadowy figures would approach her. She came upon the subject of aliens and UFOs. That's probably what happened she realized. It was aliens. But the whole idea terrified her and she refused to think about it.

A few years later, Julia felt a powerful compulsion to move back to California. Although her life was going great, she and her boyfriend picked up everything and moved to Pacific Grove, not far from her childhood home. The very day they finished moving in, strange things began to happen. 

It started with a weird ringing sound in her right ear. She went to the doctor, but he couldn't explain it. There were no insects in her ear canal as she feared. It wasn't tinnitus. The doctor had no diagnosis.

Then came the UFO sightings, weird glowing orbs hovering over the house. Then one evening, there was a ship overhead. Julia saw it through the skylight above her bed. Next thing she knew, she was paralyzed. A short time later, she fell asleep.

In the morning, she told her boyfriend. She could no longer live in denial. The memories of her childhood experiences were flooding back. The excruciating tones in her right ear were becoming unbearable. UFOs were hovering over their house. She finally found the reason for her problems. It was aliens. They had visited her since she was a girl. Now they were back, And she believed the source of the tones in her ear was probably an alien implant.

Her husband was shocked, but he was also very supportive. He believed her, but had no idea how to help her. Deeply in love, they got married.

Julia examined her childhood. She remembered seeing colorful orbs as a little girl. She recalled the hundreds of times her bedroom would fill with light and scary shadowy figures would materialize around her. She remembered a dramatic UFO sighting at age ten of a giant flying saucer. Julia could no longer deny that she was having contact with extraterrestrials.

Then one evening, she woke up to hear a weird musical sound reverberating through the house. She wandered around, trying to locate the source. Then she realized, it was inside her head! Next thing she knew, Julia found herself being pulled onboard a craft. She saw that she was laying on a table in a small, round room, surrounded by short, thin, gray-skinned beings with large bald heads and big dark eyes. 

They handed her a baby and asked her to hold it. It looked just like a gray alien. Julia was shocked. And looking outside the craft, she saw the darkness of space, and far below her, the planet Earth.

Next thing she knew, it was morning, and she was back in bed. Looking at her stomach, she saw three bleeding puncture wounds. Both Julia and her husband were shocked and traumatized. And they became even more shocked when they discovered that Julia was pregnant.

From this point, events escalated. Julia kept waking up to find herself unable to move. One evening, her husband woke up to see a gray alien entering their bedroom. Shortly later, Julia had a miscarriage. She was secretly relieved. The pregnancy had not felt normal, and she was certain that it had something to do with the night she was taken onboard a craft.

At that point, her experiences ended. Or so she thought. They fled California, and moved to the east coast. They had a baby boy, and became pregnant with their second child. Then, one morning, Julia decided to reach out mentally to contact the gray alien baby she had held in her arms years ago. To her shock, she made instant contact. In her mind, she saw a gray. He introduced himself and said his name was Sen and that he was made up of her DNA. Then began an hours-long conversation in which Julia learned all the answers about everything that had happened to her throughout her life.

This video tells the story of Julia's encounters, and what she learned from Sen about her own encounters and the alien agenda on our planet. If you'd like to explore more, Julia's story is presented in my book, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters." Now available!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode a gray alien named sen this is a very unusual and extensive case of ufo contact 
involving a lady I will call julia that's not her real name she prefers to remain anonymous julia grew up in prunedale california and had a lot of 
unusual and very scary experiences throughout her childhood that she did not understand 
she tried to explain it to her parents her parents were very strict and not helpful and by age 19 she was at the end of her rope so she decided she was just going to leave home 
and she did and she moved as far away from california as she could get all the way to the east coast of the united states and started to rebuild her life she found a place to live 
she got a job she started her own business started working as a writer she found friends she met her 
boyfriend who would later become her husband and just started nurturing and rebuilding her life 
and she started to look back on her childhood to figure out what had gone wrong she knew it wasn't 
childhood abuse she knew it wasn't sleep paralysis and the more she looked into it she realized 
it was probably aliens and this scared her very badly so she decided to just drop the subject 
not think about it and move on with her life and then in 2011 everything changed 
she had a sudden and very strong impulse to move back to california 
and as she says I honestly can't tell you why I felt like I was being directed to do this 
so she and her boyfriend just up and moved to pacific grove california and this is when 
her life started to get really strange again she started having these weird harmonic ringing sounds 
in her ear and her right ear was like tinnitus but it didn't appear to be tinnitus as julia says 
i thought maybe there was an insect that had gotten into my ear because I could hear it moving around I could feel something digging into my skin was making this harmonic vibration it was just 
terrible so I went to the doctor he looked in my ear and he says there's nothing in there so that 
was like torture to me because he could not help me so julia thought to herself well perhaps it is 
a bug and if it's a bug at some point it's got to die but it didn't this harmonic ringing continued 
as she says so I waited like two weeks but I still heard these sounds these harmonics and the thing 
kept digging into my skin this went on for two years it was a nightmare it was awful it was so 
terrible I thought I had tinnitus I had to rule out all these things I would take pictures of my 
ear I tried everything and the stupid thing wouldn't stop uh julia did notice something 
very strange with these ringing sounds as she says I noticed a pattern these sounds happened 
so often I started to notice the pattern when I was physical with my husband when we were kissing 
or experiencing certain types of behavior like hugs or an emotional connection it would start 
to make these loud humming noises and I can't even begin to tell you how annoying it was 
so julia tried to move on with her life she worked as a writer around this time she noticed 
she could see people's auras and tell what was physically wrong with them and she started giving 
aura health readings and was quite good at it she had a lot of compliments people were so happy with 
her they would give her gifts and meanwhile she's still suffered with this tinnitus by 2013 she 
was really at the end of her rope with it and she says I finally got to the point where there was no 
explanation for this thing in my ear there was nothing I could come up with and at this point 
she started to see weird orb-like objects over their home this was in pacific grove 
and she would look out the window or look outside and see these glowing orb like objects 
and after several of these sightings she realized they were ufos finally one came low over the house and on impulse she ran outside and started screaming at it 
and said to it are you the ones that put this in my ear did you do this 
it suddenly occurred to her that she might have an implant in her ear and that it this problem 
was due to aliens she got a real sinking feeling she did not want to go there but she really had no 
choice as she says I knew I wasn't crazy and that something was happening but I just couldn't find 
any explanation then I started thinking aliens so at this point she decided she's going to have to 
face the subject she's going to have to really dig into her childhood and figure out what happened 
so she started looking back to her childhood all the way back to as far as she could remember 
and she started to really realize that yes this was probably something to do with aliens and 
the things that happened to her when she was a little girl and a teenager and looking back she 
saw that her first strange experiences occurred around age five or six when she was in her room 
whenever she was feeling sad these little colorful orbs would appear they were really beautiful 
small glowing orbs with soft pastel colors yellow blue green pink and they were really pretty as she 
says I thought they were fairies I would talk to them and they would float around my room it was 
very comforting anytime I was sad or felt hurt or was crying they would show up and they would just 
overwhelm me with a feeling of peace I didn't realize until later that it was a little weird 
at some point that stopped and it was around age six really all the way up to age 19 so 13 years 
she started to have really scary experiences in which her room would fill up with light 
and these figures would enter into the room and this was very scary for her as she says 
what began happening is I started to get paralyzed at night I would wake up and there would be lights 
coming into my bedroom bright bright lights the whole room would be lit up and my body would be 
paralyzed but my eyes could move I would look around trying to see who was in the room with 
me and I couldn't see any actual people so I didn't know what that was she did tell her parents 
but again her parents were very strict and not helpful in fact she got in trouble about this 
so she was basically on her own and these experiences just continued as julia says the 
one thing I can say about the nighttime things that happened is they were very scary for me 
because I knew that the lights were not on because of something I had done somebody had turned lights 
on in my room it was super traumatic a combination of being preyed upon by whatever this was 
and then getting in trouble for it I just remember it being a very very dark period of my life 
at this point she was not connecting it to ets at all and she didn't connect it to ets even when she 
had a very dramatic ufo sighting at around age 9 or 10. she was outside on the balcony of her home 
in prunedale which overlooked this little valley and this enormous classic silver flying saucer 
showed up was absolutely huge as julia says it was humongous it was just hovering in my valley it 
basically took up the entire width of the valley it was so big and it just sat there silently it 
was a perfect dome with a perfect saucer shape a slate gray like a navy ship it was a flying saucer 
it was very close I could see the details of it little lines where the metal was a different color 
it looked much like the same material you would make a navy ship out of the weird part of this 
whole experience was on the dome of this craft there were giant block red letters 
spelling out u s a so this was very peculiar and really puzzled julia she didn't know what to make 
of it but as she says it was very large lettering it took up one whole side of the dome itself I 
watched it hover there for I have no idea how long and then I went back inside and ate a sandwich 
that doesn't sound normal to me I should have run back inside screaming at my brothers oh my 
god it's a ufo I don't know why that happened I literally just stood there and watched it and then 
i ate some food julia did have two little brothers but they were quite a bit younger than her so she 
couldn't really talk to them about this experience and she kind of basically forgot about it she 
wonders now if this could have been some weird sort of screen memory particularly the lettering 
she doesn't know all she knows is she has this memory of this gigantic flying saucer 
right outside her home this was during the day so this was a very dramatic sighting 
and meanwhile her nighttime experiences continued and this went on all the way to age 19. 
as julia says I couldn't close my eyes and sometimes the light was just so 
bright and I was so afraid to see the shadows materialize I could see them moving but I just 
knew in my heart that I didn't want to see them materialize so I just kind of blacked them out 
the one thing I did to protect myself is I would crawl inside I would go catatonic and 
crawl inside my mind I was so afraid of what was about to happen the fear was so great 
that I was actually able to dissociate and leave my body go inside and block everything out 
my childhood was pretty difficult my parents never believed me they did not protect me they 
did not care what was happening so at that point at age 19 she couldn't take it anymore and that's 
when she moved to the east coast and started to rebuild her life and like I said earlier she did 
look into her childhood at some point and realizing it was aliens she just did not 
have the strength or courage to face that at that time as she says I thought probably it was aliens 
but I didn't want to look it up I did not want to give it credence or energy in my life so now 
she's back in pacific grove california she's seeing these orbs she's hearing these weird 
harmonic ringings in her ear and always when she's being intimate with her husband hugging or kissing 
or making love this is when these tones would really become prominent and she did finally tell 
her husband that she thinks she's being visited by aliens uh she told him about the orbs that 
are hovering over her house this harmonic ringing she had already told him about that 
and he was very supportive and understanding uh but wasn't really sure how to help her 
uh at this point they did get married and it was very interesting because during their wedding 
ceremony julia saw weird orbs dancing around in the trees at the ceremony weird colorful orbs 
just like when she was a kid and again she felt somewhat comforted by them and 
to her it was sort of a good sign at the same time she still had a lot of fear surrounding what had 
happened to her in her childhood and then these orbs continued to appear over their house at night 
and one evening julia was sleeping in bed they have a skylight right over their bed and looking 
up she saw a ufo hovering very low over her house and she was unable to move she felt paralyzed as 
julia says there was a bright circle of light hovering over our bedroom I saw this craft I was 
awake but I could not move my body it didn't scare me I was paralyzed but I was looking up and I saw 
this craft so that's all she remembers she fell asleep woke up the next morning told her husband 
and uh she went on the internet and started doing some research and was shocked when she found an 
image of what appeared to be the same exact object as she says and I quote it was just this circle of 
lights it was the exact same craft it had the exact same amount of lights it looked like the 
same one so events were definitely escalating and it was a short time later when julia had a very 
major event she woke up one evening and heard this musical tone echoing throughout the house 
and she started wandering around looking for it as she says the sound was like music a beautiful 
strumming sound like a guitar the music was kind of like following me around and I realized it 
was coming from the implant in my ear it was actually inside my ear and I could hear it 
it was just very strange so the second I realized it was coming from the implant there was a 
very very bright light like a flash of pretty purplish silver but completely totally blinded me 
so julia was in the living room this happened she felt like she was being struck by a beam of light she was unable to move and this is when she started to see all these very pretty sort of 
sacred geometry like shapes triangles squares diamonds moving at her in sort of a tunnel of 
light and she felt herself being pulled into it as julia says I started to feel myself being pulled 
through I was fully experiencing it and I knew exactly what they were doing they were moving me 
my body through space and time I was easily traveling through it and I could feel somebody 
on the other end that was pulling me through this tunnel like a metaphysical tunnel I felt 
like I didn't have any arms or legs I felt like my spirit was moving to meet my body on the other end 
so all this is happening and the next thing I knew I was on an actual ship I'm on a ship 
and I'm surrounded by these glowing faces with large almond eyes julia was strangely calm and 
looking around she saw that she was in this small rounded room and there were about eight 
or nine gray aliens as julia says it was a large group they had pale white faces big black eyes 
round in the front with a pointed almond shape at the tip they were five feet tall and very thin 
and this room she was in was again rounded and quite small as she says 
it was like a nursery the room was round the bed that I was in was white and it looked very simple 
she could see that the wall of this craft was transparent and looking through it she could see 
the earth far below her and it was quite some distance down there so she realized 
she was pretty high up there in outer space and uh this point the greys who were surrounding her 
handed her a baby a hybrid baby or perhaps a gray alien baby she says the baby was just like them 
white skin big black eyes almost asian looking the baby was in a little soft white blanket 
and its little face was sticking out and I held the baby in my arms and looked at the baby they 
were all interested in what was happening they were monitoring they wanted to know if I felt 
anything for the baby and julia didn't she felt neither attraction nor repulsion 
really it was very much clinical she had no real feelings about this baby at all and as she says 
when I felt nothing I handed the baby back to them and the next thing julia knew it was in 
it was morning and she was back in bed she says I woke up in my bed I looked down 
and I had three large bleeding puncture wounds on my belly I was covered in blood 
so she woke her husband they cleaned herself up they were quite concerned about this event it 
was very shocking and then came even more shocking news julia was pregnant they had 
been trying to get pregnant unsuccessfully and now suddenly they were pregnant but they did not feel 
like this was good news because both of them were convinced that this pregnancy had something to do 
with this onboard ufo encounter as julia says I knew before I took the pregnancy test 
that had something to do with that night we were both traumatized we thought that they had 
done something to my body and possibly the pregnancy was from that experience 
so it wasn't a joyful thing and we weren't excited I was really scared about what they 
were doing to me and I was also scared that they were going to try and take the baby from me 
and at this point her experiences escalated even further she started waking up 
and being completely paralyzed and unable to move this was quite scary for her and she would 
try to move and wake up but she just couldn't the only thing she could do was move her pinky finger 
and so she told her husband uh if you see me in the middle of the night moving my pinky finger 
please wake me up roll on top of me do do something to stop this experience from happening 
and this turned out to work out really well the husband would wake up feeling her moving her her little finger and he would quickly wake her up or 
roll over and lay on top of her and this would stop the experience so this seemed to work for 
a little while but actually just caused the experiences to escalate to a whole new level uh 
as julia says she really started to fight them mentally at this point she wanted to take control 
she wanted these experiences to stop as she says it started to feel kind of like a battle at that 
point that's the best way I can describe it I felt like I was fighting I didn't want to go 
along anymore I didn't want to be a passenger in this experience I really just wanted to 
say I know what you're doing to me enough stop abducting me if you want to abduct me why don't 
you ask I'll do it willingly you don't have to kidnap me you don't have to put me through that
so while all of this was going on her husband continued to help her by waking her up and stop 
these experiences and this is when the encounters moved to a whole new level as julia says 
maybe a week or two went by and they couldn't pull me so they showed up in my house in physical form 
i was asleep my husband woke up and he heard a sound at the doorway and he saw this three foot 
tall thing at the door he blinked and in that moment it went from the door to the side of our 
bed it happened so fast he reached over to turn the light on and he knocked the light over it fell 
where this thing was standing and when this light came on it was gone he woke julia up and said I 
just saw one I saw an alien and julia said oh my god what did it look like her husband said it was 
pinkish gray and three feet tall it was shortly after this experience that julia had a miscarriage 
as julia says I hate to say it but I was happy because it didn't feel like a normal pregnancy 
to me it felt like something else like a stone it was hard and uncomfortable it just didn't feel 
like my baby it was a scary pregnancy so after that I was really grateful I feel bad to say that 
so after this miscarriage julia's experiences came to a sudden end no longer was she hearing these 
weird harmonic tones in her ear she wasn't waking up paralyzed there were no more ufos over their 
house uh no et's coming in no on-board experiences everything just stopped as julia says the implant 
just went silent I never heard it again I never had another night of sleep paralysis either 
all of it ended at the same time after that night I felt like I failed their experience experiment 
because I fought back and I thought good I'm a failure they're probably not going to visit me 
so by this point she's in her mid-30s and uh she feels like her experiences with et's are 
completely over and she and her husband decide that they're going to move back to the east coast 
which they did and they were very happy they got pregnant they had their first child 
a beautiful healthy baby boy and they got pregnant again and julia was about 
seven months pregnant when she decided to go out shopping with her best friend and on impulse they 
saw this psychic tea leaf reader and her friend says let's go visit let's get a psychic reading 
and julia thought okay you know that'll be fun let's go and get a psychic reading and julia 
started getting her reading the psychic filled up a teacup and started looking at the tea leaves 
and as julia says the first thing she starts to talk about is aliens she says 
oh your cup is filling with flying saucers oh look at these aliens over here julia's friend looked 
at her in surprise julie had never spoken about her past so this was quite disconcerting to her 
and the psychic told julia the aliens are still looking out for you you think they are gone but 
they are still in your life they want you to know that you are not a victim they cared about you 
from your childhood on and they still care about you they chose you for a reason you are chosen for 
a reason they want you to write about it so that ultimately turned out to be why julia contacted me 
later but that really sort of threw her for a loop she wondered if her experiences were going 
to ramp up again but they didn't she was just fine but then one morning this is still in just 
a short time later she's about seven and a half months pregnant or so and she's getting ready for 
a doctor appointment to check on her pregnancy and on impulse she decided to reach out telepathically 
to see if she could contact the gray alien baby that she had seen on the craft many years earlier 
as julia says I don't know why but I reached out to my child the child I had held in the spaceship 
i just reached out mentally like a prayer are you there are you okay I don't know anything about 
telepathy but when I reached out I found out that there was somebody on the other end of the line 
i was super shocked and I kind of didn't know how to really process it so I just went with it 
and I asked it questions what's your name she asked and the being replied sen in her mind 
julia could see this little gray e.t she says he looked very cute was very friendly very benign 
and she felt very strongly telepathically connected to him to the degree that she actually 
found herself inside this little ship with him and could see everything he was seeing and 
he could see everything she was seeing and this was the beginning of an hours long conversation 
between julia and this gray alien named sen and as julia says was kind of like I was actually there 
with it I was in the ship with it and it was the same kind of ship it was like a little round room 
and you could see everything there were no windows and it was flying over this large body of water 
and it was beautiful so she could see through the walls which were slightly transparent 
and julia asked where are we and instead of communicating with words uh 
sin began to show her mostly images he showed her images and concepts and would occasionally 
speak with words as well and as julia says he kind of showed me that this was its planet 
he showed me a large tower julia asked speaking out loud what is the tower for 
and sen replied the tower emanates the frequency of our planet the ship I'm in can repulse that 
energy and he sent her an image of the ship's control room and explained that the equipment was 
actually a frequency generator which he emitted in anti-frequency of the planet and that the waves 
repulsed each other as julia says he was showing me how it worked and it was beautiful that's all 
i can say the technology was just beautiful he showed me how he could flip in his ship 
and he did all this stuff I felt no gravity at all so he started doing all these loop-de-loops 
and flips and turning at right angles and it was really exhilarating and quite fun 
and after doing this julia asked him are you my child are you the child I had on the ship 
and sen replied no I am not your child you did not give birth to me I've been given your dna 
to evolve to where I am I have your dna in me we are connected through our dna julia 
had a lot of questions and she started hammering them at sen and she says why did you abduct me 
why have you been abducting me since I was a child what is my implant and sen 
answered her questions again using images and concepts and words as julia says he allowed me 
to see that I had helped them but that the reason they had not asked my permission was 
because they do not experience relationships in the way that I understand them they have 
no concept of what it means to ask permission or to engender respect through emotional connection 
so the gray showed julia that he was sort of lacking in the strong emotions that humans have 
as julia says he showed me what they needed he showed me how they got to where they were 
with their own physiology the radiation in long distances in space forced them to evolve into a 
different type of species where they couldn't have hormonal reactions they took their hormones out of 
their dna and in doing so they changed their dna from the law of attraction to repulsion 
we are important to them we are a bridge to them but it's more of a scientific thing they 
love science so much their whole livelihood has become an experiment trying to get back what they 
lost we are the bridge back to what they were so sen explained this to her in a lot of detail 
julia is very scientifically minded and even so a lot of this went over her head but sen basically 
explained exactly why she had been contacted and what their agenda was as julia says sen explained 
to me that his race used humans like me to try and bridge themselves back into the law of attraction 
a long time ago their species was like us they were beautiful creatures that reproduced on a 
planet they chose a life of exploration among the stars and began to experiment on themselves 
to create bodies better suited for space travel they began the long process of eliminating the 
strands of dna that existed in the law of attraction hormones and emotions the 
vibrations and frequencies were changed using light therapy this changed them physically 
into creatures that eventually became asexual once sensed people stopped feeling the vibration 
and frequency of attraction they began to stop feeling a connection to each other reproduction 
became uninteresting alone in space they began to clone themselves some travel in space their 
whole lives without seeing another living being as they explore other places in the universe 
the main difference in our physio physiology is humans are rooted through their bodies in material 
reality and they the grays are rooted in a frequency and vibrational reality 
their bodies are almost an unimportant side effect but at some point they realize they did not like 
this existence or that this existence could leave them unable to evolve any further in the material 
world as explorers they found earth to be filled with beings existing in the law of attraction and 
people like me with an excessive amount of this vibration can help them bridge back 
the gap within themselves so they can once again settle on a planet and reproduce again naturally 
which is the first step for the law of attraction so this was quite a bit of detail and at this 
point julia asked sen do you guys want to live on earth and send replied no we don't 
want earth it is filled with people already there are many empty planets like it as julius says they 
have no desire to live on our planet a planet filled with messy human beings I sent him the 
image and the feelings I was experiencing with my belly full of child my toddler lying next to me 
it was repulsive to him in that it was messy julia was amazed to be so mentally connected 
to sen and she began to pick up more information as julia says when I saw into his mind I saw the 
scope of his race I would say that there are not very many of them they're not in one place they 
don't have a city as they lost their attraction to each other they split out farther and farther 
and sen said that yes it was true they disliked associating with humans because we are so 
emotional and so physical and abrasive as he told her humans are difficult to communicate 
with because you are so emotional and he added however that this was the aspect of humans that 
they were particularly interested in and trying to reintegrate back into their own race as julia says 
this conversation between us was a marriage of information I felt somewhat stupid and emotional 
and he felt distant and logical so they continued to discuss a lot of scientific 
subjects and genetics and things like this as julia says he showed me that he was taking my dna 
and was adding it to their own dna in hopes that they would be able to repair the damage that they had caused in their own dna so that they could come back to being able to reproduce 
and that then they could repopulate a planet again it's really weird but he was showing me 
that their dna and our dna are capable of mixing because our dna has so much junk he 
said we are like a donor for other creatures that are trying to reverse their dna damage 
and get back their dna space the radiation in the frequencies does a lot of damage to dna 
it doesn't do damage to their bodies the way their bodies are but once they get to a planet 
then they have problems they can't reproduce the clones they create of themselves are not capable of reproducing either he was showing me that they want to reproduce and live on 
a planet and that's what their goal was for taking my dna julia learned from den from sen 
we truly don't understand why it makes us special but in sen's mind there is a pendulum on one side 
are the evolved beings that have eliminated human emotions but are left with a shadow of physiology 
on the other side the physiology is powerful but the chaos of that frequency is overwhelming 
there are other ways to exist all taking place in evolutions of frequency and vibrations 
around the universe it's a matter of finding the perfect frequency at this point julia asks 
sen about this implant and the weird tones in her ear and sen told her it's not us it's you 
it's the sound of your hormonal frequencies it is your sound and we are mapping that frequency 
as julia says he explained that the implant in my ear was a recording device that emitted 
and mapped the vibrations made by my hormonal and emotional responses to attraction 
this sound in my ear was actually me my vibrations they mapped this vibration in order to replace 
this frequency into their own dna the baby I held on the ship had pieces of me but mostly they used 
vibrations that they had recorded into its dna and when they handed me the baby they wanted 
to see my reaction to it whether it held the law of attraction or repulsion so they talked 
some more and as julia says sen is an explorer they all are but they're trying to settle down 
when we think of settling down we think of having kids for them it's like rebuilding an entire 
civilization on a planet their whole civilization has lived among the stars in the universe
and uh sen wanted to keep talking but at this point the conversation had gone on 
for quite some time and julia was late for her appointment and she told sen I have to go 
stop talking I have to go and uh finally she just broke off the connection 
but she felt this tremendous sense of relief all her fear left her she finally understood why she 
was being contacted and while she still you know felt some fear from her childhood experiences 
and some sense of violation now she understood the fear was gone and she did not feel like this was 
a bad experience and in fact she found it really quite interesting uh and at this point 
all her fears had left her she felt like her experiences were completely over 
and she was happy to just move on with her life which she did I mean she considered investigating 
it further getting an mri checking out this implant but she decided not to 
at one point she did do something a little experiment out of curiosity uh her husband's 
father was a scientist and he had this huge industrial magnet and on impulse 
she decided she would hold this magnet up to her ear where she believed this implant was 
and this turned out to be a huge mistake as julia says I felt this terrible horrible sharp pain 
deep inside my eardrum was so deep in there and it felt like a needle just stabbing me in the ear 
so I dropped the magnet and I was hyperventilating from the pain
and she decided okay I'm not going to do that again she did start to read about ufos not so 
much about people's experiences but about the scientific aspects of her own experience 
she did join a support group at one point and was shocked to see how similar 
her experiences were with other people and finally she did call her parents as well 
and told them everything and to her surprise her parents were very supportive and somewhat 
understanding and actually revealed that they had both had their own sightings back in prunedale 
fairly recently in fact they were followed down the road by ufos so this was comforting to julia 
otherwise she kept her experiences secret from everyone and it was uh some years later 
a few years later after she had contacted me and given me an interview and I'd written about 
her experiences I called her up to let her know that uh the book was going to be coming out soon 
that contained her experiences and I wanted her to look it over and make sure it was accurate and 
i asked her if she had had any new experiences and she said yes she had a very unusual event 
and what she described was really quite amazing something I'd only heard maybe once before 
julia decided to reach out telepathically to sen again to see if she could talk to him 
and she did not reach sen but she did reach what she believes to be the spirits of her deceased 
hybrid children a lot of them and this was really quite profound and poignant for her as she says 
i found myself open to whatever that connection is I saw a great many faces coming through in rapid succession all the children I had helped to create 
it was such a hard thing to see from a human perspective in that deformity in pregnancy can 
be devastating many of the faces were deformed some had my eyes and alien faces some had more 
human features in alien eyes most were dead I knew they were dead but with telepathic hive minds 
the dead never really die I was given a glimpse of my children probably around 200 I would guess 
gave me the most sad feelings I cried and I cried and I just wanted to send my love to them 
knowing that they had died and never had my love it was like a funeral all at once for me I had 
never thought of the failed experiments aspect of it as you think there isn't room for failure 
in an advanced civilization that can do so much but what they are trying to do is very difficult 
i can't even grasp it sometimes it's just really really strange 
so this was a very profound experience for her she's not sure if this was just memories 
if she was actually in active communication with these et spirits it was quite confusing to her 
as she says I did not speak to any of them I just saw their many many faces I felt such a sadness 
and emotional connection like a very deep mother's love I did not feel like I was reaching out to 
spirits that could communicate but just images or perhaps I did meet them and was able to give 
them love that could explain the intense motherly connection I felt or maybe I experienced knowledge 
of their deaths but all those memories were buried deep in my mind it's very possible because I was 
only mentally awake and aware that one time I did meet a baby and it really scares the crap out of 
me to think how much I have seen experienced and done all to lose it to their advanced technology
so she cried and cried after this experience and was very sad to see so many of her children her 
e.t hybrid babies who had passed away in fact it was so unnerving she decided that was it 
she was not going to reach out telepathically anymore julia is quite psychic she is able to 
sense spirits as well something she does not like because many of these earth-bound spirits 
are quite negative and she simply does not want to be a part of it 
so she sort of has put this all on the back burner at this point and is just moving on with her life 
as a science writer and being with her husband and raising her two children and she says they are 
very healthy they are a wonderfully happy family and ultimately she feels blessed to have all these 
experiences because it's really enlightened her to a much larger universe as julia says in closing 
i think that is perhaps what we are all searching for the perfect way to exist 
with the mixture of connection and also the ability to disconnect completely and move through space and time I have no idea how to do that but it has something to do with the 
body and finding a way to access your astral body and still retain a connection to the physical body 
humans seem to be the perfect reboot for this as we have the ability just not the understanding 
we are being used for this but not using it completely ourselves maybe once we do we will 
be able to join the rest of the universe in the search for this ultimate existence
so that's julia's story I did cover her story in my book wondrous 25 true ufo encounters 
julia's is one of the more extensive cases I have investigated and I really wanted to share 
her story with you for a number of reasons I think it really illustrates the e.t agenda in detail I 
think it shows how these experiences can start out very traumatic and move to a really interactive 
positive relationship with ets certainly this is how julia feels 
it's just a very interesting story and it shows how ets are also very interested in our emotions 
as well so that seems to be one of the main et agendas is to repair their dna 
and move back into a more emotional and physical realm of existence 
so that is julia's story I hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you very much for watching I truly 
appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers and most importantly keep having fun.
