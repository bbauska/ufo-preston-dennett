THE ANCIENT ONES: THE TRUE STORY OF THE UFO CONTACTS OF DON ANDERSON
Jan 28, 2022

Summary:
Jan 28, 2022
In 1984, 24-year-old Don Anderson of Spanish Fork, Utah woke up to see a gray alien inside his 
bedroom, taking away his 4-year-old son. Don leaped out of bed and informed the gray that if 
they were going to take his son, he wanted to join them. The gray agreed. Both Don and his son 
were taken onboard a craft where they were greeted by a female human-looking ET who gave them 
a tour of the craft. The ET informed Don of several events which would soon occur in his personal 
life. Don and his son were then returned.

This event caused a radical shift in Don's life. He recognized the gray as a friend and teacher, 
and he remembered having encountered him before. In fact, several bizarre events which Don had 
ignored, denied or explained away now suddenly made sense, and he realized he had been 
experiencing UFO contact his entire life. He remembered being visited and taken as a young 
boy. He remembered seeing a UFO and the gray at age ten, then being taken onboard a craft 
and taught how to perform telekinesis and about the aliens' technology. A missing time event 
at age fourteen now revealed itself to be an extensive onboard UFO encounter during which he 
was again taken beyond Earth and taught by the ETs. He even remembered a "pre-life" encounter 
during which his gray alien guide showed Don's mother giving birth to him!

Don, who had been religious, now realized that he was in contact with extraterrestrials. This 
began a lifelong search for answers. He also began experiencing a wide variety of paranormal 
events including precognition, out-of-body experiences, communication with spirits and more. 
And of course, more UFO encounters.

He once went camping with some friends (also UFO contactees) not far from the famous Skinwalker 
Ranch, hoping to initiate contact with praying mantis ETs. To the amazement of Don and his 
friends, a huge UFO showed up, followed by several mantis ETs. This culminated in a long and 
profound onboard encounter during which Don communicated with the praying mantis aliens who 
again gave him information about his personal life and showed him many strange and wonderful 
things onboard the craft.

It wasn't long before more encounters occurred. On one occasion, Don was visited by a familiar 
human-looking ET who cured him of a chest cold. On another occasion he was taken onboard and 
treated for a heart problem.

Don's encounters attracted the attention of the U.S. military who threatened him not to talk 
about his experiences. As a result, Don decided to go public. He spoke at conventions and began 
doing interviews and writing about his experiences. He even put together a website called "Path 
of Shaballa" (link below) to share the spiritual information he learned at the hands of the ETs. 
Shaballa can be translated as "Wisdom of the Ancient Ones."

Don's case is more extensive than most. He has worked hard to understand his encounters, learn 
from them, and share the wisdom he has been given. He says that while people are very interested 
in the physical aspects of his encounters, it is the spiritual information that is the most 
important and is the reason he decided to go public.

Don's full story is told in my book, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters," now available. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0949H5Y8G/...

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal. 
I call this episode the ancient ones the true story of the UFO contacts of Don Anderson. Don 
Anderson is a quiet and unassuming gentleman from a little town in Utah called Spanish Forks. 
He's had experiences his whole life. UFO sightings, landings, onboard encounters, many deeply spiritual 
experiences, a wide variety of paranormal activity all of which is connected to his UFO contacts 
he's had contact. Not only with gray type ETs but praying mantis and human looking ETs. 
As well, it's really quite a story with a lot of unique elements and a lot to say about what 
it's like to have ET contact and the nature of the phenomena and the ET agenda on our planet. 
So that's why I wanted to present his story to you. Today in this episode I'm going to play first-hand 
clips of the interview I did with Don. So, you can hear him tell his own story in his own words. 
Although Don is a contactee he had no idea about this until he was 24 years old. At that time he was 
a very religious man. He had a four-year-old son and he was living alone as I said in this little 
town called Spanish Forks. One evening he woke up to see a grey entering into his room and coming 
for his four-year-old son. Coming to take his son away. Don jumped out of bed and said no you're not 
taking him unless I can go along with him. And what was really remarkable is Don felt no fear 
and in fact seeing this grey alien. He suddenly recognized this ET as a friend, someone he's seen 
many times before. And this grey agreed to take down on board with his son so this is how it all 
began for Don. At the time he was very religious. He had no idea that things like this could happen 
but I'll just let don describe in his own words how this experience began one of the reasons I 
went it's like they came for my son they actually came from both of us but I when they came for us 
i looked at my son I looked at the great being and there was a gray that was floating in the room it was initially the one who came and got us and he pointed at my son like he wanted to take my son 
and I said oh you know what you know let me go with you if I go with you because he's gonna be okay he's not gonna freak out okay and it's like I recognize this gravy he'd been around forever 
you know so it was kind of like a friend of mine is I'm very comfortable with him and 
yeah he this little great being was like my teacher and I would they got me and my son we went 
right through the walls of the house we actually went through the ground through the lava house 
out in the atmosphere and it was just like going in a giant vacuum I mean you could not hear anything it was just fairly quiet and you know but yet you could see the neighbor houses 
and you could see the ship across the field and all this kind of stuff so once on board this craft 
don was greeted by a human looking woman dressed in a brown and orange jumpsuit 
who proceeded to have a conversation with him and again I'll just let don describe this 
conversation in his own words there's a lady who escorted me around the ship and uh she was yeah
a typical human looking nordic type of living you know stressed on some sort of orange brown 
jumpsuit and she was like my escort she's kind of guided me around the ship I had a 
i had an issue that was going on with my stomach there was a really really bad case of irritable 
bowel at the time and I looked at her and I said hey you know is there something you can 
do I mean you're speaking telepathically as we're walking along I said is there something you can do to help me I said this is just hurting I got to get this healed and she just laughed at me 
you know and she thought that was so funny and I'm thinking to myself well no you really hurt me lady I mean you know I'm asking you seriously for some help and you're laughing at me and then 
she looked at me in the side of my eyes she said don't worry about it you're gonna be okay and 
uh later on it pretty much filled herself up for the most part you know I've never 
been seriously bothered with it since then so after speaking with this lady for a few moments 
she guided him down a corridor to an archway and into another room inside this room don was amazed 
to see his son there playing with another child about the same age they were playing with this 
weird device which was spraying what looked like sparkly blue light all over them they were having 
a lot of fun with it so don wasn't concerned and I will just let don describe this whole encounter 
again in his own words there was a little boy that my son ran into that they were playing with 
okay I know this is kind of bizarre because what was going on with him was that they had taken 
him and uh they were doing something with them and so anyway they took us on the ship and um
as we're walking along this corridor on the ship there's an archway off to the right hand side of us we stop we look in and there's my son with this little boy who's about his same age 
and they're standing around a vertical shaft that's going through the center of the ship and around just like a little cat walk and hanging on this 
vertical shaft is what looks like a shower massage unit okay and I would watch and I'd watch them as 
one of them would grab the shower massage and hold it on his head you see this blue stream of 
it looked like electricity or something just slow down their bodies and dissolve into the catwalk 
and they would break out laughing one of them would break out laughing whoever was holding it over their head and this was happening dude they break out laughing because it must have tickled 
or something and they were fighting over this and uh the other his little buddy would grab it 
over his head and the same thing would happen and you know it would go back and forth and uh it was like well there he is you see him he's okay and we continued on with what we were doing 
so there's this little kid that he met so seeing that his son was okay uh he turned back to this 
lady who had a message for him she proceeded to give him a number of predictions and prophecies 
pretty much all about his personal life his relationships and again I will let don 
describe how this conversation unfolded yeah my son was four years old he was he would be 
five that year and I was going to be 25 that year so he was four years old and
he met a young kid on the ship who later turned out to be his friend that he ran into like about six months later 
and they showed me a lot of stuff that happened in my life that came true you know they showed 
me a lady who says hey you're going to meet this lady and I did hear about five years ago I met her 
and uh through some really odd circumstances and then we were showing a few things the things that 
we were showing all came about that all happened yeah so it was kind of a three jabu type of thing 
as well so yeah as it turned out don would later meet this woman and it was quite a series of 
synchronistic events that these ETs predicted and they all came true following this encounter 
don and his son were led back to their home and into the bedroom and as it turned out the other 
little boy was apparently brought along as well though at some point he must have been returned 
to the craft because when they woke up he was no longer there but I will let don describe 
how they were returned to their house and you know before we were actually placed back in our beds uh 
we were in the living room we replaced the living room uh towards the end of all this and you could see across the street the ship was hovering it was making some sort of noise it was just kind of 
coming right off to the right left-hand side of me where I could hear somebody scuffling so I look 
over and it's him and his friend that he was on the ship with and they were kind of scuffling you 
know they're doing their kid thing they're just you know mess around and you know kind of sparring 
with each other this was actually one of his his turned out to be his best friend that showed up 
later on about six months later they spent you know the next six or seven years as best buddies 
you know these things just came about they were there it happened so yeah and that just that 
opened up the floodgates to be honest with you it was like there was so much ET activity that went 
on after that and when she sent me back in my bed I had immediate knowledge it was kind of like a
near-death experience except it was a UFO remembrance experience of all these experiences 
i had all the way up to and including before I was born and it just kind of popped in like 
your life flashes before your eyes when somebody dies it was like a UFO band of all these events 
that happened some of them that was a little bit of oil some of them I had no idea about 
uh but it happened up to that point in my life and it just kind of totally blew me away it just I i 
had no idea that this kind of stuff was going on out there in the universe I didn't know where to go how to deal with it or there was really nobody out there so it just kind of led me on a lifelong 
search of what was going on because I couldn't find any answers from anybody when I woke up I 
just I was just blown away I couldn't understand what was happening so it was a lifelong search 
i was in here in town in utah it was uh in central utah not too far away from salt lake city 
with all this happening at the time I you know I was pretty religious I didn't drink I didn't smoke 
i didn't do any of that kind of stuff you know I was pretty straight-laced and so it was just like 
this stuff shouldn't be happening you know now all of a sudden there's this world out there 
these things and um they're human looking and that they're not removed so this experience turned 
don's life upside down he said it was very much like having a near-death experience because when 
he saw this gray and after being taken on board he it was like having a life review he suddenly 
remembered all these events from his childhood onward which had made no sense to him these were 
weird events that he had overlooked denied refused to think about explained away as something normal 
but now he realized he was a contactee and he remembered many events which turned out to be 
direct UFO contact stretching not only to his childhood but to pre-life and in fact 
he remembered this gray taking him to his mother's hospital room when she was giving birth to don so 
he was actually there witnessing his own birth and I'll just let don describe this absolutely 
incredible and unique event in his own work he was one who introduced me to my mom in the operating 
room when she was you know before she was ready to give birth to me while she was giving birth 
so he was the one that was escorting me into that operating room and uh you know and he's just showing up again to continue on with whatever it is they do 
another thing he remembered following this 1984 encounter were the many times strange beings 
a strange figure would enter into his bedroom he described it as looking almost like an ape 
and it would always frighten him sometimes the room would fill with light and this being 
would appear poke at him pull on his blanket sometimes actually pick him up and lead him 
out of the room through the wall remember that happening many times dozens if not hundreds and 
sometimes he would remember being taken back into his room and placed back in bed he of course told 
his mom who freaked out she called the police the police could find no evidence of any intruders 
they called the doctor and the doctor examined don and pretty much concluded that don must be 
having nightmares don disagrees with this he was always awake when this happened and he believes 
these were entirely physical events yeah really little kid there was a little kid in spanish work 
there was a it was just that was a little farming horsing community you only had maybe a couple 
thousand people living it at the time this was also a rural country at the time right um 
they used to come in and get me at night there was a period of about a month there where it was just 
like a house of course yeah literally it was like my mom was beside herself you know she couldn't 
figure out what was going on but we had the police over there and everything you know I mean 
the police the doctors that come over everybody viewed out of time because we'd wake up and I would wake up screaming my head off in the middle of the night you know the you have you 
seen communion okay you remember the time where uh really who's played by christopher walken 
was dancing for that little alien creature that was kind of looked like a 
small little lake or troll or something okay that little creature would come and get me 
at knives that scared the hell out of me all right and he would just walk through the walls and I 
knew when he was coming I was sitting there in the corner and pulled the sheets tight across my body and uh he would come in and try to tickle me stick his fingers up underneath my arms and 
it would scare the hell out of me and he picked me up and he'd walk me through the walls yeah 
and then they would put me back in bed and after he put me back in bed I'd wake up screaming 
you know telling my mom that the you know the eight man that come and got me and the egg man was coming and so she's calling the police and the police to go around and they'll 
look around the yard you know they'd never find any footprints or a doctor who came over 
another really strange event that sticks out in don's mind occurred when he was about 10 years old 
he and his friend and their two brothers their two little brothers decided that they were going 
to go camping out in the front yard of their home and the little brothers fell asleep while don and 
his friend stayed awake late into the evening and it was around 2 am or so when suddenly they had 
incredible UFO display it really shocked them they went running into the house of don's friends to 
try and wake up his parents who would not wake up it's an incredible event that ended up being 
an abduction and I will just let don describe this whole event in his own words that night we decided 
we're going to sleep out in the front yard and there are four of us there's me my little brother 
and the two neighbor kids that live down the road and that night uh for whatever reason there were 
two of us who stayed awake we couldn't get sleep we woke up in the middle of the night and we were messing around with our brothers trying to get him to wake up and they wouldn't 
wake up and we weren't carrying the dogs or anything so we're like well this is really strange let's go down to your house which is like about four hours down the street and uh 
you know see what's going on so we go in there and their parents were asleep and they would wake up nobody wake up in their house so we were sitting out on the front porch eating a uh 
apple very like maybe two or three in the morning I'm not sure what time it was 
staring out in the sky and all of a sudden you could see this like great big old fireworks display start going off in the sky up above our heads right right and uh you just fascinated us 
because you see these orbs of life just flying across the sky and it kept on going for like about 
10 or 15 minutes and then all of a sudden you can see the edge of the ship just kind of poke through 
like this I don't know where it was coming from but just kind of pokes through the sky and this great big ship starts forming and coming out of I don't know where it came out 
it looks like it was coming out of a cloud right but there weren't any clouds and uh that night we 
were taken again I remember his dad's bed shaking him trying to get him up you know I'm saying you 
got to get up you know get up get up and I was shaking as hard as I could trying to get him up 
and nobody was waking up and they came in they got us at night too 
so that was one that I didn't have any idea about until you know that night in 
june of 84. I didn't remember it at all all I remember was waking up in the yard and 
richard who is my friend's brother her brother had grass all over all over his head that we piled up 
on him at night that we didn't remember doing and something that scared him so bad he'd read 
his pants so that's what don remembers the last thing he remembers consciously is being in his 
friend's house trying to wake up his parents and that's when grace appeared so that's probably when 
they were taken or perhaps returned was years later that don did undergo hypnotic regression 
to this event and he was surprised to find himself being taken on board a craft where he met grace 
this was not a fearful experience for him and in fact the greys were teaching him they were teaching him how to do telekinesis and they were also showing him their technology 
and showing him how to operate it so this was quite an interesting experience for him and it 
certainly was not his last experience it was four years later when he had another major encounter 
this was something he was never able to explain all he remembered was he was hiking outside of 
his home one evening he was about 14 years old and he became disoriented all he really remembers is 
suddenly being confronted by a herd of skunks and being chased down the mountain by them 
sometimes thought perhaps it was coyotes he really wasn't sure and it wasn't until this 1984 
experience that he suddenly remembered this event as well and what he remembered 
was being taken on board a craft it had landed he was taken on board inside it was very clean there 
were all these computer-like screens and I will just let don again describe this in his own words 
you know I was 14 years old I was stuck up in the canyon it was about 10 miles away from anybody there was nobody up there at all just me 
and I had an experience up there where I had thought it was gonna sound really weird but 
i had thought I had been chased down the canyon by a herd of skunks you know and uh I because I 
could hear them off in the brush in the bushes they were chasing me down the road and uh and I 
told the kids in school about it the next day when I got back down the canyon or two days later when 
school started when I got back down the canyon that wasn't happening laughed at me and said yeah 
funny and that turned in to be a full-fledged abduction encounter where they had trapped me 
in uh a place in the canyon so that they could you know take me and I was actually on the ship 
have you ever heard of bob lazar when he describes that [ __ ] I don't know if you're familiar with 
some of the things he's talked about but he described the ship that he saw in area 51 
okay that ship that he was talking about was the exact same ship that they took me from but it was 
used before bob lazar had been to area 51 and he had described the exact same ship that I was in 
yeah and so you know whatever you want to think about balls are good for better or for worse a lot of people say yeah he's full of huffy and some people say he's real I believe he knew 
something because there's no way you could make the exact description of the place that I had 
been and the type of ship that I had been in uh to be so precise like that and the screens 
that they had on the ship were ultra high depth I mean it's like the airlift tvs that we have today 
that's the kind of screen that you were seeing when the ships open you know when the vision opened up and you could see outside the ship 
that's the kind of screens that they had but it was way way before high def we didn't have any idea what my depth was right and all these kind of experiences just popped up and it's like 
oh my god and they related directly to things that had gone on in my life that I wasn't I knew that 
something weird had happened but I wasn't sure what it was so I just shut up about it because 
i couldn't explain it so he remembered this much consciously being taken on board and seeing grays 
but he did undergo hypnosis and under hypnosis he recalled that this UFO actually took off 
he they went way way far away he felt feels like they went way deep into the milky way and 
he saw all kinds of stars around him they came up to another very large donut shaped craft he 
was transported into this much larger craft and on board this larger craft he saw human looking ET's 
who he said were very wise and they actually show took him to meet who he believes was his deceased 
father don's father died when he was three years old but he got to meet him on board this craft so 
that was really unusual and then he was taken into another room and in this room there are 15 to 20 
other children all about don's age there was also a very old looking half human half gray 
e.t hybrid and this hybrid was teaching all the children including don in alien language 
so that was what he recalled at age 14. and following this 1984 experience 
it woke up don's psychic abilities he started having all kinds of out-of-body experiences 
really profound ones where he was taken to other dimensions to what he believes are other planets 
where he met high-level entities and would converse with them he started having a lot of paranormal experiences including precognition psychic reading you could 
see people's past lives I mean it was just off the charts completely changed his life 
and his experiences of course continued with some years later following this 1984 experience 
that he had one of the most profound onboard UFO experiences of his entire life he and his friends who were also contactees a group of about four of them 
decided that they were going to go up into the mountains of the winter basin in utah 
this is not far from skinwalker ranch actually and they were going to try to contact the mantis-like 
ets they were all interested in this type of ET and wondered what it would be like to meet them 
so they all were meditating on this they went up into the mountains one of them had a trailer 
where they could stay and that evening they had a major encounter they not only saw a UFO but 
the mantids showed up and each of them had a very profound and very personal encounter 
with them and I'll just let don describe his own encounter with these mantis-like beings in his own 
words I had a counter with the praying mantis creatures after that me and three other people 
in the mountains of northeastern utah you know where the skinwalker ranch is it's um not too far 
away from the skin walk around which is a little community called proven I had a friend who's got a 
trailer up there and we would stay in the trailer up there we had to experience with the praying mantis that pretty much just changed your whole life I mean 
you know when you meet with these guys at least these particular things that I met with 
there's nothing that you can describe it to it's just tell me out of this world 
we decided that we were going to go up in the uh four of us when we were camping up 
this trailer and proven that we wanted to have an experience in the county of some sort 
and so we kind of decided yeah the praying mantis we heard about him but you know didn't really know 
much anything about him at the time and so let's have an experience and see if we can 
call the praying madison you know it's just kind of an experiment that we were doing and that night we were sitting out on the front porch and you could see it was cloudy it had been 
just a little bit of sprinkling it was cloudy that night overcast and the sky just parted it was like 
a great big donut hole pops up into the sky and you know this great big circle foreign has and you 
can see stars and everything up the sky that he'd never seen before I mean it was just like looking 
up there and I don't recognize any of these stars but it was beautiful and you can see this ship 
it was a triangular ship that was up there kind of bouncing around inside this circle 
like you got the impression it was kind of clearing the space out for us 
it wasn't too long after that that we start hearing these tripping sounds it's like
you know clicking right because they come in sets of threes and you'd see these figures moving up and down the road and you can see them 
kind of like a shadow creature you would see a shadow creature except you could see that there are these praying mantis looking beans that are like nine feet tall 
you know just huge and they showed up to our camp out there you know and um how we got we we became 
aware of them is that there was an outhouse in the backyard and you know you have to walk around the 
trailer in the backyard because that's the way that you had to you know go to the bathroom and 
the air behind the trailer dropped by about 20 degrees you know that they took the change 
so drastically that you know it was really kind of bizarre I mean and then looking off into the 
fields right there you could see these beings running around and all of a sudden they just 
started approaching us and by approaching us I mean I would go in the backyard and I 
would say hey I want to see you and then one of them would show up next to me and he would say 
are you sure you want to see me I said you don't want to see it says are you sure you want to see me yeah I want to see you and then he would say nobody would run off 
you know but you would hear him running off and you could see him and you could hear the voices in your head and all that kind of thing so I did this twice and the second time I did it 
i could feel his like it was an arm that was kind of looked like a little bit like a ring manchester 
but it was his arm and it placed over my shoulder you see this blue electrical energy just flew 
all over and I asked him the same question that I said well I want to see you and the 
third time he said no not yet you're not quite ready you know to see us and so I walked back 
out front and we're sitting down and everybody was sitting around the porch looking out in the front yard and you can see out in the front yard that one of my friends had actually was standing 
out there with one of these things that it picked her up raised her about three feet off the ground 
you know and was looking at it like right the eyes and then you can see her slowly start settling 
back down on the ground again I mean literally she was like up off the ground this thing picked her up yeah and uh they were all just running around and we were just sitting there kind of 
amazed watching them run around but the energy was just totally different and they were doing 
their thing and we were doing our thing and then the clouds kind of came back and they disappeared 
you know and so we sat on our porch for about a half hour after they'd gone 
and nobody said a word and then all of a sudden when I looked at each other there's a good time that's where I'll jump to bed I mean just like as fast as we get to bed we went to bed 
so after this long series of face-to-face encounters with the mantids 
uh suddenly and without any warning everyone felt compelled to just go to bed 
there was no discussion about what happened there was no talking everyone just like zombies 
almost went directly to bed and it turned out many of them did have an onboard experience 
that night including don in fact as soon as don went into bed the next thing he remembers 
and this is fully consciously is walking down a dirt road near this trailer and into what was 
like a portal or a doorway and he found himself on board what was presumably this huge triangular 
craft that they had seen there were mantids on board this is a long and extensive experience 
the mantid began to talk to don first he was taken to be decontaminated 
he was shown this device much like a crystal ball which showed him various events in his life it was 
taken for a very interesting sort of telepathic communication event with other entities and I will 
just let don describe in his own words this really fascinating onboard encounter when it was a dirt 
road it was country road you know I was walking up the road and there's this kind of a poor door
that appeared over this ravine and they had me walk through this corner door and as I walked into 
this pool over there it's like I walked right into their ship with the guy who had placed his arm 
around me he was there kind of like waiting for me okay and it was one of these triangular shifts 
that you hear about the great big uh you know 300 foot long triangular ships with an orange ball in 
the middle and we found myself right in the middle of this ship and there's a cat walk that we were 
walking down he was on by the side of me walking down the catwalk towards the middle of the ship 
it's like the catwalk was coming from each corner right to the center and right in the center I can look down and I can see the orange ball in the middle of the ship below us and there's a podium 
right in front of us you know and uh that podium it had a little ball on top and it had like 
if you do like the spock salute you could place your hand right on that ball and it would a big screen would pop up and it would show you your password I 
mean your life events your future life and past life and you watch it kind of flow past you as 
you had your hand on this little ball look man I looked at him I said well what is this and 
he stopped for a couple seconds trying to figure out what the words were he says oh this is deja vu 
you know which is basically seems like you future life uh we walked a little bit further 
past that and um standing in front of a door looks like about eight feet 
tall right no it's probably more now it's probably about 12 feet tall door 
and we're standing in front of this door and you can hear a wish from the door opens and you walk inside and there's this room and the far end of the room there's like a laser light that's right 
there that's right really high it's up like in the corner and when I walk in it scans my body 
it does a body scan on me and so I looked over at him again and I says what's this and he looks 
back at me and he's like he's having a hard time trying to figure out their language he goes oh so 
so this was some sort of a cleansing light you know it was like it was scanning for germs or 
something I guess is one of the best way to do it or attachments and things of that nature 
and as soon as it was done off the left-hand side of me there's another door that opens up 
and I'm looking into this large room it's got a kidney shaped table on it and there's a little 
stand it's a rectangular stand on top of it there's a big crystal ball 
and if you're looking across the room you can see this great big glass window and it's looking out 
into space I have no idea where I wrapped but you know I didn't recognize anything how am I going to recognize anything anyway even if I knew what it was right it was a myth I mean 
i had no idea where we're at we were out there someplace so it was just totally a novel view 
that he had and around this table there was 26 other people sitting around this kidney 
shaped table and it's like well you know now you're here we've kind of been waiting for you and
i'm standing there and as I'm standing there you can see this 
ball this is like this big crystal ball starts to glow a little bit and as it starts to go everybody 
everyone around the table and myself included you can see the stream of light 
flow out of the top of each one of us withdraw all dropped into this big ball that's sitting there 
in the middle of this table you can see all this energy just swirling inside this ball 
and then it just kind of shoots back out the top of back up back into each of our heads 
i don't know what that was about but it was just like we're doing this energy sharing thing uh the next thing I remember we're sitting on top of the ship in apartment you know it's just like 
there's me and him and we're sitting out there by ourselves up on top of I get the impressions on 
top of this ship you know and there's a dome that's covering us and that's all I can see is just the dome okay he looks at me and he says would you like to see I said sure I'd love to see 
and the minute I said that everything disappears and it's just me sitting out there in the middle of the universe okay there's nothing there's no shift there's nothing I'm just 
floating out there all by myself and you can feel this tone out there it's like 
that's the best way to put it it's just like a musical note starts to build up and you can feel this tone building up in the universe and it just kind of 
flows through you like like if I was gonna take it I was gonna breathe on you and that breath goes 
right through you and you can feel it touch every single cell in your body as it's going through 
it's kind of what it was like you know and I'm and it's just amazing because you're sitting out there 
and it's just you and the universe and the stars and yeah it was just this journey was 
a mind-blowing type of thing you know it was just like wow and I don't know how long I'm out 
there but then all of a sudden I'm back into this dome and the next thing that I'm waking up in my 
sleeping bag and my body is burning up literally it's just kind of burning you know it's like 
i am sweating so profusely that I can't stand it and that's like 40 degrees outside so it's 
kind of cold so it was just it was these little mind-blowing type of you know things right there 
so that was don's most profound on board UFO encounter though he's had many other experiences 
far too many to describe in an episode of this size I mean I could go on forever but one day 
don became very curious about why he was having so many encounters why him and in his search for 
answers he decided to take a dna test and boy did he get a shock when he he found out that he has a 
very rare condition known as uniparental disony what this means is when a person has genetics 
that come almost exclusively from one parent the vast majority of these cases usually involve 
people who have their genetics coming from their mother it's much more rare that they come from a 
person's father and that was true in don's case 99 of his genetics come from his father and I'll 
just let don describe how he discovered this I had a dna analysis done on myself 
because I just wanted to you know kind of see where my background was because I know 
on my mom's side of the family they have been like you know 8th and 9th generation 
americans and so I'm thinking well I wonder if there's some american indian background in there someplace you know they would explain why I do all the psychic stuff and 
i have no genetic material from my mother at all like no wonder I grew up without family thinking I don't know who these people are you know I feel like I was not related to him I did not read
i don't know who these people are I don't know why I'm living in this house this is just you know I 
have nothing in common with these folks nice and normal otherwise but it just shows that 97 
of my genetics is strict my dad's side of the family which is no norwegian okay well in the region it's uh yes norwegian and danish scandinavian one 
almost 100 percent yeah there's nothing else there just his side of family 
so more experiences followed lots of paranormal experiences he started communicating with spirits 
occasionally with his deceased grandmother was found he had the ability to give psychic readings 
lots of very powerful synchronicities all kinds of amazing stuff happened 
and on one occasion he was actually healed he had been suffering from a very severe chest cold and 
he just couldn't shake it and then one day he was in his home when in walks this human looking e.t 
dressed in a jumpsuit had a little symbol on its jumpsuit and this e.t proceeded to heal him by 
feeding him medicine a glowing pink liquid in a little vial and I will just let don describe this 
very unusual experience in his own words you know I have been suffering these really debilitating 
chest colds you know that had just almost on the virgin pneumonia type of stuff that had 
been hitting me really really hard for you know like about three months it would go away then it 
would hit and it would go away then it would hit again and it would go away and it would hit again and uh I was really into the meditation thing at the time and I was sitting there 
meditating one day and um this alien guy shows up that's the best way to put it and he has this 
neon pink vial of liquid in his hand and he looks at me he hands it to him and he says drink this 
it was kind of that thick consistency but they really didn't have much of a taste it was just 
kind of like you just drink it smaller real fast and it's gone yeah oh it was just maybe
maybe about three ounces or something like that a little bit much
if you went to say somewhere in a lab or something they'd have a little violence in there similar and 
so I drank that and immediately I was better and I have never had any problems with uh settling 
cold again this never never ever hit me yeah that was it he just laughed he just disappears
this guy right here was kind of a grace looking guy he was dressed in a silver kind of a 
jump suit that has kind of on the left grass it's got this little hemorrhaging of some sort 
i can't exactly know for sure what what it is but I know there's a little design there of some sort 
it's almost like he's got a little belt of some sort but uh he's taller he's got longer hair 
he ties it back but he puts his hair in a bun and that's how they wear their hairs in a bun and he's 
got these eyes where if his eyes he's staring to his eyes it's like he's looking right through you 
i mean they're so piercing they're so you know a matter of intense they've got this intensity 
about them that just right through you and it sends shivers up and down your back when he does 
i've met him a couple times he dropped he came in the bathroom one time when I was taking a bath and had my eyes closed I watched him walk in and it just like it fills me up solid you know 
it was like really really powerful overwhelming he looked like a normal person to me but he had these 
kind of almost chiseled features on his face that was a perfect looking face 
and uh it's his eyes that really give him away I mean he'd look at you with those eyes and 
it's like okay you're not from around here you just automatically know that there's something really different about him yeah yeah he showed up a number of times so don has seen this being 
on other occasions once he was suffering from a heart condition and he was healed this was when 
i had my heart surgery when I was laying in my bed in my house on the couch in my house and
he showed up until all of a sudden I'm in this room someplace and it's kind of a hospital-like 
setting I did very much it was a healing center of some sort that they had me in that they were doing 
some sort of healing on me to help me get better on another occasion he was actually threatened by 
mib types or government agent types who told him not to talk about his experiences this 
really angered don and he decided he was going to go public with his experiences he had no 
plans to go public at that time but after being threatened he decided it was important to do so 
and he went to a convention where he spoke publicly about his experiences and uh he started 
thinking about writing about them as well I have had the military abduct me once upon a time too 
would you really cut up the tires oh yeah that surrounding stuff has been a continual thing 
the military abducted me they told me not to speak before they came and got me they told me 
not to speak about this and they said hey don't talk about this stuff I said well come on man you know don't be so paranoid I'm gonna talk about it because I'm just an ET guy contact e you know 
i'm not a big by any means you know I'm just a guy who's had some experiences who's you know not 
afraid to share my mind on what's happened right right and uh they show up and they say hey don't 
talk about this and uh so after that I said well screw you I'm writing a book so I wrote a book 
and went to speak at a conference up in seattle at the seattle UFO network conference he wanted to 
put out a website where he could put forth some of the spiritual information he learned and he was 
trying to think of a good name for his website and that's when the same being who healed him 
showed up and told him what to name the website so it's not like it's for the website that I've 
got I've got a I was thinking about what to call my website that I have and it's called shabala 
and I was singing for a long time me and my girlfriend at the time we're thinking about 
what we were going to call it you know he drops in one day uh as I'm waking up and 
he walks right up to him and he looks at me and he says you should call it shabala 
i said well what do you mean you mean shambhala that's already been taken he said no shabbalah without the imp and there's shabbat he says yeah 
so after doing some research about the word shabala he found out that it means spirit 
of the ancient ones so that's what he decided to name his website which is still running today and 
don offers to give people spiritual information past life readings this sort of thing 
he's like I said a very quiet and gentle man he is seeking no publicity 
he's not interested in fame or fortune he's just a deeply spiritual very quiet gentleman somewhat shy 
he has spoken publicly as I said on his experiences and in fact his account does appear in a few books one book that his story appears in is called 
we are among you already true stories of star beings on earth 
he's also written a couple of books one of the books that he wrote is called the wanderer 
a soul's journey and another book is called musings of an old soul a cosmic paradigm
don's full story is told in my book wondrous 25 true UFO encounters don is not again seeking any 
publicity but he knows his experiences are quite profound and unusual and I think that's why he 
consented to being interviewed for my book and I'm really glad he did because as I said 
i think his encounters have a lot to say about the nature of the UFO phenomena how it can be so 
frightening in the beginning and how it often transforms into a deeply spiritual experience 
and can actually move someone along the pathway of enlightenment to a remarkable degree that I really 
think that's what it's about I mean it's I've spent a good person in my life talking about the 
physical things that have happened that have gone on but when it boils down to it it's not about the physical stuff at all it's about how it changes you as an individual 
and that inner perspective to look inside and to go for the answers where 
that's where you find them those on the inside that's certainly true in dodd's case that's why I wanted to do this episode today I hope you've enjoyed watching thank you very 
much I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers and keep having fun
