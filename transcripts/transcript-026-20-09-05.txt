ALIEN ZOOS

Summary:

Alien Zoos!

ETs have been studying our planet for a very long time. They seem to be interested in all things 
Earth. They have taken humans onboard their craft. They have collected a wide variety of plants. 
And they are also taking animals. In fact, there are several cases on record in which experiencers 
have seen collections of live animals onboard UFOs. This video is not about animal mutilations; 
it's about something much more bizarre. As strange as it sounds, some abductees report being 
taken to visit alien zoos, containing animals from Earth, and also animals from other planets. 
Some UFOs, it seems, are very much like "Noah's Ark," preserving a wide variety of species. 

Some of these cases have a very high level of strangeness, including chimera-like creatures from 
ancient mythology, or even in a few cases, dinosaur-like creatures.

The ETs' interest in animals is also betrayed by the many cases in which UFOs and extraterrestrials 
have been caught taking animals of all kinds. Farm animals seem to be a primary target, but a wide 
variety of animals have been abducted into UFOs.

In a few cases, ETs seem to be particularly interested in our closest animal companions, dogs and 
cats. One case contains a shocking revelation explaining why they have such a strong interest in 
our pets.

Alien zoos may sound strange, but there are too many cases to ignore. Something very strange is 
happening here.

One," now available on Amazon.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  the title of today's presentation is alien zoos  
this is kind of a companion piece to my last  presentation extraterrestrial gardeners but this  
one involves animals instead of just plants so  yeah this is about cases of people who have seen  
animals on board ufos and not just earth  animals sometimes extraterrestrial animals  
and I didn't find nearly as many cases as I  thought I found a lot of cases of mutilations 
that's not what this video is about this is about  case of people who have seen animals on board ufos  
but I found some other very interesting  information about animals and ufos in general  
so let's just get started and see what we can  find out about this very weird subject of alien  
zoos first case i'd like to talk about comes from  barbara lamb who co-wrote a book with nadine lalik  
about the many people she's interviewed who have  had on-board experiences the case I want to cite  
is about a lady by the name of jennifer who  had an onboard ufo experience and saw something  
very unusual on board the ufo and i'll just  quote barbara lamb and nadine lalik they said  
that this lady jennifer saw and am quoting  row after row of large cages containing many  
different species of animals that she believed  were not from earth these specimens she was told  
had been collected from different planets  to be studied and tested along with those 
that had been taken from earth in the event that  relocation of life forms would become necessary  
in the future due to planetary changes they were  determining which species could survive on planets  
other than their place of origin so yeah there's  that theme that comes up of upcoming earth changes  
and certainly it's not the only case that  reflects that but yeah many people have seen  
animals on board ufos small animals and large  animals one case I have cited before is that of  
carl higdon he's an oilfield worker from rawlings  wyoming on october 25th 1974 he was out hunting  
elk and it actually spotted a group of about five  elk and shot at one of them when his bullet got  
about halfway there and stopped and fell to the  ground at this point carl higdon noticed a very  
strange looking figure with straw-like hair a kind  of weird appendages holding a strange instrument  
he walked up to carl higdon gave him a little pill  which carl obediently swallowed he's not sure why  
and then let him on board this very small kind  of rectangular shaped craft maybe 10 20 feet  
wide once inside carl higdon was surprised  to see it was much larger on the inside  
than on the outside and it's a long involved case  where he was apparently taken to another planet  
he was set in a chair and saw these really amazing  things really he saw other people on board the ufo  
but important here is he saw about five of the  elk apparently the same elk he had been hunting  
but were now in glass enclosures like cages  and were not moving he saw other animals  
as well and the et's told him that these  animals were needed for breeding purposes  
so yeah here we go this is not necessarily  mutilations these are ets who are actively  
collecting studying and breeding earth animals  another very interesting case is that of  
denise and burt twiggs who I quoted in my video on  extraterrestrial gardeners because they said that  
there is an area on board the ship that they  were taken where animals and plants are being  
cared for the twigs had a series of you know  pretty scary abductions before their case evolved  
into sort of a more friendly contact d case and  they believe they were in touch with these et's  
who call who are called the andromedes and so  here are the twigs describing what they saw  
in terms of animals on board the quote ship  so yeah now i'm quoting denise and bert here  
one interesting part of the mother ship is the  animal reserve it is a veritable noah's ark  
lions bears wolves birds and elephants are to  be found there the majority of these animals  
are from earth although the andromes have also  brought animals from their own and other planets  
so here we have another case probably the  ultimate case of this kind of alien zoos  
comes from a real estate broker by the name  of katarina she wrote a book called alien  
jigsaw for the forward by bud hopkins  it's a very interesting book and  
yeah she was taken on board a ufo in july of  1988 where she saw what appears to be a zoo so  
i'll just quote her now this is katarina talking  this huge dark area we are in looks like a zoo  
except instead of cages they use big glass rooms  they look like displays I can walk all the way  
around them I see two gorilla-like beings and a  large cat the hairy beings are very tall and they  
don't really look like gorillas but they are all  hairy there is a cat on the other side of the room  
it is white with orange spots and is about two  to three feet tall it must weigh over 50 pounds  
i'm walking towards another glass enclosure  the animal in this one appears to be half   lion and 
half reptile it is lying on its back and  its mouth has fallen open because it is sleeping  
i'm looking at its mouth  and I can see rows of teeth   I sense the animals have been saved from 
extinction someone next to me whispers  
that is something no one on earth has ever seen  before i'm nodding in agreement i'm amazed at  
what i'm looking at these animals are incredible  i'm particularly intrigued by her description  
of a half-line half reptile because this is a  mythological creature that's fairly well known and  
i'm wondering if perhaps this mythology comes from  actual cases of you know et's perhaps manipulating  
animals in ancient history hard to say but this  is not her only experience involving animals  
on board ufos on another time or she yeah  she says that she believes these are actual  
alien zoos uh she doesn't believe these were  screen memories or anything like that as she says  
yes they were unusual but I felt at that time and  still believe today that these animals were very  
rare and were being saved from extinction  another possibility would be to compare   this area to 
one of our own zoos it is also  interesting that even today I remember the sex  
of the reptile lion was female while I was in the  dark and large zoo area I did not see any aliens  
but I was aware that they were monitoring us  on another occasion she was taken to another  
sort of zoo-like area where they were keeping  only birds and here's what she said about that  
they brought me to another place I see cages with  birds the cages are about eight feet square this  
is like a zoo except they have only birds uh so  there's another case and one lady I interviewed  
her her name is sue she had a very interesting  experience where she wasn't taken on board a ufo  
to see animals but they took animals down to  earth to show her she has had experiences her  
whole life when she was a little girl  she had gray ets coming to visit her  
she this was followed by repeated visitations  by a short dwarf-like entity covered in fur  
it reminded her much of a humanoid cat it had  cat-like features but was covered with dark fur  
and I would speak telepathically with her and  was kind of like her friend she lived all alone  
on a farm and uh was disabled so she wasn't  able to get around a lot didn't have any friends  
and would be repeatedly visited by this cat-like  entity whose name was marie m-r-e-e and this  
entity came down and actually showed her various  animals which she said was from different planets  
and i'll just quote sue here one was kind of like  a tylosaurus but the face and everything it had  
ears like a cat and it was covered with fur like  a cat but it kind of looked like an e colisaurus  
in a way because it had those spiky things along  its sides in the tail with a little club on it  
she said one looked like a cow kind of like a  heterosaur or a duck-billed dinosaur in a way  
and she said there were horses with cat-like  eyes a leopard with a pouch that's the kind of  
animals they look like to me she doesn't know what  planet they came from only that they were not from  
earth definitely and some she was not allowed to  approach too closely because they were dangerous  
so I know how strange that sounds but uh daryl  sims another ufo researcher has said that he's  
uncovered similar cases of abductees who have  seen dinosaur-like creatures on board ufos  
he doesn't cite any actual cases and I really  couldn't find any myself other than you know  
the case I just told you but it's a possibility  that I certainly can't discount because there  
are a growing number of cases in which people have  seen animals on board ufos here's a case which is  
pretty old summer of 1948. I found this  in albert rosalie's book the humanoids  
amongst us is it's actually a series of books very  useful for ufo research and he describes a pretty  
scary abduction case in which a person was taken  on board a ufo this occurred in russia and uh he'd  
seen this man by with the initials v z saw this  craft land there were three tall thin humanoids  
who pulled in silver suits who pulled him on board  and he was really surprised to see a large bear in  
a glass enclosure and as he's being led through  the craft he saw that there were other humanoids  
put in glass enclosures and they actually put  him in a glass enclosure he managed to speak  
with them and get himself and the other humans  most of them released one apparently not which  
was a case involving vivisection and mutilation  so yeah these sort of things do come up and  
it's not always really friendly uh the et's may  be saving these et these animals from extinction  
but you know it's not always a friendly case is  is how we would think of you know a friendly case  
uh but there are other cases alan godfrey had  a very uh well-known abduction his abduction I  
should say became very well known it occurred on  november 6th 1957 he was called out to a herd of  
missing cows which were not in the area where they  were supposed to be so that might be significant  
here he ended up coming upon a landed ufo or  hovering right in the road in front of him he  
had missing time he was able to draw this craft  didn't realize he had missing time until later  
and went under hypnosis and recalled being  taken on board and while on board he did  
see an animal he was very surprised to see a  large black dog it's hard to say what exactly  
this means if it was screen memory or symbolic but  yeah he describes seeing this dog on board a ufo  
really the ultimate case of this kind comes from  no surprise betty andreason who on january 26  
1967 was taken on board a ufo she's very well  known abductee from ashburnham massachusetts whose  
case was investigated by raymond fowler so in 1967  she was taken on board ufo physically examined  
implanted she thinks but she was put into this  kind of special chair-like device and transported  
to an area where she was led into a tunnel and  saw a very strange landscape that looked very  
unfamiliar and kind of otherworldly but was  taken from there into a a building or a room  
and here it's really strange she saw all these  very strange kind of one foot tall creatures which  
she said looked kind of like lemurs or monkeys  and i'll just quote betty she says there's loads  
of them oh they're scary and they've skinny arms  and legs and kind of a full body and their eyes  
can move every which way and they can climb just  like monkeys they can climb up quickly and swiftly  
and down and around and in and out of  the windows they are all over the place. They are all around 
us everywhere. They are all around and they keep looking at us. Betty asked the ETs what these creatures 
were but did not receive an answer. This was not her only experience involving strange animals or 
creatures on board ufos. She had one experience in which she was placed in a disc which filled with liquid and  
was transported to this weird underground area. And they're leading her through this underground area 
down this pathway where when she starts to see these large cube-like structures which were clear 
transparent like crystal. And again, I'll just quote Betty when she says "what you saw inside these 
cubicles as Betty says "I'm just moving along beside those odd I don't know what would you call them 
icicles square icicles or glass things. I don't know and there's light there there's people in there 
there's people inside those things inside  those glass things but they're not moving she saw all 
different kinds of people in there native  americans a person from renaissance times and she says 
there's an indian in there there's a whole  bunch of people in there 
there's people there that are dressed funny and old-fashioned I see  chinese and just all different 
peoples in there and they're all frozen there's even a dog and a  cat and some animals too but I can't 
see it all and she she was taken from  this area into a forested area  
and she saw that there were more of these animals  which appeared to be like frozen as she says  
everything it's just like clear glass like  a forest of clear glass there's leaves and  
trees and grass and everything and the birds  they're like thin thin glass the only thing  
there's nothing moving there's even birds flying  but they're not moving and there's butterflies  
betty actually touched one of the butterflies  and it flew around for a second and then became   still again so it's not exactly clear what these  are if they're just uh representations or what  
but it certainly does betray et's interest in  animals and as I said in my earlier vid video  
about extraterrestrial gardeners she saw a whole  forested area with a pond and little fish in it  
so yeah aliens are definitely collecting  animals and taking them on board  
while I couldn't find a whole lot of cases in  which people actually saw animals on board ufos  
cases in which they collect animals were fairly  common one such case occurred on november 14 1954  
this is in isola italy a local farmer watched  a cigar-shaped craft land next to his farm  
three small beings in diving suits got out  and started to hover around his rabbit cages  
surrounding his rabbit cages he grabs his gun  and wants to shoot them but is unable to his  
gun becomes too heavy to hold and at this point  the beings grab his rabbit and get into the craft  
and take off so other cases are very much like  this uh november 12 1955 miss long of lynchburg  
ohio pulled into her friend's driveway and saw  this orange light this orange object glowing right  
over her car it frightened her pretty bad because  her car lights were dimming she screamed and next  
thing she knows her pet cat is gone her she had  had her pet cat in her car with her it's now  
gone the windows are mostly I mean the window is  cracked open but the cat could not have gotten out  
so it looks as though this ufo abducted her  cat another case occurred around the same time  
october of 1955 also in ohio this is in the city  of greenfield a farmer had a ufo land on his farm  
and it took off and after he examined the area and  was counting all his animals he noticed one of his  
cows was missing so yeah they're definitely taking  animals very famous case occurred on september  
18th 1962 this is in barcelos uh in brazil  this was investigated by jim and coral lorenzen  
and this case actually made the newspaper because  it followed on the heels of a pretty well-known  
abduction case following this abduction of  raymondo mayfra da silva this ufo was seen flying  
over the town by a bunch of people including by  a group of workers from a rubber tree plantation  
and they started telling one of everyone about  this ufo they saw and uh they were actually jailed  
uh by the mayor of this town who who accused  him of spreading rumors and uh was not having it  
uh turned out though that a lot of other people  had seen ufos so the corporal of the police  
squadron started interviewing people and found  out that yeah a bunch of people had seen ufos  
and not only that it appears that 17 chickens six  pigs and two cows had disappeared from the area  
uh during this wave of sightings the police  officers speculates that perhaps the ufo  
had run out of supplies or food and was stealing  these animals or perhaps they were studying them  
hard to say but there are a lot of cases like this  another occurred uh more recently on july 12 1999  
this is also in brazil but in a very rural area  in a place called acre brazil in which a group  
of people saw a ufo described as very much like a  small car bright silver it came down hovered over  
the field and it lifted up a pig and this pig just  flew up and inside this craft which darted away  
and I know how this sounds yeah when pigs fly  but this is apparently a serious case and it was  
viewed by about 50 people according to the local  police commander so yeah absolutely a serious case  
so yeah as the cases mount it becomes kind of  undeniable that ets are interested in animals  
another case comes from mufon was reported to  mufon by an anonymous gentleman this occurred  
in march of 2018 in a rural area of ohio a man  decided to go camping not far from his home  
uh this was something he did periodically and he  said in this area there were a lot of stray cats  
so he wasn't surprised when he saw  some running across his campsite   but then he started hearing a strange  noise and so he looks over to where this  
cat had just run and saw something very  strange and i'll just quote the witness here
i could make out the shape of plastic containers  in a small circle that housed some of the cats  
i then noticed three sets of pinkish orange  glowing objects with slight movement I first  
assumed the glowing objects were the reflection  of the three cat's eyes but after watching the  
objects further for about 30 seconds I saw that  the glowing was in fact some sort of eyewear  
worn by three human-like figures as I knelt  down to watch I could see these figures were  
handling the cats and the subjects were  wearing a very low reflective off-white  
or gray coverall after about two minutes all  three subjects turned their heads towards me  
thinking they might be animal control workers and  not wanting to frighten them I stood up and said  
how y'all doing there was no vocal response  and all three began moving towards me instantly  
closing about 30 feet that separated us slowly  I spoke again saying what are you guys doing out  
here while they continued moving towards  me I heard them talking or communicating  
but inside my head and in a very strange whisper  I couldn't understand I also noticed they were  
shorter than me uh i'm 510 and i'd guess they were  8 to 10 inches shorter than me I turned and ran  
later he explored the area the roads in this  area and could not find any vehicles so clearly  
they weren't animal control officers and uh yeah  he thinks they were ets and ended up reporting  
this case to mufon so there are other cases in  which and lots of cases in which animals have been  
taken in 2011 uh the police in uh the fed powers  area of wales received a series of calls one com  
came from a gentleman who said he saw a sheep  being abducted into a ufo in a field near the  
town of lampeter wales there are a number of  cases in which et's have tried unsuccessfully to  
abduct dogs one occurred in 1957 on the heels  of the levelland texas sightings november 1957  
everett clark of dante tennessee went  outside to check on his dog frisky  
and saw that there were four human figures two  males and two females and one of the men was  
trying to take his dog who was growling and  trying to bite him they eventually just went  
back into their craft and went away on that  very same day in everettstown new jersey john  
trasco went outside around dusk to feed his dog  and saw this object hovering in front of his barn  
out came these three foot tall pale skinned  beings with frog like eyes they were wearing green  
jumpsuits his wife was watching from the window  by the way had also saw this craft and the beings  
and uh the being spoke to uh mr john trasco and  said we are peaceful people we only want your  
dog well trasco replied get the hell out of  here and they're being retreated to the craft  
so yeah et's are apparently trying to  abduct people's dogs but not so successfully  
though there are a few cases where people  have been abducted along with their pets   there's one case reported to mufon of a  gentleman who was taken on board a ufo  
and the ichi's were friendly enough but his dog  was uh very angry with the et's and kept trying  
to bite them and finally they just paralyzed  him and this gentleman said his dog whose name   was hunter bone just floated around the craft  like a stuffed animal during the entire duration  
of his on-board experience and finally  was let go and the paralysis was removed  
i know another case which occurred on march 2nd  2006 in which a man was in his home this is in a  
corn creek nevada and he had a ufo hovering  overhead and his dogs were acting up and  
he went inside after the ufo left but the next  day one of his dogs had a very strange injury  
and he ended up taking the dog to the vet because  it looked like a wound that had been cauterized  
which was pretty inexplicable and the vet  was absolutely puzzled too so it appears as  
if this guy's dog was in fact abducted I know  of another case which occurred on october 7th  
1989 this is in venetsa ukraine a young  boy by the name of rado was visited  
in his bedroom by two human-like beings who  asked him to go with them on board their craft  
rado refused he said I won't go unless I can bring  my dog and cat with me his pets and they agreed  
surprisingly enough and radio was taken on board  this craft and showing a lot of different things  
he may have been taken to another planet  it's a pretty long involved experience  
uh what's interesting is he was actually observed  by his family as he came back into his room just  
floated back in through the window so it's got  some pretty interesting outside observers there
i know of another case in which an abductee had  a vision or a dream a dream like vision which  
she saw the koalas being rescued from  the very devastating and recent wildfires  
that it swept across australia and yeah  killed an estimated millions of koalas  
and hopefully some of them were saved from  being killed by these ufos so that's encouraging  
certainly but not all these cases are friendly  as I mentioned I mean there was one kind of  
chilling case which occurred on february 25th  1999 in the cascade mountains of washington  
in which a group of forestry workers were  looking down upon a herd of elk and saw this ufo  
hovering over the herd it caused the  herd to panic and this ufo targeted  
one of the elk and lifted it up into the air and  was sucking it up towards the craft they didn't  
see it actually enter the craft because by this  point the object had moved behind the trees  
so this was a pretty well-known case got a lot of  attention and there was an investigation they did  
find an elk which had died of unknown causes there  were no broken bones or wounds that they could  
see but they weren't able to determine if this  was actually the elk that had been lifted up so  
what actually happened we don't know it could have  been taken or could have been dropped hard to say
another case comes from artie six killer clark  who had interviewed a guy by the name of kacho  
kakouch he was in a small village in the yucatan  peninsula in the tulum area of the yucatan this  
occurred in 2010 and he's walking by a small lake  when a ufo appeared it was very low it had a dome  
on top metallic and it was hovering over the lake  as if looking for something and to his surprise  
he sees it pull up an alligator and i'll  just quote the witness here says the witness  
suddenly the beam fell on an unsuspecting  crocodile it was resting near the bank  
the beam lifted the crocodile upward and  took it on board the ufo according to  
the witness the crocodile appeared to struggle  but was swooped up into the craft very quickly  
two days later he was walking by the same area  when this ufo apparently the same one appeared  
and dumped the body of a crocodile back into  the lake and uh took another crocodile so  
not a particularly pleasant case but  definitely they are taking animals  
i know of another guy I interviewed his case  appears in my book on board ufos uh his name  
is andy he had abduction experiences from his home  the netherlands and he said he had a really weird  
experience for two fish disappeared from his fish  tank and no they weren't eaten by the other fish  
they were just disappeared so very strange  now ichis are definitely abducting people  
another kind of disturbing case comes from grant  cameron he wrote about it in his excellent book  
alien bedtime stories and involves this deer which  was found on top of a telephone pole now how the  
heck it got all the way up there is hard to say  unless it was dropped or maybe somehow you know  
someone's playing a real sick joke uh but  yeah this is apparently related to the  
mutilation phenomena which again I don't really  want to get too into but it is related to this  
certainly and there are lots of cases  where cows have been taken on board and  
ranchers have found their cows the bodies of them  lodged in trees so yeah we know this does happen  
and it's certainly pretty unfortunate um so yeah  not all these cases are super friendly rd6 killer  
clark talks about a case in which a gentleman had  his dog abducted and while the dog was returned  
it was returned without its voice box the  guy noticed his dog could no longer bark and  
took it to the vet and the vet said well this is  strange the voice box has been surgically removed  
and whoever did it did a really good job but yeah  the dog owner is obviously not happy and neither  
was the dog so a lot of weird cases in which they  definitely show interest in animals one such case  
occurred at the phoenix zoo and this is a very  interesting case the main witness is a gentleman  
by the name of kenneth sinat who had worked at the  zoo for many years this is a large zoo it's got  
124 acres that he's responsible for patrolling  and so he reported this case to fate magazine  
and i'll just quote kenneth here I noticed  an extremely bright light in the air directly  
above the lion and tiger exhibit the light was  oval and so bright it hurt my eyes to look out  
so what he did is he called his partner on the  radio and asked if his partner could see the  
strange light and as ken says i'm quoting again  at that point the light was moving over my truck  
as the light passed over me the truck's motor  stopped and the lights went out I sat motionless  
more frightened than anything else as soon as the  light passed over the truck the light and motor  
came back on the ufo moved on occasionally sending  down a brief beam of blue light wherever the ufo  
went the animals below would react by making  sounds that were unusual for that time of night  
so this craft eventually moved off and  after several minutes it disappeared  
it turns out his partner had viewed the entire  incident from the front gate of the phoenix zoo  
so yeah this has two witnesses who watch this  ufo show a very unusual interest in the zoo and  
yeah it's a very strange case and there may be  other cases like it I found one that may have  
taken place at flushing park in new york at a zoo  there but ended up not including the case because  
i'm not quite sure about uh the source but another  case occurred in november 30th 1971 a lady was at  
the uh the plymouth zoo in devon england  and was taking a picture of a giraffe  
did not see the ufo when they took the  picture of the giraffe but a ufo sure showed  
up in the picture and I just found that really  interesting because it's not the only picture  
of a person who's you know who took a  picture of a giraffe and a ufo showed up   there's actually another one which I wasn't able  to track down the actual source and location  
but I did find the photograph which is very  strange maybe it's because giraffes are so tall  
people are looking up but it could be these ufos  are hovering over zoos more often than we think  
so yeah ufos are all about animals and I know  animals can definitely sense ufos before they come  
there are literally hundreds of cases of dogs  barking and farm animals going crazy when a ufo  
appears and they can sense these things  before the ufo actually becomes visible  
so yeah a lot of cases like that i'd be here  another hour to talk about that but I will   quote one case which occurred in 1974 in the city  of ramona this is north of san diego california  
the overfelt family was drawn outside by  a bright object that had swooped out of   the sky and landed on a hill near their  home was about the size of a small house  
and was perfectly round and was changing in color  from red to white but while the craft was on the  
hill the horses that they owned started bucking  the dog was slamming around in his doghouse  
the goats were jumping up and down and their cat  ran into the side of the house stunning itself  
so yeah ufos can have a pretty severe effect  on animals in terms of just sensing them  
uh and here's one final case which I think is very  interesting this is another case I investigated  
personally I wrote about it in my book on board  ufo encounters this is the case of lynette  
and it's a very long and involved experience  but important here is what the ets told her  
they told her that they have been manipulating the  genetics of humans for a very long time but not  
only humans animals too they told her that they  had been manipulating the genes of specifically  
dogs and cats to boost their emotional  intelligence to make them more able to interact  
with humans which I find very interesting because  yeah we are all about our pets our dogs and our  
cats and they do have very human-like emotions  so this could be because of the et's I mean this  
is what they told her so I i don't know these are  strange cases I did a whole study of these types  
of cases in my book not from here volume one  and I can tell you pretty definitively pretty  
conclusively that yes ufos are collecting animals  and in some cases preserving them apparently from  
any dangers of extinction are  genetically manipulating them probably  
and of course there are an enormous number of  uh animal mutilation cases it's not just cattle  
it's all types of animals but i'm more encouraged  by these cases in which you know the animals   are treated kindly as they deserve to be so  yeah that's what this presentation is about  
i think these cases are important because they  show that not only are ets interested in animals  
but are studying them intently and  maybe even genetically modifying them  
it's also important because it shows that  animals themselves are able to sense ufos  
so yeah that's it for now thanks once  again for watching and keep having fun.
