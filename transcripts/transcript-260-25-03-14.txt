MY MOTHER THE MANTIS: THE TRUE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONTACT STORY OF SONDRA X
Mar 14, 2025

Summary:
Mar 14, 2025
A teacher from Virginia, Sondra came from a military family and has lived in many locations on the planet. She was born in 1940, and like many ET contactees, unusual events surrounded her from a very young age. In fact, when she was only a few weeks old, her mother woke up one morning to see Sondra levitating above her crib! Soon other mystical events occurred. At age three, while living in sunny Long Beach in southern California, Sondra discovered that she was able to call forth the wind, and even make it snow.

In 1946, Sondra’s father (now an  attaché to a Navy Admiral) moved the family to Tsingtao, China where they lived in the former Swiss Embassy building. There Sondra soon displayed other abilities. She began having out-of-body experiences. Fresh-cut flowers would remain alive and healthy in her room for weeks on end. She began to hear a voice in her head teaching her about the human body. She excelled academically to a degree that should would soon skip grades in school, and more. Her stay in China was cut short by conflict within the country, and in 1947, her father was called to serve in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was there that Sondra had perhaps the most unusual event of her life.

Sondra had just turned eight-year-old and one day, with her parents’ permission, she decided to ride her bicycle to a friend’s home one mile away. This was something she had done many times, but on this occasion, she never made it there. When she did not arrive, her family began a 7-hours-long frantic search for Sondra, finally finding her dazed and in a trance alongside the remote highway near her home, in an area where they had already searched several times. They asked her what happened, but Sondra did not dare tell them. She knew they would never believe her.

As she biked down the desolate highway, a shadow appeared overhead, and looking up, she saw a metallic craft hover overhead. It quickly landed on the road in front of her. Sondra stopped and watched as an opening appearing in the craft, and standing in the doorway was a tall humanoid praying mantis beckoning her inside the craft. More curious than afraid, Sondra approached. That mantis being told Sondra to have no fear, that she was her mother and invited her onboard the craft. Fascinated, Sondra accepted the offer. 

Entering the craft, she was shocked to see that it was much larger on the inside than the outside. Immediately a half-dozen short little figures crowded around her, playfully touching her blond hair and escorting her around the craft. She first thought they were little children, but saw that they had large bald heads, big dark eyes, and gray skin. Sondra explored the craft which was very sparse. Looking out a porthole, she was shocked to see the Earth off in the distance. The mantis being led her to the center of the room where there was a holographic device displaying full-color, three-dimensional images. Sondra was shocked and saddened to see images of soldiers, tanks, explosions and more.  The mantis said, “What you are seeing are pictures of future wars,” and told Sondra that it was her duty to warn others about this.

After a few more messages, Sondra suddenly found herself back in her home with her concerned parents. Sondra later told her grandmother who shared that she also had encounters as a little girl, but otherwise learned to keep her experience a secret.

Sondra grew up, got a few college degrees, fell in love, got married and had children. She continued to have OBEs and other unusual events. Then one day her husband said he had seen grays at the foot of the bed speaking to Sondra. She had no memory of this, but shortly later, she began having repeated visitations by the grays in her bedroom, who would hold long conversations with her. The visits occurred for many years. Only a few times did Sondra ever see them arrive or leave. She rarely remembered the content of the conversations. 

Eventually the visits slowed and one day stopped. One of her final visits occurred in 2018. The grays had come to again give her in urgent warning about future wars on our planet, and advise her to move out of the city and into the mountains, a warning which she and her husband heeded. Today, she lives there peacefully. Sondra agreed to share her story as she feels its important to communicate the warnings given to her by the ETs. If you are interested in hearing more about Sondra’s amazing encounter, her story (and many others) is presented in my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal
today I'm going to do something a little bit different this is not a collection of humanoid accounts this is in fact one
person story I call this episode my mother the Mantis the true
extraterrestrial contacts of Sandra not going to use her last name she wants to
remain anonymous Sandra reached out to me after finding out about my research seeing some of my stuff on YouTube and
boy does she have a story to share I've certainly interviewed a lot of people
and much of what she describes is familiar to me but some of her story is absolutely unique and it's truly
fascinating she's had a lifetime of contact not only with mantis type
extraterrestrials but with Grays as well and also some really high strangeness
events with the Paranormal and psychic abilities it's a truly amazing story I
did present it in my book humanoids in high strangeness so I'm going to be
doing a little bit of a reading from that chapter you might look at it that way but I think you'll find this a
particularly fascinating account because it is quite unusual and quite lengthy
and extensive as well and the first section I call strange from the start as
I'm sure you know contact almost always Begins for contactees at a very young
age anywhere from a few months old all the way up to 5 6 or 7 somewhere there
about with Sandra it was quite early and her first indications of unusual events
were some very very interesting psychic abilities that she presented at a very
very young age strange events surrounded Sandra almost from the day she was born
the year was 1940 Sandra was only a few weeks old Sandra's crib was next to her
mother's bed so her mother could keep a close eye on her and one morning Sandra's mother woke up to an incredible
sight Sandra was levitating above her crib her mother immediately jumped up
and shouted whoever is doing this put her down now at that point Sandra
promptly floated gently back back down into her crib but this was an incident that Sandra's mother kept secret almost
until the day she died it was to be the first of many strange events that would become a regular feature in Sandra's
life at this time Sandra's family resided in Long Beach California her
father was a captain in the Navy and held other prominent jobs within government and as a result his job would
take him all over the world now one of Sandra's first memories stes Ates back
to when she was only 9 months old this may sound incredible but a lot of
contactees have very early memories and often report tic memories now Sandra and her mother were
riding on a public bus when another passenger began to argue with Sandra's mother sandre became angry and shouted
at the other passenger saying she's my mother and she can do whatever she wants
this was the first of many times that Sandra would Amaze her family with her early childhood recall because she was
able to remember this as an adult really shocked her family at age three Sandra
vividly remembered the birth of her younger brother all her aunts were there to celebrate the birth and Sandra was
disappointed because she was no longer the baby of the family so a little
mythed about this Sandra decided to step outside she looked up into the sky this
was a bright sunny day and wished it would snow there were clouds uh but to
her shock it actually started snowing now this is Long Beach myu Southern
California it rarely snows there she was absolutely amazed she ran back inside to
share this miraculous event but nobody cared they were all busy with the new baby so Sandra stepped back outside and
enjoyed the snow alone and after playing for a while she became bored and decided
to test her abity ability to control the weather by calling forth the wind and she shouted out I want wind and to her
Delight she says powerful gusts of wind swirled around her now had she actually
called forth the snow and the wind as an adult Sandra is not completely sure
nevertheless it was an incident that left a very Vivid impression on her mind
and future events with s what we would call superhuman abilities certainly
would make her wonder about this in hindsight how interesting is that I've certainly heard of other contes
levitating it's not that unusual I did a whole episode about it so that really
didn't surprise me too much but Sandra's description of being able to control the
weather that is unusual and I've only heard that a couple of times but I have
to believe it because this is something that turns up with a lot of contact te stories I'm telling you we all have
these abilities some people just display them more often than others I think
their abilities are woken up somehow I sometimes think it's partly due to
contact partly sometimes I think these abilities actually are attractive to to
the extraterrestrials they really are drawn to people with strong psychic
abilities and it didn't stop there this was just the beginning because Sandra
soon began to display even more amazing abilities so I call this next section
mystical abilities and man oh man the things she describes are just so amazing
shortly after this in 1943 Sandra's father moved the family to Norfolk
Virginia 3 years later in 1946 Sandra's sister was born sadly she suffered from
muscular distrophy but was otherwise healthy not long after this Sandra's
father who is now working as an attache to a Navy Admiral announced that they
were all going to go to Singa China and actually live there in the former Swiss
Embassy building now to six-year-old Sandra this was all part of a fantastic
Adventure but she soon learned some harsh realities of what life was like outside of the United States while her
residence was nice outside the embassy building things were a little different
there was a large brick wall surrounding the building and all the day trash would be disposed of by their Amma who tossed
it over the wall now Sandra became curious about life outside the building so she peered over the wall and to her
sadness saw that there were children starving waiting for the trash they would actually pick through the garbage
looking for food and more often than not equally hungry adults snatched the food
scraps away from the ch children and ate it themselves so this was a real wakeup
call for Sandra Sandra's family also had another scare when their Amma secretly
tried to broker a deal and actually sell Sandra as a servant or Worse thankfully
this did not happen but it was a very powerful reminder to all of them that they were in a foreign country and how
had to guard their safety carefully the only opportunity Sandra had to leave the building was to attend the International
School in a Convent where classes were taught by nuns and this also led to some
interesting situations because the nuns began to show a very unusual and
Powerful interest in Sandra at this point Sandra wasn't sure why but she soon found out before long
these nuns actually began to beg Sandra's mother to let her join the convent Sandra's mother said it was up
to her daughter Sandra however had no interest in becoming a nun instead she had aspirations of becoming a doctor but
one day very soon after all of this Sandra found out one of the reasons why the nuns showed such a special interest
in her the nuns would regularly Place fresh cut flowers throughout the convent
and of course they would always Wilt away fairly quickly however in Sandra's
room the fresh cut flowers never seemed to wilt or droop instead they remained as fresh as the day they were cut but
when Sandra was absent these flowers would soon die and as Sandra says that
surpris them all and that was one of the reasons they wanted me to join the convent that's part of it I know how
that sounds but I have other cases like that now yeah there was that was just part of it apparently Sandra was also
displaying other mystical abilities that truly amazed the nuns forbidden from
traveling outside Sandra nevertheless longed to see the city and she found
that if she lay down relaxed she could actually leave her body fly around and
explore the city at her Leisure using what she now knows as astral projection
so that was interesting another thing the nuns were apparently impressed by was Sandra displayed an incredible
ability to care for the other children she seemed to know things well beyond her years now sandre didn't talk about
why but she did have a secret because it was during this time that she says she began to hear a voice in her head a
soothing female voice which would teach her and show her all kinds of things as
Sandra says she would tell me all about my body I learned a lot just by listening and looking at my body this
voice kept telling me about my body I could almost see my body the bones in my
body she would show me and tell me what was in in the human body so Sandra's
interest in health and biology and being a doctor was being fortified by this
apparent spirit guide now at the time Sandra didn't realize how unusual all
these experiences were instead she just found it very fascinating but it was
short-lived because her time in China was about to come to an end after living there for about a year in the beginning
of 1947 they were told that they had to immediately vacate the premises they
only had 24 hours warning turned out war was brewing in the country and it was no
longer safe for them to be there how unusual is that I mean Sandra's just a
tiny little thing and she's already displaying all these amazing abilities
with healing and outof body experiences and so much more so they fled China and
ended up in Albuquerque New Mexico this is 1947 now as you may know this is when
the Roswell incident occurred I think it's quite possible and so does Sandra
think that her father may have had some participation in the Roswell incident
she never was able to find out but yeah it was the summer of 1947 and this is when she had a truly
incredible encounter fullon onboard encounter her where she met praying
mantis ETS gray type ETS who apparently took her on board because they had some
very important messages for her apparently to share with all Humanity
it's an incredible story and one of the most unusual ET contact stories I've ever heard I call this one my mother the
Mantis so now they are back in New Mexico in Albuquerque the summer of 1947
this is the exact time of the Roswell UFO incident a really remarkable
synchronicity there considering that Sandra was about to have the most
amazing encounter Sandra was had just turned 8 years old she found herself
once again having to adjust to a new home a new neighborhood a new school but
because Sandra had done so well in China and impressed The Nuns with her extensive knowledge her parents had her
academically tested and the teacher said she could skip two grades if her parents wanted her parents
said no so she instead just skipped the second grade and put her in third now
their home at this time was located in a fairly remote location outside of Albuquerque luckily Sandra had a new
friend at a nearby Navajo reservation only about one mile down the road and
one morning after getting permission from her mother Sandra grabbed her bicycle and began the the one M trip to
visit her friend Sandra had made this trip several times before and today
seemed no different as usual the highway was pretty much devoid of traffic so she
just pedal her bike along the highway then as sandre says all of a sudden it
felt like there was a cloud over me it got dark so I stopped my bike and I looked up and there was a gray something
was gray it was round like a sphere so she could see this metallic object it
was silent and in a matter of seconds it landed on the highway in front of her was big enough to reach from one side of
the road to the other actually overlapping onto the shoulders sandre
says I knew what metal was and it was gray and it landed right in front of me
it was not small but it wasn't that big either I looked over and there was a
door so Sandra having been on a Navy ship knew what cra looked like she knew
this was some kind of a craft and she looked at it in absolute amazement she
could see the metal glinting in the sunlight it was obvious to her that this was not normal she peered into the open
doorway and slowly cautiously crept forward after just a few short moments
she saw a tall figure appear in the doorway as Sandra says she looked like a
praying mantis I saw her face and I saw her her hands she had long fingers she
was very skinny she looked like a pray mantis she was very tall Sandra was
absolutely startled by the being's strange appearance and yet at the same time she felt no fear she walked forward
and this mantis being immediately began to speak telepathically to her in a
soothing female voice and the Mantis told her come in Sandra hesitated for
just a moment but the Mantis seemed very friendly welcoming and nurturing and she
repeated please come in don't worry everything is fine I'm your mother so
everything is fine don't be afraid I'm your mother so that as you can imagine
fascinated Sandra and feeling no fear she walked up to the Mantis who took her
by the hand and led her inside this craft says Sandra so there I was I walk
walked in when I got in there it seemed bigger than it did on the outside she
walked me around and there were all these other little ones they gathered around me they let me walk around the
ship so I was walking around and then I realized they weren't kids they were
these gray creatures there were about six of them I was fully accepted and I
accepted all of them it was nice they were very nice I was just fascinated by
what I had walked into to to me this was all an adventure so Sandra was thought these
were little kids at first but realized you know these are not quite normal little kids in hindsight she realized
that they were what we would call Grays and she was delighted by them they were very playful very curious they clustered
around her making soft high-pitched chirping noises and as Sandra says they
followed me everywhere they were everywhere with me they were just showing me that were friendly they
wanted to touch me I had blonde hair and they wanted to touch my hair and that sort of thing they loved my blonde hair
and I was like okay because I had gotten used to that in China in China everybody
was wanting to touch my hair so it was not a problem so Sandra absolutely
amazed roamed through the ship in a state of complete awe she said the inside was very bright very clean and
sparse there were gray metal walls said the grace acted like little children
while the Mantis mother led her gently through the craft says Sandra she looked
like an ant but a different size of an ant a praying mantis I mean seriously a
creature an insect that was talking to me that was something else I thought oh
my that is strange but it was all very pleasant to me it did not feel like
anything to be afraid of I was so amazed I really did like them I had no problems
with them they were all friendly now Sandra had only been on
board this craft for only a minute or two when something caught her interest
as Sandra explains I saw a port hole just like I had seen on the ship from
China so I said let me look through the port hole and what did I see I saw Earth
and I saw the Moon it was in between the Moon and the Earth and I was thinking thinking wow this is fantastic and the
Moon looked pretty big like we were closer to the Moon than the earth and I
thought oh God this is interesting I looked and I thought where am I I was so
amazed to be out in space I enjoyed the ride I was looking at the stars and it
was just amazing it was just fascinating looking at the Earth from so far away I
was thinking wow this is great so candra was utterly captivated by this amazing
view she had felt no movement or inertia so to find herself suddenly so far away
from Earth so quickly was a huge surprise says Sandra we were out in
space which was fascinating to me I just can't tell you it was like wow then I
kept walking around and finally kind of like in the center of the ship everyone
was gathered around it looked like a box like like a TV now I didn't know what a
TV was at the time but that's what it looked like I don't know how to describe this but it was like a hologram so as
Sandra focused in on this she saw movement and colors she first saw
darkness and clouds and then suddenly it all became clear she couldn't believe what she was looking at she saw people
in uniforms marching she saw tanks she saw guns and explosions these were all
images of war was quite small about a foot wide but very colorful Vivid and
totally lifelike as Sandra says I thought wow what is this all about and I
heard from her my mother the praying mantis what you are seeing are pictures
of future Wars you need to let people know this is what is going to happen if
mankind doesn't do something this is going to be the future
so as you can imagine once again Sandra found herself absolutely astonished says
Sandra I don't know exactly what she said because I was so fascinated with everything but she was trying to tell me
that we had to watch out otherwise there would be many many wars that's all she
would say and I thought well I'm out in the desert how am I going to tell
anybody what am I supposed to do with this so she was was struggling with all
of that when as sandre says the next thing I knew I was in my
bathroom now go rewinding just a little bit unknown to Sandra her family became
alarmed when Sandra failed to show up at her friend's house on the Navajo reservation so they immediately began a
search they could not find her and in fact sandre was missing for about 7
hours they simply could not find her anywhere they went up and down the
highway several times finally decided to check it again and there they found Sandra sitting next to her bike
alongside the highway she was in a days she did not seem to be aware of her
surroundings they thought at first that perhaps she had crashed but that made no sense because an earlier search had
failed to locate her and furthermore Sandra didn't have a scratch on her nor
did the bike itself show any signs of damage Sandra doesn't really remember
this her first conscious memory after seeing these holographic images of War on board the craft and being warned
about them was waking up in the bathroom of her home so she exited the bathroom
and was immediately confronted by her mother who wanted to know what happened now that Sandra was lucid she wanted to
know had anyone hurt her what did Sandra remember did she need to go to the
doctor but Sandra insisted that she was fine she said she didn't remember
anything because even at that age she knew she would not have been believed as
Sandra says that was the thing I didn't think they would believe me they would
not have believed me isn't that interesting Sandra taken on board meets
this mantis ET who introduces herself as her mother may sound strange but I've
heard that in other ET contact stories doesn't surprise me that Sandra kept
quiet about it even at that age she knew how unusual this experience was and that
there probably wasn't much use in trying to tell people though she eventually did
try uh she told people at school was not believed uh learned again the hard way
to keep quiet but her psychic abilities continued to
manifest she had some very powerful outof body experiences where she could see her whole neighborhood all over the
place she asked her grandmother if she had had experiences and her grandmother
actually admitted that yes as a young girl she also had Encounters this is an
important detail I go more into this in the book but it's important because this
is another indication that contact is generational certainly does seem to be
true in Sandra's case but Sandra grew up she got married had kids she went to
college she became a teacher got a degree in Psychology actually so she's
quite accomplished and basically that was her last experience with the manads however
it certainly was not her last experience with the Grays she went many years without any encounters that she's aware
of but then one day the gra came back into her life and again they had some
very interesting information to share with her now as an adult Sandra had left
all of that behind she thought that her experiences with ETS were over but turns
out they weren't and for her it began when one day her husband made a startling admission he told Sandra that
shortly after they got married he woke up to see two quote creatures standing
at the foot of the bed equally startling was the fact that Sandra appeared to be
talking to them now frightened he told the creatures to leave and don't come back oddly Sandra has no memory of this
visit as she says I do not remember anything I don't remember that at all
but around 1990 it happened again and this time Sandra did remember says
Sandra I woke up and they were on the side of the bed they came to me and were
talking to me I can't remember what what they were talking to me about but she certainly remembers what they looked
like she describes them as short little Grays very friendly and not at all
threatening Sandra has no memory of being taken on board but again neither
could she remember what the ETS were telling her at this time Sandra was living in Virginia Beach in Virginia and
before long the grce started visiting her fairly regularly now she never saw
them arrive but she would be wakened in her room by this noise and there they
would be it seemed like they were often bumbling around the room chirping and
knocking into things being kind of playful and on a few occasions they seemed to be producing she says some
kind of music they were always interested in talking to Sandra but when
morning came Sandra could never quite remember what they had been talking about she almost never saw them arrive
or leave leave but sometimes they would stay for so long that Sandra had to actually tell them to go away and that
she needed to get her sleep but as Sandra says they made a lot of noise and
I would have to say please stop knock it off no noise no noise sandre was
particularly concerned about her husband because she had tried telling him about what was happening and her experiences
during childhood but it was clear that the subject made him uncomfortable and
that he did not want to talk about it but still the grace kept coming as Sandra says they were little gray
creatures they seem to be really happy with me they always woke me up like two
three or four of them like let's have a party and I would wake up and say would
you please not make so much noise I have to go to work you have to stop making so
much noise but they were happy to be in my house it was almost like they were
dancing and there was some music that came along with it that's what woke me up the music music and
talking so sometimes the Grays would wake her up and Sandra would just lay in bed and ignore them and wait for them to
go away it became such a regular thing that it was a normal feature of her life
and she just didn't pay too much attention to it now a few times she did become curious if other people in the
world were having similar experiences so she decided to pick up a few books on the subject but she quickly put them
down cuz she was disappointed to hear strange and lurid stories of abductions
and examinations and fear-filled encounters which wasn't her experience
at all she wondered if the cases she was reading about were even true so she no
longer bothered to even read them she did notice some patterns the visitations would come in waves sometimes frequently
though sometimes it would be quiet for several months but they always seemed to return on a
few rare occasions she did see them arrive she would wake up to see the room filling with light then the Grays would
be there also equally rare was seeing them leave but it did happen when they
left they would float up through the closed window and into a bright light which would quickly wink
out one time they showed up and she did actually remember what they told her
says Sandra they said I am going to live a long life that's what they basically
told me and I thought well that's nice it's like they're there to take care of
me for some reason of course this turned out to be true Sandra has lived a very
long life and quite healthy too other strange things happened Sandra was
working she had to commute about 45 minutes to her place of employment and
sometimes inex lickably she'd find herself arriving 30 minutes early it
happened enough times that she knew it wasn't her imagination and yet it was weird because she never saw anything
strange during these trips she couldn't explain how it was happening suddenly she just find herself pulling into the
parking lot at work as Sandra says that happened quite a few times I was taken
care of very interesting stuff Sandra's not only having sometimes missing time
but apparently at added time other contactees have described that to me
arriving at their locations far earlier than they should have so there's some really interesting details to some of
these contact stories that you don't often hear now Sandra's husband wasn't super
receptive to the fact that she was having contact even though he himself had seen the gra so it was kind of a
part of her life that she just kept mostly quiet about uh but this is definitely a pattern we
see with a lot of contact e they live as Jacob says David Jacob's Secret Lives or
two separate lives I hear this sort of thing all the time finally she did
summon up the courage to ask her sons she has three sons if any of them had
encounters none of them did all of them were a bit surprised to hear their mother's accounts of having encounters
but were very supportive Sandra never did get a chance to ask her siblings she had a sister and a brother
um but she never was able to ask them they passed away before she had a chance
to ask them and that's when she finally decided she better ask her children uh Unfortunately they did not
have anything to add so she was kind of left alone with this um possibly they do
have encounters but don't remember but there's no real indication of that that
at any rate sandre spent most of her life without having a whole lot of
encounters though many years later as often happens The graes Returned again
this time they had a message and a warning and that's what I call this segment a message and a warning so time
marched on and while the visitations continued they slowly slowed down and
eventually seemed to completely stop sandre would occasionally dream about the ETS but she was almost never visited
and if she was she didn't remember it but every now and then it would happen
one of the last occasions occurred around 2018 and it was apparently an important
visit because as Sandra says I was awakened with two of them sitting by me
wanting to chat or take care of me someway and then I finally got the
message you need to go to the mountains and I got this feeling that there was a
war coming on as a result of this Sandra and her husband eventually sold their house in
Virginia Beach and moved up into the mountains and it wasn't long after that
that the 2020 pandemic hit and then the political unrest war in Europe something
which still concerns Sandra and as recently as 2022 she heard some strange noises at
night but was unable to identify them she can't conclusively say that it's the
ETS but she knows that they're still out there she has the sense that they are
still watching over and protecting her but she's glad she got that message she's now safe in her Mountain Home in
case anything should happen I think you'll agree Sandra's story is pretty
interesting very compelling she has witnesses to support her case and the
fact that she went missing as a young child and nobody could find her that's quite significant where was she well she
was on board a craft her husband also saw the Grays so my point is this is not
simply one person's eyewitness anecdotal testimony she has corroborating
witnesses that I think is important because it always adds a level of credibility to the case Sandra is
certainly not seeking fame she insisted upon anonymity she had to be convinced
to be interviewed as many contactees do they're very very wary of being
disbelieved ridiculed uh being gaslit because they
had an experience that they don't fully understand uh but I think a lot of people are having these experiences I
think it's important we all know about this because I think we now have enough
people coming forward to say for sure that these events are happening I like
Sandra's story because like most of the people I interview VI she doesn't feel
like the ETS are here to hurt or take over or cause fear or anything like this
uh again she did try to read on some other people's accounts and just finally
put the books down because they were very lurid very fear-based and that just wasn't what she was
experiencing so I really want to thank Sandra for coming forward I know it takes a lot of Courage her story is an
important one and certainly I think adds to our knowledge of what's going on here with
extraterrestrial contact so that's it for today if you want to learn more about Sandra's Story
