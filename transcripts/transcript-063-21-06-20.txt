Summary:
Jun 20, 2021
On March 16, 1967, an incredible event occurred at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, USA. 
Multiple UFOs hovered at very low elevation over the nuclear missiles sites, and were viewed 
by many military officers at the base. Then, one by one, the nuclear Minuteman ICBM missiles 
mysteriously went offline. The entire base went on high alert. There was an immediate 
investigation and a cover-up of the event. Years later, in 1994, one of the witnesses, 
Captain Robert Salas went public and disclosed the event. After locating other witnesses, 
Salas published the book, FADED GIANT in 2005, and the encounter became established in UFO 
History.

In 2015, retired army officer Mel Hansen was shocked to learn that the Malmstrom incident was 
being presented on television. He was a firsthand witness to the encounter, but had always kept 
his participation in the event a secret from everyone except a few family members. Now that it 
was being shown on TV, Mel decided that it was time for him to talk about what he saw on that 
amazing night.

This video presents the incredible story of Mel Hansen, and what he saw and experienced at 
Malmstrom AFB in March of 1967. It was an encounter that would drastically alter his life and 
leave him forever convinced of the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials. Mel's story provides 
further confirmation of one of the most important and profound cases in UFO history, a case 
that the Air Force is still trying to cover-up to this very day!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and welcome to another episode of UFO's  
and the paranormal this episode is  called "Malmstrom: A New Witness Speaks". On march 16 1967 an incredible event occurred at  malmstrom air force base in montana multiple ufos  
hovered at very low elevation over the base and  were seen by many of the military officers there  
one by one the nuclear minuteman icbm missiles  were shut down this of course caused near  
panic at the base especially at the very high  levels and there was an immediate investigation  
and a cover-up of the events a cover-up  which is still in place to this day  
one of the main witnesses was captain robert  salas he was present when this event occurred  
and as robert salas says the events  involved the sudden shutdown of nearly  
20 nuclear missiles while ufos were  in close proximity to these weapons  
following this event captain salus was told not  to discuss it but he couldn't get what happened  
out of his mind and he eventually started to  investigate it he located other witnesses and  
in 1994 captain robert salas bravely went public  with what happened at malmstrom air force base
eleven years later in 2005 he  released his excellent book faded  
giant which presented the events of what  happened at malmstrom air force base  
in 2015 a gentleman a 77 year old retired military  officer was contacted by his daughter who had just  
seen a television program on the discovery channel  featuring ufos and presenting this incredible  
event which occurred at malmstrom air force base  on march 16 1967. his daughter was excited because  
she remembered that her father had told her  about being there at the base when this event  
occurred mel hansen himself was delighted to  hear that this event was being spoken about  
publicly and he decided it was time for him to go  public and share his story of his participation  
in this incredible event and this video is the  story of mel hansen's participation in this event  
it's a story that has not been publicly released  before and he tells it here for the first time  
mel was born in 1938 after graduating  from college he spent six years in the u.s  
army and was given an honorable discharge in  1962. he then worked in a civilian capacity  
for the u.s air force performing aircraft repair  modification and flight test missile repair and  
testing and quality assurance and systems program  management it was a job he would hold for 37 years  
eventually becoming a division chief  before he retired from that position  
and then worked at tool army depot for two years  and later at raytheon corporation as a missile  
engineer at misawa army base in germany he is  also a licensed contractor and master carpenter  
on the evening of march 16 1967 mel hansen who  was then 29 years old was a member of a depot  
maintenance team performing modifications  of the minuteman icbm launch facility  
on the outskirts of malmstrom air force base there  were 10 launch facilities assigned and identified  
as alpha flight primarily a3 and a5 as mel says  I was a missile quality assurance manager on a  
modification and maintenance team from hill air  force base in utah the work we performed at the  
time was on the actual missile launch facilities  of alpho and bravo flight the launch facilities  
are not manned the launch and monitoring of the  sites are performed by the launch control facility  
each which controls 10 missiles the  launch control facility is manned by two  
armed usaf missile launch control officers  if and when the launch commands are given  
it takes both crew members to simultaneously  turn the launch key within one second it is  
physically impossible for one person to enter the  launch vote command the launch control facility  
is on a manned complex and has the underground  launch control facility a manned security desk  
and houses the combat security teams that  patrol the launch control facility access roads  
and maintains site security they are heavily  armed and can respond with deadly force  
at times missile maintenance crew members  also stay at the launch control facility  
the strike teams are on the road 24 hours a day  and respond directly from the desk sergeant who  
under unusual circumstances responds from orders  directly from the launch crew the launch crew and  
security personnel are given extensive training  on how to cope and deal with stressful situations
on this particular evening mel was working the  graveyard shift monitoring the maintenance crew  
team and along with them was a armed usaf  security officer and as mel says and I quote  
sometime after midnight the guard was  sitting in my government car on the site  
taking a break and having a cup of coffee not  much was happening on his tactical radio or on my  
site activation task force radio it was a clear  dark night and the guard and I stepped out of the  
car so he could have a smoke it was a beautiful  star-filled sky however it seemed really eerie  
you could feel it in the air it was unusually  quiet the rest of the crew three maintenance  
guys were working on the silo suddenly the  guards radio started to say that some unknown  
airborne activity was occurring near our  site a3 and a5 and as we stood by the car  
something really strange was happening in the  sky a little to the west of us about where the  
commercial electric power poles for the site were  located but almost directly above the launcher  
it was virtually silent but you could sense its  presence and see something blocking the stars  
directly above the silo there was no doubt  something really strange was happening and yes  
both myself and the guard were concerned and  scared looking up mel could see a very large dark  
object blocking out the stars it was immediately  apparent to him this was not a balloon  
not a normal aircraft it was very clearly a ufo  as mill says I have been on almost all of the  
minuteman missile sites and all 54 titan missile  sites and I have never experienced anything like  
what was happening the guards radio really came  alive with obvious confusion on what to do next  
the guard became excited and somewhat confused  waiting for further instruction things were  
happening so fast I have no recollection of  how all of this how long all of this lasted
at the time of this incident captain robert  salas was on duty he was on alert duty  
as the deputy missile combat crew commander  at the oscar flight launch control facility  
his phone rang and the flight security  controller explained that he and another airman  
were observing quote some strange lights over the  site captain salas asked him what kind of lights  
the officer replied well they're just lights  flying around and making some strange maneuvers  
captain salas said you mean they're ufos the  officer said well something like that all we can  
tell you is they're not aircraft salus wondered if  the officer was joking although he clearly wasn't  
and he advised the officer to keep observing the  lights and inform him if they should approach any  
closer and he hung up a short time later his phone  rang again and it was the same guard who said  
sir there's one hovering over the front gate  captain robert salas said one what and the  
officer replied a ufo it's just sitting there  we're all looking at it what do you want us to do  
captain salas had the officer describe  what he was seeing and the officer had  
difficulty explaining it and could only tell  him that it was quote a glowing red object  
captain salus ordered the guard to secure the  site while he immediately phoned the command post  
sales told his commander lieutenant fred maiwald  and explained what the guards were seeing  
and in the middle of this conversation  an alarm went off and a quote no go light  
and other red security lights indicated a problem  at one of the missile sites as captain salas says  
another alarm went off at another site then two  more simultaneously within the next few seconds  
we had lost 8 to 10 missiles in a no-go condition  on this night first lieutenant walt feigl  
was on duty as the deputy crew commander below  ground at the eco flight launch control center  
this is of course separate from the oscar  flight and when the alarm went off and one of  
the missiles indicated a no-go status he called  the missile site thinking angrily that they had  
failed to inform him and that they had started  their maintenance job without letting them know  
instead the guard informed him that  a ufo was hovering over the site  
lieutenant feigl assumed that the man was drinking  when without any notice all ten missiles began to  
shut off in rapid succession with lieutenant  feigl at the time was captain eric carlson who  
also verified this incident and both men were  reportedly very shaken by what was occurring
meanwhile back at the a3 missile site mel hansen  and his team continued to observe this huge  
dark object hovering directly above the silo  when without warning all power at the site  
failed as mel says in his own words suddenly  the commercial power to the site shut down  
and the diesel generator came on  and the site went on emergency power  
the maintenance guys came top side to see what  was going on then the diesel shut down and the  
silo went on battery power at the time the launch  officer ordered everyone the guard three other  
guys and me to stay in their cars and monitor the  tactical radios at this time the same thing was  
occurring at a5 which was not occupied at the time  and you could hear the roving patrolman's radio  
traffic saying that they had seen ufos hovering  above a3 and a5 and they appeared to be observing  
both sites the situation along with the radio  traffic seemed totally unreal and there was  
a lot of confusion on how to respond the guard  with me just sat in the car staring at his radio  
confused not knowing what to do we were again  told to stay in our cars until further notice
mel obeyed and stayed in his car for some time  but at some point curiosity got the best of him  
and he decided to venture outside so he could  get a closer look as mel says and again I quote  
i got out and stood by the car door and I could  tell that something really strange was happening  
then the battery powered to the silo shut down  and it was really quiet other than the confusion  
on the radios I can't say for sure how long  but it seems like this incident lasted about  
10 or 15 minutes because that's about the time it  would take for the strike team to get to the site  
when they finally got there we had  been given orders to return to the base  
which is about an hour's drive and as they arrived  at the site the commercial power came back on  
and the site seemed to return to normal we  were told to leave and return to the base  
the site was secured and we left we the guard  and I knew that within an hour both sites would  
be swarming with investigators and security  people and we were right the guard was not  
very talkative on the drive back and was only  concerned about how he reacted to the situation  
and when we arrived back at the base we were  met by some air force officers who took the  
guard and told me to where to report 4g briefing  the rest of the team was there when I got there  
and these very serious air force officers and  two persons in civilian clothes told us in no  
uncertain terms that we were not to discuss this  incident in any shape or form and that we would  
be given additional information as it occurred  I didn't count on this happening mel of course  
was right he was never informed after that what  the investigation into this incident revealed
nor was he questioned again he was however given  another stern warning to remain silent and not  
talk about what happened as he says the next  morning the team and I were given another don't  
say a word or you will lose your job briefing we  were then given an armed escort out to the site to  
retrieve our equipment and tools and move out onto  another site outside of the 10 a flight launch  
sites I never did understand why they let us  get the tools and equipment that soon after  
the incident when we arrived at a3 to get  our stuff the site looked like an ant hill  
mel and his team quickly gathered their tools  their equipment and left the site as mel says  
we never saw the guard again our tdy  temporary duty assignment was cut short  
a couple weeks later and we returned to hell  air force base no one wanted to lose their  
jobs so nothing to my knowledge  was discussed about this incident  
mel dutifully remained completely silent  he told no one and did not talk about it  
he only made one exception to this one of his good  friends dale snyder was also a team member and  
together he and dale would occasionally talk about  what happened on that amazing night as mel says we  
didn't want to lose our jobs but we did it on rare  occasions talk about what happened that night we  
both agreed on my version his was almost identical  the only difference was he was down in the silo  
when it started and I was topside sitting in the  car every detail other than that was identical  
unfortunately at this time all the team members  of mel's team including his friend dale snyder  
have since passed away and in 2015 when mel who  was then 77 years old heard about this incident  
he realized how important it was and that it was  time for him to share his version of the events  
he he wanted to make sure that his story  wasn't lost to history and that people knew  
what happened at malmstrom air force base  on march 16 1967. as mel says I have been a  
believer in extraterrestrial occurrences from my  teen years to the present and when this incident  
occurred it wasn't like the hollywood version  of hovering humming flying saucers with little  
guys with big eyes and long arms it happened with  silent precision in an almost unbelievable manner  
i believe the malmstrom air force base  missile wing was chosen because of the  
remoteness of some of the missile sites alpha  flight was actually in a mountainous region  
with big hills with lots of pine trees  it was an ideal scene for this incident
robert salas of course covered this event  
in his book faded giant mel hansen's story  is not told in faded giant uh robert's house  
did not know about mel hansen's story uh he does  now but mel hent or robert salas like mel hansen  
says that he was also given a debriefing of  this event and a warning to remain silent  
uh immediately following this event solace  related the events to colonel george eldridge  
and an officer from the air force office  of special investigations the a-f-o-s-i  
as captain robert salas says and I quote upon  completing our briefing we were told that the  
incident was to be considered highly classified  we were not to discuss it with anyone including  
our spouses or fellow crew members in  the more than two years that I remained  
on assignment at malmstrom air force  base neither I nor other crew members  
were ever told about the progress or the  results of the ensuing air force investigation
captain robert salas and other researchers  who looked into this incident later did find  
out what allegedly happened according  to the air force investigation  
according to the air force the official  explanation is that each of the missiles had gone  
offline due to a problem with the guidance and  control systems most of the missiles remained  
inoperable for almost an entire day and the  air force investigators speculated that some  
sort of electromagnetic pulse or emp may  have caused the incident that was their  
initial theory but this was ruled out as they  said there was no source for any kind of emp  
of course other than the ufo itself which  they did not mention in their investigation  
and meanwhile the air force apparently did its  best to scrub out any mention of ufos at all  
in the official records and they were  successful however ufo researchers have since  
located official documents about this incident on  that night there are declassified documents about  
how these missiles were shut shut down  and investigators of course also have the  
testimonies of other witnesses who were there one  of the witnesses was state security police officer  
james j ortel who was on duty that  night as officer ortel says and I quote  
i observed an unidentified flying object pass  over the entrance gate and fly in close proximity  
past the window at least two other air  policemen acknowledged seeing the same thing
airman robert morales was also on duty  that night and he observed this incident  
he was on duty while these missiles were being  brought back online almost 24 hours after the  
initial incident and it was getting dark and as  he says we were watching the lights in the sky  
they would streak and then they would stop  in the sky and they were going back and forth  
they were getting really close to us and  would go across the horizon to this day  
the air force still denies officially at  least than any ufos were seen on that evening  
mel hansen has his own speculations about  why the ufos were there and what happened at  
malmstrom as he says I believe the circumstances  involved a ufo that either had a mechanical  
failure and needed to recharge its systems or  was on a training mission for the same reason  
i think their propulsion system requires  large amounts of various types of electricity  
to recharge and to do so they had to power down  the launch site they chose remote missile sites  
in montana because they assumed they would not  be occupied but a3 was occupied the other site  
a5 was not occupied maybe they wanted to see if it  made any difference if the site was occupied based  
on what happened it apparently didn't make any  difference whatever the reason for this incident  
mel hansen says that he will never forget  it as he says I know without any reservation  
what I witnessed in montana actually happened  although this incident happened many years ago  
i remember it like it was yesterday there is  intelligent life in the vast openness of space  
maybe someday they will be so common that  their presence cannot be denied following this  
mel also had another incredible ufo  sighting mel's story about what happened  
to him at malmstrom air force base again is  not told in robert salas's book faded giant  
however he did contact me and agreed to have  his story told which I present in my new book  
wondrous 25 true ufo encounters mel wanted to do  his part to aid disclosure and make sure that this  
very important event was not lost to history  in my humble opinion I think what happened at  
malmstrom air force base was a clear message from  the ETs not to mess around with nuclear power  
this is certainly not a unique event many other  missile sites with nuclear weapons have also been  
visited some have been shut down and in other  cases the missiles were actually activated  
many nuclear power stations as well have been  visited by ufos sites where nuclear weapons  
have been held such as rendelsham  forest have also been visited  
places where there's nuclear tests of any kind  have also been visited anything involving nuclear  
power nuclear powered ships nuclear-powered  submarines submarines that carry nuclear torpedoes  
all have been visited anything to do with nuclear  power at some point is being very closely observed  
by the extraterrestrials and in addition this is  certainly one of the number one messages given to  
contactees who are taken onboard a craft over  and over again contactees are given warnings  
about the dangers of nuclear weapons and nuclear  warfare and the use of nuclear materials the ETs  
are very very concerned about this that's why  I'm pretty sure that what happened at malmstrom  
was not a hostile act in fact it was a friendly  act it was a friendly reminder to let us know  
that what we are doing is extremely dangerous and  imperils the life of everyone on earth I think  
this is an extremely important event it's one  that deserves to be widely known and that's why  
i wanted to do this video and make sure that this  event is not forgotten and that everyone knows  
that the ETs are very well aware of our use of  nuclear weapons and nuclear power and that they're  
very very concerned about it so yeah that's why I  wanted to do this video I hope you've enjoyed it I  
want to thank you very much for listening I really  appreciate it until next time keep having fun
