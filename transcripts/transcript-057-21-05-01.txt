GARY VERSUS THE GRAYS
May 1, 2021

Summary:
May 1, 2021
It is unknown how many people have been taken onboard UFOs, but it may be a lot. The problem is, many of these events are shrouded in missing time and amnesia. However, this is not always the case. Some people have fully conscious encounters. One of these people is a gentleman from England by the name of Gary. 

Ever since he was a young boy, Gary began having dramatic UFO sightings and face-to-face encounters with gray aliens. It wasn't long before he was taken onboard their craft and subjected to a wide variety of bizarre experiences. While many people recall only being physically examined, Gary recalls many other incredible experiences, many of which have rarely been reported in the UFO literature, and some which might be totally unique. Few people have the extensive recall of their experiences like Gary. His case contains both harrowing events and encounters that are incredibly humorous. It is one of the most unusual cases on record.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and welcome to another episode of ufos   and the paranormal this episode is called gary  versus the grays this is the story of one man's  
lifelong experiences with gray type ets this  has not always been a pleasant experience for  
gary gary is a pseudonym he does not want his  real name used but he's had many encounters  
with gray type ets it's quite an extensive story  and i would really like to share it with you today  
gary was born in 1969 in cumbria england cumbria  is a very rural and picturesque area it's often  
been called one of the most beautiful areas of  england unfortunately for gary he was born into a  
very abusive family his grandparents were abusive  and so are his parents his father left home  
at a very young age when gary was just a young  boy and gary was left alone with his mother  
and grandparents and his earliest memories are  of pretty severe physical and emotional abuse  
also along with this gary started having quite  a few ufo experiences his first encounter  
occurred around age five maybe six and he was  outside in the backyard with his grandmother  
when a ufo flew by even at that age gary could  see that this was not a helicopter or a plane  
or anything he recognized as conventional he  turned to his grandmother and said what's that and  
she was clearly baffled by it but didn't want  to talk about it and just sort of dismissed  
it and said oh it's just the moon and gary  could see that this wasn't the moon obviously  
but he had no one else to turn to for information  so he just dropped the subject but it wasn't long  
after that when they had another encounter on  this occasion gary had gone on a vacation with  
his mother and his mother's new boyfriend soon to  be gary's stepfather and they were returning from  
this vacation where they had driven across england  and it was late at night they were in the car  
driving along a rural area when a ufo showed up  and started to pace their car it was sort of the  
saucer shaped object it came down very low treetop  level and paced their car for many miles for over  
an hour gary says gary's soon to be stepfather  was baffled by the side of this object and just  
telling everyone to ignore it gary's mother was  pretty upset she didn't know what it was and  
kept asking what it could be again gary's soon to  be stepfather said just ignore it just ignore it  
don't look at it gary however was very intrigued  by it and stared at it as it paced their car for  
over an hour before finally flying off and this  is when his experiences really began following  
this gary would go to bed and at some point in  the night he would wake up to find these weird  
figures in his bedroom this scared him pretty  badly and now he recognizes them as grays but back  
then he had no reference point as gary says and  i quote i wouldn't be in bed long when i used to  
see these little creatures come into my bedroom i  used to scream in panic and leg it out of the room  
much to the amusement of my mother and stepfather  they looked like grays but i never remember them  
taking me i think it's probably likely that he  was abducted at this age he has no memory of this  
though he does remember that they came over and  over again it was always very frightening for him  
his parents were not supportive in the least  so he really had no recourse nobody to turn to  
it was around this time he started having really  extensive out of body experiences where he would  
float around his room or around his house  in the neighborhood or out into outer space  
even at that age gary didn't sleep much he sleeps  maybe two four hours a night this is something  
i've heard from a number of contactees who say  that they just don't need much sleep at any rate  
gary feels that his out of body experiences and  ufo experiences are somehow related and i agree  
i know many contactees who are also having  experiences with astral travel so at any rate  
this went on for a number of years from age  5 to 10 at least but at some point did stop  
as a teenager gary uh often stayed away from  home he enjoyed going to the zoo he had a real  
affinity with animals as many contactees  do but as soon as he reached legal age he  
got out of that house out of that abusive  situation and started living on his own  
at that point he immediately started thriving  he made a number of really good friends he met a  
girlfriend a lady who he would soon marry he got a  job and things were going great right off the bat  
but he was about 19 years old when he had a very  scary experience at that time he was an avid biker  
and he had had a few accidents woke up  in the hospital and one evening he woke  
up and he thought he was in a hospital but  he wasn't because there he saw this gray  
e.t hovering over him he had no idea what  it was he'd never read anything about ufos  
had no reference point to it but he knew that it  wasn't human as gary says and i quote i remember  
the first time vividly like it was yesterday i  woke up a little disoriented it was dark my eyes  
adjusted to the light overhead and as i started to  get my bearings i realized something wasn't right  
i was lying on an operating table the surface  was cold and hard and i was in real pain at  
this point he saw this gray e.t hovering over him  and it held a very large needle and was several  
inches long and proceeded to place this needle  into gary's temple causing intense pain gary  
protested he screamed he began cursing stop it  stop it you're hurting me but this gray e.t showed  
little compassion and just carried on without  any concern over gary's well-being as gary says  
like a vet ignoring a yelping dog it carried  on regardless never acknowledging me once it  
had a job to do and that's what it was doing as it  continued to insert the needle deep into my temple  
i passed out and that is all i remember  the next morning i woke up a little tired  
and disoriented with a bad headache i got up  went to the toilet and looked in the mirror  
to my horror there was a red mark a wound on my  left temple i didn't know what to think i was  
horrified terrified this was such a traumatic  experience for gary that he didn't tell anybody  
he barely acknowledged it to himself he pushed  it to the back of his mind and refused to think  
about it because he couldn't explain it  the idea of aliens was something very new  
to him again he's never read anything about  ufos or aliens and he wasn't about to start  
he just didn't want to think about it he told  nobody it became his own very private dark secret  
and he just would not think about it shortly later  he got married he found a job at a warehouse he he  
had a son and things were going great but it was  not long after this first incident when he had  
another very strange experience at the time gary  lived in a two-story house and he had to go down  
the stairs to reach the bathroom which was on the  far side of the kitchen and this was something he  
had to do a couple of times a night because he  had had an accident as a child and he needed  
to go to the bathroom several times during the  evening and so he woke up and decided he needed  
to go and walks down the stairs and to his shock  he saw a figure in his living room it was very  
short bald head large dark wraparound eyes it was  a gray e.t he had pushed his childhood experiences  
onto the back of his mind as well as this other  experience where he had been on board a ufo so  
this was a real shock to him he saw this gray e.t  and it had its head bent down and it looked like  
it was almost praying or something but he didn't  quite realize what he was looking at as gary says  
i recoiled back i was shocked i had no clue  what the hell it was or what it was doing there  
you have to remember i lived in a very rural  part of the country things like this don't  
happen to people like me in places like this and  that is all i remember about that as i passed out  
i barely had time to take a breath i  truly have no idea what happened to me  
or where it took me after i passed  out when i woke up i was back in bed  
so again gary did not talk about it he didn't tell  his wife he just pushed it to the back of his mind  
and refused to think about it but it was only  two maybe three weeks later when he had another  
very strange experience he was lying in bed  uh when he kind of felt something in the room  
so he had to blanket over his face at the time  he pushed the blanket away from his face and got  
a real shock there was a woman a female staring  at him only inches away for a second he thought  
it might be his wife but he realized instantly  that his wife was still lying in bed next to   him at this point he jumped up and screamed as  this lady floated up to the ceiling and threw  
the ceiling and out of the house as gary says i  shot up in bed i truly thought i was going to be  
robbed or murdered i shot up shouting surprisingly  the woman jumped as much as i did she stood back  
and quickly floated up and through the roof gary  looked up at the roof and you could see this weird  
swirling pattern where the lady had disappeared  through by this point his wife was awake and was  
asking him what's going on what's wrong and  he pointed to the ceiling and said look look  
she looked up but this by this time the ceiling  had returned back to normal and he said i think i  
saw a ghost i don't know it was very strange this  lady was very attractive she looked uh very young  
but was wearing this weird suit uh this sort  of tan not a jumpsuit but very similar to it  
it had no wrinkles on it  it looked almost brand new   and he was just very puzzled by this experience  and decided it must have been a ghost uh he was  
very rattled by it so he and his wife got out of  bed even though it was the middle of the night   and went downstairs made a pot of tea and talked  about it they decided it must be a ghost but it  
was only two again maybe three weeks later that  it happened again gary woke up and uh was shocked  
to see that there was this woman or a very similar  looking woman this time she wasn't staring at him  
she was staring at his wife again from inches away  just staring at her even though she was asleep  
gary shot up and stood on his bed at the foot  of his bed and looked at her for just a few  
moments he was completely shocked i had no idea  who this woman was and after just a few moments he  
reached out and touched her shoulder put his hand  on his shoulder and said hello what's your name  
and the woman completely freaked  out as he says she nearly s-h-i-t  
shite herself is what he said uh  she reached out both her hands  
on put them on gary's chest and pushed him down  onto the floor then quickly levitated up and  
flew through the ceiling gary of course screamed  and gary's wife woke up and said what's the matter  
and gary explained what happened said this woman  came back again i think i saw this ghost again  
only this time he wasn't really convinced it  was a ghost because she had actually pushed him  
over this was very upsetting to him his wife  was very supportive but also very confused  
and he had no idea what to think of it or  who this lady could be or what was going on  
interestingly it was just either that morning  or a few days later they were listening to   the television news when a television reporter  came on and started talking about people who  
were being abducted by aliens and he described  the aliens as looking like pamela anderson the  
television actress the very attractive television  actress and that really threw gary for a loop  
because she had to admit that the figure  he saw was a very attractive young woman  
and he wondered huh could she be an alien he  had never thought of ets as looking like people  
but again he knew nothing about this subject he'd  never read any books on this had never looked into  
it at all and i really didn't know what to think  about what was happening to him so once again he  
just sort of pushed the subject into the back of  his mind and refused to think about it but this  
became increasingly difficult for him because  he was still having experiences it was about  
one year after this that he woke up and he was  on board a ufo and this time there was a gray e.t  
sitting or standing there in front of him and it  was talking to him and it asked him what do you  
want to do with your life this was not a scary  experience gary says it was very much like just  
going to visit a doctor or something and he was  having a pleasant conversation with this gray e.t  
and he was pretty thrown by the question  he didn't know how to answer it so he just   kind of made a jokey answer um the gray didn't  laugh or anything did not seem to be amused and  
that's really all he remembers about that but he's  pretty certain he was on board a ufo it was very  
bright uh he couldn't see any lights but the  walls themselves were glowing it was very clean  
and this gray e.t was very much like the  one he had seen before so at this point he  
pretty much knows what's happening to him but  he just doesn't want to think about it he didn't  
tell his wife he didn't tell his friends he told  nobody and again just tried not to think about it  
but it was not long or long after that that once  again he woke up in the middle of the night and  
he was not in his bedroom he was on board a ufo  and in fact he was in a very strange situation it  
was very unpleasant for him he woke up and found  himself inside this large tank filled with liquid  
he was able to breathe in this tank even  though he was entirely submerged with liquid  
and even more upsetting was his wife was right  next to him and she was very upset they were both  
awake both fully conscious and breathing this  liquid and she was very frightened and kept asking  
them you know what's going on what's going on are  they going to hurt us because there were gray et's  
standing up on this sort of ledge this sort  of railing looking down at them as they were  
submerged in this tank and he did his best  to assure her that everything was going to  
be fine that they wouldn't be hurt though  he himself was not at all certain about this  
he did not know what was going on it was all  very disorienting for him for both of them and  
another weird thing that really concerned him  was he didn't only see gray ets he also saw what  
looked like military personnel watching over him  so yeah this was a very upsetting experience for  
gary as he says and i quote i can't put into words  how i felt i realized my wife was with me we were  
both naked and huddled together like two trapped  animals in the corner of a cage she was awake also  
and terrified we were in some sort of clear liquid  as clear as water but we could breathe in it  
there was nothing around us and it was a very  large tank several feet deep with clear sides  
all around and as we looked up we could see  gray aliens on a walkway to the right about five  
feet above us just staring down and observing us  there were three tall ones and two short ones and  
even more upsetting were these two human looking  figures uh they looked very much like government  
personnel to gary like cia agents or something  they were just coldly observing the whole incident  
and taking down notes on what looked like some  sort of a pad or electronic device of some sort  
and showed no emotion showed no compassion about  what was happening to gary and his wife the next  
morning gary remembered all of this perfectly and  his wife did not seem to remember he asked a few  
questions about how was your night you know did  you dream anything and she so showed no sign of  
remembering anything so he did not tell her and  again just filed this experience in the back of  
his mind and did his best not to think about it  this was the only way he could really cope with  
this at this point so the experiences just kept  happening one after another it was around this  
time 1994 that he was outside his home when he  saw a huge absolutely gigantic cigar-shaped object  
move over his home it was much much larger than  his house itself and it was very low treetop level  
scary says it went slowly over our house it was  only a few hundred feet up and is the biggest  
movable object i have ever seen in my life it  blotted out the winter sky and never made a sound  
and that turned out to be his last encounter  or so he thought because following that  
all these weird events just stopped he had no  other memories of waking up on board a ufo or  
seeing grays in his bedroom or in his living room  or anything like this all these et experiences  
just stopped they still had paranormal experiences  gary still had a lot of out-of-body experiences  
which were actually becoming more extensive  he found himself not only flying around his   neighborhood and his home but going up into outer  space visiting the moon and even slipping off into  
other dimensions which he found very hard to  describe but these were pretty much normal for him  
and another thing that they both experienced  were premonitions this happened quite often  
that they would have premonitions of little things  or disasters or all kinds of events in their life  
this was much more pronounced for gary's wife  than it was for him actually she often had  
premonitions of things that would occur  and was apparently very very psychic and  
gary as well though to a lesser degree so for  many many years that was all they experienced  
and he thought that ets were gone from his life uh  but at some point they came back it was about 22  
years later in the year 2016 they decided to move  out of cumbria to the city of carlisle this is a  
fairly large city it's a picturesque city with a  rich cultural history stretching back hundreds of  
years it's got a strong military presence they  moved into a small village outside of the city  
found a home on a cul-de-sac which was perfect  for their little family and they had no sooner  
moved all their stuff and settled in when the et's  came roaring back into their life big time and how  
it all started was gary woke up one evening  and felt the covers being pulled off his bed  
his eyes snapped open and he looked around him  and there was nothing in his room but something  
or someone was pulling the covers off his  bed and as soon as the blanket came off  
gary found himself floating upwards levitating  he was unable to move he couldn't stop it  
and suddenly he was just whooshed went right  out through the window and up into the sky  
and that's all he remembers this was an entirely  physical experience not an out-of-body experience  
he's absolutely convinced he was fully conscious  and fully awake and it wasn't long before it  
happened again this started happening every  couple of weeks or so over and over again and he  
knew what was happening he was pretty sure he was  being abducted by aliens but again he didn't know  
how to handle it who to turn to what to think so  he just dealt with it by not thinking about it  
denying it and he didn't tell anybody but it  wasn't long after this or actually it's while this  
was occurring that he had one of these  strangest experiences of his entire life  
he woke up and he was on board a ufo um he could  tell instantly because the walls were rounded  
it was very well lit and what was really  strange is there was a woman on top of him  
he had no clothes on and neither did she  and they were having intimate relations  
and this really shocked him he had no idea who  this woman was she was very attractive looked  
maybe 19 or 20 years old and as soon as she  realized he was awake she immediately got off  
of him and sat down next to him and they started  talking and he's like what's going on you know  
he started cursing he's like oh my god oh my god  and she said just calm down calm down everything's  
okay you're not going to be hurt you're fine  you're fine and he had the impression that  
this was absolutely a totally human woman but that  she had lived her entire life on board this craft  
and she was super excited to talk to him because  he had the impression that this was something that  
had never happened before that she had never had  the opportunity to talk to anyone and she seemed  
very interested in him and they were just starting  you know he had just settled down and was getting  
his bearings uh look and looking around him  and she kept trying to stop him from looking  
behind him uh two in front of him he could see a  open sort of doorway that and there was a corridor  
and to his uh incredible shock he saw two  gray ets walking by they appeared to be very  
absorbed in their own conversation uh he was  so shocked he actually let out a curse word  
and the female he was with said you know be quiet  be quiet don't say anything just ignore them and  
they won't bother you and so gary uh  calmed down and started to look around him  
and he wanted to look behind him and this  woman said no no don't look don't look   but he turned around behind him and looked and  got an incredible shock he absolutely could not  
believe what he saw as he says though i only saw  behind me for a few moments i remember what i  
saw vividly the place we were in was enormous  more of a small warehouse than a large room  
and everywhere you looked the floor was filled  with bodies some lying still others writhing about  
in pleasure both men and women the feeling i got  was i really really wasn't supposed to see this  
uh he had the impression you know that these  people were being intimate with each other uh  
he's not sure how many people there were  there had to be at least 50 possibly as  
many as a hundred it was a very very large room  and this upset him pretty bad at this point the  
woman grabbed his hand and quickly led him to  another opening that he hadn't noticed at first  
and pulled him into this tiny little room  which was longer than it was wide it had  
little weird-looking sinks in there and  what appeared to be some sort of toilet   and she tried to calm him down and just tell him  that everything's all right everything's all right  
and so he started asking her questions and he  asked her why are you doing this and she got  
kind of a sad look on her face and said i'm not  allowed to tell you and he started peppering  
her with questions asking her all these  different things and she refused to answer  
any of his questions just evaded every single  question he asked and he was only there for a  
few more moments before he blacked out and  the next thing he knew he was back in bed  
so this was a very upsetting experience for him uh  even though it really wasn't you know painful or  
anything i was quite disconcerting especially  seeing so many people on board this craft  
doing what looked like reproductive  type behaviors or experiments  
so he wasn't quite sure what to make of it but  it certainly gave him the impression that a lot   more people are being taken than most people  realize so more experiences came after that  
during this time he and his wife were experiencing  all kinds of paranormal activity in their home  
they had doors opening and closing lights  turning on and off they heard weird footsteps  
they had two dogs had several pets gary loved  animals but they had this apparition of a dog  
that kept going through their house many weird  experiences he saw a weird sort of apparition of  
this spiral-like creature saw all kinds of weird  shadow people his wife saw a apparition of a lady  
dressed in old-fashioned clothes probably the  scariest experience was something that happened  
at least uh three or four times which  involved this very large lizard-like creature  
which would scuttle across his wall he says it was  two or three feet long and looked very much like a  
giant lizard with a dragon like face and he had  the impression it might be some sort of demonic  
creature or something at any rate he didn't like  it was very scary and he wasn't sure what to make  
of all this paranormal activity i mean  once they came downstairs and all the  
burners on their stove had been turned on it's  very strange and inexplicable and they had no idea  
what was causing this activity or what was  going on but it was a lot for them to take  
in 2016 he had another encounter and this  one was very strange he had woken up with  
the need to go to the bathroom and again this  this was a two-story house and he had to go  
downstairs to get to the bathroom and had walked  downstairs and to his shock there was a gray e.t  
but this time instead of being surprised  and just standing there doing nothing  
he reacted very quickly and ran up to this grey  alien and wrapped his hands around its neck and  
started choking it as gary says and i'm quoting  i grabbed it by the throat in a single moment a  
thousand thoughts went through my head i remember  thinking how surreal i've got some creature from  
another world by the throat what the hell do i do  now it's skin felt cold firm and leathery it was a  
split second because then its spindly little arms  were spinning around like windmills desperately  
trying to get rid of me it was screaming in my  head get off of me get off of me get off of me now  
at that point something approached him from the  high behind and sort of banged him on the head and  
he blacked out and the next thing he remembered he  was back in bed so again he has no idea if he was  
abducted or what happened but he was absolutely  certain he was awake and he had choked this gray  
e.t not the first person i've talked to who has  reacted violently to the appearance of a gray  
in their home so at this point gary could  feel them coming there would be a weird energy  
in the room and often he would be paralyzed but  even that started to wear off he could feel them  
coming and they were no longer able to paralyze  him so he wasn't sure why that was the case but he  
could absolutely sometimes feel them coming uh one  time he could feel them coming woke up and to his  
shock a grey et was pulling his wife out of bed  she was standing up the grays were surrounding her  
and he was really mad it's one thing for him to  be taken but it's quite another for them to take  
his wife and he was pretty upset and tried to stop  them at which point they said just go to sleep go  
to sleep and he tried to wake up but was unable to  he felt himself being pushed into unconsciousness  
and he fell asleep when he woke up the next  morning he remembered this but again his wife  
had no memory so still he was keeping all of  this secret and did not want to talk about it  
and the experiences continued in 2018 he  had another very very unusual experience  
he woke up and he was on board a very very small  craft it was just this tiny little round room it  
was mostly transparent and looking out uh he could  see that they were flying over this landscape  
there were two greys sitting in little seats in  front of him they had their backs to turn to him  
and were operating this console apparently flying  this tiny little two-seater craft he was standing  
up behind them and became fully conscious and  he was so shocked he didn't say anything he  
just kind of looked around and enjoyed the view  as they were flying over this sort of desert  
landscape which reminded him of perhaps the mojave  desert or he wasn't sure really where it was  
but he just stood there and watched  this for about 10 minutes maybe 15  
until he became curious it was clear that  the grays had no idea that he had become  
fully conscious so after about 10 minutes he  decided he was going to take some action and he  
blurted out quite loudly and out loud all right  lads and uh their reaction was instantaneous  
and actually really quite amusing to  him as he says and i quote the shock  
it caused them was instant and amazing it's the  only time i've ever seen one lose their cool  
in any way at all they literally freaked one of  them in particular the one sitting to the right  
i got the distinct feeling it was very  young or immature it got out of its seat  
and proceeded to run wildly back and forth  from left to right in the small space between  
us it just wanted out of there to get away i stood  there watching this thing and thinking talk about  
role reversal this thing was seriously freaking  out and i couldn't help myself i started to laugh  
so gary talked out loud and said it's okay it's  okay don't worry i am not going to hurt you  
this one young grey continued to freak out and  the other one remained silent and unmoving so gary  
repeated himself he said it's okay it's okay don't  worry i'm not going to hurt hurt you everything's  
fine and the grey that was sitting down and  apparently flying this craft uh replied nervously  
okay but please just stay where you are please  just stay where you are gary had stopped laughing  
at this point but he was still very amused and  he said don't worry i will i will don't worry and  
they continued to fly for a short distance and  then stopped the craft apparently over near  
his home and at that point they both got up out  of their seats and approached him and told him  
that this had never happened to them before nobody  had ever woken up while they were returning them  
back to their home and gary started asking  them questions he asked them why do you  
do this to people and gary got a very strong  impression of sadness and one of them replied
we are not allowed to tell you and uh then gary asked them can  you let me remember being taken  
and again gary felt this wave of sadness  coming from them and they said no we can't  
we're not allowed and gary said well who am  i going to tell who would believe me anyway  
they made no response and that was all gary really  remembered the next thing he knew he was back in  
bed and he woke up and had no memory of this event  at first it was about midday when it suddenly just  
he remembered this memory came sliding back into  his head he started laughing at the absurdity of  
it and the memory of these these greys freaking  out and uh it was really quite an amusing event  
for him and it was a few days after that that  he remembered more he remembered that this ufo  
had actually come out of some sort of underground  base and then flew across this desert area which  
he believes is uh perhaps in the united states  he's not sure he just had that impression that  
it was like the mojave desert area that this kind  of uh desert area and uh that's all he recalled  
and this was perhaps the most pleasant and amusing  experience that he had had with these gray ets but  
overall most of his experiences have not  been pleasant and it was a few months  
later uh actually in 2018 that he again felt their  presence he could feel the energy of them coming  
and this energy increasing and got stronger and  stronger until he was quite certain that they were  
in the room so he waited until he was sure that  they were standing next to the bed and this is  
when he took action as he says and i quote i  waited until it had pulled the covers right back  
and i punched it in the face and i can tell you  now they may look small and cute to some people  
sometimes but this thing suddenly changed it  was furious it hissed loudly and lunged for me  
its face changed suddenly it looked nothing like a  gray it looked like something completely different  
its small narrow mouth went from a tiny slit  to a wide gaping thing with spiky teeth it was  
something that in all intent and purposes seems to  try to come across as innocent frail and harmless  
but in fact has the teeth of a predator for  gripping shredding and ripping and when i punched  
it it was like its mask slipped for a moment  revealing its true identity i shot up in bed i  
thought i was going to die i threw my fist right  back i was going to punch it through the wall  
i thought i was fighting for my life at this point  he passed out he wasn't able to punch it again  
but this was yeah the second time  at that he reacted very violently  
towards these gray et's who were appearing in his  home and that was interesting that he described  
uh short spiky teeth because this is  something i have heard from other abductees so  
that in a way for me at least was verification  that his experience was real and yeah this was  
very hard for gary to talk about uh he wasn't  very forthcoming at first but only after he got  
more comfortable with me did he start sharing  more and more of what was happening to him  
and i was interviewing him actually  as these experiences were ongoing  
so this was a very active case a very active  investigation and this same sort of thing  
happened again a few months later he woke up he  could feel them in the room and he was getting  
ready to lash out he was going to kick them this  time but this time they were ready as soon as  
they pulled off the covers they immediately  knocked him out before he could kick them  
so he they came prepared this time for his fear  and his violent tendencies to attacking them  
so more weird expan experiences happened  in the next year in 2019 he woke up to go  
to the bathroom and uh was in the bathroom  when about 10 maybe 20 little orbs of light  
came swarming into the room and swirling  around him and he was very shocked and  
slowly backed out of the bathroom  and returned to his bedroom and  
again tried to ignore what was happening to  him and forget about it at this point it wasn't  
possible these experiences were so numerous  that he was constantly thinking about them  
he still didn't want to read about ufos the  whole subject made him very uncomfortable  
and he just doesn't want to talk about it but his  experiences continued it was a few months later  
that he was in his bedroom when suddenly this  bright bright light came shining in through   the window he thought at first it might be a car  even though he knew it wasn't because his bedroom  
did not face the street it was impossible  for light to come in that brightly and as  
he's watching suddenly this huge orb of light  the size of maybe a grapefruit comes into the  
window and it's very bright lights up the whole  room and suddenly it lets out this really bright  
flash of light there's a loud bang and he's  knocked unconscious he feels like they probably  
did it that way because he was in their bad  books for sort of attacking them the way he did
so gary is not happy about his experiences he  thinks that abductions are probably much more  
common than people realize in fact he thinks  perhaps they're very widespread as he says  
and i quote i honestly think nearly everybody is  abducted it's like a cattle market the difference  
is most people simply have no idea don't remember  and never will it's just the odd unlucky person  
or lucky i suppose depending on your outlook like  myself that occasionally does for whatever reason  
we are simply no more than lab rats to these  things i've spent most of my life trying to  
block all of this out i think that's  what they want you to do the tossers  
but now i've gotten through that mental  block the genie is out of the bottle so  
yeah it hasn't been pleasant for him he had  another experience around this time where he  
woke up on board this craft and again the  same tall gray et was piercing his temple  
with a needle it was very painful and  again the gray seemed to show no compassion  
another time his son his young son woke up and  there was all these scars all over his back  
that freaked them out they healed very quickly  but they had no idea where these scars came from  
gary kind of knew that had probably had something  to do with et's and now it was not only affecting  
his wife it was affecting his whole family  and this is when he decided to tell them  
he said it would be much easier if he was  diagnosed with schizophrenia or something  
or he said it would have been easier to admit to  being a serial killer than telling his family or  
his wife did not tell his son what was going on  with him in fact he got himself really drunk and  
that's when he told his wife that he  thought he was being abducted by aliens   and he spilled out pretty much the whole story  there was a few encounters that he was just too  
embarrassed to talk about to her and she was to  her credit very supportive and she knew he wasn't  
the type of person to lie she could see he was  totally serious he was very emotional about it and  
he came clean and uh yeah she was absolutely 100  supportive and gary was felt like a weight had  
been taken off his chest and uh was not  long after that he told his best friend  
what was going on and his friend had heard of  ufos and abductions and was also very supportive  
so for the first time gary felt a huge sense of  relief and uh he also spoke with me and shared  
all his encounters he felt it was important that  people know this is going on and he thinks yeah  
a lot of people if not everybody on earth is being  abducted it's just that most people don't remember  
and uh he does not like the grays he feels like  they do not treat him kindly and that he's being  
used and uh is not happy about these experiences  so that's kind of why i wanted to do this video to  
you know let people know that there's a  wide variety of experiences that people have  
i told gary's whole story in my  recent book on board ufo encounters  
it's one of the longer cases in this book  and i think was really important for people  
to know about and uh gary's experiences are  still ongoing uh unless i've talked with him  
he's still having experiences he saw another  ufo over his home he's still being pulled out  
levitated out of his bedroom and presumably  into a craft he doesn't remember most of  
the time what's going on in these situations  but yeah this case is still ongoing  
and my heart goes out to gary and uh i  certainly hope his relationship with the grays  
improves but at this point it's not something he  would wish upon anybody and that's the story of  
gary versus the grace i want to thank you  very much for watching and listening i really  
appreciate your support and uh just want to thank  you again and until next time keep having fun
