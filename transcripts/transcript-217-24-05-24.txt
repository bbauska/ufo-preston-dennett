Summary:
May 24, 2024
Can you imagine being taken onboard a craft and meeting extraterrestrials face-to-face? It is perhaps the ultimate encounter. This video presents five astonishing cases of people taken onboard an ET craft. While each of these cases does involve a single witness, every one of them was recalled consciously without hypnosis. And every one of them includes compelling evidence pointing to the reality of the encounter. They come from all over the world, and provide a close-up look at what it’s like to meet aliens face-to-face. They also answer many of the questions surrounding ET contact and their agenda on planet Earth.

THE CASE OF WARABE AMANAKA. It was a summer evening in 1926 when 2-year-old Warabe Amanaka heard a telepathic voice calling him outside. Venturing outside his home in Matsuyama, Japan, he was greeted by a tall, blond-haired human-looking figure who promised to meet him again. Over the next three years, the man (who Warabe called Uncle) appeared several times. Then on Aug 2, 1930, Warabe (age 5) heard the familiar telepathic voice and met Uncle again. This time, Warabe was taken onboard a craft, and given a ride around the planet, viewing whales in the ocean, elephants in Africa and the Great Pyramids of Egypt. After being dropped back home, the ETs promised to visit him again. During one of his visits, the ETs gave Warabe a strange metal box. It’s one of Japan’s strangest cases on record.

THE CASE OF NICHOLAS HENRY EDWARDS. In Jul 1952, at age nine, Nicholas Edwards was outside his home near Point Defiance Park in Washington State, when he saw a UFO and then found himself in a strange room surrounded by little aliens. Shortly later, he and his entire family had a close up sighting of a UFO. But it wasn’t until November 15, 1959 that Nick (now 16) recalled a lengthy and complicated onboard encounter. While driving with two friends in California, a UFO pulled their car onboard. Nick’s two friends fell unconscious, but Nick remained awake as small human-like ETs with large dark eyes and pale skin pulled him from the car and took him to another room. The ETs were kind and gentle as they put him on a table and examined him with strange instruments. The encounter changed his life forever.

THE CASE OF KLAUS-DIETER KAUFMANN. At 8:30 pm one night in the Spring of 1960, 14-year-old Klaus-Dieter Kaufmann walked to his home in Frankfurt, Germany. Suddenly a Saturn-shaped craft hovered overhead. A beam of light came down, struck him, and rendered him unconscious. He woke up a few hours later. Terrified, he ran home and found a strange mark on his back. Years later, as an adult, he went to have surgery and the doctor told him that it looked like he had already had surgery on his back. Klaus-Dieter recalled his missing time encounter with the UFO, and began to remember what happened. He recalled going onboard the craft, meeting different kinds of humanoids, who gave him a strange exam. Although frightened, one of the ETs comforted him and explained that he would be returned home shortly.

THE CASE OF GILBERTO GREGORIO COCCIOLI. At 3am on Oct 4, 1972, Gilberto Coccioli (age 50) stepped outside his home in Burzaco, Argentina to check on his dog. Without warning, he was struck by a beam of light and pulled onboard a craft hovering overhead. Inside, he was confronted by 7-foot-tall humanoids who placed him on a circular bench, and examined him. He saw many things beyond his comprehension. Two other women were onboard and had intimate relations with him. He saw a small pile of stones and convinced the ETs to give him one. Then he was placed back on the ground, with the stone in his hand. His dog was badly traumatized. The stone turned out to be earthly iron pyrite. Gilberto remained in contact with the ETs, who began to teach him science, philosophy, and spirituality.

THE CASE OF ISTVAN BALOGH. On the night of Dec 26, 1991, Istvan Balogh (a 21-year-old border guard) returned home to find a flying saucer hovering over his backyard in Bekes, Hungary. A week prior to this, he had heard a strange telepathic message, repeating, “You will meet us.” He was unable to resist as he was pulled onboard the craft where he was greeted by short humanoids, four feet tall with greenish skin, large eyes, and three fingers on each hand. They told him that they had watched him for three years and would take him on a trip. He recalls seeing the moon and other strange sights before being returned to his yard. He told his superiors what happened to him and was promptly fired. A psychiatric exam showed him to be a normal, but a physical exam showed that a metal rod which had been placed after breaking his arm, was now missing.

These 5 cases show that people all over the world are being taken onboard UFOs and that it has been happening for a long time. This kind of experience is far more common than most people believe. The evidence speaks for itself: we are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal today's episode
is called meeting the aliens five onboard UFO encounters I think the
onboard UFO encounter is probably the ultimate type of UFO encounter certainly
more extensive than a simple sighting or Close Encounter of the second or third kind I mean meeting a humanoid face to
face is certainly one thing but being Tak on board is quite another these are
really such Close Encounters that it removes any chance of misperception
whatsoever you are literally surrounded by the UFO phenomenon it's something you
hear taste smell feel uses all your senses and these are the cases of course
with the most data that have the most to tell us about what it's like to have contact who the ETS are why they're here
where they come from and all the many questions surrounding UFO contact so
yeah I love love love these cases most of all and I've chosen five today that I
think you probably haven't heard before they're really quite obscure most of
them and super interesting now what's interesting about these cases is they reach all the way
back to the 1930s the earliest case and the latest is
1991 so quite a long period of time time here these cases do come from all over
the world I've chosen a case from Japan one from the United States one from
Germany one from Hungary and one from Argentina so quite a large geographical
spread there now the vast majority of these four are single witness cases was
one does involve multiple Witnesses though the other Witnesses do not recall being taken on board and I will say that
some of these do have peripheral Witnesses is and that there were people in the area who saw UFOs at the time the
person the main witness was taken on board and pretty much all of them involve one form of evidence or another
to help support their case and all were professionally researched as well by
experienced investigators which always adds another level of credibility to
them what I find most interesting about all five of these cases is that not one
of them involves the use of regressive hypnosis I do think hypnosis works when
done correctly I think the cases recall under hypnosis show this because they
match pretty much exactly what people consciously recall but just avoiding any
explanations of oh this is hypnosis this is false memory syndrome they made this up nope you cannot say that in these
cases because these are all recalled fully consciously and
yeah there's evidence as well I think these cases have lots of insight to them
lots to say about what it's like to have contact and they're just super
interesting because they are really the ultimate type of UFO
encounter so the first case I'd like to talk about today I call the case of Wabi
amanaka this case took place in Matsuyama Japan all the way back on
August 2nd 1930 this is a very unusual case uh it's
a bit different than most but there are some elements to it that certainly match up with other cases it does have some
really interesting evidence to it but the whole account is just a fascinating series of events which I think you'll
find quite interesting this astonishing and very early onboard UFO encounter
comes from Japanese researcher hachiro Kubota the witness is warabi amanaka
though this is a pseudonym like many contactees he had a series of contacts
while a very young boy in fact while Robbie's First unusual experience
occurred on a warm summer evening in 1926 when he was just 2 years old he was
in bed in his home in Matsuyama when he felt a sudden and strange feeling of
goodness overwhelming him and he heard someone calling out to him mentally come
out my boy it may sound unusual that he remembers all the way back to 2 years old but this is something many
contactees do report at any rate what Robbie says he went outside where he was
greeted by a 6 and 1/2t Tall youngl looking human-looking Caucasian man with
shortcut golden hair and wearing a white robe and white shoes he had very large
eyes very smooth hairless skin he was very friendly he smiled gently and spoke
in Japanese told warabi let me hold you boy then they proceeded to take a short
walk around the house now while Robbie says he felt no fear the man was very warm very caring
and that was basically it but the next summer it happened again this Friendly Stranger appeared once more beckoning to
warabi using mental telepathy to come outside and greet him the meeting was
entirely friendly and it happened again the next year and the next and in fact
from 1926 to 1929 there were a total of at least three
meetings while Robbie called this gentleman Uncle as he didn't know his name but on a few occasions this man
uncle gave warabi gifts once he gave him a bicycle during another visit he actually gave
Wabi a small metallic box which you can see here with a carving on the top The
Carving as you see has a triangle in the middle two small snakes rising up on
either side of the triangle all of it surrounded by this rectangle with a series of vertical lines and a sort of
Sunburst surrounding it so this is a physical artifact which as far as I know
has not been tested in any way at any rate all of this appeared to be in
preparation for a major onboard experience because it was on the evening
of August 2nd 1930 that will Robbie now 5 years old was just beginning to fall
asleep when he heard the familiar telepathic message come out my boy so
while Robbie very much enjoyed these visits and eagerly went out to meet uncle again and uncle said come along
with me boy warabi said all right and together they walked away from the house
out into a large field and to rabi's surprise there was a very large craft
sitting in the field now it was pretty dark so he didn't get a great look at
what it appeared to be he didn't see much detail but he estimates that this object was about 120 ft across and as he
watched a door opened and Uncle went inside and W rabi followed once inside
the craft the witness saw five other tall men very similar in appearance to Uncle one was slightly shorter and wore
a light brown jumpsuit with a wide belt and brown shoes this man had long blonde
hair and looked to Wabi Japanese now everyone gave him a
friendly greeting while Robbie himself was given a long white robe with no sleeves and white s sandals similar to
what the others wore after he put this on he was put into a little seat and strapped down
with what appears to be a kind of seat belt according to Wabi this room was
quite spacious it had large elliptical Windows milky white walls floor and
ceiling all of it was the same color he said it was dimly illuminated so he couldn't see many details about the room
but he did see a 6t wide Central column which looked almost translucent I found
this detail particularly interesting because this is something many many contactees do describe a central column
in the craft then at this point Uncle told the witness quote we are going to take you
wherever you want to go so needless to say this delighted 5-year-old warabi and
he said I want to see elephants and whales and uncle said all right we will
go to where the elephants and whales are and the next thing the witness knew the
craft was taking off quite quickly silently he could tell because looking outside he was amazed to see dark space
he didn't feel any actual movement but after a few moments he was surprised to see the sun coming up over the horizon
and he could see that they were very high up in the atmosphere they flew for what seemed to him almost an hour over
the ocean when suddenly Uncle told him boy some whales are swimming look down
at them so wabie got up from the chair and looked out through the port holes
looking down and because they were so high up the whales looked very small to him and he was disappointed and he told
Uncle I thought whales were very big but now they are rather small I want to see
big ones and uncle said okay we are going down a little more at this point
the craft dropped down and W Robi became very excited because now he could see
these whales close up and they were huge and as he said wow how big they are
great so Uncle looked down at him with a very pleasant smile and they watched the
whales for a little while and then the craft took off again over a vast desert
area this time and well Robbie was delighted to see this grassy plane and a
crowd of elephants stomping around and raising clouds of dust but again he was
a little disappointed to see that they were very small and off in the distance and he said Uncle I want to see bigger
elephants at which point Uncle replied all right we are going down a little
more at this point the craft descended slowly and while Robbie was delighted to
get a close-up view of these elephants who were stomping around swinging their trunks flapping their ears uh he noticed
that some appeared to see the craft and were looking up directly at it uh later
in life he believed that this was probably Africa somewhere in
Africa now while he was on the craft doing all this he was given on a few
occasions cold sweet juice to drink and then without any prompting the
craft suddenly took off again looking out the windows while while Robbie was amazed at what he saw he saw pyramids
which he later recognized as the pyramids of Egypt and in fact the craft landed on a hill which he estimates was
about 150 ft High not far away from the pyramids giving them a very close up
view of them now many many years later as an adult he went and visited the
pyramids of Egypt with his wife and recognized the very Hill where the craft
had landed on when he was just a little boy so the entire onboard experience was
very benevolent just all about going and showing him all these different sites
and it took up pretty much the entire night he estimates because the next thing he knew the craft returned to his
home in Matsuyama and as W Robie was about to exit the craft Uncle told him something
very interesting which didn't make any sense to him at the time but uncle said
my boy your father father is Abraham you are Abraham's son you must bear it well
in your mind so yeah this really didn't make a whole lot of sense to him but he never forgot it at this point Uncle LED
warabi back to his home Robbie rushed inside and saw that it was now 5
a.m. and boy did he surprise his family because it turned out his parents his
entire family and really the entire neighborhood was frantic with worry
because they had discovered that well Robbie was missing early that evening and they couldn't find him even
searching the whole neighborhood they could not find him so now he appears in the house while Robbie's father is
furious and asked him angry where have you been well Robbie very honestly
related his amazing adventure but to his disappointment nobody believed him and
from that point on he became labeled as something of a liar and a Sleepwalker so he learned very early on
it's probably a good idea to keep your experiences secret now one year later August 2nd
1931 he was laying in bed when he heard that familiar telepathic call from Uncle
he ran outside was greeted by uncle and led to the same field where this same
craft rested in the same spot and uncle said my boy where do you want to
go now what Robbie was now 6 years old he was about to go to school for the first time so he was very interested in
that and said I want to fly to my Elementary School uncle said all right
we will fly there so they went inside the school was less than a mile away
from Robb's home so the saucer rose up and went to the school circled around it
several times for about 15 minutes and then while Robbie was returned home
Uncle promised that they would there would be future visits but alas this was not to
be this turned out to be W Robbie's last and final onboard
encounter however in confirmation of the August 2nd encounter there was in fact
another witness it turned out that 16-year-old toshio Fujita a resident of
Matsuyama told researcher hachiro Kubota that on that night he saw a large
elliptical object flying over the village around the time of w Robbie's
encounter so yeah as many experiencers do while Robi kept his encounter secret
for much of his life finally speaking out with researcher hairo Kubota at age
61 but this encounter affected him profoundly for the rest of his life he
became a scientist and spent the remainder of his life in his hometown of Matsuyama hoping that one day his
friends from space would return he became an impassioned environmentalist and really enjoyed
nature I think you'll agree that is a very unusual encounter and I certainly don't blame the witness for not stepping
forward for decades especially considering the climate uh surrounding
this subject can be quite hostile at times but again he does have some peripheral corroborating Witnesses some
apparent physical evidence much of what he describes is described by other
contactees and again it was researched by an experienced
investigator so I think it's an important case that's why I included it and it's certainly not
welln now here's the next case I'd like to cover today which is very interesting
for a number of reasons uh contact is rarely a singular event and we see that in these cases and
is certainly in this one which I call the case of Nicholas Henry
Edwards like many witnesses he kept his experiences secret for a very long time
but finally decided to go public contacted a number of very prominent researchers who looked into his case and
found it quite credible uh his main onboard event and
there were several but his most well remembered and extensive one occurred on November 15 19
1959 while driving near Maryville in California it's an incredible case uh
got quite a few corroborating Witnesses some interesting evidence as well and I
certainly think you'll find it fascinating and it does deserve to be more welln now again most people who are
taken on board a UFO have a lifetime of encounters and that's certainly true of Nicholas Henry Edwards of Tacoma
Washington he has had many unusual experiences in fact at age five in 1948
while he was lying on the grass at the University of Puget Sound in Washington he experienced what he believes is a
profound outof Body Experience where he flew Among the Stars uh and unusual experiences
continued one evening in July of 1952 while living in Point Defiance Park
north of Tacoma he saw a strange light bulb-shaped object moving back and forth in the sky
he drew it as you can see the next thing he knew he found himself in a different place so he was apparently taken on
board and as Nick says I was scared I saw many small aliens they seemed to be
talking but I couldn't understand them their sounds they seemed to be looking at me but from a distance it didn't look
like a room just white I couldn't see walls I felt like I was sitting on a stool
so his recall is not entirely complete here uh he doesn't think that anything
happened to him other than being taken on board apparently and seeing these ETS
but he did arrive home about 11:00 p.m. this experience started at 9:30 so there
may have been some things he admits that he does not remember and other weird experiences would follow as a young
pre-teen and teenager you would occasionally see an aura of light Sur in his body nobody else seemed to notice it
on a few occasions he would suddenly fall into kind of a trance he says and would start relating deep profound
spiritual information to people once in 1952 he was in his backyard with his
parents and his brother Tom when a UFO showed up all four of them watched it
for about 2 hours as it moved high up disappearing in and out of the
clouds but Nick's most memorable and dramatic experience occurred on November
15 1959 at that time Nick was 16 years old
and he and his two friends were driving along US Highway 99 between Chico and
Maryville California it was about 4 a.m. they were
about 100 miles from Sacramento when suddenly Nick found his car being pulled up into a UFO he looked
over and his two friends were unconscious and I'll just let Nick describe in detail in his own words what
he saw says Nick I never forgot about this the aliens took me to a room on
that night the room was like an operating room on the wall to the right were some instruments like clocks coming
down from the ceiling were three black cords with devices on the end like lasers there was a long large table near
the cords I remember six aliens total they were 4 and 1/2 to 5T tall the eyes
were large like humanized but big they were very friendly I thought they were cute at first I was given an examination
I will not elaborate about the deeper details but everything works fine in a certain area the spacecraft was about
50x 30 ft High it had two rooms a left room and a right room the car was was in
the left room the aliens took me to the right room I could see that the wall was kind of round where the car was but
didn't notice it in the room on the right there was a kind of greenish Mist where the car was and a whitish Mist in
the room on the right the alien took me around the front of the car to the right
I could not move on the operating table except for my eyes the aliens had
complete control over me communication was done by thought I never did see their lips move the aliens were very
expressive with their eyes and with movement of their heads and arms the aliens did walk but floated at the time
I did notice to the upper left what appeared to be an instrument panel and could see two aliens perhaps to the
front and up to the left from the right room or operating room this may have been the flight deck or control center
there were three aliens to my right and one to the left and after a couple of hours the aliens put me back in the car
with my buddies we were back on US99 just outside of Sacramento
California so yeah he was moved some distance from where he was taken and his friends didn't remember but during his
encounter he did ask the ETS where they came from and their response was interesting they said we come from a
place beyond your solar system so somewhat vague but certainly
interesting and he like other contes actually remembers seeing this weird
alien book too in fact and as Nick says in his own words I also noticed two
large blue books I saw pages of one book turning but this was not done by me nor
do I remember one of the aliens turning the page there was an alien standing by me at the time but he was only watching
me and I don't remember having any communication with them now afterwards he wanted to tell
his friends but he just couldn't as he says I never told anyone this has been
my secret I just couldn't get it out until now my life was changed never the
same I started drinking and was very hard to get along with but I learned to live with it this was locked up inside
deep down until now so yeah it took him many years to
deal with this and to come forward and in the Years following this encounter he
says he had many really profound dreams about UFOs about being on board a craft
and talking to the ETS some of these were very Vivid and repetitive dreams in
one of these dreams the ETS told him the history of Earth is coming to a conclusion soon he remembered going to
another earthlike planet all kinds of stuff now he did have a few other UFO
sightings and so did his brother Tom in 1973 Nick and his nephew viewed a
cylindrical UFO flying near a jet after it left they talked about it briefly and
his nephew said no one would believe it but yeah it took Nick about 29 years
to start talking and in 1988 he began to contact prominent investigators to share
his story he also signed an affidavit attesting to the truth of his encounter
he contacted Dr Leo sprinkle who looked into his case and wrote back quote it is
obvious to me that your UFO experiences are similar to those of many other persons with whom I have talked and you
have come to similar conclusions about the possible historical biblical and
scientific significance of these encounters Nick also wrote to researcher
Bullard author of measure of a mystery abductions and which was really the
first statistical study of onboard UFO cases and Ed Bullard said quote I can
see that you are one of a number of people with lifelong encounters with strange visitors they are many and
varied and they also have a deep impact on the lives of the people they meet your report certainly makes this aspect
of these visitations very clear so Nick was very determined to get the word out
about his encounters and speak with researchers he also wrote to UK research
Mark birsa who wrote back I have read your transcript and comments regarding
your experiences and beliefs I found them very interesting and honestly
written so Nick ended up writing a small book himself called The Inevitable which
was all about his experiences and its implications uh Nick does have a strong
religious Faith he speculates that some of the ETS may actually be Angelic in
nature he ended up writing articles for a few UFO journals sharing his
experiences and he writes that his encounters have been very benevolent writing quote these aliens I'm with look
like humans I am happy to see them and be with them you can see Nicholas
ultimately concluded that his encounters were very positive it's an interesting
case for so many reasons such a shame that he wasn't able to connect with the other Witnesses who had
that onboard experience with him although apparently it probably wouldn't help much to corroborate his case
considering he recalls that they were in fact unconscious so he appears to be the
target of the ETS in this case which is not unusual we see this in case after
case where one person is taken and others are basically put to sleep or even all might be taken and the others
won't recall anything because they were unconscious throughout the whole experience but I like Nicholas's case
because he did reach out to many really prominent researchers who found his case quite credible I think that adds a level
of credibility to the case and certainly deserves to be more
welln now this next case is super fascinating I had never heard of this
one before and when I did find out about it I'm like wow this is an interesting
case I call this one the case of klous deer Kaufman and this took place in the
spring of 1960 in a very urban area of Frankfurt
Germany it's an incredible case that did initially involveed missing time but the
witness recalled what happened to him spontaneously after going to the doctor and finding out something very unusual
about his physiology as we shall see this case comes from elob Van ludger and
it was one evening around 8:30 p.m. in the spring of 1960 that
14-year-old Claus deer Kaufman was walking to his home on the outskirts of
West Frankfurt Germany he had just gone to visit the movies and he was walking
by the acur school and the athletic field behind it as you can see here when
he noticed a strange star-like object hovering next to the Moon of course it
was much lower and looking at it he was shocked to see that it had almost a Saturn shape it was large was nearly
onethird the apparent size of the Moon and looking at it he could see it was actually disc shaped with the sort of
rings around it and metallic he says it glistened like quote iridescent metal uh
he could see this in the Moonlight and it was hovering just a few blocks away he estimates in front of the river Maine
now he did have a box camera with him but unfortunately there was no film in it but he was able to view the object
through the camera viewfinder and could see that this saturn-like ring around the circumference of this object was
actually composed of several rings so as he watched he noticed a
strange whitish Mist forming near the Highwire fence to his right and at the
same time he noticed a powerful beam of light coming down now suddenly he
himself was struck by this beam of light and it was so quick and so bright he
didn't have a chance to even cover his eyes and the next thing he knew he lost
Consciousness and when he woke up he was still standing in the same exact place
the object was still in the same position in the sky however the moon had changed position so some time had
apparently passed and he also noticed something else he saw a few figures off
in the distance moving very quickly away from him uh his watch it turned out had
stopped at 8:30 so he knew exactly when this experience occurred but he was
feeling quite disoriented a little unwell so he rushed home as fast as he
could and when he arrived he found that his brothers and sisters were all already asleep and it was around
midnight his parents were out at the time but looking out the window of his home he could still see this Str strange
Saturn like object and watched as it emitted a short white beam of Light
which moved up and down then suddenly the object became dark orange becoming
darker and darker until it disappeared so at this time clous deer
had no memory of the missing time which somewhere around 3 hours or more the
next day he did suffer from a very strong headache and inability to concentrate
he also noticed a very sore spot on his lower spine near his hip which upon
examination appeared to be a minor puncture wound But as time passed he forgot about
this sighting he forgot about the fact that he had lost Consciousness the only reminder was this mark on his back which
remained periodically painful from time to time and would always remind him of
his strange experience with this UFO so ultimately it kind of left his
mind for decades but was 30 years later in 1990
Claus deer had to undergo spinal surgery at Offenbach hospital and to his
surprise the doctor told him that his X-rays showed evidence of a prior
surgery exactly where Claus deer had found this puncture Mark decades earlier
immediately after his UFO encounter problem was he hadn't had prior surgery
so this very quickly reminded him of his encounter which he hadn't thought about for such a long time and as if on Q his
memories of what occurred during the missing time began to return it took a while he had to meditate on it but
before long he remembered much of what had happened during these three hours of missing
time so he now recalled seeing this saturn-like object being struck by this
beam of light but but he says he didn't actually lose Consciousness but fell
into sort of a Trans likee State and this is when he noticed standing real
close to him were several figures they stepped out of this Misty area and walked up to him he said they were each
about 4 and 1/2 ft tall dressed in skintight jumpsuits they had little tiny
silver boxes attached to the chest he said they had small hairless heads a
small chin nose and mouth mouth but did have very large prominent eyes he says
their arms and legs were strong and muscular he noticed that their feet or shoes looked like flippers with two toes
he says the figures did include both men and women which he judged by the shapes
of their bodies he says all the figures walked with a strange jerking gate very
fast and purposefully holding their arms at sort of an angle reminding Claus deer
of soldiers so at this point he was still very much dazzled by This brilliant light that had
struck him but he sens one of the beings asking him to come closer so he started
to walk towards them he says under his own free will he says he felt a great affection for this ET now offence was
still separating him from these figures and he was about to climb it to get closer to them when the ET suggested
that he just stand next to the fence which he did and suddenly CLA derer felt
himself levitating being lifted upwards and looking up he saw that the UFO above
him was growing closer and larger and that he was being carried towards it the
next thing he knew he found himself inside a yellowish domed room was
illuminated with a bright yellow light he said he was seated in a reclined
chair which he says was very much like a dentist's chair in front of him he saw a
large round round opening leading into another room facing him standing by the
wall were several gray green entities uh actually they did have their
backs towards him he says they were holding on to what looked like handles on the wall were pumping these handles
up and down he couldn't really tell what they were doing he did see another type of ET which he recalls filled him with
fear but he is unable to recall exactly what it looked like but standing next to
him was another figure who had very large eyes with whites in the eyes and
small dark pupils he said it had leathery webbed fingers which he stuck
into Claus deer's mouth kind of pulling or yanking on his teeth this caused the
witness to feel somewhat nauseous uh he felt them trying to loosen his belt and remove his pants and
during this time he could hear them talking both male and female voices and
this is when he did have quite a bit of fear he actually wondered if he was going to be killed this brought him two
tears actually but this is when he noticed another small gray being he said
it had an enormous bald head huge brown black shiny almond-shaped eyes wrinkled
skin a very thin mouth no visible nose or ears but Claus Deeter sense this
incredible kindness coming from this being and in fact he says it seemed to be very curious about him and it
comforted him and told him that he would be allowed to return home so this
provided him some definite reduction of his fear the next thing Claus deer knew
he was being levitated through the air exiting the craft and being placed down next to the fence where this whole
experience began uh during this he could hear but not see the sound of breathing behind
him actually reached behind him and felt what seemed like a belt hooked to him but suddenly a force pushed his hand
back he says and at this point Claus Deeter did faint and that turned out to
be the end of his experience and that was all he could recall an amazing case
it's really interesting to me how he recalled it years after the event that's
actually not that unusual that does happen sometimes people have what I call a q something that reminds them about
the experience and just sitting down and meditating about it can bring back the memories that's apparently what happened
in clous deer's case which is so interesting also because of the
physiological evidence the doctor telling him well looks like you've had an operation when he hadn't or
apparently he had with the ETS and again this was an experience
that he felt was ultimately benevolent just a fascinating case all around with
so many different types of ETS and what he experienced while he was on
board and now we move to another really interesting case which did get quite a
bit of attention in the country where it happened but I don't know if it's very
well known outside of Argentina where it took place I call this case the case of
jilberto Gregorio cioli and this is an interesting case
which took place on October 4 1972 in bersak
Argentina this has some really interesting evidence to it as well physical evidence animal reactions
certainly physiological evidence it's a remarkable case that deserves to be more
well known with someone being pulled on board seeing some very unusual type ETS
having some very interesting interactions with them the main witness in this case is again jilberto cioli a
50-year-old construction worker and it was around 3:15 in the morning on
October 4 1972 when he heard strange noises outside his home in Baco which is
located outside of buenus Aris Argentina now we first thought it might
be his dog his dog had a habit of escaping from the house and jumping the fence was quite a difficult dog to deal
with so he crawled out of bed opened the door stepped outside and this is when he
walked right into the strangest experience of his life and I'll just let jirto describe what happened in his own
words so he steps outside and as jilberto says when doing so a very
intense light dazzled me and I lost Consciousness what I remember was is
waking up in a small room with a metallic appearance with neither doors
nor Windows nor any other openings that could be seen only polygonal pipes could
be seen on the walls and on the roof of the room the satin sky was like silver
very bright like fluorescent lights that because of their brightness it was impossible to look at them I could not
distinguish the range of colors I was seeing there were many beings in the room and around me their exact number I
cannot specify they were 2 m tall and 30 cmers that's about seven feet just under but
as he says they were very thin I believe they were no wider than 20 cm their gaze
was strong so much so that I couldn't look at their eyes when I could look at their eyes I saw that they were Hollow
and deep the nose was wide and flattened and the lips thin they were covered in a
kind of olive green uniform was like a diving suit the inexpressiveness of
their faces makes me think that they might have been masked their faces were very long they had a wide belt with with
squares with flashing lights so jilberto became quite frightened and one of the
beings the only one who was wearing any kind of headgear spoke verbally he thought at first he later decided it was
telepathic but this being spoke to him and said don't worry nothing will happen
to you this did provide him some comfort and looking at the figures he could see
that they were mostly human looking but did have very wide very long chins and
yeah after they continued to speak with him he realized that they were actually speaking
telepathically he said the room that he was in was very large brightly lit it
kind of reminded him of a scientific laboratory because he says the walls and
everything was made out of metal he saw many strange quote apparatus and
instruments but he couldn't tell what they were they were kind of Beyond his ability to understand he could see that
he was sitting on a circular bench which looked like it had colored lights on it
one of the beings took a small device sort of like a suction cup with a funnel and a pencil like Extrusion on it and
took a small quantity of blood from the fourth finger of his left hand this surprised him because there was no
needle nor did he feel any pain whatsoever uh he said a sperm sample was
also taken though in a later interview he elaborated on this and said what actually happened was that there were
two other women from the Baco area on the ship human woman and that he was
made to have intimate relations with both of them
now Gilberto did have the impression that the beings were entirely friendly
as he says in his own words these beings were very kind to me and their voices
were very sweet while I was in that room I heard children crying calling their
mother but I don't know where that crying came from it may be from some family but I didn't see any in there as
one of the beings took my blood away I looked around me and so it was that I could see in the pavement some Stones
piled up so yeah he heard children crying this could be from houses in the area is what he's saying but he saw some
weird piled up stones on the ship and he was very curious about it and wanted
proof of his experience so jilberto asked if he could take take one of the stones the being replied no but then the
being looked at one of the other ETS and then bent down and picked up one of the stones and actually handed it to
jilberto now before jilberto took it in his hands he asked if this Stone
contained any radioactivity and the beings told him to just take the stone and that quote
nothing will happen to you and this is when suddenly his onboard experience came to a quick end and as the witness
says I didn't have time to ask him if the stone was terrestrial or not but I'm
sure it belonged to our planet it was iron Hite when I had the stone in my
hand I closed my hand and appeared again at home I was calm standing stoned in
hand if I hadn't had that stone what happened would have seemed like a
nightmare so yeah he had some physical evidence of his EXP experience he could
see that it was now 3:55 a.m. 40 minutes had passed and upon his return He also
noticed something else there was in fact a mark on his finger where this blood sample had been taken he said the finger
afterwards would swell up on and off for some time he also noticed a minor pain
at the base of his neck for about 3 days after his encounter he also suffered
from vertigo and a sense of dissociation in fact as he says when I
walked it was like I was walking on air I found that interesting because that is an a description I've heard from many
contactees he noticed that his dog was somewhat traumatized and scared it didn't eat normally for some time and
experienced what looked like bouts of semi paralysis now the stone given to giberto
was in fact analyzed by his friend who worked as Miners And it again revealed
itself to be normal Earthly iron pyate still interesting though the strangest
effect was perhaps that jilberto noticed an increase in quote intuitive
sensitivity he says he suddenly possessed a whole new understanding and knowledge of physics astronomy and
philosophy which was very unusual as his education had never gone beyond primary
school now jilberto says that he did actually remain in telepathic contact
with the ETS as he says sometimes I feel a jingling noise back here on the B of
back of my neck and I know that they are calling me to communicate something
telepathically I actually saw them only once after that day but I have communicated with them many times they
tell me many things that I cannot reveal because they won't let me what an amazing case that is and the
fact that they gave him this rock although it turned out to be an earth rock it's still kind of
interesting uh his medical evidence is also very interesting to me the most
interesting aspect is the psychological or spiritual and psychic after effects
with him suddenly becoming interested in all these really deeply philosophical
and spiritual and scientific subjects this is something we see apparently there's something about UFO contact that
wakes people up in a number of different ways uh contact experience challenges
people on multiple levels particularly an onboard experience it challenges them
physically mentally emotionally spiritually and psychically so it's a
really profound Peak Su superlative experience that is often something
people will remember for the rest of their lives now this let's move to the very last
case of this little collection I call this one the case of istvan balog this
took place on December 26 1991 in Beacon Hungary and this is a
really interesting case the witnesses a young man who worked for the National Guard so he was a Border guard and that
I think makes him a very credible witness like many wanted to keep his
experiences secret and did initially when he started experiencing some very unusual events but certainly couldn't
hide it from his parents who knew instantly something very profound had happened to him uh as in all these cases
he was taken on board had a very in interesting interaction with unusual
ETS and as we shall see some really remarkable proof of his contact this
case comes from researcher Gabor tarali of hufan the Hungarian UFO research
Network and it involves a 21-year-old military Border guard by the name of
istan balog this case took place in the town of Beaks in Hungary and it was
beginning on December 13 1991 that istvan was sleeping in bed
when he was awakened by a voice that spoke three times in a mechanical tone
saying you will meet us you will meet us you will meet
us so this fun was wondering if this was just some weird dream or Nightmare and
at first really didn't think too much of it but the next night the same thing happened again and the night after that
in fact over the next week and a half for 11 nights in a row he was woken up
the same time each night with this same message you will meet us repeated three
times so this was absolutely freaking him out he was afraid to tell anyone
thinking that he would not be believed but at the same time he began to dread nighttime and he was barely able to
sleep and it all came to a climax on the evening of December 26 13 days after he
started getting these nightly messages that night he had gone with his friends to the movies and he returned to
his home about 15 minutes after after midnight and he had just opened the gate to his property and reached the Terrace
of his home when he noticed something hovering just a few meters above the ground in the courtyard and as he looked
at it he could see it was a gray disc about 12T wide and 7 ft high was glowing
brightly he said it had a weird squarish protrusion on the bottom a domed top
there was a band around the center the circumference and what appeared to be a port hole along the side now the moment
he saw this object istvan says that something strange happened he felt like
he lost all his willpower and as though some strange Force propelled him to walk
directly underneath this object and the moment he did this a beam of light about
2 feet wide Shone down from the center and unable to stop himself istvan walked
directly into the beam of light and immediately found himself inside this us
o now inside the object he was amazed to see two short beings he said they looked
pretty much human but were very short only about four to 4 and 1/2 ft tall
they had large heads very large eyes kind of a greenish skin and long hands
with only three fingers on each hand each of them wore black skintight
clothing now one of these beings was operating some controls in The Craft
while the other stood by istvan kind of attending to him looking around istvan
saw no doors only one small window which he estimated was about 3 to 4T wide and
looking out the window he could see his yard the room inside the UFO was very bright he said with smooth gray walls it
was at this point that the being next to istvan began to speak to him telepathically in his native language of
Hungarian this little guy said that they had been watching IST Von for 3 years
and they told him they were going to take him away on a trip of about 15 million light years that it would only
take a very short time as they were able to travel interdimensionally at this point the
being shown a green light onto IST Von's forehead this caused him some
disorientation and following this he doesn't really remember clearly what happened next he does have fragmented
memories of looking out the window and seeing what he believes was the moon's surface he saw craters real closeup he
also recalled seeing pyramidal structures but does not know where these were if they were on Earth or perhaps
another planet but the next thing he knew he was kneeling on the ground in a
sort of prayer posture about 6 feet from the location where he had been taken but still in his
backyard he did have a terrible headache he said he was very dizzy his whole body
was trembling the muscles in his face were distorted he had trouble standing up so he was pretty severely affected by
all of this he did manage to stumble into his house he could see that it was now 2 a.m. so this onboard encounter had
lasted about 1 hour and 45 minutes of which he only remembers a little bit he
went straight to bed but when he woke up the next morning he told his parents and
they told him that they had not noticed anything out of the ordinary that night but when they heard His Amazing Story
they absolutely believed their son because they could see he was in great distress now istan had to go to work
that day so he went to the barracks where he worked but he had to be driven there he couldn't walk on his own they
called a doctor and he was actually driven to his job and once there he immediately reported to his superiors
and told them what happened now they did not believe him and they sent him to the nearby hospital for a
medical examination and then he was sent to the psychiatric ward in the Central Hospital
of Budapest now thankfully a psychiatric exam showed istvan to be perfectly
healthy but despite this he was discharged from his job as a Border
guard and the official explanation was that he was quote unreliable and unfit
for further military service but something very interesting
did result from the medical exam earlier in his life istvan had broken his arm
and had to have a platinum Rod inserted however when examined and x-rayed in the hospital they saw that
this Platinum Rod was now missing so apparently the ETS took it so there you
go that's the case of istvan balog and what an interesting case it is and
absolute proof of ET intervention given the fact that this Platinum Rod that had
been inserted in his body by doctors following uh him breaking his arm was no
longer there so that's certainly something that can't happen by accident
it's really remarkable evidence uh such a shame that he was
treated as he was by his superiors in the milit
losing his job that way just because he had an experience that's hardly fair but
certainly something we do see over and over again people will have a UFO
experience and as a result lose their job because of it I did a whole episode
on that previously on this channel so you can check that out if you're interested but what an amazing case all
five of these cases I think have quite a bit to tell us about the ETS who they
are why they're here where they come from what they're doing on this planet
and with us and all the different types of ETS there are how people react to
contact how people are treated because of their contact many really interesting
insights into all of this from these cases alone which as I'm sure you know
by now represent only the very tip of the iceberg many many more people are being
taken on board UFOs and is publicly revealed uh people are much more likely
to talk about a simple sighting but if they have face to-face contact or are taken on board they're very unlikely to
talk about it the vast majority simply don't because as we can see reactions
can be quite skeptical hostile uh people will ridicule Witnesses
mercilessly this can break apart families and marriages it's a real tough
thing for a witness to go through to have an experience like this and then have to deal with all these After
Effects uh in relationships and physically and again mentally spiritually all of it it's quite an
ordeal but certainly a fascinating experience that many many many people
are having it's why I do this research because so many people out there are
having these experiences looking for answers and have no recourse so that's it for today I really
want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it again it's because of you guys that I do this research and are
putting and am putting out these episodes so thank you thank you thank you for watching and until next time
keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth it's out there and most important of all keep having
fun I will see you next time bye for
now e
