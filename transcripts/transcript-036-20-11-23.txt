Summary:
Nov 23, 2020
New York is one of the most influential places in the world. Not surprisingly, it has a rich 
history of UFO events, many of which have had a strong influence on what we believe about UFOs 
and extraterrestrials.

This video presents the top twenty UFO encounters in New York State. Some are well known, a few 
you've probably never heard before, but all of them have had a profound impact on the field of 
ufology.

Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, humanoids, onboard UFO experiences, UFO 
crash/retrievals...they're all here. When it comes to extraterrestrials, New York is not shy. 

Did your favorite New York case make the list? Can you guess which ones made the top three?

Intro
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and the  title of today's episode is the top 20 ufo cases  
of new york i've written a number of books  about various states and new york is one of  
them and i have to tell you i think it's one  of the most influential in terms of how we  
view the ufo phenomena there's an enormous  number of cases coming out of this state  
of course involving the entire gamut of the ufo  phenomena sightings landings on board experiences  
face-to-face encounters ufo crashes  ufo photographs and films being taken  
conspiracies the whole deal so i had a real  tough time picking the top 20 and i had to leave  
out some that i really wanted to include but i've  come up with a list of what i think are the top 20  
encounters in new york state these are the ones  that are perhaps the most well known the most  
influential important unique uh credible these  types of encounters um some i think you will know  
of some i'm sure you've never heard before i think  people will be surprised at what the top cases are  
but let's just get started because there's a lot  of cases to cover the case i chose for number 20  
UFO Display Over Glen Falls
is the ufo display over glenn falls this occurred  on the evening of august 19 through 20 of 1974 and  
really it covered a much more widespread  area than just glen falls and included  
various communities such as lewdenville saratoga  warren and washington as well all of these cities  
started receiving floods of calls into their local  police stations but it was really apparently glenn  
falls where most of the activity was centered  people were viewing these blimp-shaped objects  
large glowing blimp-shaped objects darting around  hovering moving at right angles many of these were  
covered with colored lights and it was attracting  large groups of people to watch this in fact  
by midnight more than 100 people were lining dicks  avenue in glen falls to watch this ufo display  
police officers arrived radio stations many  of these people watched one of these objects  
swoop down and actually hover very low over  saratoga lake and start scooping water out of it  
and it sped away at high speeds uh an hour  later by one am there was more than 400 people  
along dick's avenue traffic by now was completely  blocked people were seeing ufos all over the area  
there was a pilot flying over this area and he  reported his sighting to albany county airport  
and they said that they had it on a radar and  they were tracking it at 3 000 miles per hour  
witnesses called plattsburgh air force base who  denied having any information about the sightings  
they had no explanation to explain them   and they also said that they were seeing  nothing from their location at a plattsburgh
so it's a very very amazing sighting uh really a  huge sort of mini wave witnessed by many hundreds  
of people and that's why i think it's important  it's also got a weird little twist at the end  
the day before this whole incident one of  the residents of glen falls joanne warren  
was in her home when a ufo appeared outside her  home her whole family saw it including her young  
12 year old son larry and also her daughter  saw it and all three were watching this object  
when suddenly they all just passed out they  became unconscious woke up the next morning  
and uh didn't know what to make of it  but then heard on the radio that evening   about the sightings going on at glen falls so they  heard about him on the radio ran outside and saw  
all these objects darting over head as joanne  warren says we saw them the neighbors saw them  
you could go out right in front here where the  parking lot is and you could see all these things   zooming all over the place and stopping zooming  here and there it was not just me that saw or  
larry or my friend next door half the town  saw it so it was clearly some sort of display  
interestingly joanne warren's son larry would  later become one of the prominent witnesses in  
the rendel shim ufo incident in uh bent waters  england in 1981 so that could perhaps be related  
but definitely an important case the case i chose  for number 19 is the warren sigmund photographs  
Warren Sigmund Photographs
it's a very impressive case which took  place on may 15 1955. warren sigmund  
was a television technician he was in the heart  of new york city uh he was with a very well-known  
person by the name of janine boulier an  officer for the french office to tourism  
and she suddenly shouted out looked out the  window and shouted out hey quick look at that  
and sigmund saw this object this  weird object scooting across the sky  
he had a camera handy so he quickly grabbed it and  snapped a series of photos which clearly showed  
this object moving around the heart of new york  city and i'll just quote warren here as he says  
i had never seen anything like it in my life it  must have been tremendous in size it looked like  
a full moon that suddenly appeared it was eerie  frightening fascinating i didn't know what to do  
i could feel myself getting tense all over  but i had to watch this thing whatever it was   the things seemed to have an unknown power giving  off that glow and just hanging there in the sky  
then it turned a dull gray and swung lazily over  the right and stopped again just hovering then i  
noticed another strange thing even when it was  resting in place the outline was very blurred  
indicating terrific movement no one else was  on the roof and no one else seemed to see  
this thing we were alone but how could  that be in a city of 8 million people  
then it moved again this time to the left to  the original position it was like a graceful  
ping-pong ball now it made a high sweep  and settled down at an angle of 45 degrees  
this thing had no wings tail insignia or markings  of any kind it left no trail and it made no sound  
it didn't seem to know what gravity was if it did  it certainly wasn't respecting it then as suddenly  
as it had appeared it made a slight turn and  vanished it moved like it had intelligence this  
was not mass hysteria or individual hysteria was  not an illusion or a mirage or a light inversion  
i believe the pictures prove that clearly an  impressive case as you can tell by these photos  
and there are many other excellent photographic  cases in new york one case that i really want to  
just briefly mention occurred in june of  1963 again in the heart of new york city  
a man by the name of milton b saw this object  scooting across the sky and managed to photograph  
it as it hovered directly over  the united nations building  
the object kept moving and he snapped another  photograph as this same object hovered over  
the or hovered next to the empire state building  so an excellent case those these photographs  
were vetted by wendell stevens a ufo researcher  who specialized at one point in ufo photographs  
another case involving photographs occurred on  april 12 1993 this occurred again in new york  
city overlooking the uh hudson and east river and  uh this uh landscape artist was taking photos of  
new york landmarks when he saw the river bubbling  and turned towards it and saw this silvery  
object rise up out of the river and dart away very  quickly he snapped a series of five photographs  
two showed nothing two showed the object but  only as a small dot and a blur but one very  
clearly shows this object rising right up out of  the river it's an impressive photographic case  
and this again comes from wendell stevens in the  ufo photo archives a third excellent photographic  
case took place in december 1959 the main witness  is dwayne f rary he was outside his home when  
he saw a strange object and managed to snap a  quick picture of it he described it as a glowing  
saturn-shaped object hovering at very low  altitude over the house across the street he  
felt like it almost posed for him and it clearly  shows a solid glowing object with a strange ring  
around its circumference i like these older  photographic cases because i think there's  
less chance of them being manipulated now we move  to case number 18 ufo causes plane crash this  
UFO Causes Plane Crash
is a controversial incident it occurred on july  1st 1954 over griffis air force base began when  
officials at the base detected unknown objects on  their radar scopes they scrambled an f-94 starfire  
jet after this object and the pilot described a  gleaming disc he said it was huge and circular  
and he tried radio radioing the object and asking  it to identify itself he did not get a response  
other than suddenly his jet engine suddenly  cut off and the pilot felt a very strong  
wave of heat in the cockpit he says it was like  quote like a blast from a blowtorch and uh the  
pilot ordered his radar man to bail out which he  did and the pilot bailed out seconds later and  
both men parachuted to safety unfortunately  their plane crashed in the town of walesville  
new york killing two adults and two children  in their home and injuring five others  
so this was obviously a very huge incident and  uh the pilots wanted or the press wanted to know  
what happened and interviewed the pilots and  the pilot said that they had encountered a ufo  
they later retracted this in later interviews  and said it was quote engine trouble major donald  
kehoe was a very active investigator at that  time for the national investigative committee  
of aerial phenomena nycap and he investigated  the incident and learned that in the hours  
following the crash a large silver ufo had been  reported across several communities in the area  
he tried to get information from the air force  and learned that the air force was afraid to  
scramble any other jets after this object for fear  of being attacked as this first plane apparently  
had been kevin randall investigated this  case and tried to debunk it pointing  
out a confusion and dates and he learned  that there was in fact a weather balloon   known to be in this area uh most researchers i  think uh in my humble opinion i think this is a  
real event um certainly i do considering that uh  this object did apparently cause the jets engines  
to fail and a blast of heat to occur and so many  people reported this object and any event it  
appears to be a very important case and that's why  i included it and now we moved to case number 17  
UFO Encounter Jimmy Hendrix
for 17 i chose the ufo encounter of jimmy  hendrix there have actually been a number  
of really famous celebrities in new york uh  who have seen ufos a lot of musicians actually  
neil sedaka saw a ufo over the catskills in 1970s  muhammad ali reports that he was jogging through  
central park in 1974 when he saw several ufos he  talked about him on the tonight show and said i'm  
convinced ufos are of tremendous importance to the  whole world in 1953 mel tormey saw a ufo and said  
that it moved faster than his eyes could follow is  darting around in june of 1961 punk rocker helen  
wheels and her brother peter robbins saw a ufo  and actually had missing time peter robbins would  
later become a very well-known ufo researcher so  as you can see there are many uh famous people who  
have seen ufos in new york but what i wanted to  talk about here is the sighting by jimi hendrix  
it's a really interesting case this occurred in  1965 during the winter of 1965 in upstate new york  
hendrix was driving with his bandmates including  curtis knight when they became stuck in the snow  
it got stuck in a huge snow drift and were in  danger of freezing to death when suddenly this ufo  
stopped down and in the street in front of  their car just parked there blocking the road  
uh it was cone-shaped according to curtis knight  and sort of looked like a space capsule jimi  
hendrix as far as i know never talked about this  and curtis and i'd only revealed this after jimi   hendrix passed away it's an amazing case according  to curtis knight this object was giving off heat  
somehow this figure appeared a very  tall figure glowing and approach the car  
and i'll just let curtis knight  describe what happened in his own words
we couldn't believe our eyes he stood eight feet  tall his skin was yellowish and instead of eyes  
the creature had slits this forehead came to a  point and his head ran straight into his chest  
leaving the impression that he had no neck   jimmy seemed to be communicating  telepathically with it at this point  
the interior of the van began to heat up as  curtis knight said i was roasting and then this  
figure this tall figure started to walk around the  car melting the snow again as curtis knight says
as it glided behind our truck i saw  that the drift had completely vanished  
turning on the ignition key i gunned the motor and  i got the hell out of there the object the strange  
craft was at the same time lifting off like a  rocket from a launch pad jimmy never did talk much  
about what happened he sort of let me know that  the cool thing to do was not bring up the subject  
it was to be our little secret however from what  he said i sort of suspect the object arrived to  
save our necks chiefly because jimmy had been  practicing trying to communicate by esp with the  
beings on board i know this may sound i know this  may be hard to believe but i'm putting it straight  
just like it happened uh so jamie said that  he'd seen a ufo over at a concert once in maui  
and apparently yeah he was in contact and some of  his songs actually seemed to reflect that in fact  
he wrote a song called up from the skies which  is actually written in the point of view of an  
et who has come back to visit earth after a long  absence and the lyrics are really revealing the  
song begins i just want to talk to you i won't  do you no harm i just want to know about your  
different lives here on this people farm the et  goes on to say that he's come back to find the  
stars misplaced and the smell of a world that has  been burned or maybe it's just a change of climate  
so this sort of echoes the themes of  environmentalism that we see in many other   cases uh he had another song called castles  made of sand which is about a young girl who was  
confined to a wheelchair and became suicidal and  was about to end her life when she saw a winged  
ship pass over and at this point she was healed so  here we have the theme of healing being revealed  
which is another thing that definitely shows up in  ufo accounts it's a really interesting case jimi  
hendrix is an extremely influential musician and  i find it interesting that so many musicians have  
had contact with ufos and that's why i wanted to  include that case now we move to case number 16.  
UFO Sighting Over Lake Tiara
for k-16 i chose ufo sighting over  lake tiarata it's a really interesting  
photographic case which has generated a lot of  controversy but i think is a legitimate case  
this occurred on december 18 1966 a man by the  name of vincent perna a construction worker  
was fishing at lake tiarati with his brother and  friend suddenly this disc showed up it was copper  
colored sort of a dull finish very large disc  shaped it emerged from a nearby ridge and hovered  
directly over the lake it was totally silent  and appeared to be about 18 feet in diameter  
vincent perna had a plastic brownie star flash  camera and he quickly snapped number of photos  
at least at least one of which clearly shows this  metallic disc overhead he reported his sighting  
to the park patrol officers and they forwarded  his report to stuart air force base officials  
at stuart air force base were very interested  and the case was routed to project blue book  
project blue book officers interviewed   vincent perna and the other witnesses and reviewed  the photograph and they pronounced the case a hoax  
jalen heineck was part of blue book at the  time and he was shocked at this conclusion  
he was very angry he disagreed with it  vehemently as he says and i'm quoting i  
find no substantiation for the evaluation of hoax  particularly in view of the photo analysis report  
mr beckmann a qualified photo analyst disagrees  with the photo analyst presented in this report  
as to the distance of the object he points out  that the depth of field extends much farther than  
indicated in the report consequently no judgment  can be made to the real size of the object  
my recommendation is therefore that the  evaluation be changed from hoax to unidentified
but bluebook refused to change their conclusion they believed perna or they  certainly accused purna of having a  
model of some sort and said that this was  just a small object very close to the camera   uh the photo analyst and heineck disagreed leaving  with a large object some distance from the camera  
so this definitely caused quite a bit of  controversy again as hynek says and i'm quoting  
project blue book ignored my recommendation and  maintained a file on the bear mountain photograph  
with the hoax label intact not really fair to  either the scientific method or the character  
of the witness but the case wasn't over  yet uh reporters from the rockland news  
got a hold of the story uh reporters called up  stuart air force base and asked for confirmation  
and uh people at stewart air force  base told them that they believed that  
the photos showed nothing more than  quote a blob of developing fluid  
so now they're changing their story first they  said it was a model now they're saying it's a blob   of developing fluid nightcap investigators arrived  on the scene they were very interested in the case  
they interviewed perna and actually asked him if  he would go under sodium pentathol truth serum  
uh he agreed and again there was no variation  in his story at all researcher frank edwards  
was very impressed by the case as well and i'll  just quote edwards here as he says because of  
the apparent authenticity of the pictures they  could conceivably become among the most important  
civilian photos ever taken so clearly an important  and influential case now we move to case number 15  
UFO Sighting on April 11 1964
i chose blue book case number 8739 unidentified  it's only one of 16 cases that blue book declared  
unidentified in the state of new york as you  can see they were very reluctant to do so but  
sometimes they just couldn't get out of it this  case occurred on april 11 1964. the main witness  
is warren b oschner he's a was a pilot in world  war ii and at that time was a physiotherapist  
he was out picnicking with his wife and  kids in the area outside of homer new york  
suddenly they all looked up and saw this black  object leaving a weird contrail this the contrail  
disappeared but the black object remained  it kind of took on a the shape of a banana  
and then faded out shortly later another object  appeared this one was glowing and looked like a  
cylinder it was impossible to determine how large  or how high up it was because he didn't know its  
size but he estimated it was about the size of a  navy submarine that's what it looked like to him  
he was looking at it through binoculars and he  could see flashes of light from one side of it  
it was sort of darting across the sky maintaining  shape and this is where it started to get really  
strange this object changed shape from a cylinder  to a saucer shaped it then appeared to become  
spherical at this point it divided into two  pieces the top part darted away and the bottom  
part remained at this point the bottom part split  it into two pieces one of them faded away and the  
other sped off at high speeds the whole experience  lasted about 45 minutes according to the witness  
he says and i'm quoting i have observed a  phenomena which is beyond my comprehension and  
which taxes my sense of reasoning and credulity  so a very impressive case and while blue book  
was trying to debunk a lot of cases this was one  that they declared unidentified for case number 14  
Civil Defense Employee Photographs UFO
i chose civil defense employee photographs ufo  this occurred on july 28 1952 right around the  
time there had been ufos seen over the nation's  capital i think that's one of the reasons why this  
particular uh incident generated so much interest  the main witness is august roberts as i said he's  
a civil defense employee he was on the roof of  the sixth precinct police station in new jersey  
when he saw a ufo hovering over the other side  of the hudson river he had two other people they  
were all watching it through binoculars the object  looked like a large ball of light orange in color  
with a dark brownish rim and roberts had a camera  with him and he quickly snapped a photograph  
as he says whatever the object was i'm sure it  was not like any type of aircraft i have ever seen  
since he was a civil defense employee he  reported his sighting to superiors and  
submitted the photograph the military and the  fbi actually heard about this case and expressed  
extreme interest and for the next 72 hours roberts  went through an intense and somewhat abusive  
interrogation and i'll just quote august roberts  here as to what happened as he says for a combined  
total of three days my life was virtual hell  they just wouldn't let me alone what did you see  
how is it possible what do you think it was  they never stopped questioning me i was so  
worn out that i had to spend the rest of the week  resting up at my sister's home i was questioned  
badgered threatened laughed at and insulted in  the end they accepted my story i hope i never have  
to go through that again as i said i think this  generated a lot of interest because officials were  
trying to figure out what was hovering over the  nation's capitals and here they had a photograph  
of an object very nearby and very close to the  same time that's why i wanted to include this case  
UFO Repair
and now we move to case number 13. for case 13  i chose a ufo repair case this is an incident  
in which witnesses observe an apparently  disabled ufo being repaired by ufo occupants  
this particular case was investigated by ted  blocher and dr bertold schwartz they're both very  
well respected you and well-known ufo researchers  this case also appeared in dwight connolly's book  
world's best ufo cases dwight connolly was the  former editor of the mufon ufo journal so yeah  
very good case this took place in new berlin  new york just northwest of the five corners area  
the main witness is marianne hatson bueller  this occurred on november 25th 1964.  
on that evening marianne was in her home when  she saw a shooting star dropped from the sky  
followed by a second one she realized these  were not shooting stars when the second object  
assumed a horizontal trajectory and started  traveling along the creek bed next to highway 85  
heading towards her house she ran outside and  observed this thing as it came above the highway  
and started chasing cars away it actually followed  one car down the highway for a short distance  
marianne called out her mother to observe this  her mother came running out and saw it as well  
screamed in fear and went running back inside  and begged marianne to come back inside  
marianne refused she wanted to see this  thing marianne's dog was also too afraid  
to come outside meanwhile this object moves  away from the road and lands on a hillside  
about uh 30 3400 feet away just over a half mile  and these occupants start to get out these men  
and they were moving very urgently around  underneath this object and appeared to be carrying  
boxes of what looked like tools she could  see them very clearly around this time the  
second object reappeared came swooping down and  landed very close to the first one so you've  
got about five or ten figures here standing  under this ufo apparently trying to repair it  
and i will just let marianne describe what she saw  in her own words as marianne says they seem to be  
dressed in something like a skin diver's wetsuit  it was a dark color and their hands were visible  
apart or out from the wrist of their suit their  skin was lighter than the suit they were wearing  
they were built like men the only difference  is they were slightly taller between six and   a half feet taller they seemed to have hair it  seemed well barbared fairly close to their heads  
they were considering calling the police at  this point but decided not to because they   realized that what they were looking at was very  unusual they could see this was a ufo by the way  
it was flying and they decided not to call the  police because they did not want authorities to   harass the ufo people instead they just watched  and it was very cold outside so at this point  
marianne went back inside grabbed her  binoculars and she and her mother watched this  
object and these men from their window using  binoculars and they watched as these guys move  
very urgently pulling something out of the  bottom of this craft and working on it with tools  
they had a very difficult time apparently they  were moving very quickly kept trying to put this  
box like contraption back into the ufo and  couldn't do it on their third try they finally  
did it but by this point nearly two hours had  passed when they finally got this thing put back  
together they picked up all their tools very  quickly moving very urgently running and all  
climbed back into these two craft which took  off straight up and zipped away at high speeds  
so clearly a very impressive case the next  day marianne went up there to see if she could  
find any evidence and was surprised to see  definite landing traces she saw two separate  
depressions in the ground that were triangular  shaped and more than a foot deep she also found  
weird strands of cable about a foot or two long  some weird kind of paper towel like cloth as well  
as some foil strips she gathered some of this up  actually and collected it and brought it back into  
her her house and put it in a box unfortunately  sometime later when she went to retrieve it she  
could no longer find it so this evidence has  been lost still this is a very impressive case  
it was researched by very prominent investigators  as i said and dwight connolly included it in his  
book world's best ufo cases and he was the former  former editor of the mufan journal so he should  
know what he's talking about and definitely a very  interesting case and i included it because it's a  
ufo repair case humanoids a landing landing traces  multiple witnesses it's got a lot going for it  
and i think deserve to be included on this list  and now we move to case number 12. case number 12  
Gary Wilcox Encounter
is the gary wilcox encounter i've discussed  this case before but this is a classic case  
and definitely deserves to be on this list it's  fairly well known this occurred on april 24th  
1964 in tioga city in new york obviously the  main witness is dairy farmer gary t wilcox  
and he was out in his fields spreading fertilizer  when he saw something strange he first thought it  
was a refrigerator or something that somebody had  abandoned but it was far too large for that then  
he thought perhaps it was a aircraft engine that  had been dropped from a plane but as he approached  
it he could see it clearly wasn't it was some type  of craft and there were two men standing next to  
it each of them were wearing seamless uniforms  with hoods covering their faces and each of them  
were carrying a tray of earth apparently from his  field and carrying it into their craft the craft  
itself was egg-shaped in about 20 feet long so he  approaches them and has a conversation with them  
they apparently spoke english they told him they  were from mars they actually gave him a prediction  
that there would be fatality in the astronaut  program which did turn out to be true  
and they also told him that they were  interested in the fertilizer he was spreading   in his field gary offered to give them a bag of  fertilizer and went back to his barn to go get  
it and when he came out back to the location  in the field the craft and the men were gone  
nevertheless he set down the fertilizer in the  field and went back into his working and when he  
came back there the next day the bag of fertilizer  was gone so presumably they took it despite these  
unusual elements this case did get a lot of  research from jim and coral lorenzen a lot of  
attention from other researchers and no one could  find any evidence of hoax as gary's brother says  
if gary says this thing happened it really  happened he has nothing to gain and a lot to  
lose by telling a story like this i know it is  true and gary himself spoke about this incident  
and i'll just give you a short quote from gary  wilcox i don't care whether anyone believes me or  
not it doesn't mean anything to me one way or the  other i told them the police what i saw and heard  
i thought i should i know what i saw we talked  for two hours and we were even joking at times i  
just don't worry about it i've got nothing to hide  and if i saw another one today i would report it
yeah a very well known case but it  definitely deserved a place here   for case number 11 i chose the perfect ufo  case this is what dr james mcdonald calls this  
The Perfect UFO
case dr james mcdonald was an atmospheric  physicist and a pioneering ufo researcher  
and he calls this the perfect case for a number  of reasons as well find out but primarily because  
there were multiple independent witnesses in  different locations as well as radar returns  
so this case took place about 15 miles east  of utica on june 23rd 1955 it began when the  
co-pilot of a mohawk dc-3 airliner observed  a strange object oval-shaped light gray in  
color with a line around the perimeter and a  row of windows emitting a bright green light  
this object appeared about 500 feet above their  plane moving at quote great speed both the pilot  
and the co-pilot watched this object move for  about several miles until it moved out of view  
and they estimate it was moving at about 4 500  miles per hour much faster than anything we had so  
at the same time nearby radar operators in boston  tracked this object on their radar scopes and  
there were other crews in the area who saw this  as well there were two other airliners who also  
observed this object and reported it over their  radio air traffic controllers at albany airport  
were monitoring the radio transmissions and they  were able to make visual contact so now we have  
three separate airliners seeing this object  one very close we have air traffic controllers  
at albany airport seeing this object and we have  radar controllers in boston actually tracking this  
thing on their scopes so this is an incredible  case it actually made it to the condon committee  
and uh they were very skeptical of most cases  and actually reached a negative conclusion  
about the ufos and yet there there was this  case which they were never able to explain dr  
gordon thayer the radio propagation specialist  was unable to explain this case at all and  
he tried and said it might have been perhaps  an anomalous propagation on the radar and just  
basically ignored the fact that there were so many  other independent witnesses so dr james mcdonald  
very much disagreed with dr thayer's report  and i'll just quote dr mcdonald here as he says  
this is the most intriguing report that certainly  must be classed as an unknown pending further  
study which it certainly deserves statements  from some of the other witnesses would help  
in analyzing the event it does appear that this  sighting defies explanation by conventional means  
so for dr james mcdonald this was the perfect  case for three main reasons one was that there  
were multiple independent witnesses from separate  sources second was that these witnesses were both  
in the air and on the ground and third  was that it had radar confirmation  
and that these were all trained observers  people very familiar with aircraft  
so he could find no fault in this report  and calls it absolutely the perfect case  
and i have to agree with them it's  amazing and that's why i included it here  
Landing in Cherry Creek
and now we move to the top ten for number  ten i chose the landing in cherry creek  
this is a classic case i think it's very  well known among ufo investigators certainly  
and has an enormous amount of physical evidence  and generated a lot of interest from the air force  
this occurred on august 19 1965 at the butcher  farm in cherry creek harold butcher age 16 was  
in the barn getting ready to do some farm  work when suddenly he heard this loud noise  
the bull started acting up the radio staticked  he looked outside and saw this 50-foot  
object it was football-shaped it was  silver and it landed right in the field  
was making a loud beeping noise it had a red vapor  surrounding it this point the milking machine in  
the barn suddenly malfunctioned as well he grabbed  the phone which was in the barn and called the  
house meanwhile back in the house the radio that  they were listening to suddenly went off by itself  
they pick up the phone and it's 16 year old  harold screaming for everyone to come outside  
by this point the object was taking off  it made a loud bang and zipped away harold  
hung up the phone and he saw this object in time  to move off only one other member of the family  
actually saw this 14 year old robert ran to  the front door and saw this object taking off  
so they called the police meanwhile  their neighbor her name is kathleen  
bruham she comes knocking on the door and  says it's back it's here again so she and  
all the other butcher family come running outside  and they can see this object hovering at about 700  
feet overhead it scoots around for a short time  and then moves off by this time the police arrive  
including officers e.j haas and p.m nelson they  can smell a strange ozone-like odor in the air  
they're impressed by the witnesses uh  they decide to contact the air force  
so uh this point the air force sends over people  from project blue book meanwhile one of the  
witnesses harold he finds a strange  purple liquid where the object had landed  
scoops it up and saves a sample of it uh he  find finds that the bull was so upset by the  
presence of the object that it actually  bent the iron bar that it was tethered to  
so there was some pretty interesting  physical evidence right from the outset   project blue book officers arrived and started to  investigate captain james m dorsey from the 4621  
air force group interviewed the witnesses and  said i don't think it's a hoax these children  
saw something so blue book officers  were unable to explain it and actually  
labeled it unidentified case number 9806 as you  can see one of a couple that have been declared  
unidentified in project blue book interestingly  researcher dr james mcdonald was shocked by blue  
book's conclusion because they again were usually  very skeptical in trying to debunk cases and uh  
i'll just quote james mcdonald here i wonder why  it happened to be tagged unidentified so quickly  
does it imply that the credibility of all  the observers and especially the sun herald  
were so high or was it the indentations  the singed brush and the purple liquid  
or did the bull sell this one by bending the stake  with his nose ring j alan hynek was also surprised  
by blue books conclusions because they declared  it unexplained so quickly as he says there was a  
strong impulse to regard this case as a hoax but  the evidence pointed in the opposite direction in  
addition the witnesses concerned were from a rural  family and there seemed to be nothing to be gained  
by fabricating such a story as a consequence blue  book reluctantly carried this case as unidentified  
apparently they were impressed because according  to the investigators who've looked into this case  
researchers from wright-patterson  air force base showed up there was   a whole team from wright-patterson  who examined the landing traces and  
found no radiation using a geiger counter  but did find high levels of phosphorus  
that's interesting because that's turned up in  other cases ufo researcher robert galgansky looked  
into this case and found further confirmation  of the event and that there was a cluster of  
sightings in the days following this incident two  days following the sighting at the butcher farm  
new york troopers richard ward and mr purcell saw  a ufo just one mile south of the butcher's farm  
nycap investigators also found another  witness who had seen ufos a few days earlier  
a couple of days after the incident the  butcher family saw the ufo again appeared  
to be the same ufo and the days followed there  were other incidents their neighbor dick nelson  
reported that he kept hearing a strange beeping  noise coming through his television and radio  
and later another group of witnesses said  that they were actually chased by this   object in their car down the highway a very  impressive case no one's ever been able to  
disprove it and as you see the air force was very  interested in it and that's why i included it and  
now we move to number nine for number nine i chose  the ufo sighting by john lennon this is a really  
John Lennon
uh influential sighting i think very well known  but a lot of people don't know the whole story  
it occurred on august 23rd 1974. john lennon was  with his new girlfriend may pang in their 53rd  
street penthouse in the center of manhattan new  york suddenly may paying she saw it first this  
classic disc shaped object very large approached  to within about just a few hundred feet uh of  
their penthouse they both ran out into the balcony  and observed this thing for about 15 minutes  
and they said it was about the size of a jet and  as may pang says and i'll just quote her directly  
as i walked out onto the terrace my eye caught  this large circular object coming towards us it  
was shaped like a flattened cone and on top was a  large brilliant red light not pulsating as on any  
of the aircraft we'd seen heading for a landing  at newark airport when it came a little closer  
we could make out a row or circle of white lights  that ran around the entire rim of the craft these  
were also flashing on and off there were so many  of these lights that it was dazzling to the mind
john lennon didn't really give any interviews  about this sighting but he did once talk about  
it on the radio and i'll just quote  what he said here as john lennon says
i was standing on the roof and i looked  left and there was this thing 100 yards away   i could have hit it with a stone if i had a chance  
it had all these lights around the  bottom of it flashing on and off
uh he tried to take a picture of it with  his camera but the pictures didn't come out   they later learned that a bunch of people  had called the police and also reported it  
on that day so it was a pretty major sighting  and lennon did apparently write about it in  
one of his songs strange days indeed  as he says there's ufos over new york  
and i ain't too surprised nobody told me there'd  be days like these strange days indeed most  
peculiar mama uh so that's where we thought the  story ended for a number of years but it turned  
out there was a development his excellent  book alien bedtime stories grant cameron  
reveals that john lennon may have had direct  contact psychic yuri geller says that he spoke  
directly with john lennon that john lennon  revealed that one evening he was in his  
bedroom when the room lit up and in walk these ant  like creatures sort of these bug-like creatures
and these figures actually gave him this metal  artifact a small metal egg yuri geller has shown  
this artifact but it hasn't been scientifically  analyzed at this point he has refused to let it  
be analyzed so that's the case of john lennon  which i included because i think it's a very  
important case it's very interesting because it's  another example of a musician being contacted by  
ufos i think their tactic here the ufos is to  contact people who are influential in society  
so that's why i wanted to include this case  and now we move to number eight for number  
Ryan Neff
eight i chose the ryan neff near collision  with a ufo i think this is well known  
within the ufo field but really it should be  much more widely known than it is i'm not sure  
how many people know about it it's a very dramatic  example of a ufo that nearly collided with a jet  
and this jet was actually taken over by the  military mind you this is a commercial jet  
filled with passengers so hollis all began was  on april 8th 1956 over schnecktady new york  
there was captain raymond ryan who was  piloting the jet and william neff was co-pilot  
and there was a large group of  passengers as they flew over new york   this was flight 775 they were flying at about 6  thousand feet when suddenly this brilliant white  
object appeared in front of them on an apparent  collision course they made an emergency turn  
and to their shock this object made a right  angle turn directly towards them and zoomed by  
at they estimate at least one thousand miles  per hour and then disappeared or faded away  
so they were freaked out fearing another collision  captain ryan turned on the landing lights  
at this point the object reappeared  again directly in front of them   and was pacing their jet they radioed griffis  air force base and reported the object  
at this point griffis air force base confirmed  that they had visual contact and they were going  
to send two jet fighters after this uh to vector  it in stewardess phyllis reynolds came into the  
cockpit room she saw it as well and at this  point something really bizarre happened  
griffis air force base called pilot ryan  and ordered flight 775 to pursue the ufo  
ryan and neff were surprised to find that  their passenger jet was now under military  
orders to pursue this object but they agreed  and uh they deviated course and began to  
chase after this object they chased it for about  20 minutes for about 150 miles until they reached  
the point where they were going to be out of  radio contact with griffiths air force base and  
there was still no sign of the jets that they  had promised to vector in towards this object  
so finally they just disobeyed military  orders and returned back onto their course  
this was became a very controversial case uh it  was investigated by major donald kehoe and kehoe  
had a lot of problems investigating this case he  said he said he was stonewalled at every corner  
and that the air force was completely  uncooperative they he said they flat out  
lied about this case and there was more debunking  of this case going on by the military one debunker  
was donald menzel who was now an alleged member  suspected to be an alleged member of the mj-12  
organization as a debunker at the time donald  menzel was a pretty well-known astronomer  
who was skeptical of ufos and according to his  report on this case what the pilot saw was venus  
so that that's a clearly uh not a tenable  explanation this is a very controversial case  
that has certainly deserves a lot more attention  than it's gotten and that's why i included it here  
The Terror Above Us
and now we move to case number seven for case  seven i chose the terror above us this comes from  
a book by malcolm kent by the same name this was  published in 1967 right on the heels of the betty  
and barney hill case in the ufo incident by john g  fuller so this is a very early reported abduction  
case and still has a lot of the elements we see  in other cases even up to today so that's why i  
think it's a very important case and it's not  well known it occurred to two brothers by the  
name of jason and robert those are pseudonyms  it began around the summer of 1958 when these  
brothers both developed a crippling fear of  driving at night they began having panic attacks  
one of them just couldn't date anymore  and he was a very avid dater at the time  
and one time they were driving along the road  when they came upon a bank of fog and both of  
them had a crippling panic attack to the point  where they had to pull over they couldn't drive  
at this point they knew something was  wrong they went to see a therapist   and the therapist had a difficult  time finding the origin of their  
phobia and he eventually traced it to an incident  that had happened while they were driving  
they came upon a fog bank and this is  when the whole story started to spill out  
under hypnosis they came upon a landed ufo in the  field or rather right in the road in front of them  
it was blocking the road short men in dark   uniforms showed up both men were pulled  from the car and moved into the object  
jason found himself undressed naked strapped  to a table and being physically examined  
while robert found himself in another situation he  found himself in a windowless metal gray room with  
a young attractive woman and this woman told him  that they had been captured by ets and they wanted  
the ets wanted them to be intimate with each  other and that was the only way they would get out  
robert was having a very difficult  time orienting himself he   could not figure out where he you know what  had just happened where he had just been or  
where he was and he didn't trust this woman  who was making intimate advances towards him  
he said she smelled bad had a really strange odor  and he suspected actually that she was one of the  
et's in disguise he blacked out and when he woke  up he had been undressed and he was lying next to  
this woman who was also undressed so here we  have that theme of reproduction which we see  
in other cases and again this is all covered under  hypnosis so moving back to uh jason after he was  
physically examined he blacked out and then he  woke up and went through the same experience  
that his brother had reported where this  woman tried to make advances at him and what  
she accepted he felt like he had no choice next  thing they know both brothers found themselves  
sitting next to each other on a very low bench  their hands were bound in front of them with some  
sort of weird strap they were paralyzed and unable  to move while this weird hypnotic device came  
down from the ceiling and uh hypnotized them next  thing they know they wake up at home in their car  
a full day has passed and they have no  memory of what happened other than they   thought that they got stuck at work so and under  hypnosis this is what the hypnotic command was  
to you know you won't remember you will not  remember this you just had problems at work   so that's all they were left with and after  after the incident these phobias really ramped up  
and became crippling and that's when they sought  therapy it took six years and that's the story  
that came out i find it very interesting because  it echoes the sort of accounts we see today  
malcolm kent is the sole researcher to this story  and i'll just quote him directly as malcolm kent  
says until the strange story of jason and robert  was revealed to me and for a long while afterward  
i did not believe in what are called flying  saucers i believe that jason and robert while  
driving home late one fog infested night were  kidnapped by alien creatures and taken aboard an  
alien ship where strange and revealing experiments  were made upon their body these are the facts i'm  
going to present them stand behind them claim in  front of my peers and my god that i believe them  
there are those i know and the numbers include  almost everyone interested in flying saucers   that believe we can learn untold secrets open  amazing doors of learning not just in science  
but in philosophy psychology medicine for these  reasons and others people attempt to track down  
the saucers and the salsa people berate the  government for denying their existence make  
speeches and write books i'd like to suggest that  this course is as mad as those disputed previously  
it is only too clear that the aliens are  not interested in telling us or teaching us  
anything and what and what could we learn from  them if they were willing to tell us their secrets  
if the aliens treat us with impunity assuming the  right to sweep down out of the skies and kidnap us  
and close us with creatures of their manufacture  stick needles into our skin and watch us reproduce  
what makes us think that whatever philosophy  they have will be superior to our own
so malcolm kent takes a pretty dim view of this  whole experience uh i don't think uh he can be  
faulted for that this is a very early reported  abduction and it does have a lot of pretty  
alarming elements to it for sure but i think a  very important case and that's why i included it  
and now we move to case number six for number  six i chose the maurice bay ufo crash retrieval  
incident this is a very controversial  incident was investigated by the long  
island ufo network which was headed by researcher  john ford who himself has had some controversy  
but it appears that the event is legitimate uh  this occurred on september 28 1989 and as the  
story goes a ufo was shot down by the military i'm  not saying this is true i'm just going to report  
the facts that we know about this incident at  least as they were reported by the long island  
ufo reporting network and other researchers again  this occurred on september 28 1989 there had been  
a wave of sightings prior but on september 28th  at about 5 30 pm mary mclaughlin and her son  
saw two large triangular objects in this area  a half hour later residents in the area said  
they saw military arriving and started setting up  roadblocks along the east maurice coast guard base  
or at 8 pm mona rowe a resident of the area  saw amber lights in the sky and she thought  
at first they were flares but they didn't  quite look right uh another resident miss p g  
and her son saw strange lights in the sky uh  and looking at them saw that they were actually  
attached to a huge triangular shaped object  another witness interviewed by the long island  
ufo network was larry s and his son who were  out fishing along maurice harbor when they saw  
these helicopters and what they first thought were  flares but they're not sure they were flares these  
were orange kind of amber objects and they watched  this for several hours they stayed there until 1pm  
and were very nervous about what they  were seeing because it was clearly unusual   another witness by the name of susan was near  southampton college when she saw eight lights  
they looked like they were about 500 feet over  the highway this was on tucahoe lane so there's a  
lot of witnesses here 815 a dentist by the name of  john sykes was driving along sunrise in the nearby  
town of quag when he saw these strange lights and  he's definitely convinced this was not a flare  
another interview to witness  is paul peterson who described   seeing six amber lights also he saw  several helicopters heading towards them  
he went out with his friend to investigate and  they saw these lights hovering about 50 feet   over the water and they stayed for about two  hours in place and they were taking pictures  
uh bob eschler who's a mufon investigator actually  was able to examine these photographs and believes  
they're genuine and says they were not flares  because there's no heat signature apparent in  
them so the evidence for this is definitely  building up at 9 pm another witness carol  
olivieri and her husband frank said they saw  these strange lights and helicopters 9 30 p.m  
kevin and kathy o'donnelly saw these lights while  they were driving they said actually paced their  
car at treetop level and lit up the area around  them bright as daylight was totally silent uh they  
got to their home and this object hovered over a  nearby field which is about a 10 acre field and  
they said it covered it completely some another  witness was a court officer by the name of frank  
uh who saw what he thought were flares and an afc  130 dropping people uh parachutists into the water  
uh so definitely there's some sort of operation  going on that involves at least the military  
at 2 30 and am a commodities broker by the name of  john and his sister were woken up by helicopters  
and looked outside of their home and to their  shock there was helicopters flying by and  
hanging from it was a very large  circular object being carted away uh  
at this point numerous other witnesses  were seeing a military convoy moving along  
the roads from smith's point beach along the  william floyd parkway towards brookhaven labs  
so the long island ufo network uh took  a while to collect all these reports and  
sort of build this case for the possible existence  of a ufo crash retrieval which took place  
on maurice harbor but according to some  researchers this thing wasn't just a crash   it was actually shot down one researcher  is ufo researcher george dixon who was told  
by a inside source a colonel who worked at the  pentagon that the military actually shot down  
this ufo using star wars weapons and according to  this kernel the ufo retaliated and actually struck  
back with sort of a sound weapon a sonic weapon  which killed 18 people including a small group  
of psychics who have been brought by the military  to communicate telepathically with the alleged ets  
so this case starts to get you know really towards  the fringe here uh with a lot of bizarre but  
interesting information certainly uh and it does  appear to have legitimate to it because the long  
island ufo network held a press conference and  the copley news service received confirmation of  
activity in this area from both the police and the  coast guard though they made later inquiries which  
resulted in nothing but complete blanket denials  so once again we have officials backtracking
various explanations were raised to try and debunk  this case from officials including reports of a  
russian satellite others said it was a drug  bust another source said it was the an air c  
training operation so we start to get  contradictory debunking explanations that's  
a pattern we see again in uh high-level cases so  it's very hard to say what exactly happened here  
uh but researcher george dixon said he found  another witness was actually on the scene and  
worked on the weapon itself he was just there for  a short portion when they actually shot down this  
object but says that it's absolutely legitimate  and he refused to elaborate anymore because  
he was being threatened and there's a weird  and kind of complex interesting end note to the  
maurice bay ufo crash on july 17 1996 that's you  know many years later twa flight 800 was flying  
over maurice harbor they had been 12 minutes  in the air had just reached 14 000 feet  
when they spontaneously exploded 230  people perished there were no survivors  
there was a lot of speculation that this might  have been a missile at first because a bunch of  
people saw a huge flash of light heading towards  this object in fact there are over 50 witnesses  
who reported this michael russo said he saw a  glint quick and sharp i wish i hadn't seen it
actually there was another person linda cabot who  managed to photograph what appears to be a missile  
or something heading towards uh well certainly  in the air at the time of this incident  
major fred meyer he witnessed this flash of  light and he was inside a military national guard  
helicopter at the time and he says i saw what  i've described as the light in the sky that has  
the characteristic and trajectory of a shooting  star the difference was this was broad daylight  
and i was immediately curious because i've  never seen anything like that in broad daylight   i've seen missiles fired at me sam ones  twos sevens their 1960s vietnam vintage  
missiles is the last time anybody shot at me  i do not attribute or ascribe to this any of  
the characteristics of those missiles i've seen  missiles nothing in my experience says missiles
so this was not just you know a conspiracy this  was being taken seriously by major news outlets  
in fact aviation week and technology the new  york times and newsweek all printed articles uh  
speculating on the possibility that that the plane  had come down from some type of friendly fire  
this even appeared on larry king live and uh  there was of course the report from united  
airlines pilot richard russell of daytona florida  who said flat out twa flight 800 was shot down by  
a u.s navy guided missile ship and said he was  given this information by a high-level briefing  
of course the military has denied this there's  been a lot of research into this incident it was   a tragic accident in 1997 the discovery channel  did a special on flight 800 and revealed that  
there had been a number of navy ships offshore  uh when this happened offshore of long island  
and they were conducting top secret maneuvers at  the time including quote satellite reconnaissance  
hard to say but there's a lot of  controversy surrounding this incident   there's been a lot of research into it i don't  want to get too deep into it but i would like  
to quote a little uh snippet from researcher  elaine douglas who's i think a prominent and  
well-respected researcher as elaine douglas says  there's that curious coincidence about maurice bay  
which more than a few persons have pointed out  is where john ford said the u.s brought down an  
alien craft in 1989 in maurice bay is where twa  flight 800 mysteriously crashed the cause of that  
crash readers are aware has so far eluded federal  investigators and in particular investigators are  
unable to explain the reports of more than  20 persons who say they saw an unaccountable  
light streaking towards flight 800 before it went  down so this is developing into a huge conspiracy  
and uh certainly one who's knowledgeable about  conspiracies is author peter moon who wrote about  
the montauk project peter moon of the montauk  project says that flight 800 was in fact shot  
down by friendly fire using star wars technology  as he says the rumor in my circle has it that  
it was the particle accelerator at brookhaven  labs on the montauk point part of the strategic  
defense initiative program the plane was passing  the vicinity of the military exercise when a heat  
generated target was being pursued but something  malfunctioned and the beam was act accidentally  
fired up from the ground hitting the deactivated  missile and activating it the heat sinking seeking  
missile passed through the whole of the plane  destroying it and leaving no trace of itself
so that's what peter moon says there was  a lot of controversy surrounding you know  
what brought this plane down they did think  it might be a missile 300 fbi investigators  
converged on this scene as well as air  traffic investigators they eventually   concluded that there it had uh occurred  because of a spark in the central fuel tank  
uh but some people to this day disagree with  it whether it was friendly fire or ufo uh it's  
still hard to say i but what's very interesting  is there's some very bizarre incidents that a  
lot of people don't know about and this is  why i wanted to include this after note on  
this whole maurice harbor case because a  lot of ufos have been seen in this exact  
area by other jets uh on november of 1996 just  a few months following this incident the crew  
of pakistani jet were flying over the same spot  when according to fbi investigator rob rapalski  
i'm interpreting it as they saw a single beam or  a point of light enough to attract their attention  
one month later there was another strange  ufo scene about at about 12 000 feet over jfk  
very close to where uh the twa flight 800  had crashed this was a saudi arabian 747  
and they described seeing a green flare-like  object which hung over their plane for a  
short period of time but long  enough to be caught on radar   and they're as a result of the sighting  their flight was actually diverted to dull's  
airport where federal officials questioned  them about what they saw airport officials  
released a statement about the incident saying it  might turn out to be completely nothing i can't  
say there is anything to it obviously if someone  reports something they have to check it out that's  
standard and later cnn was told by the fbi that  it could have been a meteor shower which clearly  
it couldn't have been if it's hovering over their  plane for a period of time and appearing on radar  
and in august 9th 1997 just again not  far later there was a fourth incident  
in which a 747 was involved this appeared in the  toronto sun and involved swiss air flight 127  
which was crew cruising over new york at 23 000  feet just opposite of john f kennedy airport uh  
quote according to the toronto sun near the area  where twa flight 800 went down in july of 1996.  
and the pilot was addressing passengers on another  issue when he cut his transmission off to call the  
national transportation board when this object  came shooting by them he called it a near miss  
by a round white object and according to  the ntsb the following concert conversation  
occurred between air traffic controllers  in boston in the pilot of swiss air 747  
jumbo jet the object had just streaked past  the plane when swiss air radioed in swissair  
sir i don't know what it was but it just  flew like a couple of hundred feet above us   i don't know if it was a rocket or whatever but  incredibly fast in the opposite direction the  
controller asked in the opposite direction swiss  air yes sir it was too fast to be an airplane  
at this point the controller located another  aircraft in the area and asked the crew if   they saw anything like a missile in  the area the response was negative  
and the controller asked swiss air how close the  object was to his plane and the controller replied  
it was right over us right above opposite  direction and i don't know two three four  
hundred feet above we saw a light object it was  white and very fast so lots of strange events  
surrounding this whole incident uh as one  researcher john romero wrote in his article  
just as ufos entered the flight 800 mystery the  case is closed he points out that as soon as this  
whole ufo connection became undeniable federal  investigators immediately came up with the cause  
of the crash zee writes the diagnosis effectively  bumped the mystery of flight 800 out of the news  
but the explanation was curiously timed it came  just as reliable witnesses had reported a possible  
ufo connection to the explosion crash that killed  230 passengers and crew on the paris bound 747  
so this is a very long and complex case and i  just want to close it with a poignant endnote  
which is really interesting and ties into all  this this comes from english researcher tony dodd  
who was interviewing an abductee by the  name of stephen and stephen had been taken  
on board a ufo and he was often given  messages sometimes of future events  
and on one occasion he was given a very strange  prophecy uh just a few weeks before the crash  
of uh this plane as uh tony dodd writes on one  occasion steven saw an airliner crash he asked the  
aliens if they could stop this from happening and  was told no two weeks later twa flight 800 crashed  
into the sea off long island so that's case uh  number six which i know got a bit long there  
but i think deserves to be told something clearly  happened in maurice harbor and is still happening  
if all these airliners are seeing this strange  activity all right now we get to the top five for  
number five i chose pine bush ufo hot spot pine  bush is an area in upstate new york which for a  
very long time has had a reputation for attracting  ufos in very large numbers the activity goes back  
decades but in 1980 really ramped up and sort of  became famous it's a very interesting area it's  
pretty rural according to air traffic controller  at stuart international he revealed to ufo  
investigators that this area is what they call  a border area is actually not visible on radar  
so perhaps that's one of the reasons why it's so  active it became famous as i said in 1980 largely  
through the work of harry liebelson and ellen  crystal ellen crystal had seen a ufo and was very  
interested in ufos and contacted omni magazine  where harry liebelson worked and asked him about  
ufos and harry liebelson had heard about sightings  in the pine bush area and told her that would be a  
good place to start and this is how ellen crystal  became actually a pretty prominent ufo researcher  
and harry liebelson joined her as they began  investigating the ufo sightings at pine bush  
they interviewed a number of residents including  policemen the barber store clerks a bunch of  
blue-collar workers all who said that there's  been activity there a long time since about the  
late 1960s uh interestingly this is not far from  crawford where whitley strieber had his cabin  
so ellen crystal started going out there to see if  she could see ufos and she did almost immediately  
she began photographing them she visited this area  on a weekly basis and started getting some very  
close-up sightings sometimes she's good as close  as 50 feet and she's decided that she's going to  
have to start bringing more witnesses in because  there's a lot of activity going on in this area  
uh she researched it a little bit  found those mining in this area   so something was very strange was  going on in the pine bush area  
and ellen crystal was determined to figure out  what it was in 1986 she was researching there  
again and said this object approached to within  30 feet away and hovered about eight feet over  
her car started bringing car loads of people in  to watch these objects and was having incredible  
success the number of witnesses was growing  rapidly and this area was becoming well known  
as a place you could go to to see ufos probably  ellen crystal's closest encounters was when  
she saw a gray actually run across the road in  front of her car she caught it in her flashlight  
so she continued to do research and brought  more people in she brought in robert toto  
a mufon investigator and they had a number  of sightings she brought in other witnesses  
such as rich rorman edward moray arlene  clifford uh other witnesses renee petrella  
david dalia she eventually wrote a book about  her experiences here in pine bush called silent  
invasion and i think is largely responsible for  popularizing it and making this small community  
uh what amounts to as a tourist attraction  bringing in hundreds of people to see ufos  
and one of them was vinnie police in 1991 his  brother had seen a ufo and police was very  
intrigued so they went out and started researching  the pine bush area and were incredibly successful  
had a number of close-up sightings and at one  point vinnie police also describes a face-to-face  
contact with a humanoid so this was the place to  go to see ufos vinnie police ended up writing a  
book about uh his encounters in pine bush which he  called the pine bush phenomenon and by 1995 it got  
out of control at this point there were cars lined  up nightly along this one road it's called west  
searsville road that became the place to see  ufos in this area and hundreds of cars would  
line up along this road to view ufos researcher  linda zimmerman has written about cases in pine  
bush that's very well known but it was causing  problems by uh 1997 there were property developers  
in the area who were dismayed by the crowds of  hundreds of onlookers and contacted the police  
a whole controversy followed ultimately there  was a no loitering order put out and people were  
forbidden from parking along searsville road  so it sort of put the pine bush phenomena to  
a little bit of an end but you can't kill a good  thing especially and the ufos are still appearing
people are going to come and look at  them and to this day pine bush remains   one of the most famous areas to see a ufo  they're in 2003 they started holding ufo  
meetings and to this day there's an annual uh pine  bush festival so it's become sort of a iconic uh  
ufo sighting area and that's why i included  it and that's why i gave it the number five  
place now we moved to number four and these are  the encounters of whitley streber i think this  
definitely deserves its uh ranking as number four  uh whitley strieber's encounters have had a huge  
impact on the field the whole ins story  unfolded really beginning in july of 1984.  
william strieber was a novelist at the time  famous for novels like the the hunger and wolfen  
and uh one evening in july of 1984 he was in  his cabin in crawford new york when he heard the  
footsteps and the motion sensor light went off  and he looked outside there was nothing there  
next year in october 4th 1985 in the middle of  the night he was in his cabin when the entire  
interior lit up with light his wife ann saw  it his son saw it their two friends downstairs  
thought the light was so  bright that it was morning and
the light flashed out and everyone was very much  confused by the incident that morning's streeper  
had flashbacks of a ufo hovering over the house  and his son told him that little people had come  
running in and said everything was going to be  okay but otherwise nobody seemed to talk about it  
then on december 26 1985 everything changed when  whitley woke up to hear people downstairs in his  
living room and uh he woke up the next morning  and not feeling well he had a very restless night  
he was feeling anxious had fatigue he was feeling  foolish he had memories of a large owl staring at  
him through the window he had tactful memories of  being pushed and poked at and seemed to remember  
a light in the woods but it was all a confused  jumble and he wasn't sure what to make of it
and it was one week later when he was skiing when  he had a pain in his head and discovered a needle  
mark and suddenly this flood of memories  came rushing back he recalled being pulled  
from his room carried by grey or these sort of  bluish-skinned creatures into the woods there was  
a gray next to him he was sucked up into a craft  and underwent a fairly unpleasant examination  
uh including an anal probe he got a lot of ribbing  for that but uh i really commend him for coming  
forward and describing it he thought it was a  very scary experience and had no memory of it  
until uh this suddenly spontaneously popped  into his head i thought he was going crazy  
maybe having a psychotic break so he went to the  doctor the physical doctor pronounced him healthy  
he went to a psychologist and the psychologist  pronounced him healthy uh he did eventually take  
some imagery and found evidence of what appears  to be implants in his body so uh at this point he  
started to realize what was happening to him  and that he was having ufo experiences after  
these memories flooded into his head streetwear  thought he was going crazy he went to the physical  
doctor who pronounced him healthy he went to a  psychiatrist who could find nothing wrong with him  
but these memories were flooding into his head and  uh it took him a little bit to piece it together  
but he realized it was the ufo phenomenon uh he  recalled seeing a ufo hovering over his house  
so it started to become clear to him that  whatever this was it was something to do with ufos  
and he began researching it he looked into  his childhood found out he had a history of  
encounters that he kind of denied or suppressed or  explained away including a ufo sighting with his  
little sister he had a memory of being abducted  from a train with his father and seeing  
dozens of soldiers he had other strange memories  as well remembered being at his grandma's house  
as a kid he was reading a book when this ant  like fig here very short appeared next to him  
and had a metal rod in its hand so he started  to have all these memories coming back to him  
and uh decided he was going to seek hypnotherapy  which he did and found out that he was in fact  
a ufo abductee uh the uf the et's told him you  are our chosen one uh that was a phrase he did  
not find convincing uh but started having  a lot of unusual experiences after this  
he moved to the new york city uh in partly in an  attempt to avoid having contact but the contact  
just followed him in 1977 he remembered a  weird experience where people were talking  
through his stereo his wife was there they said  something like we know something else about you
and this is when the experiences just   continued they moved to new york and lived on  76th street where they had another weird incident  
which you could never quite explain thought it  was a burglar in his house uh they moved away  
from there to the east 75th street and lived  on the 33rd floor still the et's arrived his  
son reported seeing figures at one point the  babysitter did they started to freak out they  
ended up moving from that they moved to the upper  west side in 1983 and in his apartment there he  
had three hours of missing time on october of 1984  he drove into a fog bank had more missing time  
so at this point he's still unconscious of being  a ufo abductee it wasn't until his experiences  
at his cabin in 1986 that he realized that  this was involved with the ufo phenomena  
he wasn't crazy in fact there were implants in  his body which showed under x-rays and mris and  
he eventually sought hypnotherapy and uncovered  of what had happened on some of these events of  
missing time usually of which was examinations  and the experiences just ramped up following  
that he had been unconscious of being an abductee  but he started having fully conscious encounters  
in 1986 the et's showed up in his room wearing  what appeared to be a double-breasted suit  
he thought it might be to reduce the fear  factor which other contactees have also reported  
it didn't work in his case he still thought it was  very scary he ended up writing the book communion  
about his experiences and as he sent it out  to various publishers or rather his agent did  
all of them rejected it he couldn't find  anybody to pick it up and finally after a  
long list moral books agreed to publish the book  and actually gave whitley strieber an advance of  
one million dollars they believed in  the book and as it turned out they were   right the publication of communion went off like  an atom bomb willie streeter was the first real  
celebrity to come forward claiming to have been  abducted by aliens and the book was a phenomenal  
success it reached number one on the new  york times it broke publishing records  
it stayed in the top ten for over a year and is i  believe the most successful ufo book published and  
uh really just introduced the world to the idea  of ufo abductions lily street became more known  
for his ufo experiences rather than his fiction  and uh sort of transitioned into the ufo field  
and began writing more books he eventually  wrote a series of books about his encounters  
he became very well known appeared on television  and radio received 20 letters daily and  
introduced a lot of people to actually  seeing ufos in 1986 uh astronomer john  
gleedman visited whitley streeber at his  cabin and actually witnessed ufos first hand  
another person who had an experience at whitley's  cabin was director philip mora and uh he was  
staying at the cabin when he saw a bright light  fill the room and had a dreamlike visitation with   a gray e.t another person who had an encounter  as a result of whitley's sort of contagion  
uh was the editor of communion actually the  editor's name was bruce lee and in february  
of 1987 bruce lee went to visit the walmrath's  bookstore on lexington avenue to see the display  
and came upon two strange figures standing in  front of the book display who he said we're all  
wrapped up in scarves and sunglasses and gloves  and we're speed reading the book saying oh this  
part is right this part is wrong and so on and he  approached them and saw that they weren't human  
he said their eyes were far too large they  gave him a very angry stare their skin was  
very pale it scared the daylights out of him and  he stumbled away and got out of there it's a very  
strange encounter but one of several which have  taken place actually in public areas in new york  
that's just one of them so the whole whitley  streeber case is just multiplies it's much larger  
in february or let's see in uh 1988 willie  strieber started working on the film  
communion telling the version of his story  and more people saw ufos at his house  
uh raven dana and laurie barnes were two people  who were staying at his house and both had  
a first-hand encounter with a gray  e.t they both said it was benevolent  
in uh also another person who had an encounter was  michael talbott an author and friend of whitley  
strieber and uh he visited the cabin had a lucid  dream type experience where he saw what he thought  
was a bag lady sort of a gray dressed up as a bag  lady on the front doorstep and they proceeded to  
have a conversation and he told whitley strieber  about it the next morning and whitley streeter  
was shocked because he had seen the whole  thing he'd woken up because he heard noise   and came down the stairs and stopped when he saw  the gray at the front door and michael talbot  
talking to it so it wasn't a dream at all so an  incredible case journalist ed conroy decided to  
look into it to see if it was a hoax and he came  away utterly convinced not only that he himself  
started having experiences so this  is something that whitley strieber   has an effect on people he's continuing to have  encounters he's had a lot of poltergeist phenomena  
out-of-body experiences pre-cognition he had an  episode of levitation the et's have given him  
various messages they told him they could control  his finances and gave him a demonstration of that  
they told him he had to stop eating sweets which  he did he slowly got over the whole fear factor  
to a large extent at least and started to sort of  build a relationship with these guys he had an e.t  
once jump on his back uh he started seeing these  guys in his house at night sometimes on a nightly  
basis and little by little he had sort of a more  interactive relationship one of his most profound  
experiences as was when he saw an e.t come and  approached him and put his little hand in his  
and so it's still scary experience i think for him  but definitely has also become very spiritual and  
let me just give you a little quote from him about  that experience he had with this e.t putting his   hand in his as strieber says i kept working and  meditating with him it was a wonderful incredible  
period in my life and i wish dearly that i could  share him with every single soul in the world my  
hope is that contact will lead to friendships like  this for everybody who seeks them i sought myself  
to free myself as he was free i was fascinated  with his physical abilities i'd seen him disappear  
he levitated at will when he left he'd shoot  through the wall i loved him i had never loved  
anybody else like this i didn't know his name  i rarely saw him i'd never heard him speak  
but he knew me vastly better than anybody else  ever had he was a teacher a real one not the sort  
of egocentric fake that usually treads the path of  enlightenment by any human standard he was totally  
enlightened so these are the encounters of whitley  strieber and as i said he's written a number of  
best-selling books about this and continues  to uh dominate the amazon ufo best seller list  
he's had a very profound effect on this field i've  talked to him several times he's a wonderful guy  
and uh i'm really glad he's come forward because  he's had a very strong effect on this field and  
that's why i wanted to include him as the number  four case on my list and now we move to the  
top three for number three i chose the brooklyn  bridge abduction this was a case researched by bud  
hopkins how it came to light is very interesting  there was a lady by the name of linda napolitano  
she at first was anonymous but she had had a  lifetime of encounters and was starting to put  
things together the late 1980s she went to the  doctor and discovered a weird object in her sinus  
and realized she was probably  having encounters with et's   so after doing some research she contacted  bud hopkins and became one of his clients  
and started working with him using  hypnotherapy to recall what happened  
and then this weird incident happened this was  on november 30th 1989 linda was in her apartment  
which overlooks the brooklyn bridge and it's a  high-rise apartment suddenly she wakes up the  
room's filled with light there's three et's in her  room grays they grab her and pull her out of her  
apartment through the window and into this object  next thing she knows she's being put back in bed  
it was a very frightening thing for her she didn't  remember anything else but she immediately called   bud hopkins she they scheduled the appointment  for hypnosis and under hypnosis she recalled  
being physically examined and uh there were  other parts she wasn't able to recall so they  
later scheduled uh more hypnosis sessions  meanwhile bud hopkins received a letter  
from a gentleman who wanted to remain anonymous  who said he was a security guard and actually  
there were two security guards who said that  they were guarding a highly placed world official  
and they told bud hopkins that they had  viewed the entire incident that they were  
parked below the brooklyn bridge and saw  a woman being pulled from her apartment  
uh into this object and they described  exactly what linda herself had reported  
and this was just the first uh witness to come  forward other witnesses over the next few months  
started to come forward in fact bud hopkins heard  from more than a dozen witnesses who reported  
seeing linda be pulled out of her apartment  this is uh very unusual this is definitely an  
outlier most abduction cases are not observed  but this one was observed by numerous people  
from different locations as bud hopkins says  over the past five years i have interviewed and  
communicated with nearly a score of individuals  involved in this new york city abduction case  
after conducting many hypnotic regressions and  studying the various types of physical evidence  
i have come to a firm conclusion this abduction  event so drastically alters our knowledge of  
the alien incursion in our world that it is easily  the most important in recorded history no previous  
case has had such profound effect on so many  lives and none has ever been observed by so  
many independent witnesses among the many stunned  observers was a political figure of international  
significance whose presence was likely reason for  this demonstration of alien capability so clearly  
an unusual event at the very least if not you know  the most important is what hopkins says at any  
rate he did produce the testimonies of a number of  these witnesses one was janet who was actually on  
the brooklyn bridge at the time and says her car  was stalled as well as all the cars around her  
she saw this object hovering over the building  or next to the building and linda being pulled  
out some people thought it might be a mannequin  in a movie others were screaming she said in  
horror and terror it was very frightening for  some of them and many other witnesses saw this  
one was brooklyn resident kathy turner who's  described the object as fiery red that was the  
description matched by most witnesses her neighbor  francesca also observed the event uh meanwhile uh  
meanwhile bud hopkins received more letters from  the security guards guarding the world leader  
and they told him they had memories of being on  board the ufo or standing on the beach with linda  
and the ets at this point linda was having further  hypnotic regressions and sure enough she recalled  
seeing both these security guards and the world  leader uh she also got messages from the et's  
dts wanted to give warnings apparently to these  people about pollution and uh polluting our planet  
was basically the main message  destroying our environment   meanwhile other witnesses came forth there was a  lady by the name of erica who told hopkins that  
she was abducted on that day or that evening  et's came in and floated her from her room into  
this large parking lot she saw the big fiery red  ufo not far away uh over the brooklyn bridge and  
she says that she was floated over to this field  this parking lot along with about 20 other people  
so this appears to be a mass abduction hard to  say but it's definitely a very complicated event  
but hopkins tells the story of this in his book  witnessed it's a 400 page book it's uh excellent  
book actually i highly recommend it it's a very  complicated case the world leader told hopkins  
that he would never ever come forward and he  never did but apparently we do now know who it was  
according to researcher stephen greer it was  the the secretary general of the united nations  
uh perez de cuellar but dr stephen greer has  a very different take on this whole event  
uh according to stephen greer de cuellar was  about to go public with the ufo phenomena  
along with a number of other world leaders  and make a public announcement about ufos  
and instead to stop this from happening apparently  the government stepped in and staged a ufo  
event which wasn't aliens at all according  to stephen greer with psychotronic weapons  
as greer writes the goal of the operation was  to stop this entire attempt by the world power  
elites including gorbachev to disclose the truth  to the world these abduction events are parallel  
paramilitary operations run by humans using things  that look like ufos and even having creatures on  
board that look like extraterrestrials but  are disguised humans or man-made creatures
i'm not sure that explains what's going on  here uh that's stephen greer's take on it  
uh i think that i don't think abductions are  all my labs as he's asserting that this one was  
and but hopkins certainly does  not believe this theory either   at any rate that's the brooklyn bridge abduction  case i think it is an important case and that's  
why i gave it the number three spot and now  we move for number two the spot for number two  
i gave to the hudson valley ufo wave this occurred  from about 1982 to 1984 and is considered one of  
the most widely viewed ufo events in history  that's definitely a top 10 event in terms of  
sightings of what occurred it was a huge  huge wave it really ramped up around 1983.  
the main investigator was philip imbrogno he's one  of actually many investigators who've looked into  
this and brogno was a member of mufon and kufos  when he interviewed a police officer from kent  
who saw this boomerang shaped ufo  this was right on december 31st 1982  
and more sightings started to come in following  this there was a sighting on february 26 1983  
by monique driscoll she saw a boomerang shaped  object hovering over white pone lake in kent  
on march 17 1983 the sheriff's office office  in brewster new york received a flood of calls  
of people reporting an object over the highway  some of the witnesses were fred dennis sheila sabo  
chris clark george lesnick all these people  saw this object hovering over interstate  
84. linda nicolette saw this object  from her house hovering over the highway  
dennis sant saw this object he  says it was 50 feet over his house   william durkin was driving along inters interstate  84. he pulled over with about a dozen other people  
and watched this huge boomerang shaped object  move at a very slow pace at a very low level  
over the highway it was stopping traffic all  along the highway and people were jumping out  
of their homes and watching this as it just  moved overhead uh so this was a huge event  
and it was only a short time later that there was  an even bigger event the real big event was on  
march 24th 1983. this was when the yorktown police  station received a flood of calls in fact there  
was calls coming in all over the place and brogno  looked into that case and discovered that multiple  
counties their police stations were being flooded  including police stations in 15 communities  
in westchester and putnam counties so he set up  a hotline and in the first day received more than  
100 calls so there was clearly an enormous wave  of epic proportions going on as imbrogno says just  
how many people actually saw this large boomerang  shaped object as it drifted over the valley  
during a two and a half hour period that evening  will probably never be known but is likely that  
several thousand people saw this strange phenomena  that night there were so many reports that  
that investigators had to ignore the routine  sightings in order to concentrate on those   involved with close encounters or when the  object came to within 500 feet of the witnesses  
85 of all the sightings reported that night came  from the area of westchester and putnam counties  
only three miles wide and 12 miles long   the taconic parkway runs through the center  of this area and the object appeared to have  
been meandering back and forth across that  roadway some of the witnesses to this event  
include hunt middleton he saw the object near his  home in bedford steve whittles and his friends saw  
the object from their home in carmel lawrence  greenman and his family also in carmel saw this  
object sending down beams of light joan lindauer  said it followed her down the road in millwood  
ed burns was on the highway when he pulled over  and watched it with dozens of other people who   pulled over a police officer by the name of kevin  soravia he was on patrol and saw this object  
so many witnesses bill hell pulled  over and saw this object hovering out
so many witnesses bill heel saw this object and  was hovering about 1 000 feet over the highway  
and moving at only a few miles per hour dennis  fleming saw people weaving on the highway and  
screeching to a stop and pulling over he pulled  over and they all stopped and watched this giant  
boomerang shot object move over the highway this  was an incredible incredible sight david scarpino  
saw this object hovering over osining reservoir  at treetop level he said it was bigger than a 747.  
the holtzman family was driving along 301  when they saw this object john miller of  
brewster saw it dozens of people were in a  restaurant in stormville they saw this object  
so the number of witnesses is too many to  count too many to list there was another   police officer who saw it so it was just an  incredible incredible night march 24th whatever  
happened on that night a lot of people saw it  and the sightings continued around this time  
there was another phenomena ultralight planes  started to be seen groups of them flying at very  
low levels sometimes strung up with christmas  lights colored lights this appears to be an  
attempt to confuse the issue this is what  certainly philippe and bragano believes he  
this is what he found out and was told actually  by an inside source but it definitely confused  
the issue and a lot of people reported seeing  these ultralights and thought it was the ufo while  
others had seen the ufo and and the ultralights  and said no these were completely different things  
but the sightings continued they spread out  into the neighboring state of connecticut   and lots of people saw this and brock no duggan  trying to find some official confirmation he  
called the faa they denied everything as  did the police and most airport officials  
but he did eventually find that inside source  who who said the the ultra lights was all about  
confusing the issue the sighting slowed down  a little bit in 1983 and came roaring back  
in uh 1984. a lot of people saw these objects as i  said over raised reservoirs and jim cook saw this  
object hovering over croton falls reservoir uh 15  feet above the water sending down beams of light  
a few months later in may 31st it was back again  hovering over the highway sending down beams   of light stopping traffic and that's when the  following this the waves started to slow down that  
appeared to be the climax of the whole wave there  were other sightings some were very impressive  
there was one witness who saw the object  approach and it changed size it was very   small and then it expanded in size so a lot  of interesting sightings but following this  
the sightings slowed down and eventually  stopped or they were not being reported in  
at least as large numbers the area  still remains a major hot spot   philip and brogno did write a book about it he  co-wrote it with j allen heineck and bob pratt  
it's called knight siege i'd highly recommend  it i also recommend the sequel to the book  
just one of the most amazing ufo waves in history  a final incident of the hudson valley ufo wave i'd  
like to mention is the incredible encounters at  indian point nuclear power plant this occurred  
on july 24 1984 an object hovered about 300 feet  over the exhaust tower reactor 3 for at least 15  
minutes it was seen by about 70 people it was  photographed the entire time filmed and caused  
quite a bit of consternation they had their guns  pointed at it this remained covered up philip  
and brogno found out about it and actually got  permission to interview one of the security guards  
at that point officials at the power plant denied  it the interview and brogno threatened to go  
public if they didn't allow him to interview  the security officer so they relented and this  
is how embrogno got the whole story and it's an  incredible story turns out there was a week a  
sighting a week before it and again this react  this object was hovering over the same reactor  
and eventually uh they inspected this reactor  and found what appeared to be some sort  
of irregularity so it could be this ufo is there  for a reason trying to help or at least send  
some sort of a message but the story doesn't end  there phillip and brogno has talked to witnesses  
who've said they've seen actual gray et's  moving through the walls and moving around this  
base and also when this object showed  up on and hovered over reactor 3  
it shut down the base's entire security system  all the computers went dark and uh all the alarms  
were no longer functional so it could have also  been some sort of a display of their ability  
to shut this nuclear power base down if they  wanted to hard to say so philip and brogno got  
a lot of repercussions he says from investigating  this incident he was warned to not research it by  
the new york power authority he says and he began  to get audited by the irs year several years in  
a row and as he says and i'm quoting it's hard to  believe that people like john lear and bill cooper  
are revealing top secret information with little  or no repercussions i just poked my nose a little  
too deep into an area of national security and i  got my ears pinned back for it if i really wanted  
to go into this with no fear of what would happen  to me i'm sure there's an incredible story here   i'm still being given information about certain  things in the night time people seeing little  
creatures coming through the walls of the  casing on the reactor and military personnel  
indicating we're aware of these creatures and we  don't care if they're from outer space shoot them  
so an incredible case and one finally one more  tiny little event because i just i i have to  
mention it this occurred on august 25th 1985 when  a man by the name of greg boone who was actually a  
reporter for the pukekeepsi journal was uh in the  offices of the newspaper with 10 other reporters  
when this huge object comes traveling leisurely by  the building within just a few hundred feet they  
all saw it and they quickly wrote up a news story  to report it thinking this was going to be front  
page news and were shocked when their superiors  quashed the story they nixed it and didn't want  
to talk about it and that the next day men in  suits came up and told them not to talk about it  
so definitely a huge huge event the hudson valley  ufo wave and that's why i gave it number two  
and now we get to number one drum  roll it is the 1965 new york blackout  
some of you may be surprised that i  chose this one but i think it's the most   influential ufo event in new york history  and that's why i gave it the number one spot  
on september 22 1965 there was  a wave of sightings over buffalo  
lewiston clarence niagara north tonawanda  this appears to be the preliminary sort of  
beginning of this wave of sightings which was  about to occur and caused this huge huge event  
it was one and a half months later on november 9th  1965 that had happened the great new york blackout  
this was one of the largest power blackouts  in united states history it involved 80  
000 square miles 5 million homes 36 million people  and affected about one-fifth of the u.s population  
actually including my own father he was there  officials eventually tracked the problem that  
caused the blackout to a faulty relay at the sir  adam beck plant in number two in clay new york  
however at the same time there was  a lot of reports coming in of ufos  
uh not just a few hundreds from  all across this area and it's  
clearly connected to these this power blackout  because it occurred at exactly the same time
the night before this whole incident there was a  sighting a bunch of boys saw a ufo moving over the  
syracuse dormitory dormitory but on november  9 1965 at the time in this blackout robert c  
walsh the deputy city aviation commissioner in  syracuse was flying at 1500 feet over the city  
when the power went out he immediately landed and  observed along with several others a 50 foot wide  
glowing spherical object rise up and take off  overhead at about 100 feet elevation at the  
same time of the robert walsh sighting there was  another pilot who saw it was flight instructor  
weldon ross and his student james brooking they  were flying over syracuse airport and watched as  
this object actually followed the telephone  wires towards the niagara falls power plant  
many many witnesses some of high level  one great witness is church sexton  
william stillwell of saint paul's episcopal  church he had a 117 power telescope  
and these objects showed up and he observed  them through his telescope for a period of  
about two hours he was actually able to take  several photos two of which were published  
in the new york herald journal and turned out he  had been seeing these objects for several months  
since august four months earlier and was afraid  to tell people because of how they would react  
many people took photographs of this object  including a photographer for life magazine by  
the name of arthur rickerby uh he was there when  the blackout occurred ran outside he and hundreds  
of other people saw this object he snapped a photo  which was actually published in life magazine in  
the november 19 1965 issue there are other photos  one report comes from researcher antonio hunius  
who writes and i'm quoting many ufos were taken  around the period of the great blackout of 1965  
including one that shows a totally black  saucer-shaped figure flying very close  
to the empire state building precisely at  the point of the huge antenna at the top
there are far too many witnesses to to list here  but there are some famous ones renato paccini he  
worked with the symphony orchestra in indianapolis  he and a bunch of other people saw six objects
families came running out of their homes  people saw this while driving down the highway  
and it was not only seen in syracuse but  in surrounding areas such as mattysdale and  
literally they found out surrounding states  the syracuse herald journal received more than  
100 reports of ufos in the days and weeks that  followed mostly from syracuse in this one area  
but all over uh the surrounding states where all  this power had gone off so it wasn't apparently  
just one object it was many many objects and this  is where it gets really interesting and here's an  
aspect of the new york blackout story that i don't  think a lot of people know about and one of the  
reasons i gave it first place this comes from an  a witness an actor by the name of stuart whitman  
and he tells an incredible story according to  stuart whitman he was in his 12-story new york  
hotel room when he heard his name being called  like a loudspeaker in english and he saw two  
egg-shaped objects hovering outside the window one  was blue one was orange these were fairly large  
then this voice shouted out to whitman that  he was being contacted because he had no   malice or hatred and these et's if that's what  they were gave him this message and i'll just  
quote stuart whitman here because it's a pretty  amazing story as he says they were concerned about  
our continued use of uncontrolled nuclear weapons  and about the chaos and lack of morality now in  
existence on our planet they informed me that they  will definitely interfere if we go too far in our  
war-like attitudes they claim that they are able  to stop all electrical apparatus from functioning  
and could put a halt to our normal  everyday activities anytime they wanted to   the voice proceeded to tell stuart that they had  contacted other people apparently no one else has  
come forth but according to stuart whitman and i'm  quoting again they gave their message to all those  
with ears that will hear they they told him  that the blackout had been a demonstration  
but that their only concern was the welfare of  humanity as stuart whitman says again i'm quoting  
they requested that i attempt to assist in  any possible manner their campaign to wipe out  
racial prejudice hatred bigotry and war from our  planet i was not frightened but strangely elated  
i had no fear as i somehow knew they would do  me no harm i don't know why they picked me as  
a contact but i'll swear on a bible that i  saw them out there and that they talk to me
so many many witnesses in a very complicated case  many researchers have looked into this ralph and  
judy bloom looked into it immediately after it  happened and learned that it was causing waves  
at very high levels officials were concerned  that it was as stuart whitman had said a  
demonstration of their power and uh this  caused waves all the way up to congress  
in 1968 three years later congress held a  congressional hearing on ufos and the great  
new york blackout certainly came up researcher  james mcdonald was one of the presenters  
and he definitely had something to say about what  happened on that night and i'll quote him here  
as he says dr heineck would probably be the most  appropriate man to describe the manhattan sighting  
since he interviewed several witnesses  involved i interviewed a woman in seacliff   new york she saw a disc hovering and going  up and down and then shooting away from new  
york just after the power failure i went  to the federal power commission for data  
they didn't take them seriously although they had  many dozens of sighting reports for that evening  
there were reports all over new england in the  midst of that blackout and five witnesses near  
syracuse saw a glowing object ascending  within about a minute of the blackout  
mcdonald reported several other cases to the  congressional officials and then concluded his  
report by saying and again i'm quoting just  how a ufo could trigger an outage on a large  
power network is however not yet clear but  this is a disturbing series of coincidences  
that i think weren't much more  attention than they have so far received  
congressman ryan was listening to mcdonald  and asked mcdonald as far as you know has  
any agency investigated the new york blackout  in relation to ufos james mcdonald replied  
none at all there is no one looking at  this relation between ufos and outages  
congressman ryan then asked one final question  he says one final question do you think it is  
imperative that the federal power commission or  federal communications commission investigate  
the relationship between the sightings  and the blackout dr mcdonald replied my  
position would call for a somewhat weaker  adjective i'd say extremely desirable  
so that's my list of the top 20 cases in new york  i researched all these cases for my book ufos over  
new york there were lots of others i wanted to  include but as you can see this is already gone  
way too long i hope i've included the most  important cases and uh for those of you have  
stuck around all the way to the end thanks very  much and hope you enjoyed it and keep having fun
