UFO INCIDENT ON THE USS CLAMAGORE
Nov 14, 2020

Summary:
Nov 14, 2020
UFOs have often been seen over nuclear power stations, nuclear missile sites, and anything associated with nuclear energy. In 1971, the USS Clamagore, a Navy submarine equipped with nuclear torpedoes, encountered  a UFO, or actually a USO (an unidentified submersible object) which approached the sub and paced it for fifteen minutes. 

This incredible encounter is only one of many, many instances in which UFOs and USOs have been encountered by the US Navy. This video presents the UFO Incident on the USS Clamagore, as well as four other incredible UFO/USO encounters by Navy and other military personnel.  Some of these encounters include a sighting by the crew of the USS Long Beach (a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser,) a fascinating USO sighting by two retired Navy submariners near San Simeon, California, a highly dramatic USO sighting witnessed by dozens of people off the coast of Redondo Beach, California, and finally a visitation by a fleet of glowing donut-shaped USOs by a US Coast Guard Captain off the coast of Haiti.

In some cases, these UFO events went unrecorded or were actively covered up. This raises the question, how often does our Navy encounter UFOs and USOs and never reveal it? As these cases shows, perhaps more than you might think!

Until recently, there has been very little research into USOs. And yet, if these and other cases are true, then our oceans could be swarming with large numbers of alien craft, most of which remain unseen by human eyes.

It is time for disclosure of all UFO information. These incidents and others should be known by everyone! If you would like to learn more about these and other remarkable USO encounters, please check out my book, "Undersea UFO Base," available on Amazon.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and today i'd like to talk to you about a ufo  
incident on the uss klamagar a navy submarine  this is actually a uso encounter with an  
unidentified submersible object it's an incredible  case in which this ufo this uso approached and  
paced a navy submarine for several minutes  so that's what i'd like to talk about today  
that and four other encounters involving usos  and mostly navy personnel but we'll start with  
the uss klamagar because it's to me i think  uh the most dramatic case of this bunch but  
actually they're all pretty amazing uh this  case with the uss klamagar occurred in 1971  
the main witness the guy i talked to is ray sax  ray joined the navy in 1969 at age 18. he became  
an electrician's mate and was at first stationed  on the uss dog fish another navy submarine  
but the u.s navy decided to sell the dogfish  to the brazilian navy and ray was transferred  
as an electrician's mate to the uss and  here's where things got really interesting  
turns out the uss klamagar carried two mark  45 anti-submarine torpedoes in the after tubes  
mark 45s are nuclear torpedoes they're designed  by the navy to be used against high-speed  
deep diving enemy submarines and each one weighs  about 2400 pounds and contains a nuclear warhead  
that can hit a target up to eight miles distant  so the clamour gore not only carried these it  
had been recently modernized and now carried the  most advanced ranging sonar available at that time  
so it was aboard this submarine the klamagur  that ray and uh well frankly all the people on  
the submarine had an incredible encounter again  this is 1971 the uss klamagour was heading north  
in the atlantic ocean traveling on the surface  on this particular evening ray had been assigned  
watch duty with another petty officer so ray was  up there with the other officer the deck officer  
and the commander of the submarine peter b boyne  and without warning the submarine was approached  
from the stern from behind by a very fast-moving  glowing object beneath the surface of the water  
and i'll just let ray sax describe what  happened in his own words as he says  
this object closed from dead of stern and  slightly to our right it closed in at an  
extremely high speed in excess of 80 knots  and it closed until it got right next to us  
then it went from 80 knots to matching  us at 12 knots so 80 knots is faster than  
our own submarines can go certainly it was  clear that this was an unidentified object  
very advanced it was totally silent and had  just actually matched their speed perfectly very  
quickly so the deck officer turned to ray because  rey was in touch with the people in the sonar room  
and the deck officer turns to rey and asks him  what is the contact and ray just shook his head  
and said that the sonar sonar guys were telling  him that they couldn't see anything and he joked  
well maybe it's captain nemo in the nautilus uh  the deck officer did not think that was very funny  
all four guys were just staring at this thing  in complete shock they had no idea what it  
could possibly be it was totally silent and  at this point all the guys in the sonar room  
they wanted to see it so they came up on deck and  observed it and the other uh petty officers also  
or the junior officers rather also wanted to see  this object so they came up and observed this  
thing which continued to pace their submarine and  i'll just let ray describe as he says it sat there  
for 15 minutes while our sonar crew all of the  officers and the captain included were staring  
into the water at this 50-foot diameter light  and trying to figure out what the heck it was
so the object paced the submarine for about  15 minutes all the officers had to return to  
their stations and at some point this object just  darts away again at very high speed as ray says  
the object just left and it left just like you see  a ufo in the air going from a dead stop to high  
speed and just gone about two miles out it did a  45 degree right hand turn and it continued about  
18 miles out until you couldn't see it anymore and  it was moving fast it just boogied out of sight  
so he estimates it was moving somewhere in excess  of 50 knots this time just a tiny bit slower and  
moving at right angles again something our own  uh submarines cannot do they cannot move at that  
speed and they can't turn at right angles  and quote boogie out of sight so it was cl  
very clear to all of them that this was a very  unusual situation a very unusual object and the  
deck officer he was getting angry because rey and  the other lookout were just jibber-jabbering about  
what they had just seen they were talking about  this object how large it was how bright it was  
how to pace the submarine and was totally  silent and what could it be and the deck  
officer turns to both of them and says do  you guys mind shutting up so they uh shut up  
as their superior ordered and the deck  officer now turns to commander peter boyne  
and according to ray the deck officer uh says how  do i write this up in the log sir and commander  
peter boyne replies officers who write up  contacts like this do not get to advance in rank
so apparently this was never recorded at all in  the official log books at this point the deck  
officer turns to rey and the other lookout and  says i don't want you guys spreading this around  
the crew and after their lookout ended ray went  below deck with the other officer and he both of  
them were immediately besieged by their fellow  shipmates who all wanted to know what they had  
seen it was the buzz of the entire ship everyone  in the crew of the uss klamagour apparently  
according to ray knew about this thing and it  was just a really incredible encounter that very  
nearly what did not go recorded in any capacity  i'm really glad ray decided to come forward  
and share what happened because apparently  this was covered up by the uss navy it's  
my theory that the uso was interested in  the uss klamagar because of the nuclear  
torpedoes it carried and this is a pattern we  see in other ufo cases where ufos and usos show  
an interest in anything nuclear whether it's  a nuclear power station or nuclear missiles  
or what have you interestingly that was not  the only weird incident that happened there  
was another incident where all power on  board the submarine completely failed  
uh this should be impossible because there are  numerous back up systems to prevent this from  
happening and it was totally unexplained  and thankfully it was only a very brief  
instance but ray thought it was important to  mention because it might be related to all this  
so that's an incredible case and there are  many others i'd like to talk about another  
incident which happened in february of  1983 off the coast of catalina island the  
outward facing uh coast of catalina  island the main witness is dr  
gary wagner who contacted me after hearing about  my uso research and wanted to share his experience  
which occurred on board the uss long beach which  is a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser  
and i'll just let gary describe what happened  in his own words this is gary talking while in  
the u.s navy we patrolled on the outward side  of catalina one evening after a thunderstorm  
i was a lookout at the time and had direct  communication to the ship's radar operators  
and the ship's bridge i and approximately 15 to  20 of my shipmates witnessed a ufo approximately  
three miles away outbound from catalina it  was a light shaped like a half moon with a  
notch cut out of the bottom middle part it  changed in size from large to very small  
while maintaining the same relative  shape it also changed in visual intensity  
it would blink rapidly then remain lit and then  it would change size and blinking frequency  
this occurred for about 15 minutes i asked  the radar operators what they saw on the scope  
they had no surface contact on radar when i asked  the bridge what it was the sailor at the other  
side of the headset said the bridge officers  are too busy looking at the object themselves  
so gary was not able to obtain any other  information from uh the people on the bridge or  
his other officers as to what this thing was  but he definitely believes it was unusual it was  
not the first time he had seen a ufo while in the  navy uh once while he was in patrol in the indian  
ocean he and about six other sailors watched two  very fast moving lights streak across the sky  
from one end to the other and he was in  touch with the radar operator at the time  
and asked him what the air contact was the radar  officer didn't respond instead another officer  
came on the line and said you did  not see anything and gary of course  
uh didn't talk about it after that but he like uh  other witnesses feel that this sort of information  
is important enough that it should be revealed  and i totally agree i mean these are amazing cases  
another case i'd like to talk about is actually  a classic case this occurred in 1956 long before  
i had arrived on this planet so i wasn't able to  interview the witnesses firsthand but it's such an  
incredible case that i thought i would talk about  it here because it's not super well known and it  
deserves to be this incident occurred on february  9 1956 off the coast of redondo beach it started  
around 1 30 a.m when residents of the area as  well as police officers from both hermosa beach  
and redondo beach as well as lifeguards saw  this object come swooping down out of the sky  
it was described as being about 10 to 20  feet in size bright and fiery glowing orange  
and it came down in a kind of gliding  or swooping uh pattern and landed on  
the surface of the ocean about 100 to  300 feet off the coast of redondo beach  
while this was much earlier than today the  area was by no means isolated and numerous  
people saw this soon there was a crowd of people  watching it including police officers marvin poor  
and john freeland and jack hopkins one of  the residents who saw it was martin dumbrell  
and some of the lifeguards you saw was lieutenant  frank rodicker and ted davis so there's a whole  
group of people watching this thing and it's  just hovering there for about 20 minutes or  
so on the surface it's very bright at some point  it sinks below the surface of the water and they  
can still see its brightness but now the water is  becoming all frothy and foamy and so at this point  
one of the officers jack hopkins calls the redondo  beach police station and requests a geiger counter  
shortly later the geiger counter arrives and  lieutenant frank rodicker and another lifeguard  
row out to this thing and actually go right over  it and as frank rodeker says it was a big thing  
it was maybe 15 feet across and it was still  glowing down there under the water almost  
until we got there unfortunately or as if in  response this object winked out right when  
the lifeguards approached so they weren't  able to get a real good look at it close up  
and they took out the geiger counter  and did not get any readings from it  
they decided they'd after searching around a  little bit they rode back to shore at which point  
uh one of the witnesses martin dumbrell joked  with them and said maybe the martians saw you  
and turned out the lights which yeah may be  a joke but could be not far from the truth  
one of the lifeguards ted davis he joked  and said or maybe they already waited ashore
so a very interesting case and it generated a lot  of attention the next morning there were still  
witnesses there there were reporters  people wanted to know what happened  
and this object made no reappearance however  the navy decided that they would send out  
a couple of divers to investigate the area and  that's exactly what they did after the sun rose  
two lifeguards donned their scuba diving  gear one of them was lieutenant don hill  
another was a really well-known diver by  the name of bob maestral a diving expert  
and together the two of them went out  there to see if they could find anything  
and surprisingly they came back with something  about 40 minutes later after diving they returned  
claiming that they had found the culprit the ufo  they said was not a ufo at all it was in fact a us  
signal core c search flashlight with a special  water battery this flashlight actually has a  
sensor which turns on the flashlight automatically  after three minutes of being exposed to water  
and it burns for about one hour so this was the  explanation released to the press to explain  
this incident or in my opinion to debunk  it and other ufo researchers of course have  
looked into this incident and they don't buy this  explanation offered by officials for one second  
one researcher who looked into this  is idabel epperson and as she writes  
as usual there are discrepancies and the  reader is left with unanswered questions  
the police officers reported that the object  was a glow before it hit the water there  
was also no explanation as to what kept the  solid object afloat for 20 minutes or longer  
and then automatically caused it to sink if  something kept it afloat why did it finally sink  
another researcher who looked into this  was leonard stringfield a very prominent  
researcher and well respected i think and he  totally agreed with itabel epperson and added  
and i quote nobody heard or saw the aircraft which  may have dropped the searchlight and according to  
the picture of the searchlight supposedly found  the half inch bulb certainly would not appear  
as a ball of fire as reported by several observers  so the explanation offered is an incomplete  
contradiction to the known facts that this was  a very large fiery glowing disc shaped object  
which glided down out of the sky and floated  on the surface of the water for 20 minutes  
and was described as being  anywhere from 15 to 20 feet across  
uh so clearly not a flashlight and it's  unfortunate that this was the explanation  
offered uh whatever the case leonard stringfield  did find out that the navy knew this was not  
a searchlight or flashlight of any kind  he found official documentation in 1957  
which stated only quote fireball hits water  submerges so obviously not a flashlight  
but one of many other cases i'd like to talk  about just a couple more one guy i interviewed  
told me a very impressive story uh his  name is paul uh he's also an ex-navy guy  
he and another ex-navy guy decided that  they were going to convoy a boat up the  
california coast this was in the 1990s and uh  they are both uh ex-navy submar submariners  
uh not only uh in the navy but guiding submarines  navigating submarines and piloting the submarines  
so they're very familiar uh with ocean-going  craft to say the least and our trained observers  
and uh they're heading north up in this  just a small yacht not a very large boat  
they started out dana point and got all the way  up to san simeon this is late at night it's a  
dark stormy night when suddenly off the coast just  a short distance off the coast maybe a few hundred  
yards they saw a very bright object what appeared  to be a boat of some kind except no boat that they  
had ever seen before first of all this object  was in an area where it shouldn't or couldn't  
be because it was very rocky and boats were not  allowed to go there you would be destroyed so they  
couldn't figure that part out and also it just did  not look like a normal boat at all it had none of  
the normal navigation lights at all was very large  like the size of a tanker according to the radar  
and extremely bright and they're looking at this  thing trying to figure out what the heck it is  
when suddenly their depth sounder which gauges  their uh the depth of the ocean beneath them  
suddenly read out a depth of 15 feet they  knew this couldn't be true because they  
knew their position and yet they couldn't  take any chances they took emergency action  
and immediately turned their boat left  out towards c to increase their depth  
so you know they wouldn't run against any rocks  and once they their death sounder read a normal  
depth uh they turned their attention back  to this object and were shocked because it  
was no longer in the same position it had moved  about one to two miles they estimate and was now  
much deeper out into sea and was in fact directly  in front of their boat and heading towards them  
they stopped moving and just let this thing  whatever it was approach them which it did  
it approached them in a distance of less  than a mile which at c is uh very close  
uh he estimates it was about three-fourths of a  mile and it approached on the port on the left  
side and it was too bright for him to make out  any kind of hole structure at all until it got  
to about broadside of them you know until it drew  up right alongside them and then they could just  
make out that this thing was at least 600 feet  long and it had what appeared to be about 30 or  
40 extremely bright stadium lights scattered all  over it uh it was very strange it stopped there at  
this point then that really freaked them out and  they at some point became so frightened they moved  
on uh so they don't know what it was and still  don't know what it was to this day all i know  
is this wasn't ours and it wasn't anything normal  and uh there's a lot of cases of these usos let me  
just tell you about one more uh from another  really amazing witness this occurred in 2004  
call the witness rick baker that's not his real  name and this occurred off the coast of haiti  
or the dominican dominican republic area that  area and it's a very interesting incident  
there were three witnesses they were on a former  navy boat a 65-foot decommissioned navy boat  
rick the main witness that uh i interviewed is a  certified scuba diver nitrox certified in not only  
basic diving but advanced open water and he's also  a licensed coast guard captain so a great witness  
and uh they had a very terrifying encounter  they had just survived a life-threatening  
storm they literally thought they might sink but  thankfully they survived it and were heading in  
for a port to find shelter as this storm blew  itself out and this is when this very weird  
incident occurred suddenly beneath their boat  they saw a very large glowing turquoise blue
object it was donut shaped uh he estimates it was  about 20 to 50 feet in size it was hard to tell  
because i couldn't see how deep it was and it  winked out and suddenly there was another one it  
turned on and it was closer and then it winked up  and then there was another one and these were all  
identical looking all giant kind of blue green  donuts very artificial looking uh they appeared  
to have a very dark center all you could see was  this glowing ring of light around the perimeter  
it could have been actual donuts or solid objects  he couldn't tell for sure because this was at  
night and they became very alarmed because these  objects started swarming their boat and it wasn't  
just one or two there were dozens of these  things blinking on and off beneath their boat  
some very close he estimates within 10  feet of their boat and some much deeper and  
maybe about a hundred feet the deeper ones  looked smaller and were dimmer and the close  
ones of course were very bright and very large  again he estimates uh 20 feet maybe even 50 feet  
uh all three of the men had no  idea what these things could be  
all of them were very alarmed none of  them had any prior experience with ufos  
or usos so they really did not know  what they were looking at they were  
pretty confident this was not any kind of navy  experiment because it was a very isolated area  
and there's no evidence of navy activities in  this area so they pretty much discounted that  
uh not only because of that but because of the  way these objects were behaving swarming around  
their boat and that's these objects followed  and swarmed around their boat for a few moments  
long enough to you know scare them pretty  badly and finally moved off or just disappeared  
and these guys decided they were still going to  head directly into the closest port that they  
could find which they did they took anchor  in about 40 feet of water and were shocked  
to see one of these donut shaped objects suddenly  zoom up towards their boat again from underneath  
but very bright went under the boat and  disappeared so very strange rick contacted me  
because he wanted to know if i had ever heard or  seen anything like this and i had to tell him no  
i don't have any case quite like this but  i have many similar cases in which usos do  
target voters and it certainly seemed to target  his vote in this case he wondered if it might  
be some sort of marine life and uh you know i  looked i couldn't find any type of marine life  
that at all matched uh his description of what  these guys saw so these are just a few of the many  
uso accounts i have researched i wrote about  these cases and others in my book undersea ufo  
base that book focuses mostly on uso activity  off the southern california coast and i tried  
to put forth in sort of a case for a possible  existence of an undersea ufo base in this area  
but the book does cover other cases around the  world because it does appear that our oceans  
are swimming with usos and there's all kinds of  activity going on beneath the water beneath the  
surface of the waves that we don't see and  certainly the navy isn't talking at least  
not in an official capacity so i'm really grateful  to these whistleblowers who have come forth and  
spoken with me and other investigators and shared  what they know about these objects that are  
swarming around in our oceans and they  felt it was important to talk about  
and let people know and so do i and  that's why i put together this video  
uh so once again i hope you enjoyed it thanks  very much for listening and keep having fun
