ET E.R. - FIVE TRUE CASES OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL HEALING
Sep 23, 2022

Summary:
Sep 23, 2022
Healings are a consistent feature of UFO encounters, and they are more common than most people realize. Cases reach back more than 100 years and come from across the world. They cover a wide variety of injuries, illnesses and diseases. Most major UFO researchers have multiple cases. This video presents five true cases of people who have been healed by extraterrestrials.

CASE ONE: DIPHTHERIA. From researcher David Jacobs, Ph.D., in 1962, Alice Haggerty of Trenton, New Jersey was struck with the sometimes fatal disease diphtheria. For religious reasons, her parents had not inoculated her against the disease. When her condition worsened, they called in a doctor who cared for her as best as he could. Unfortunately, Alice's condition deteriorated. Alice became so sick that she was not expected to live through the night. On that evening, Alice was visited by ETs, taken onboard and healed. The next morning, she was fully recovered, amazing both her parents and the doctor.

CASE TWO: HERNIA. In 2000, Jim Law from Gainesville, Florida developed an inguinal hernia. After being diagnosed by a specialist, Jim elected to have surgery. However, before the surgery, he was visited by three gray ETs. Jim asked the grays to heal him, and to his surprise, they said, “We know of the condition you have a concern about and will help you.” Which they did! Jim then asked them why they had contacted him, and the grays said, "We are interested in you because you have the genetic potential to live a long time.” Jim was fascinated because longevity was in his family. At the time, his grandfather was 106 years old, and his aunt and great grandmother both lived to 109.

CASE THREE: SEPARATED ACHILLES TENDON. In 2005, Michael Thomas Knox (a former Air Force officer) attended the MUFON UFO conference in Irvine, California. At the time, he had been diagnosed with a separated Achilles tendon. Doctors told him that he required surgery to repair his condition. However, while staying at the conference, Knox was visited in his hotel room by three grays who performed surgery on him. Knox had no memory of this, but his roommate saw it all. She reported that they were both taken onboard a craft as were several other people at the conference. They received further confirmation of the event the next morning when they discovered strange bruises and marks, and also unexplained fluorescent stains in their hotel room. Also, another group of witnesses reported seeing a UFO hovering directly over the hotel that evening!

CASE FOUR: BODY INJURIES. In 1960, electrical engineer, Vlado Victor Kapetanovic was hunting in the Callejon de Hauylas region of rural Peru. Traveling with a guide, they both had multiple sightings of strange metallic discs zipping through the sky. They came upon a remote village of native Peruvians and discovered that a young boy had recently fallen off a cliff and was suffering from severe injuries which had left him comatose and on the edge of death. Victor offered to transport the boy to a hospital many miles away. The parents refused, saying that the "sky gods" would come and heal the boy. Victor's guide explained that the people of the village were regularly visited by ETs who took care of them. And sure enough, a short time later, a UFO landed, and a beautiful human-looking figure exited the craft. She scooped up the boy and took him inside the craft. Shortly later, the boy came out perfectly healed. Victor verified the healing and then spoke with the ET woman. She invited him onboard the craft. This began a series of contacts with the ETs which altered the course of Victor's life.

CASE FIVE: In 1971, Gilbert Camus, a radio engineer from Gevingey, France was driving along the highway near the village of Trenal when he encountered a landed UFO and more than 20 strange-looking figures. Gilbert was then struck by a beam of light which took control of his car, slowing its speed to a crawl. A short time later, the beam retracted, and Gilbert continued on his way. Arriving home, Gilbert found strange marks on his body and his underclothes. Returning to the site of the encounter the next day, he found strange depressions and melted ice. Also, the paint on his Peugeot began to fade. Most amazing, at the time of the encounter, Gilbert was suffering from chronic liver disease. His condition was causing loss of appetite and unbearably painful headaches. However, following the encounter, his health problems disappeared. He had been healed!

These five cases are just a tiny portion of the more than 300 healings on record. One of the primary ET missions is the healing of humanity. If you would like to learn more about these cases and others, check out my book, "The Healing Power of UFOs." Now available!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today i'd like to talk about ufo healings and the title of this episode is e-t-e-r five true 
cases of extraterrestrial healings ufo healings are far more common than people realize i've 
documented some 300 cases reaching back over a hundred years and coming from all over the planet 
most major researchers have cases of this kind and these cases are not getting the attention 
they deserve i've come to believe that this is one of the main agendas of extraterrestrials 
and this is the main purpose behind a lot of on-board ufo encounters 
people are describing being physically examined and what's happening is they're actually being 
healed their health is being checked up on and maintained and in some cases 
healed and the conditions being healed are a very wide variety of conditions including injuries and 
illnesses infections uh cuts bruises i mean you name it very serious diseases as well as minor 
conditions and chronic diseases as well i have five cases which i think really show 
how truly advanced these ets are and show how this is in fact one of their main agendas so that's 
what i'd like to talk about today these five cases come from across the united states in the world 
and the first case i'd like to talk about is a healing of the disease known as diphtheria this is 
a very serious condition sometimes fatal and this case comes from researcher david jacobs in 1962 
alice hagerty of trenton new jersey was struck with the sometimes fatal disease of diphtheria 
and because of a religious background she had not been vaccinated against this disease and for 
the same religious reasons her parents refused to take her to the hospital they did call in a doctor 
who said that alice's condition was in fact very serious but still alice's parents refused to seek 
conventional treatment over the next two weeks alice's condition deteriorated the 
doctor visited her daily by the end of two weeks he told alice's mother 
that he did not expect her to live through the night however alex happened to be a ufo contactee 
and she would eventually have several contacts throughout her life but on the evening in 
question alice was apparently taken on board by friendly et's which at the time she believed 
were angels and in fact she described them as quote angels in white robes with silver belts 
alice remembers being transported into a small rounded room presumably a ufo craft where the et's 
holder she would in fact be cured and they waved a small quote rod like device around her body 
and then had her stand inside a large blue cylinder with a little window a porthole 
and the et's watched as a bright light was emitted from the top of this machine this 
device until it was about eight inches from the top of alice's head the light then retracted and 
alice was instructed to exit the cylinder and according to david jacobs the aliens and i quote 
informed her in a matter-of-fact manner that she was now cured and cleansed 
alice then underwent more of the typical procedures that are often performed on board ufos 
and the next morning alice's mother found her playing on the floor as if everything was normal 
alice was ordered into bed by her mother and her doctor but both quickly realized that her 
condition of diphtheria was completely and totally gone and later on having experienced many other 
contacts she realized that this first one was in fact a genuine contact with extraterrestrials 
later she believed she had been implanted and she became a subject in david jacobs book 
secret life the second case i'd like to talk about is a healing of a hernia 
this case took place in gainesville florida and the main witness in this case is gentleman by 
the name of jim law it's a very well verified case so jim law is an attorney from gainesville florida 
and i'd just like to quote his testimony of what happened to him so this is jim law talking i quote 
sometime in the later part of the year 2000 i began having a strange dull pain 
in my left groin area i passed it off as having possibly strained myself working out at the gym 
i hoped that whatever i had would just go away and put up with it for several months sometimes 
it didn't bother me but it got really aggravated whenever i worked out on weight at the local 
gym and i began to suspect that i had a hernia and i made an appointment for a full physical 
and on 11 9 2000 dr fein of gainesville florida performed a full physical and 
determined that i had a hernia and recommended that i see a urologist for further consultation 
i made the appointment with a person by the name of dr senden dr sendin performed an 
examination and determined that i had an inguinal hernia on the left side in recommended surgery 
the surgery date was set up for february 23 2001 at the surgical group of gainesville florida 
i was to arrive at 10 30 for pre-op before the 12 30 surgery it was to be a mesh repair 
for a hernia in the left groin area and i have all the medical records to verify all of the 
information i stated above the doctor said that i should go ahead and have the hernia operated 
on as it will never just go away people try support belts and exercises without success and 
the younger i am the faster i will heal and the more i will enjoy life without the nagging pain 
about a week or so before the surgery date i awoke in the middle of the night with a strong feeling that something or someone other than my girlfriend was in my room
so it should be stated here that jim does have a history of encounters 
and in fact in 1963 when he was about five years old he saw a ufo hovering over 
lake minnetonka minnesota that was his first clue that there was something going on with him 
but he really didn't understand but throughout his life he did have more encounters in his thirties 
he began having really weird experiences such as his burglar alarm being triggered in the middle of 
the night he developed an unexplained fear of intruders and there were other strange things 
going on but it wasn't until this incident in 2001 when he sensed a presence in his room that 
he really began to connect the dots and again i'd just like to quote jyn in his own words 
as jim says in my mind i saw three figures grey-colored with big almond eyes the typical 
thing that many abductees report seeing they entered the room apparently through the wall 
at first i was startled but i got a grip on my feelings slowed my heart rate and i told them 
if they wish to continue visiting me then they needed to do something for me or i would make them 
go away i think they understood what i meant they or one of them said to me we know of the condition 
you have a concern about and will help you one of them pointed a shiny object about a foot long 
at the area of my hernia i don't remember feeling anything i do remember asking them 
why they visited me like this they or one of them said we are interested in you because you have the 
genetic potential to live a long time i must state for fact that my grandfather is a very healthy 
105 years old born in 1898 he has lived in three centuries and works out in the yard every day 
walks without a cane and looks better than most 80 year olds and in fact i am writing 
a book about him titled living beyond 100 and his mother and her sister lived to 109 years old 
so i can see why they would be interested to this day february 2004 i do not have a hernia 
i have had three physicals since then so this is a very well verified case of a healing of a hernia 
in 2003 jim decided to use regressive hypnosis to investigate this incident and others 
and discovered through hypnotic regression that he had some 27 encounters throughout his life 
i like this case not only because it's very well verified but it shows that et's do have an agenda 
to heal people maintain their health and are in fact interested in longevity it makes me wonder 
perhaps the increase in longevity over the past couple of hundred years might be due in some part 
to extraterrestrial intervention the third case i'd like to talk about involves the healing of a 
ruptured achilles attention and the main witness in this case is a former air force officer by the 
name of michael thomas knox and this case took place in irvine california it actually took place 
at the hotel irvine during a mufon ufo conference and by coincidence i was attending this conference 
as one of the speakers so i was in the same hotel where this healing actually took place 
i love this case because this involves a very reputable witness and multiple witnesses as well 
on the days of september 24 to 27 2015 mufon field investigator thomas michael knox 
as i said a former air force officer attended the mufon conference in irvine california 
this was at the hotel irvine and in the evening he retired to his hotel room 
at this time he had recently torn his achilles tendon in his left leg doctors told him that 
it was in fact completely separated and that he needed surgery it would not heal on its own 
but the next morning knox woke up to find that his leg was no longer in pain 
and in fact he felt completely healed there were however strange marks on his leg 
and knox's roommate at in the hotel room was a young woman who i'll call melissa she is anonymous 
and she was amazed and proceeded to tell him an incredible story that had happened that same evening she had come into the room around 11 pm 
and thomas michael knox was already asleep at that time and as melissa says and i quote 
i fell asleep quickly around approximately midnight i was woken up and felt like i 
was floating out of the hotel room i remembered standing outside of the hotel room on the rooftop 
looking back into the window at my roommate lying in bed inside the room with him i could see three 
grey aliens standing by his bed holding his leg and giving him some sort of injection i was 
pounding on the window yelling for him to wake up and melissa told uh knox that he was fighting them 
kicking and yelling and she said that both of them were actually taken on board along with several 
other people that she recognized from the mufon conference some of who she said were well known 
so these are people who were putting on the conference and some of the speakers as well 
so they were both taken up inside what she described as a cigar-shaped craft 
and as melissa says and i quote at least seven other people were also removed from the hotel 
and boarded into the cigar-shaped craft on board all of us were placed in chairs which resembled 
beauty salon chairs with hair dryers above them we were all restrained in the chairs and the parts 
that looked like a hair dryer was placed over each one of our heads and it fit very snugly 
so melissa had the impression that the ets were allowing the people in the chairs to transfer 
mental information between each other she counted at least 20 gray et's on board the craft 
and she says that after this apparent information transfer procedure some of these people were also 
physically examined and then afterwards everyone was returned to their hotel room 
so later that morning after having flashbacks of all of this melissa told michael what happened 
and michael himself remembered nothing other than sleeping quote like the dead but after melissa had 
these memories and michael realized he was healed together they located a black light and used it 
to examine their hotel room and himself and they found that he had weird phosphorescent particles 
on his leg they also appeared on her pajamas and her bed and at various spots throughout the room 
there were also what appeared to be three strange fingerprints on uh michael's leg and a round red mark the size of a quarter on thomas michael's leg i should say 
and what's also very interesting is there was further corroboration of this event because 
later melissa heard a report that people had seen a ufo directly over the hotel irvine on that same 
evening so this was a pretty incredible encounter and melissa did report what happened to her 
to mufon and the national ufo reporting center new fork and later mike knox spoke publicly 
about his encounter at a later conference so this was very interesting to me because i was 
speaking at that conference i remember waking up that next morning and feeling somewhat unwell 
which makes me wonder who were the other people who had been taken on board but that's really 
all the information i have on that case but it's a very interesting case because uh thomas michael 
knox being a former air force officer and a mufon field investigator is a really good witness and 
that's why i wanted to present this case the fourth case i'd like to talk about involves a 
not an anonymous boy who was healed of multiple body injuries he had injured himself very badly 
due to a fall and it actually lapsed into a coma and the main witness in this case is 
an electrical engineer by the name of victor cappetanovic and this case took place in peru 
more specifically in the caihon de huaylas area of peru this is a very interesting case because the 
main witness victor actually became a contactee following his witnessing of this healing of this 
young boy on march 10 1960 victor capitanovic a peruvian electrical engineer was hunting with the 
local guide in the cajon de huaylas region this is a rural area in peru inhabited by native peruvians 
they were traveling through a remote local village when they came upon a family whose son 
had recently fallen from a cliff and now was apparently dying of his injuries 
and victor was taken to see the child according to victor this boy was lying on the floor of the hut 
unmoving and as he says and i quote his swollen face had taken a bluish color by the infections 
his eyes were half closed his mouth half open with his tongue and lips swollen he looked terrible 
so he bent down to examine the boy could barely detect a pulse and saw that the boy was in fact in 
a comatose state and the closest hospital was many many miles away but victor offered to transport 
the child and the boy's mother angrily refused and explained that quote the gods from the sky would 
take care of her son and victor's guide explained that the locals are often in contact with ufo 
beings whom they called sky gods and victor was intrigued by this because he had recently seen 
many of these strange discs himself so he decided to stay and see if this was true and that if the 
ets would show up and heal this boy and sure enough they did it was a short time later 
the sky filled with clouds suddenly and without warning the boy's family began to shout and point 
and looking up victor saw quote an apparatus similar to a small airplane 
drop out of the clouds and land silently among the herd of sheep and goats and he first thought it 
might be the peruvian military until he saw that this object looked very strange it was not a plane 
a door opened and a figure emerged it was a female woman she looked entirely human though her skin 
was quite pale and she was very short and also she was dressed in a full body suit unlike anything 
victor had seen before and she actually floated towards them a few inches above the ground 
at this point victor's guide and the entire peruvian family dropped to their knees and 
began to pray and this female figure told them to rise up she entered the hut scooped up the child 
and carried him into the landed craft and victor watched all this as the door to the craft closed 
and after several minutes the door opened and as victor says and i quote suddenly i 
saw the boy descend alone from the ladder of the ship and upon touching the ground 
he ran towards us reaching down to pick up a stone and thus showing his perfect state of health 
having seen him when he was swollen i did not recognize him now thus 
and thought that he must be another boy a member of the crew perhaps then i waited for the reaction 
of the mother of the child the little boy had not covered half the distance from the ship to us when 
his mother ran toward him shouting in emotion all present embraced and gave shouts of joy 
so at this point the e.t woman exited the craft and spoke briefly with everyone there 
and victor immediately approached the boy and began to examine him checking his injuries and as he says who knows how they affected this cure but i could find 
no evidence of surgery on his arms the boy showed no abnormality in his body 
so at this point victor approached the e.t woman who said that her name was ivanka and she actually 
invited him on board the ship where he saw many other et's had a long conversation with them 
they showed him a screen which portrayed scenes of future events and this started a very long series 
of contacts with victor kapitanovic and he later wrote an entire book about his experiences with 
these human-looking ets it's a very interesting case and the fifth and final case i'd like to talk 
about today involves the healing of a man who had chronic liver disease this case took place 
in gevengi france and the main witness is a man by the name of gilbert camille he's a radio engineer 
and he was suffering from a very bad case of liver disease which was becoming progressively worse 
gilbert camus was again a radio engineer from the giovanni area of france and he had a shop 
in givenchy and another in the zavani area in the loire area of france so because of this he made 
frequent trips between the two shops up to four trips per day this is on the secondary road 
d30 and it was here that he experienced an encounter that really frightened him this occurred 
on march 5th 1971 and this was at 1 10 a.m so very much in the early hours it was under a moonlit 
sky it was a very cold night minus 20 degrees celsius which is just below zero in fahrenheit 
and he was driving home in his peugeot 404 car and had just crossed by the small village of traenau 
and after passing the last house in this town on this road which is a straight line for 
the next mile or two he was driving at 100 kilometers per hour about 60 miles per hour 
when he saw a strange light ahead of him and he first thought it might be the lights of the next 
town the town of condamine but as he approached he saw that it wasn't and in fact these lights 
were coming from the woods so he paid closer attention and saw that there were in fact eight 
lights located just in front of the woods by a large meadow on the right side of the road 
and as he's driving by he sees that these lights were laid out regularly at ground level parallel with the edge of the forest and that they were rectangles of soft bluish color 
almost fluorescent and not dazzling or bright but a soft light and looking above them you saw that 
these were probably windows or portholes attached to a kind of dome of dull metallic appearance 
and he could barely see this under the reflection of the moon and he realized that you know staring 
at this object that it was a half sphere flattened a little bit it was below the height of the trees 
it was actually landed and he estimated that its height was about eight meters 24 feet and about 15 
meters wide 45 feet wide and if there had been no moon that night he probably would not have 
been able to see this and he could not really see the lower part of this dome-shaped craft 
but as you notice this craft looking to the trees next to it he saw three beings and they were 
climbing um up the slope towards the road where his car was and it shocked him because 
they were on all fours you know crawling on arms and legs and they were quite large 
he described these beings as being tan in color with huge insect like heads so perhaps praying 
mantis as opposed to grays it's not clear but as he watched these uh three beings they were not 
moving and this is when he became a little bit frightened and became even more frightened when 
looking at the meadow again he saw that there was at least 20 more of these same figures 
some of them were standing upright others were going on all fours as if they were looking for 
something on the ground you could hear no noise other than his car and as he's driving by all 
of this he noticed a white or perhaps a pale blue beam of light which shone on the back 
of his car and filled his car with illumination it also lit up on the entire woods around him 
and looking in the rearview mirror it looked like there was a beam of light being projected at him 
and he saw that there were more beings and they were of different sizes some were quite tall others were shorter and at the same time he was being hit by this beam of light 
something very interesting happened his fear completely left him and not only that he felt 
like he was no longer in control of his car and that his car was in fact being controlled 
and that he could not steer it or anything and in fact he was surprised he didn't have an accident 
he felt like the ignition of the car failed and he said that the car slowed down from 60 
miles per hour all the way down to about 12 miles per hour even though it was still in fourth gear 
and uh i'll just quote gilbert directly as he says and i quote 
i had just passed them when an intense gleam filled my car from this moment i was not aware 
anymore of what i did the car continued to run i had the impression that it drove on its own 
that i would have been unable to avoid an obstacle or an accident its speed had fallen 
to 20 kilometers per hour in less than 100 meters as if there had been a breakdown of the ignition 
and a little further i realized that the hood had become fluorescent this anomaly did not last 
and little by little without me intervening the engine resumed its normal operation 
so at this time the car accelerated again to about 60 miles per hour 
and he did not do this consciously he says he was completely disoriented at this point 
and just continued his trip until he reached the town of condamine where he recovered 
and then drove to his home in savanny and so once he arrived home he took his clothes off and 
was amazed to see that on his shirt there was about seven or eight traces in the shape of a 
rectangle these were about five centimeters to two centimeters in size you know one by two inches and 
they were all on the left side and they were sort of gold in color a little bit phosphorescent and 
they did not last long only about five or six minutes after he took his shirt off 
and so he went to bed and the next day he decided he would go back to this area with his son 
to see if he could find any traces of what had happened and he did not see anything at first 
at the exact place where these beings were but in the middle in the meadow at the edge of the 
wood he immediately saw that the grass had been crushed down in a sort of half spherical shape 
and this was about 30 feet in length and it crossed over the drainage ditch to about 
six feet in width and another thing that was very strange this was a very cold uh night and there 
was snow and ice alongside of the road however in this area where this object had apparently 
landed the water had been melted and in fact his son said that actually seemed to be warm 
so this was quite strange and there was at least an area of about 45 to 50 feet where the 
snow and ice was completely melted and checking around this area he saw strange footsteps which 
looked like shoes except there were no heels in the shoes and these were quite large actually 
and doing some more examination he saw that a large branch of a tree had apparently been torn 
off and even more interesting he noticed that a bunch of flowers had disappeared in the area 
where this object had landed these flowers are known as leon todron crispus perhaps better known 
as dandelions dandelions do have all kinds of medicinal qualities such as axia antioxidant 
qualities or anti-inflammatory and more and in fact ufologist jean tyrod investigated this case 
and verified that these dandelion-like yellow flowers were in fact missing in a very large area 
they had been picked so gilbert camus the witness was fairly well known in his community and he had 
no problem telling everybody what happened so a lot of people went to investigate this area 
and verified these landing traces and the missing flowers was three days after the encounter 
that gilbert saw these same rectangular marks on his shirt what was weird is they were on 
his undershirt they were brown in color what was weird is they were not on his uh coat or anything 
so he couldn't explain how they were on his undershirt but not on the outside of his clothes 
so it's entirely possible he had missing time there were other traces as well 
the following day the green painting on his peugeot car faded and when he washed it the green 
paint came off on the rags so gilbert stopped washing it thinking it was going to just pull 
the paint right off this also was verified by ufologist jean tyrode but most importantly here 
and is that gilbert camus at the time was suffering from liver disease was causing 
him all kinds of problems he was having terrible headaches his appetite was suffering in fact his 
health was so bad he had reached the point of deep depression and just did not want to go on anymore 
and it was the next day after his encounter that he realized he was not having headaches 
his appetite was returning and as the days went on he just felt better and better and six months 
later he was completely healthy he says he had previously been unable to anything but shortly 
following this incident his appetite returned his liver returned to normal his headaches disappeared 
and never came back he was healthy so this was a very interesting case very well verified in 
terms of the many physical traces on the ground on his car on his body i suspect that he was in fact 
did have an onboard encounter given that he was healed it's interesting that they 
were picking dandelions these ets which do have healing qualities so maybe those two 
incidents are linked the healing and the use of dandelions hard to say that's pure speculation 
however the case was quite a sensation in france in fact the ufo group lumiere don la nuit 
took a great interest in this case you followed gene tay tyrod and pierre lone champt were the 
main investigators and they spoke with the witness shortly after it happened and according to jean 
taroud he felt that gilbert camus was a very credible witness a very sensible and honest man 
and he found other witnesses in the area who also vouched for gilbert's 
credibility and sincerity and there is no doubt in the investigator's mind that gilbert was being 
entirely truthful about what happened to him so it's a very interesting case so those are 
the five cases that i wanted to present to you today and as you can see they do provide some 
very interesting insights into the nature of et contact it should be pretty obvious by now 
that ets are here healing people on a widespread basis of a variety of conditions 
and i think these cases do deserve more attention they show how truly advanced 
et's are and that they are in fact here to help us and that's really why i wanted 
to do this episode for you today i think this these cases show the truth behind the purpose 
of et contact i did cover these cases and hundreds of others in my book the healing power of ufos 300 
true cases of people healed by extraterrestrials i think honestly this is just the tip of the iceberg 
most people do not report these healings medical doctors are well aware of the spontaneous healings 
they call them and i think many of these cases of spontaneous healings and remissions are in fact 
due to intervention probably by extraterrestrials and these cases definitely deserve more attention 
so i want to thank you very much for watching this episode i truly appreciate it until next 
time keep asking questions keep searching for answers and most importantly keep having fun
you
