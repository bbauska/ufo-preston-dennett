ARIZONA HUMANOIDS: TEN TRUE CASES
Jan 20, 2023

Summary:
Jan 20, 2023
Face-to-face encounters with humanoids and onboard UFO experiences are the cutting edge of UFO research. Cases like these teach us the most about extraterrestrials, who they are, where they’re from, and their agenda on our planet. Humanoids come in all shapes and sizes, and encounters with them are surprisingly varied. People all over the world have been having encounters with humanoids for a very long time. Each location on the planet has a long history of humanoid encounters. One area with a surprisingly rich history is the state of Arizona. What follows are ten cases from the Grand Canyon state, each with its own insights into the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon.

AN ALIEN ON THE ROAD: On June 9, 1960, a woman was driving with her husband and two children east of Globe. Everyone but her was asleep when she saw what appeared to be a young child about to cross the road. Then it turned its head and what she saw shocked her: the figure was not human!

GROUP OF MUSICIANS ABDUCTED: It was 1968 when a group of musicians finished a gig in Phoenix, and drove out of town to party. Without warning, a UFO appeared and hovered overhead. The next thing they knew, they were being examined by gray aliens.

ABDUCTION IN THE WHITE TANK MOUNTAINS: On June 20, 1980, three women traveled to the White Tank Mountains to investigate recent UFO sightings. Suddenly strange lights approached and all three women fell unconscious, then woke up hours later. Under hypnosis, one of them recalled being taken onboard, where she was given profound messages from the ETs.

UFO ENCOUNTER IN JAKES CORNER: In August of 1987, five people were outside their home in Jakes Corner when they saw a UFO rise up from a mountain and hover overhead. Then it moved over their home and stayed there. At this point, all but two of them went inside, and a bizarre encounter ensued during which the ETs showed a strange interest in the men’s feet.

THE RUBY ALIEN: In August of 1988 Sam visited an abandoned ghost town in Ruby, near the southern border of Mexico, he heard a strange whooshing sound overhead. Nothing strange was visible, but shortly later, he was amazed to see a short humanoid wearing a weird jumpsuit standing nearby. Sam just happened to have a camera, and he quickly snapped a stunning photograph.

A RIDE ABOARD A FLYING SAUCER: In the late 1980s, a retired pilot was driving through the desert near Cave Creek when his car stalled. As he checked the engine, a handsome blond man walked out of the wilderness, announced that he was an extraterrestrial, and offered the man a ride aboard his flying saucer.

CONTACT IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA: At 2:00 a.m., on February 20, 1991, Sheri was woken up by a huge UFO hovering outside her home. She then found herself being taken onboard where she met several different types of ETs, who gave her strange silver medicinal pills, and also a mineral sample. Sheri saved both and handed them over to researchers. Then there were the photos!

ONBOARD ENCOUNTER IN DEWEY: On September 28, 1991, Leslie woke up in her home to find her bed surrounded by grays. More stranger-looking ETs appeared, and Leslie was pulled through the wall of her home into a craft. During the encounter she was taken to the other side of the world and deep into the ocean. It was an experience which would leave her utterly transformed.

TOUCHED BY A GRAY: In February 1997, Louise and her husband moved into their new home in Chandler. One month later, three grays appeared in her bedroom. One of them stepped forward and touch Louise on the forehead. She blacked out only to discover remarkable evidence of her close encounter.

SOMETHING NOT FROM THIS WORLD. In February 2005, after a long day working at the local ski resort, Eric woke up in his home in Flagstaff to see a gray alien standing over his bed. Freaked out, he flipped his middle finger at the ET and blacked out. Only a few weeks later, he received startling confirmation that he wasn’t the only one in his family having encounters.

These ten accounts provide an accurate representation of humanoid encounters. They show how truly bizarre and varied contact with extraterrestrials can be. They show that encounters can occur anytime and anyplace, and can have a profound effect on a person’s life.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal and today I'd like to talk about humanoids in fact the title of today's 
episode is Arizona humanoids 10 true cases all sightings are undeniably interesting I think 
the humanoid cases are far more interesting it's from these types of cases that we learn what the 
ETS look like where they come from how they behave and what their mission is on our planet 
and I've got 10 cases I'd like to present to you today which are all quite different 
they start in the 1960s and move all the way up to the 2000s so about 50 years worth of UFO 
encounters these do involve not only face-to-face encounters with humanoids but on-board experiences 
as well some are quite brief others are more extensive some are very much benevolent others did 
involve some trauma this is the sort of pattern we do see in these cases so they're different enough 
that I think it provides a broad spectrum of what it's like to have an encounter with humanoids 
and again these all come from this state of Arizona all across the state actually and I 
think they provide some very interesting insights into the nature of extraterrestrial contact so 
let's just get started and the first case I want to talk about today I call an alien on the road 
this is a really interesting case for a number of reasons the main witness found it quite 
frightening this took place late at night while driving a lot of people see UFOs while driving 
along remote highways late at night but seeing an actual ET on the road that's not quite as common 
so that's one of the reasons I really like this case late on the evening of June 9 1960 a young 
woman was driving her Cadillac through Globe Arizona on her way to California this is a 
lonely stretch of desert highway her husband Joe slept beside her in the passenger seat and her 
two children were both asleep in the back seat this is about 15 miles east of Globe Arizona 
and as she pulled around the corner of the highway the beam of her headlights caught a small figure 
about 100 yards ahead on the right side of the road the figure at this point was facing to her 
left and it looked like it was about to cross the road in front of her so she slowed down and to her 
shock the figure which she said was about three feet tall turned and faced her and this is when 
she got a real shock I'll just let the witness describe what she saw in her own words as she says 
the second I saw that thing my heart came up in my mouth and my stomach to the flip-flop 
it was small broad shouldered with long arms dark in color and it had a head shaped somewhat like a 
flattened ball almost like a pumpkin in his head were two yellowish orange glowing eyes 
I recall that when it was inside view there was a light beaming out beyond the face I saw no nose or 
mouth or ears the body was not as well defined as the head and I got the impression of hair or fur 
so a very strange humanoid indeed and after staring at her for a few moments this strange 
figure turned and ran off the road and into the brush she never saw an actual UFO or object but 
the witness slammed on the accelerator and sped away screaming at her husband to wake up so he did 
wake up and she told him what she had seen and he wanted to return and look for it and she refused 
as she says I told him that if he wanted to go back then he could go back by himself but neither 
my children nor I were going back there on that lonely dark Road I don't blame the witness in this 
case for not wanting to drive down that road again uh seeing something like that can be quite a shock 
unfortunately she is the only witness in this case her husband again did not see it 
but it certainly is an interesting case and not your typical gray as we often hear about 
and the next case I'd like to talk about I call a group of musicians abducted in some ways this 
case is controversial as we shall see but what's interesting about this case is it does involve 
multiple Witnesses missing time although the main witness who's reporting this case does remember 
quite a bit of it and it left him with profound after effects for years after the incident and 
that alone I think makes it significant this case occurred around 1968 outside of Phoenix 
and I'll just quote the witness here as the witness says the main witness although this happened many years ago I am just now able to talk about it I struggled 
for years as to whether this was an actual event or just some sort of hallucination 
at the time of this encounter the man was a guitarist in a small band that was touring the 
country playing music and they just finished a gig in Phoenix and had driven out of the 
area and were hanging out in their Volkswagen van it was around 3 A.M and they were smoking 
marijuana among them when one of them noticed a bright light approaching them from the distance 
and at this point they all assumed this was the police so they stashed their drugs and waited 
and this is when they realized something very strange was going on as the witness says well 
it didn't take long before we realized it was not a cop car but something we could not explain 
so while some people may say well the fact that they were smoking pot sort of debunks this case 
I'm not so sure that that's true because multiple people were watching this and what happened next 
according to the main witness everybody in the group began to panic as they realized they weren't hallucinating and it wasn't the police and instead it was something they were not prepared for and 
again I will just quote the witness directly as he says I wasn't the only one that saw this thing 
some of us started giggling uncontrollably I wet myself in our sound guy fainted the next thing I 
know I am in a room laying on a table looking up at some very bright lights not cool I was freaking 
out then things started to get weird two skinny pale dudes with big eyes I can't talk about what 
all they did I think I blocked it out to keep my sanity however I had a sour stomach for a couple 
of weeks afterward difficulty urinating kind of a cruel preview of how things are for me at age 60. 
I don't remember being returned to the van but we all woke up in the van naked which in itself 
was quite traumatic several hours had passed but none of us could clearly recall what had happened 
none of us ever talked about what happened that night it was too weird and strange even for the 
60s I know this all sounds crazy but it really did happen so in desperation looking for help 
the witness did report his experience to the National UFO Reporting Center and as he writes 
what can I do to get some help I still have night terrors flashbacks and more from this 
incident I found your site using Google I have nowhere else to turn thank you for listening 
I really feel for the Witnesses in that case you can tell it was quite traumatic for them 
I do hope they're all right I don't know what happened after this there's no real follow-up on 
this case but they did report it to one of the UFO Reporting centers and I think it's an interesting 
case and the next case I'd like to talk about I call abduction in the White Tank Mountains 
this is another case with some very unusual High strangeness elements to it 
this occurred on June 28 1980 and yeah it's a really unusual case what I like about it is the 
main witness talks about having been given some advice by the ETS and also having been charged 
with a mission by the ETS which we do here in some cases and yeah some high strangeness elements that 
I think make it worth looking into again it was June 28 1980 and two ladies named Lou and Carol 
and Carol's Daughter Laura and their two dogs went driving through the White Tank Mountains 
actually hoping to see some UFOs which had been cited recently in this area so they drove along 
a long dirt road and parked where it dead ended at the foot of the White Tank Mountains 
now this case does come from researcher Bill Hamilton prominent and well-respected researcher 
but by the time these ladies Lou and Carol and their daughter arrived it was late at night 
and was shortly after they arrived that Lou noticed some strange lights not far from them near 
the mountains and at this point Carol suddenly felt a strange tiredness sweeping over her 
and shortly after seeing these lights all three ladies inexplicably lost consciousness 
all three of them woke up at some undetermined time later when they heard a voice saying oh 
there is a car and it gets really strange here looking up they saw what appeared to be a beige 
hearse of 1930s vintage driving by they became frightened because they could hear no sound coming 
from this car nor was it kicking up any dust so perhaps this is a screen memory hard to say 
but quite frightened they tried to start the car but the engine wouldn't work 
they tried again and this time it did work and they sped away a few hours later when 
the sum came up they wondered exactly what had happened and they decided to return to the scene 
they found nothing unusual but did learn that the car horn no longer worked and it was clear 
to them they had a missing time being that it was only a few hours till the sun had risen and they 
had just gotten there when it was dark so they knew that they had had missing time and certain 
that something strange had happened Carol decided to go under hypnotic regression and it was while 
under hypnosis that Carol recalled falling asleep in the car only to awaken moments later because 
there were three small figures dressed in diving suits and helmets standing next to their car 
Carl found herself exiting the car with her friends and following the figures over to a large 
silver dome-shaped object that was landed not far away a fourth being stood on a rim that protruded 
from the circumference of this landed UFO and he held a flashlight instrument which he pointed at 
Carol beaming her with light and only then was she taken into the craft followed by the others 
Carol says she counted five of the small helmeted figures inside what appeared to be a control room 
filled with weird buttons and screens and colored lights she was immediately floated 
off to another room where a tall being with a veil before its face undressed her and put 
her on a table where he proceeded to examine her Carol says she felt an electrical pulse 
shocking her and the man explained that he was just adjusting her energy centers 
he then told her not to eat meat as it was disrupting her energy patterns 
so apparently he was concerned about her health hard to say for sure but that's what it looks like 
and then he told her something very interesting he said that she has not been fulfilling her 
mission to tell the people of Earth the truth about the coming of the aliens 
that I found quite interesting and that's about all she recalled Carol next found herself being 
dressed and taken out of the craft and back to her vehicle and as soon as they were put back in 
the car the ETS vanished and all the witnesses lost their memory of the onboard experience so 
that witness did go under hypnosis to recall her experience as we see I think some people have no 
memory whatsoever of their encounter this is a good example of that which is one of the reasons 
I felt it was important to include here because that does happen and she did go under hypnosis and 
recalled I think the most of what happened to her when she was taken on board hard to say for sure 
but it is interesting to me that she was able to converse with the ETS and they gave her advice and 
asked her to basically reveal the EET presence on our planet that is something I have heard before 
and the next case I want to talk about I call UFO encounter in Jake's corner 
this is a really interesting case for a number of reasons I think most interesting to me is 
it involves several witnesses a whole family an extended family all saw this UFO didn't involve 
face-to-face encounters with beings where several members of the family did see these beings it also 
shows some very interesting aspects in that the ETS involved showed a real strong interest in 
unusual aspects to the witnesses physiology he had some unusual things about his body and this really 
caught the et's interest and this is a pattern we do see in other cases and another thing I 
like about this case is the witness recalled this absolutely consciously without the aid of hypnosis 
so that makes this case significant it was late August of 1987 and Colin Morrison this 
is a pseudonym was standing in the front yard of his home in Jake's Corner Arizona 
and standing next to him where much of his family his grandparents and son and a friend 
and it was just around Sunset when everyone's attention was drawn to a white light moving on 
the hillside across the street now Colin assumed at first that this was a dune buggy except for 
the fact that instead of two headlights there was just one and it was he said quote extremely bright 
the object continued around the Hillside and then without warning it launched into the 
air so clearly not a dune buggy at this point it moved slowly and soundlessly towards the witnesses 
everyone was completely mystified and they watched the light which Colin likened to a floodlight 
for about 20 minutes and finally Khan and his friend decided to drive to another location to see the light from a different angle 
and as they drove down the street Colin was surprised to see a small red light fly up 
from the ground and into the object he then saw other lights moving around the main bright light 
at this point their attention was drawn to a second and closer object on the other side of the 
road and I'll just quote Colin here because this is where this goes from exciting to a full-blown 
encounter as Colin says and I quote the object was very close to the road it had an extremely 
bright white light shining out of an opening we couldn't see the object's shape but it was very 
big we decided to drive up to it and as we neared it perhaps 40 to 50 feet away the car engine died 
now at this moment the opening on the craft started to close shut and when it winked closed 
the car engine suddenly started now frightened Colin's friend raced home only to find that this 
first object was now directly over the house his grandparents were watching it with with binoculars 
and it could not identify it and unable to identify it his grandmother went inside and 
actually called Luke Air Force Base who told them that they had not received any calls about UFOs 
and this is where this strange encounter became truly bizarre Colin could hardly 
believe what happened next as he says and again I quote I realize this is strange but it's true 
everyone seemed to act like so what there's a UFO over the house 
my grandparents and Son went inside to bed my friend and I decided to go to sleep on 
the front lawn as if that was perfectly normal we just fell asleep on the ground 
so what's interesting about this is they're behaving in ways they would never normally behave and that's definitely a pattern we do see in these cases but at some point Colin woke up to 
see a bright blue light flooding the yard he then discovered that he was unable to move and what 
happened next was even more bizarre as Colin says small people approached us and said they 
were going to check our feet that they would not approach my grandparents they did some physical 
exams my friend was completely unconscious but I was awake and speaking to them in some manner 
the people did not move their mouths when they spoke so this is telepathy 
and Colin continues his story as he says at one point they told me a being was there I understood 
it to be some type of scientist this creature or thing was like nothing I can describe it 
somewhat resembled a giant praying mantis it was fish-like or bug-like and was absolutely the most 
horrible thing I've ever seen I became terrified and was fighting then was my impression that this 
creature did not have any compassion for humans did not speak to me but had a very cold presence 
the next thing I know my friend and I woke up in the morning still lying on the front lawn 
so Colin was freaking out at this point he asked everyone what happened and while everyone remembered seeing the UFO they were still acting strangely blase about it as Colin 
says I was the only one that seemed to think something incredible had occurred 
this is a normal after effect of UFO encounters often people won't talk about it or they're acting 
like it's nothing special very strange at any rate Colin told his friend about the strange little 
people and that they seemed interested in their feet at this point Khan's friend revealed that 
he did in fact have something very unusual about his feet he had webbed toes this is something that 
Colin did not know he was surprised because he wasn't aware that his friend had webbed toes but 
then Colin revealed that he also had an unusual anatomical anomaly his toes were double jointed 
so later Colin told his son about this whole incident and his son said well 
the beings actually also spoke to him and as Colin says I've often wondered about 
what happened that night and although it sounds incredible what I've related is true 
after the event I had an interest in science and I have since earned a masters in astronomy 
as long as I lived I will never forget the sight of that object driving up the side of the hill 
and going into the air as you can see this did affect them profoundly it was quite scary for them 
but they do appear to be okay and again it shows how the ETS do show a strong interest in humans 
and human physiology it's just fascinating to me that they found the witnesses toes his 
webbed to toes of extreme interest to them and now we move to the next case and of all 
the cases I'm presenting here I think this one is my favorite I call this the Ruby alien 
and this case comes from a fairly well established researcher he's written a number of books 
and it involves an actual photograph of an ET and that is really unusual 
so this case does have something important to say I think about this whole phenomenon 
it was early one morning in August of 1988 that journalist and artist Ron Quinn received a call 
from his friend Sam who he had known for nearly 20 years now if Sam is a pseudonym he does not 
want to go public with his story but following the death of his wife Sam had been traveling 
throughout Southern Arizona taking pictures of ghost towns graveyards and abandoned mines 
so the two men met and Sam told Ron that he had quote in odd and frightening experience 
and he handed Ron Quinn an envelope and told Ron that there was a photograph inside of what he saw 
and Sam said prepare yourself for a big shock so Ron Quinn opened the envelope and his friend was 
right Ron was shocked as Ron says it was a photo of what appeared to be a space alien taken from 
about seven feet away so Ron stared at this photo he knew Sam and that he was an honest and quiet 
man there was no possibility that this was a hoax Ron believes so Ron asked him to explain the photo 
and Sam said that on August 14 1988 he was driving to an abandoned mining town outside of Ruby this 
is just North of the Mexican border and while taking pictures during the day you heard a strange 
swishing sound followed by a sonic boom looking up he saw nothing unusual so he continued to take 
photographs it was about 20 minutes later while hiking around this area that he saw the entity 
and took a picture of it as Ron says in his own words standing a short distance off to his right 
was a rather small individual it's stood on the edge of the wash about two three two feet above 
him at first he thought it was a child until the figure turned and looked directly at him 
seeing what it was Sam brought up his camera and quickly snapped off one picture before he had time 
to take another the figure turned and ran quickly up the brush covered Hill directly to its rear 
so this figure was about three feet tall he estimates uh and Sam chased up the hill after 
this strange figure but saw no trace of it and when he finally reached the top of the 
rise he heard this strange swishing sound again but nothing was visible in the sky 
he returned to the area where he had seen this figure and searched for Footprints but only found a few scuff marks he went back to his truck walking on legs that he said felt like wet 
noodles and then he developed the photograph at the local drug store and it was then that 
he called Ron Quinn to tell him what happened so Ron studied this photograph for more than an hour 
and became absolutely convinced that it depicts a genuine extraterrestrial as Ron says and I quote 
its eyes were extremely large and full of life not glass eyes set and some into some Halloween mask 
its skin was light gray and its eyes were quite large and bulged out slightly 
some Thin character lines were visible on its forehead and around the corner of the eyes 
the area above the eye where the eyelid is resembled the surface of an accordion 
there was a slight shadow in the cheekbone area and the mouth was quite thin and small 
its head was rather lead large for its body and was minus hair 
the ear was situated much lower than ours and was no more than a fleshly lump with an opening 
the nose was almost non-existent but had small nostrils its chin was long and Broad 
so this is not your average gray but again it was about three maybe four feet tall Ron said that the 
figure had four long slender fingers on its hand and the expression on its face was pleasant and 
non-threatening also interesting was its tight fitting garment like a jumpsuit as Ron says 
its texture looked as though it had thousands of minute wrinkles throughout the surface and 
no buttons clamps or zippers could be seen Ron was deeply impressed by this photo and asked Sam if he 
could borrow it and make copies but Sam refused he said I'm afraid I've taken a picture of something 
I shouldn't have and he asked Ron's advice about what to do and Ron advised wisely I think against 
contacting any authorities but suggested that a UFO research organization might be helpful 
but Sam was afraid of any publicity or attention he wanted nothing from this and said only that 
he would think about it but he did give permission to Ron to talk about the case 
as long as Sam remained Anonymous this did take some convincing however run himself did contact 
UFO investigators he contacted Jerome Clark from fate magazine who seemed interested in the case 
and later Sam told his brother about the photo and Sam's brother also urged Sam to go public he 
was also convinced that this was a real photograph that it could perhaps sell it and make some money 
but this was not something Sam was interested in and so far Sam has declined to go public 
and as far as I know this Photograph has not been released but is Ron Quinn writes 
I'd like to know how the general public and the government will react to seeing this remarkable 
picture I saw it and the alien is real I'm really sorry we didn't get the actual photograph in this 
case but the drawing does provide I think a pretty interesting glimpse into what this 
Photograph looked like maybe someday Sam will come forward with the photograph I sure hope so it sure 
would be something interesting to see and now let's move to the next case which I call a ride 
aboard a flying saucer I love this case because it is absolutely benevolent this was not an abduction 
as many people call them this witness feels like it was absolutely benevolent and he was invited 
aboard a flying saucer for an actual ride so it's a really remarkable case there's not a whole lot 
of details to it but I thought it was important to include here because I do know of other cases 
very much like this one this case was uncovered by arizona-based research Tom Dongo who's written a 
number of really well-received books on UFOs and other paranormal incidents and this incident took 
place near Cave Creek in Sedona in the late 1980s the main witness is Gary that's a pseudonym who 
was quite elderly and an extremely poor health and one day he was driving through the Arizona 
desert when his car engine sputtered and died forcing him to quickly Park alongside the road 
he exited the car and opened the hood to examine the engine when suddenly a quote blonde man walked 
out of the desert towards him the man spoke saying that he was not from Earth and would return in 
four months to take Gary up into his ship and despite this strange statement Gary felt this 
man was very much sincere and he was impressed that this man was so kind and gentle and wise 
this man then turned and walked back out into the desert where there was nothing out there 
Gary then tried to start the car and it functioned normally four months later as promised this man showed up and gave Gary this ride aboard a flying saucer 
Gary told only a few people in his family about this story and then passed away shortly later 
and researcher Tom Dongo did not talk to the main witness Gary but actually obtained this 
story from Gary's daughter yeah I love that case I tell you if I ever got an invitation to take a 
ride aboard a flying saucer like this I would go I mean I think that would be a really cool 
experience just sorry we didn't get more details about it there are many more cases 
in the next case I'd like to talk about today I call contact in Southern Arizona 
and this is an amazing case the main ones I call Sherry I don't believe that's her real name or 
if it is it's just her first name at any rate this is a very interesting case because it does involve 
actual photographic evidence of The Craft and not only that other actual physical evidence including 
medicine given to the main Witness by the ETS it also comes from a pretty prominent investigator 
so I think it's an important case for those and other reasons as we shall see when we 
get into this case Sherry claims to have had ET contact periodically throughout her life 
however on February 20th 1991 she experienced a particularly dramatic encounter it was around 
2 A.M when she woke up in her Southern Arizona home and felt this familiar urge to go outside 
and not far away was a large cylinder-shaped object about 100 feet long and 20 feet thick 
a steady blue light glowed from the rear while the front was illuminated by a pulsating pink light 
the next thing Sherry knows she's being taken on board this craft and was on board where 
she met three different types of ETS including humanoids which he had previously encountered 
Grays who were busy operating the ship itself in a large reptilian type of humanoid that she had 
never seen before and The Reptilian said Sherry had scales instead of skin and bright gold eyes 
the ship itself appeared to be larger on the inside than it appeared from the exterior 
and the front section was the navigational area while the back part of the craft was filled with 
Machinery of some kind it was on board this craft that cherry was given these strange round silver 
pills pictured here by the ETS which she was told would quote rejuvenate her body 
and she consumed the pills as instructed but she did save a few of them and a sample of this 
medicine was later examined by UFO researcher Jem Cox Jim Cox is actually the grandson of 
the pioneering UFO researcher Wendell Stevens and Jen Cox in vestigated and examined these strange 
round silver pills and as he says and I quote the medicine appeared to be metallic about the 
size and shape of a BB the Spheres seemed to heat up when held in my hand so Jim took a photograph 
of these and asked Sherry if she could get more of the medicine for a scientific analysis Sherry said 
she was actually given a strange mineral sample by the ETS who told her that it was in quote an alloy 
of metallic hydrogen they told her it was used in the construction of the skin of their spacecraft 
and the et's actually showed her the formula they said that they used to produce this alloy 
Sherry after returning home from this incident discovered that she had been gone for five full 
hours this surprised her because she could only recall spending a short time aboard this craft 
but there's further confirmation of this incident because sporting Sherry's case are photographs 
taken by her friend Dorothy which showed UFOs in the area where Sherry's contacts were taking place 
as Jim Cox writes Sherry's story is very interesting itself when reinforced with 
all of Dorothy's photos of UFOs in the area as well as the physical evidence the medicine and 
the mineral sample and her case becomes very exciting and worthy of some follow-up efforts 
but fearing publicity Sherry has insisted upon total anonymity and as far as I know there has 
been no analysis of the medicine or the mineral sample at least not revealed to the public yeah 
that is a really unusual case I have heard of other cases involving this same sort of medicine 
little round silver looking balls but it's very unusual that people have an actual photograph 
of this I do wish the medicine had been analyzed that might have proved to be really interesting 
but nevertheless it's still I think an important case which is why I wanted to include it here 
in the next case I want to talk about I call an onboard encounter in Dewey Humboldt 
this occurred on September 28 1991 and what's really interesting about this case 
is that this witness was able to re remember this consciously it's a case that basically 
resulted in a spiritual transformation of the witness and it's also got a very unusual aspect 
because this witness was not only taken on board but taken to a place far away 
from Arizona apparently as we shall see it was around midnight on September 28 1991 when Leslie 
Ballard this is a pseudonym woke up from the sound sleep to hear something moving around in her own 
she sat up in bed looked through the open doorway and down the hallway which was now 
lit up with a strange almost opaque blue white light and she immediately looked at her baby it 
was only a few days old and saw that she was sleeping soundly in the crib next to the bed 
this is interesting to me because ETS do often show an interest in human reproduction and will 
show up when a woman is nine months pregnant or just had their baby and that's true in this case 
so when Leslie looked back to the hallway she saw a short childlike figure that she described as 
fat and almost Blobby and looking brown in color seconds later she saw a small gray humanoid figure 
this point Leslie jumped out of her bed to observe them more closely and this is when she saw a third 
type of figure a taller thin insectoid figure with blue gray skin it stepped through the 
wall and into the hallway facing her bedroom and as Leslie says in her own words this thing was 
thin and huge it was acting dainty-like it put its hands out towards me and for some reason I 
walked to it I wasn't scared at all Leslie had the impression that this figure was female she 
described it as being six maybe seven feet tall and it moved with this incredible calm Grace it 
had large wrap around liquidy eyes with visible eyelashes on the bottom and a slit for a mouth 
Leslie also noticed that the skin on its face was sort of pockmarked with either very large 
pores or blemishes and she found herself grabbing the et's hand which she said had only four fingers 
at this point she turned around and looked back in the bedroom and the little gray being turned 
and looked back at her and Leslie at this point saw that her husband and baby were 
both still soundly asleep she turned and looked back at the tall figure and Leslie could hardly 
believe what happened next as she says we stepped through the wall and into their craft 
Leslie described the interior of this craft as being creamy pearl white in color she was 
fascinated by the walls reached out and touched them because they looked almost translucent and as she touched them her hand and fingers appeared to Glow 
the craft was really beautiful she said the seats on the craft were molded into the wall she could 
actually now at this point see outside the craft which appeared to be moving at super high speeds 
there was a strange quote bulb light thing in the center of the craft 
and she could hear it humming loudly and causing the air around it to vibrate 
and as Leslie says I went to put my right hand on it and the short fat Brown being grabbed my wrist 
his hand felt like sandpaper so probably not a good idea to just go around touching 
strange instruments inside a craft and she was stopped from doing so at this point the 
gray motioned the short being to let go of Leslie's hand and the tall blue gray being 
then pointed outside and Leslie saw that it was now daylight and the craft was hovering in place 
so must have been halfway across the world because at the time of this incident it was night 
so the craft dipped down and Leslie was now surprised to see water the three beings turned 
and looked at Leslie and then the gray turned to her and sent a telepathic message saying 
we do exist where we can't be seen a shorter figure then manipulated the weird instrument 
the ball black instrument in the center of the craft and suddenly the craft dropped and plunged 
into the water Leslie continued to look outside at what appeared to be the deep ocean depths 
bubbles floated upwards and she saw Spears of sunlight coming down and as Leslie says 
I saw a beautiful coral reef you could see some fish swimming around some plants I 
remember a huge yellow fish with a blue stripe next to the wall of The Craft 
next thing she knows this craft is moving upward and out of the water it began to move again at 
super high speeds and suddenly it became Dark Again outside and Leslie found herself being 
led out of the ship and back into the hallway of her home was now 15 minutes after midnight 
and Leslie obediently crawled into bed and turned around just in time to watch The Tall 
being disappear through the wall this experience was not traumatic for her in fact Leslie found 
herself somewhat transformed by this experience as she says from that day on I have had a new 
perspective about life elsewhere and where they may be hiding out and at this point she 
is considering regressive hypnosis to explore the incident further but as far as I know has not done 
so yet now again what I like about this case is she recalled it without the use of hypnosis 
and also what's interesting to me is that the witness remembers seeing the outside of this 
craft and being underwater and seeing a coral reef now there are no coral reefs anywhere near Arizona 
so I can only imagine where she was taken I don't know but it certainly is an interesting aspect to 
this case and also interesting is that it really affected her profoundly I think that's actually 
true for most cases but this is something that the witness felt was really important to state 
so yeah a really interesting case that I think definitely deserves a place on this list 
and now we move to the next case in this case I call touched by a gray 
this is an interesting case for a number of reasons this involves multiple Witnesses and 
face-to-face encounters and as you shall see some really interesting physical evidence in February 
of 1997 Louise that's a pseudonym and her husband moved into the new mobile home in Chandler Arizona 
and it was one month later when she woke up one evening to find her room filled with light 
and as Louise says I saw three small thin aliens the exact kind we call Grays 
one was next to my husband's head one was at the foot of the bed and when I went to sit up in bed I turned to my side and there was one right next to me the gray took 
his long skinny index finger and touched me light on the forehead right between the eyes 
so that in itself was kind of interesting at this point Louise had just enough time to notice that 
the alien had only three fingers and a thumb and she fell unconscious she woke up the next morning 
and instantly remembered what had happened adrenaline pulsed through her as she pulled 
herself out of bed and she discovered that she was extremely thirsty weak and that her body was 
sore all over she said she felt almost as if she had been drugged and was now coming out of surgery 
she dragged herself to the kitchen was drinking a glass of water at this point she saw her sixth 
month old kitten outside and she gasped in shocked because the kitten had been in her bedroom it had 
never been outside before it was far too young all the doors were locked so there was no possible way 
this kitten could be outside she went outside to rescue her cat and got another shock because she 
saw that her hair scrunchy which she had worn to bed was now lying on the outside porch so this was 
absolute confirmation to her that her experience was not a dream and that app was absolutely real 
the next day Louise called her mother and told her about the incident and her mother had something 
interesting to say about it she revealed that Louise's grandparents had once been followed by 
a UFO as they drove to Las Vegas they said the object had actually struck them with a beam of 
light and the next thing they knew it was morning and when they arrived at their destination their 
family was frantic because the grandparents were six hours late and in fact the police were out 
searching for them thinking that they had been in some type of accident and it was later that 
the grandmother spontaneously recalled being inside a small room examined by four gray type 
ETS so this is significant because as you know if you research this field these encounters do 
run in families and that's exactly what happened here I like that case not only 
with multiple Witnesses but the fact that you know her cat was inside her hair scrunchie was 
outside and all of these things Point towards uh confirmation that this actually did happen 
pretty interesting case in a lot of ways I think it does fit the pattern we see in other cases 
but there's always these little tiny clues that point to the witness that something amazing happened I think sometimes perhaps I'm speculating here but I think that perhaps the 
ETS are doing these sort of things on purpose uh to give the witnesses a clue that they were there 
again that's pure speculation but it happens so often that I wonder about it could be an 
accident I don't know but I think you'll agree that that was an interesting case 
and now I want to present the last case for today and I call this one something not from this world 
I like this case because the witness came forward publicly it also occurred over a period of weeks 
and involving first one witness and then his brother so they got interesting confirmation 
and corroboration that something very unusual was happening to them it was February 2005 and Eric 
Dash had worked all day long at the snowball ski resort near Flagstaff in Arizona and he 
returned home and was feeling tired and went to bed early was around 10 30 pm and a few hours 
later around 1 30 p.m he woke up Suddenly because he sensed that someone had just entered his room 
and as Eric says in his own words all I really remember is a person with a rather large head and 
eyes looking down on me in bed I tried to move but wasn't able to there must have been some sort of 
force field holding me down Eric struggled against the paralysis moving first his hands and then with 
great effort moved his head up freaked out and somewhat angry he flipped up his middle finger 
at the being and finally it went away and as Eric says I know it sounds funny but this event scared 
me so bad I couldn't sleep in my bed for weeks fearing that they would come back Eric did tell 
his father what happened but his father laughed and said it must have been quote just a dream 
but here's where it gets very interesting uh there was a very strange endnote to this case and I'll 
just let Eric describe it in his own words as he says here's where the story turns twisted three 
to four weeks later my younger brother Devin had the exact same thing happened to him in his room 
I noticed he wasn't sleeping in his room for a while so I asked him what was going on 
he told me that he had an encounter with something not from this world in his room the night before 
he then explained to me exactly in detail what happened to me a month or so prior to him 
so they both had the same darn experience very interesting what I like about that case is they 
did get confirmation the two brothers this is not that unusual but I can only imagine how it must 
feel to be alone with your encounter and then later get confirmation from another member of 
your family which is exactly what happened here so a really interesting case although 
there isn't a whole lot of information to it it shows the pattern we see in so many of these cases 
people all over the world are encountering humanoids and all these cases are from 
Arizona alone I did present these cases in my book UFOs over Arizona 
a true history of UFO Encounters in the Grand Canyon State so if you'd like to explore more 
about them you might want to check out that book the cases I presented here are just the 
tip of the iceberg of what's going on in Arizona Arizona is definitely a very active state but yeah 
I hope that you found this episode entertaining I hope you learned a little bit about ETS and their 
mission on our planet and I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it until next 
time keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most important keep having fun bye now
