GOVERNMENT UFO INSIDER
Oct, 8, 2021

Summary:
Oct 8, 2021
Is there a government coverup of UFOs? The answer appears to be a resounding yes. Judging from the countless blacked-out documents released through the Freedom of Information Act from multiple intelligence agencies, the public is not being told the whole truth about the UFO phenomenon. This fact is further corroborated by the many government whistleblowers who have stepped forward and revealed their own participation in secret UFO projects.

Now a new whistleblower and government UFO insider has decided it's time to tell his story. "Thomas," a retired Navy officer, is now ready to let the world know about his own experiences. Thomas held a secret clearance in the Navy, but after retiring, was contacted by a Pentagon officer and was invited into the inner sanctum of the secret government working with UFO crash/retrievals. Thomas learned shocking details that would leave him forever changed. This video tells the story of what Thomas learned about what is really going on within the United States government, and their interest in UFOs and aliens. Crashed UFOs being held at military bases. ETs working along with the military. An underground city at Area 51. The truth is finally coming out!

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
I call this episode, "Government UFO Insider". This is all about a gentleman I'll call 
Thomas. That's not his real name. He prefers to remain anonymous. And once you hear his story I 
think you'll see why. Thomas is a retired navy veteran who very nearly became involved in the secret 
government. He was asked to join the secret government and a project involving crashed and retrieved 
UFOs. He has a very interesting story to tell. I've corresponded with him for many years and he's 
finally agreed to tell his story. So that's what this video is about. Today Thomas's story actually 
begins when he was just a little boy. He's always been fascinated by the paranormal, the supernatural, 
cryptozoological creatures, such as the Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot. All of this stuff fascinated him 
and it was a huge hobby of his. He's also a huge believer in UFOs, has been his whole life, because of 
what his father told him. Thomas's father was stationed at Fort Ord in California. Back in 1954, 1955 and he 
told Thomas that it was his job actually to guard a 48 foot wide extraterrestrial craft that was being 
held in secret at Fort Ord. As it turns out Fort Ord does have quite a complicated UFO history with several 
UFO encounters. Occurring there so Thomas eventually joined the military he became a part of the navy and enjoyed a very successful career. He moved up in rank and was finally discharged following a pretty severe accident 
in 1981 he suffered an accident and was honorably discharged and retired from the military 
but he maintained his interest in the military and had quite a few friends within the military 
and in 1991 the internet started to become really popular and publicly available and he started 
to use the internet to research the ufo subject he joined an online ufo chat room on aol online 
Meeting MJ3
one of the first internet providers and began talking with other military people about ufos 
and one of the people he started corresponding with used the screen name mj3 
and mj3 had some very interesting things some very interesting information to share with thomas and 
as thomas says and I quote he started asking about my military background I told him that I had a 
secret clearance in the navy for the ship I was on we were all stationed aboard the uss kid ddg 993 
i had to have a secret clearance because of some special devices that they had on board electronic 
manipulation for the radars after being out of the navy for ten years I can talk about it now 
it's declassified and basically the information is available to the public now but I started chatting 
with him and after about a week and a half of communication I came to find out he was an officer 
in the pentagon so they chatted quite a bit and at one point during their chat mj3 asked him a 
very interesting question he asked thomas would you like doing research for one of our groups 
and thomas said that he was curious about this question and what exactly was this 
and the officer said somebody will be contacting you down the road so as it turned out thomas 
qualified for a program called chapter 31 this is for disabled veterans because thomas was injured 
while in the navy he qualified for this program and was able to get funds which allowed him to 
attend college and thomas was attending classes at shasta college in california 
and this was when he was approached on the campus by a gentleman who was a complete stranger to him 
but seemed to know quite a bit about thomas and as thomas says I never met the guy before in my life 
but he seemed to know who I was it kind of freaked me out so we started talking back 
and forth and he said that he was a friend of mj threes and that he was here to give me a rundown 
on what the job entailed and so forth and he said I would have rank plus one 
Thomas Rank
so this really intrigued thomas because he actually did quite well in the navy he of 
course started with a rank of e1 but rose all the way to e5 and if you know your navy rankings 
this is basically the equivalent of a sergeant so thomas already had a pretty high ranking 
when he left the navy and now he was basically being offered a promotion as thomas says this 
plus one said that any situation that I got into I would have control of the situation so if I went 
to a plane crash per se I would have control of the landing site so this was interesting
George Sparks
so what's interesting about this is this gentleman who introduced himself to thomas 
said his name was george sparks that also is a pseudonym but george told thomas all about this 
and sort of inferred that these plane crashes were really not plane crashes but rather ufo 
crashes he didn't say this directly but that was absolutely the inference and thomas replied that 
he was still and george told him that he would be contacted later so it was just a few months later 
and george was at this time working for the veterans clinic in reading california 
and he was just doing basic office work and this is when something very strange happened 
as thomas says in his own words I was basically a gopher filing papers shredding stuff the whole 
nine yards and i'm sitting there going through the files putting the files back to the file room and 
alphabetizing them when lo and behold I come up with the medical file of george sparks the 
same guy I had met at shasta college and the funny thing about it on the outside of the file it said 
eyes only top secret well all top secret files are supposed to be kept in the administrator's office 
as far as me being an administrative aide even with a secret clearance I am not supposed to 
handle that type of material they're not supposed to be open to anybody in administration I knew it 
was a no-no for this file to be out so I took it to the administrator's administrative officer as 
it turns out the officer was outraged and said what are you doing with this file thomas replied 
i'm returning it to you sir because I know that it's not supposed to be out in the general files
so his boss was not happy and as thomas says I basically got the third degree 
it was supposed to be under lock and key and I got my ass royally chewed out and so forth 
thomas knew exactly what was going on this was clearly a setup 
as he says I know why it was on my desk it was to give sparx's background
so it was really no surprise to thomas when a few weeks later this same gentleman george 
sparks showed up at the veterans clinic as a fellow employee working right along with thomas 
and they began to talk and this is when george revealed exactly what this so-called job 
Omega Group
would entail and told him told thomas that he would be part of a group called the 
omega group the red team in the omega group and it was all about ufo crash retrievals as thomas says 
in omega when there's a crash of a vehicle what omega does is they send out what they call a red 
team the red team goes and encircles the area sets the outer perimeter when the local military 
come in they place them in the outer perimeter and then they the red team basically search and 
destroy to the crashed vehicle in this case a ufo or some sort of extraterrestrial vehicle 
so thomas of course always knew ufos were real had heard of ufo crashes but here he is getting 
first-hand information and being invited to become a part of this project 
this is what we now know is called project pounce part of project aquarius 
which is an official government project to recover crashed ufos so as thomas says 
we worked together on and off for about a week and he came to me about a week down the road and said 
well if you want to do what we talked about you need to contact the police science 
at blank college and basically what he told me about the commitment was 
once in never out I could never have contact with my family ever again 
i could never have a relationship well I was just starting one with my girlfriend 
now my wife i'd have to drop that which I could never so as tempting and as mind-blowing as this 
opportunity was thomas ultimately declined and said no as he says I just let it go
Harry Jameson
but now he although he declined he had sort of a pipeline of information directly into 
this secret government group he knew it existed he knew people who were in it and he was very 
intrigued and attempted to learn as much as he could about it while staying on the outskirts of 
this group and in 1993 still online in these ufo chat rooms he connected with another gentleman who 
we'll call harry jameson this is again a pseudonym and by coincidence or not harry jameson was 
actually a member of the red team in project omega the very group that thomas had been invited to 
join and declined to do so so yeah this is part of project pounce project aquarius to recover 
crashed ufos and harry jameson had quite a bit of interesting information to share 
with thomas and what he said was that there was a lot of ufo activity during the vietnam war and 
harry jameson was part of a project in which they actually recovered ufos during the vietnam war 
so i'll just let thomas talk about what he learned in his own words as thomas says 
he said that back in the military he had been part of a group he was in omega red he was in vietnam 
as a sergeant and got a field promotion to major or I don't know what and was put in a 
multi-service force at the time they were referred to as dragon slayers they were lrps long range 
reconnaissance these are two-man sniper teams a shooter and a spotter they are given a photograph 
and they are taken out in a helicopter dropped off in the middle of nowhere near their target and 
then they sneak their way to the target eliminate them and come back that was their primary mission 
the secondary mission if I understand correctly they were the initial groups of project pounds 
if you start doing your research project pounce was the recovery of downed vehicles 
and these guys were gung-ho they were given orders and they did what they 
were told to do whether it be with the red team or not to my understanding there were 
three vehicles that went down in vietnam and our government this black ops group went in 
put the perimeter up took the regular military and used them for the outer areas and basically 
anything that was between the outer perimeter and the vehicle was eliminated killed whether it be 
animal man or alien they wanted technology and they didn't give a rat's ass who they killed 
to get it they went in and laid defoliant into the jungle that way they could find the vehicle faster 
they were all about getting the technology and they didn't care who they killed to do it 
so harry jameson told thomas that the real use of agent orange wasn't so much about you know 
the enemy but was really used as a resource to help aid them in the recovery of these 
downed ufos so this is what harry jameson told thomas and following harry's work in vietnam 
harry returned to the united states and was stationed at area 51 as a security guard 
where he worked for a number of years but the work was just too stressful it was too much for harry 
and he requested to be let out well of course once you're in the omega team it's once in never 
out but harry apparently got an exception but it was at a very high price harry told thomas that 
he got out but um to get out he had to undergo brainwashing apparently he was approached by a 
gray alien who completely erased his memory of his entire service at area 51 and in vietnam as well 
Dumb Bases
so harry jamerson was released from the omega team and project pounce and all of this 
and lived a normal life as far as you could tell until he had a severe car accident 
and as a result of this car accident harry jameson's memories 
started to return and he recalled his involvement with project pounce in vietnam 
and his work as a security guard at area 51 and harry had a very interesting story to tell thomas 
and harry said that area 51 is real it goes many levels underground and in fact there are many 
deep under underground military bases across the united states what we now know are 
called dumbs and that in fact not only are there underground bases crisscrossing the united states 
but there's a tunnel system a huge tunnel system going all across the united states
thomas told me that uh in fact harry told him that there is a tunnel 
reaching from area 51 all the way to edwards air force base in the high desert in california all 
the way to the santa catalina channel and that's just one of many of these tunnels 
so we know that there are a lot of tunnels and underground bases researchers have done 
a lot of work into this particularly richard sautter who has really probably the leader 
into the research of underground bases and tunnels crisscrossing the united states 
so this is some of the information that harry was giving to thomas as thomas says and again I quote 
i got curious and I started asking jameson about the tunnel systems and the way he said it to me 
was i'm not telling you this but you mean the ones that you can fly an assault helicopter through 
in one of our conversations jameson told me about a submarine base there at area 51 
and how tunnel systems exist all through the continental united states 
and go to what they call the dumb bases deep underground military bases I learned about 
the dumb bases and I learned that the united states is funneling about one and a quarter 
trillion dollars a year toward black ops projects and it's not necessarily only the u.s government 
that's doing it the us government itself is kind of in the dark about this the executive branch 
our government structure it's a facade it's a pacification to keep us pacified 
while the secret government is playing their own games it's not the white house that's in control 
it's the pentagon so this was the information that harry jameson was telling thomas and he had 
some really interesting information about area 51. now area 51 is of course a super famous ufo story 
there are a lot of whistleblowers coming out of area 51. of course we all know about bob lazar 
bob lazar is of course the one who really put area 51 on the map but bob lazar is only one 
of many many whistleblowers who'd have information about area 51. of course there's bill ewhaus 
another gentleman who said he worked with uh gray alien by the name of j 
rod I was able to meet bill you house face to face I can tell you he was a very kind and sincere 
gentleman so he's another area 51 whistleblower and there are others another would be boyd bushman
another is dan burrish there are many there's another one by the name of robert miller these 
are all controversial figures to say the least and uh some people have accused them of hoaxing 
but I don't know uh all of the all of them have come under vicious attacks of one kind or another 
Area 51
but their stories match each other's and they're not the only ones who are coming out with this 
kind of information about area 51. in fact in a prior video I did about ufos over nevada the 
top 20 cases I covered area 51 in depth and a lot of the information coming out from these 
whistleblowers absolutely does match up and what harry jameson had to say about area 51 uh 
it's really quite mind-blowing and uh he told thomas all about what he learned 
so over the next five years thomas corresponded with harry jameson and 
learned all about his job at area 51 and i'll just let thomas describe it in his own words 
as thomas says here's some details at area 51 there is a hanger at the northern 
end of a runway that they call hanger delta the green door and the green door is an access point 
to an elevator system and this elevator goes all the way to an underground base to my understanding 
this underground city is called phoenix and has a population of about 10 000 people this is not 
only humans but alien friends from conversations with jameson what i've come to find out is that 
there are about seven different races existing at that facility at the lower levels of the base 
there are 15 levels to the base and the last five levels are alien crew quarters as you got 
into those levels there were different atmospheres depending on the alien from what I understand they 
didn't go into the lower level unless there was a drastic need and then whenever they went into 
the lower levels they always had an escort they always had their alien counterparts with them
so jameson told thomas that he had been down to these lower levels a few times 
and that his alien counterpart his guide was none other than j-rod 
as talked about by bill euhouse and other area 51 whistleblowers and as uh thomas says 
this alien was one of the zetta reticuli one of the science class or the diplomat 
class of aliens they were like an ant colony their existence is very telepathic and non-emotional
jameson told thomas that he had a top secret umbra clearance 
which is pretty much one of the top clearances top secret clearances you can get and uh
later thomas was actually able to meet harry jameson face to face and uh speak with him 
and he not only met jameson face to face he was able to meet with other members of the omega team 
who verified jameson's identity so this is most of what jameson or rather thomas learned about 
what's going on in the secret government but he did have one other really freaky and somewhat 
alarming experience it really quite disturbed him he was talking to one of these officers 
a military officer who was involved a part of the omega team when something amazing happened
he thought this gentleman was a normal human but it turned out he wasn't and as thomas says he was 
a shape-shifter I was standing five feet in front of him when he changed to a gray
so this showed thomas just how advanced grays are and that they can put on a screen memory 
and appear as a completely normal human being this is thomas's experience I can tell you that 
while I can't prove thomas is telling the truth I was able to verify his identity his employment 
on the uss kid and that his testimony is matching up with what other whistleblowers are saying 
uh thomas is still doing his research into this subject and trying to find out 
all he can he often wonders what his life would have been like if he had said yes to this offer 
to join the secret government but ultimately he's glad he declined and 
lived a normal life because he felt like it would have been too lonely and too stressful 
and after seeing what harry jameson had to go through yeah thomas is glad he declined 
but he's also glad that he was able to get sort of a pipeline of information to what is going on 
and he feels like it's really important that people know how deeply involved our government 
is involved in the ufo subject and I agree and that's why I wanted to do this video I did tell 
thomas's story in my new book wondrous 25 true ufo encounters it's one of a few whistleblower 
accounts that I was able to include in this book I feel it's important testimony I feel like it's 
important people know that there is a government cover-up that our government is neck deep involved 
in this subject and despite their denials about the reality of ufos they know full well that 
it is real and are spending an enormous amount of time money and effort to study this subject
so that's why I wanted to do this video so I hope you've enjoyed this story I hope you 
learned something I really want to thank you for listening I really appreciate your support so 
that's it for now keep searching for the truth and more importantly until next time keep having fun
