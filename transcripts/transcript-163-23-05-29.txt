kinds of fun just talking with Brigitte so let's bring her on and get started hi
can you hear us can you hear us Brigid [Music] I don't think we can hear you hey [Music]
so excited to talk with you I hope my the bile was accurate enough
uh well that's all right I got it from your website bridgetbarkly.com 
thank you and yeah we have some interesting images that will be flashing uh during your as you tell 
your story and I know you have so many really amazing experiences to tell so we're probably 
going to be hopping all over the place with it and I'm really not sure where to start otherwise then 
the beginning I guess with your childhood and how I think the story that really captured me was you 
were talking about visiting what you thought was a gazebo at first yeah and meeting with these beings
yeah so um it started at a very early age around about six seven um I lived in a very small little 
village in England and um everybody knew everybody so you could go off and wander around the village and one day I decided to go into the little village a little fishing Village 
down with my dog and um I decided to go home a different way and I I'm not sure why but 
obviously as we know this is why I went home a different way I um I went around the back of uh 
the houses around the back of the car park and that would lead down a lane to go up back around 
the back of my house and as I was doing that I met a young girl about my height long dark hair 
um big eyes and um she showed me some money well she showed me she's had something in her hand 
and there was no what I can't remember is there was no communication as a child you know 
um you'd have like students who used to have students come and stay with us and maybe a lot of them came from like um here to learning English so there was no communication except 
for what was on her hand and then she sort of showed me her house we talked behind you know 
her well she didn't say it but she communicated but I was her house and you know I knew that I 
was late going home because when you're a kid you go out for tea you go out all day and then you only go home and you're hungry because you're out your little friends and I remember going home 
and then the next day I then wanted to go back to our house because oh I found a new friend in the village that I don't play with and I went back down the same same place 
up up to the cul-de-sac where it was but the house wasn't there and there was no house there 
there was what there well there were houses there but where she showed me her house was was all I can describe it is like a gazebo with with lights around it it was low it was on the 
floor in the field so it's all shimmery on the on on the grass on the field and it was very big 
and the sort of It kind of if you think of it like you know I always like say as a kid growing up I 
used to watch like the Elvis Presley films and like you had like the Blue Hawaii Elvis Presley I sort of kind of had that sort of feeling in my head it was sort of like kind of like a gazebo 
with lights but this I think another very good um sort of comparison is the famous Gulf Breeze 
uh picture of at night that that beautiful um craft coming down the road at Gulf Breeze 
um you know the famous golf b side of things and um and all I remember as a child from that 
of obviously the the girl not being there was me always jumping down from something 
so I remember clasping something cold and then jumping down and then I I went home 
and so that was my experience of what I called the Chinese girl in the Gazebo and later on 
um through hypnosis with a few people Dolores cannon that I've worked with and Bud Hopkins 
um it wasn't a gazebo it was a craft and and um it was a being that I would been familiar with 
before so um that is the that is the Chinese but I did remember the jumping down like never 
understand what the jumping down was [Music] so that's something that only happened once 
as far as you can remember yes um of that encounter yes as a child it wouldn't be 
unusual for me to be out in the garden and being told to come back in the garden at night 
um it wouldn't be unusual if I shouted um you know um to members of my family he's here and he's back 
because there would be a man at the bottom of my garden by an old well that we had and 
um he was sort of like a mysterious man he looked he was dressed all in black he used 
to stare up at the well up towards the house and I many times my brother my cousin my brother's 
friend Andy would run after him and and he would totally disappear but where I used to 
see him it would be like um he was on a like a film uh Dolly you know what they put the cameras 
on where they sort of slide very quickly I'm not sure what the word is for them but he would just sort of like go in back good motion and when I did um a conference with um Nick in 2001 he 
sort of described that Nick hope when he when we spoke at Leeds conference he described it like 
um in Buffy the Vampire Slayer they were called the gentleman that were sort of Men In Black 
um but slightly tilted and they would just Glide and um or you know you're sort of quite familiar 
with like humanoids flying humanoids it was very strange like that I wasn't afraid of him 
I never I don't recall being up close to him just he would be staring at me I 
would know that he'd be there I'd go to the window and I'd shout his hair in his back 
yeah wow well going back to the gazebo thing did you go under hypnosis to recall like yes 
did you recall anything that happened say in the I'm assuming this is a craft I mean if you saw 
beings did you recall any yeah going inside and or just coming out of it well with Dolores Cannon 
um when did I do the Dolores Dolores I worked with her in 97 so quite some while ago my encounter in 
um Los Angeles in Brent the big UFO encounter that has got me into a lesson how I met you Preston
Topanga Canyon yeah but
um it's you know I with Dolores the hypnosis put me in a different direction it took me as 
um it I wasn't allowed to remember lots of things my time wasn't now for remembering with Dolores 
all I had was beings that would would be as I was lying down I'd have beings looking over me and 
um yourself and Dolly spoke about it on uh your a couple of Sundays ago with um uh Christine Dennis 
and we're talking about the eyes and the lenses on the eyes well um to me they were lenses on the 
eyes they were like if I if I they were looking at me and they were like stagnant green eyes like 
just watery stagnant green eyes and I would be looking at them my eyes would be sort of 
like hurting to look at them and then they pulled them back and you've got this book but um quite my 
book collection but I then had um uh slit spray oh wow yeah this is a great book this is an absolute 
great book is it yeah so I think that was better but so they revealed their eyes in the slips fries 
and I was so frightened by it under the hypnosis of um you know of uh Dolores calming me down and 
um that I and because I was suffering from very very bad headaches at the time 
um since I came back from um Los Angeles in 93 and it was um it's a blocker it was there to block me 
to block me to remember things so not so much came up with Dolores it was more with bud but 
we didn't actually I mean but didn't really talk that much about the um we didn't regress too much 
about the Chinese girl we regressed about the um other other encounters and the the Los Angeles 
encounter that I had well you know what fascinates me about that and Connor is how he perceived it as 
a gazebo because I do have another case from a guy in West Virginia who is driving with his family 
and they drove by what they thought was a house and he actually shouted out look it's the Flying Saucer house because it was on stilts and it was around silver and that's how they perceived it of 
course they did go back and it wasn't there and there's another case like that in Arizona where 
an elderly couple looked outside their house like hey look someone built a house overnight and it 
had little lights all around it it was in this fenced off field and they were going to go out 
there the next morning and check it out because they had no idea how that had just dropped there without them even noticing and of course when they went out that morning it was gone and they're like 
wow yeah one more case like that that I mean just reminds me it was a guy I know who I interviewed 
was driving through the desert and they yeah just burned him hand on the radiator the engine 
overheated and they drove up to a hospital out in the middle of the desert nothing there went in got 
treated went back and they're like let's go see if that hospital of course wasn't there that was 
a UFO so it's interesting to me how people can perceive this is just a normal human structure 
and another thing that I find interesting as you mentioned it's it's a bit better become you know 
um taken isn't it um you know Steven Spielberg you know like the screen the famous scream memories 
right right and another thing I'm I just find interesting maybe Dolly you can comment on this 
is because you're talking about having headaches because I I think Dolly you at age 14 are trying to remember you had this headache headache it would not stop it was a
mid me from doing anything else until I sat down and started trying to replay and the minute I started trying to do that the headache lessened and then memory started flooding back 
on me it was almost like my brain was taking the situation over and forcing me to recapture 
what I was missing you know it was horrible I spent all day in a headache until I actually
my hair was falling out after I came back from Los Angeles I was treated for radiation by my doctor 
um yeah it wasn't wasn't good like you've just gone down in um sound so I'm just going to put 
my headphones on actually okay all right I can't hear you yes I'm wondering if the 
headache thing is related to the whole process of trying to get through that wall of amnesia 
um I mean that's what it sounds like to me
I worked with her for three days I've got all of them on VHS I was thinking of converting them actually and I haven't I have 
not watched them since 97 so I don't really remember but um I was thinking of having them converted then putting them onto my website um and I was thinking of doing bits of that 
with budget hypnosis so it'd be interesting um because obviously whatever I um regressed 
back to I've totally forgotten again until all I remember is you know until I'm ready to know
interesting so this figure you saw in the backyard that was that just yeah did you see any detail to it or is just a shadowy figure
no yeah definitely he was just he was just like like like the people from like Buffy 
the vampires there he was just a man at the bottom of the garden you know sort of a face it didn't have a beard it's just a face because he was oh we had quite a long Garden I should 
have sent you the picture of the of the um the house and where the where the pump well was 
um but he would be just always in the same place and I think from from memory it was 
about four or five times it had happened and we then left there when I was 10. 
uh well uh no 12 what I left there when I was 12. so it happened when I was a lot younger 
um you know between six seven eight nine ten have you ever seen him again as an adult 
no no no no um no no I'm the only sort of similar to sort of like what I would perceive 
as like the Men in Black type of episode would be on my Brentwood La encounter with 
the military helicopters and the men in black I mean you know you don't expect to have an a UFO encounter with military helicopters anime in Black cob you know it does happen
more several times
excuse me sorry you saw the guy in the garden yeah oh yeah 
um yeah quite a few times yeah oh yeah yeah four or five times yeah
when you moved did you notice at all that um I started noticing as a small child that other elements other than uh ETA started showing up in 
my life and I had a very dramatic incident where a man in Black approached me and tried to grab me 
and I had a friend with me and I we bolted and we ran um have you ever had any instances like 
that in your lifetime where all of a sudden you know that you're being watched at all is that a nuclear as by things or like government yes um any government wow
um so yeah um definitely growing up I would have I'd have out of body experiences in that house I'd 
be able to learn to go out of my body and look up I told you about that person tonight and Dolly the 
other the other week but I'd go out of my body be able to look up and also the little people I would 
class them as the little people I was um that was probably ever my first ever encounter with 
what we you'd call little people and my dad said don't worry you know you know lots of people see 
you know things that happen and I it was me and my um old friend Marnie where I used to live we went 
we were camping in her garden and we saw at night little people running up and down the Rockery I 
never actually regressed back to that I didn't go back to that because I I didn't think that um I didn't really want the need to go back to that it was more like the the it was more like the 
Chinese girl that I wanted to go back to in the Gazebo and like my La encounter as for a military 
well obviously I used to do conferences with Nick Pope Nick I contacted Nick when I came back from 
Los Angeles and I had started doing a witness support group and at the witness support group 
um they they misconstruded my story and made it look so stupid and I got so angry because it 
wouldn't you know I'm thinking no no you've you've you've made me look like a fool the girl sees UFO 
blah blah I'm thinking I'm not having that so I had contacted my very first people I contacted was 
um people in move on and a guy called Ken Phillips he was um in England he was a very well-known 
researcher um uh in England and he sort of like took me under his wing and we used to write back 
in the days we used to write letters to each other and I used to go up and visit him and he told me who I could get in contact with and then I got in contact with Nick and because Nick worked at the 
UFO desk in um in London uh between I think it was five years he was there at the desk I contacted 
him and I said listen you research and you go and speak to people that have had UFO sightings from pilotses and Witnesses and more credible Witnesses than the typical person next door 
they've misconstrued to my story would you please put something in the paper in which he did and 
then and so then the guys that from the newspaper said oh okay all right and then I wanted to go and 
meet Nick and he was at a conference in um think it was the life actually I don't really matter 
I think it was Bristol or Wales or something but that's where I first met him and then I told him about my encounter and he said very interesting you know the fact that it's military helicopters 
and Men In Black car and a craft right on the Los Angeles freeway and I at that point you know 
I contacted mufon I spoke to Walton dress on the phone you know I've kept every single record of 
every letter that I wrote to somebody every phone call that I've had with somebody well back then 
um you know I've got the Morton Andreas um uh in you know when we spoke 
um and yeah I just wouldn't let it lie because I even though I'd had encounters growing up this 
was a really different encounter this was sort of like the game changer for me I'm thinking and then I am not going to sit down you know this is too incredible what has happened and I was 
with a witness at the time I just saw it no no and back then you had UFO magazines there was a 
lot of magazines out the internet was sort of like starting out um I contacted you Preston via mail 
um and um snail mail back in the day and um you know I then said to you I'm ever 
so sorry you know when I lived in Topanga shortly after my encounter I was one of the 
ladies that took down your poster that was in Topanga Canyon it had a UFO if anyone had seen 
a UFO police contact I never had the guts to contact you at the time but as soon as I came back to England I thought right I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do it properly
um just going back to your childhood so were you connecting with all to the UFO phenomena at that 
time or was this just like you didn't interpret it you know were you thinking um [Music] well 
I used to see ghosts when I was younger um I used to be able to tell people um you know who was next 
to them or they used to just materialize in front of me um I used to describe them fully I never had 
um Claire audio I wasn't clear audio I just was I could see I could sense um like I said I could 
used to do this I Used to Love sometimes going to bed and having an out of body experience to see if 
I probably got my room correctly because I would go out of my body and that's why I loved your book Journeys out of body that you know as a kid it was so it was like it was like a game I could go 
into bed and I could get up go high up and astral project and look around my room and it was amazing 
um to the point of obviously I had the last straw um go out of body you know when I had 
other UFO experiences around the same time um I used to work with mediums 
um no I never connected the beings and the UFOs all together until until I had my La encounter 
I heard telepathically a few things and one of the things that I heard was 
um you know that it's all I will I will know it'll all come together and when you know that 
you'll know that um it's like all the fragments of everything that had happened to me then it 
clicked and I'm like oh my god well how on a minute the Chinese girl and the Gazebo was that 
a UFO encounter because I never really thought of it as a European Capital even though my brothers 
um had both had UFO encounters um where I you know growing up 
um mum hadn't dad hadn't but both my brothers had
yeah amazing you never saw a UFO as a kid just flying around
no no things would happen to me as as you know there was there was a great weird thing that happened to 
me as well I used to that in the same Village um there was like a council estate you'd walk out of 
my house up a hill uh through some fields to the council state I had some friends up there we'd go 
and play in the day and then at its home time I'd walk home I would walk through the council 
state walk through the fields and there was a little late it's a very small little lane between between the lane and then my school then down the hill and my house was at the bottom of the hill 
and I remember walking through mist fog it was just like like fog and a mess and I'm like I was 
really scared I'm like sort of rushing I mean I've got goosebumps as I say this but I had Goose well 
yeah I've got all four horrible lapis but I don't I don't think of that encounter very often but 
you know something definitely happened there and I've I've read many of books where people open the 
doors or there's a rolling mess that's rolling towards you or you know and something happens 
that definitely was something and it wasn't until I had the LA encounter then the pieces 
of the jigsaw sort of went together yeah all right very interesting well yeah let's go to 
the LA encounter because that's the one that is so amazing crazy yeah I know I know I I 
I'm blessed by having that encounter because it's you know I think all of us are aren't we Dolly 
and Preston you know all of us have had your phone characters I mean how amazing and you know all of 
my encounters like all of your encounters are all different and all of our encounters are different 
and each one teaches you something totally different and um so Los Angeles February 93. 
um I've taken um a friend of mine uh for a job interview she'd come over from England to try 
and look for work as a hairdresser I so this is all going to sound really Posh all of the names of it all in everything but took it to Rodeo Drive just a normal average day took it to well not an 
average day to me to go through a day drive because I never shopped every day or drive or anything but I took it there um for an interview so took it for an interview uh the car park was 
in the car lot I remember it was a circular car lot that kind of was I drove back down it made me feel a little bit dizzy as I went down drove out of um Los Angeles um out towards going towards 
um it's on the 101 and 405 towards Brentwood my area that I had to get to was Brentwood 
um beautiful day around about 10 to six at night really lovely windows are down just 
kind of come off the off ramp and um I've just come off the off-ramp as you go go down off the 
off-ramp turn around and I'm now coming up and the freeway is to the left of me the Holiday Inn is 
um over the bridge to the um left of me I can see it I've got a car in front of me I've got her my 
friend Well her name's Jane or it's Kelly that's um another discussion and um she's next to me and 
prior to coming up the off ramp I have what I feel is like the most like butterflies adrenaline my 
stomach there's it's like a build up to something like something's gonna happen like something's 
gonna happen and my hands because we're a sort of like just about to stop stop the car because 
there's uh lights there before you go over the bridge and there's a car in front of me my hands 
are so heavily gripped to the steering wheel like you wouldn't be able to the World's Strongest Man 
won't be able to price them off off the steering wheel and like the the the theme what is it what 
is this and I'm not talking to to her and then you've got the the part of your car you've got 
your windscreen you've got that's that um Chrome part of the bar and then you've got your which 
would be the window that I had my wind up and they'd be part of the door all I remember is 
saying something very silver just there so on that sort of like that on that triangular bit there so 
then from that I remember then just putting my face right up to the windscreen pretty much 
and all I can describe it as is like this craft that's about like 40 40 45 foot in length massive 
silver structure and I know everyone says it it's like you feel that you can touch it it was that 
low that it felt like I could touch it it was probably about about you know 10 11 meters away 
from me if that above me it would have been it would have been it was just by the car in front 
of me so it would have been it's just probably the height of like the traffic light it was that low 
and I'm looking at it and I Then I then swear oh I go what that beep you know and I go my God 
I'm like yeah oh yeah oh we got a picture so there you go oh see there's like a beauty courtesy of 
courtesy of Jim Ryan we did an animation for that but that's what happened it was like that so now 
I'm looking underneath this craft and you've got that beautiful orange there that was like exactly 
like that and it's it I was looking at it and it had no wings it had no fuelage coming from it 
and it was sort of like gliding um like it was so heavy I mean God how could it be doing this well 
I had no wings like nothing coming out from it wasn't emitting anything wasn't making any noise 
um and I because I've swore we're both now looking at it and it's now going sort of like over the 
other car it's going over to the right and it's going towards the UCLA college so now I've got 
one car in front of me then it's probably a car away at that point and then it's just that the 
bridge of the freeway and then it goes It goes towards um right towards UCLA over by some trees 
so I mean you know you can imagine like I'm not saying anything absolutely mesmerized uh with uh 
with seeing this the car in front is going forward I then go forward I know that I can't make a right 
but at this point when I say like a telepathy type of thing I've been told that I or whether 
it's just like human instinct like hunter-gatherer type of thing I thought in my head I gotta go up 
high I've got to go up high and I knew where to go which I didn't know where to go because I don't 
know where Brentwood that well I'd been to the the movie house there from a movie premiere once 
um but you know I said I don't know Brentwood that that well so as the car in front was moving 
it went over the over the bridge to the left I'm following it and then I remember turning 
my head round and looking in the back window and all I can say and I always say it on it but it's true it's like seeing the back ass of it going through the tops of the trees 
and still at that point there's no there's no wings there's no fuelage coming from it 
um and I've obviously still got that horrible feeling in my stomach and like the shakes so I 
then can we can see it I then turn around and then I'm like I gotta get up high gotta get up high so 
I drive you know to just to the right just over the bridge just to the right holiday ends above me 
I drive up that hill I then um get up to the top of the hill and I say to my friend I said look 
we're both going to get out at the same point at the same time we're both gonna point in the same direction where we think it went so obviously out in America you know you drive on your left but 
um yeah like you drive when you're left in your car so she's next on the right we both 
out the car and we both point and we both point in the same direction well as soon as she pointed 
I'm like shaking I'm like so there's the whole yeah the holiday in there that's the that's the 
bridge that I went over and um so I drive up high behind the Holiday Inn so at that point 
the Holiday Inn is directly down below me on the left as we're pointing because that would be pointing towards UCLA and um I'm like I am absolutely like I don't know what to think I'm 
not saying anything I'm like in shock I'm like I can't see it um it's gone and I'm like shaking 
now didn't drink alcohol back then at all uh just smoked Marlboro Lights bad because 
California and all that really bad but um um so I remember then it's totally gone we can't see it 
I then drive down the road make a right go round the corner and the house that I need to go to is 
just around the corner I pull into the driveway and um there's a there's lots of synchronicities 
with my UFO encounter this UFO encounter with other UFO encounters that I've had they all 
kind of sometimes go back to this encounter which is quite bizarre but as we know everything and 
all of this is connected and um so I get out of the car I remember being really shaky I remember 
holding myself up literally over by the car walking and steadying myself on the car knock 
on her door and she says you know no trying to be silly and be in English and you know would I like to come in for a cup of tea and I went no something has just happened I'm gonna go home 
um I then get back into the car we're still not talking me and Jane and I go to go and pull my 
um car out and they're in front of me is now this car now my dad's had classic 
cards all this life I've grown up with the most beautifulest and the most weirdest I think of all my life and I love all American cars and all of that but this car was in front of me 
and this car was then again I it was like I was told as I saw this this is being put here so I 
don't forget because you can forget UFO encounters and we all know that you can forget UFO encounters 
so they're now in front of me is this sort of Men In Black car that I cannot see in its windows and 
I did send it to you I think on it on an email it's the windows was so thin it was jet black 
um uh black I couldn't see into it and it was there I mean that's the closest sort of 
resemblance to the car that I saw and it was just like it shouldn't have been there and I know it's Los Angeles and I know it's sort of like not far from Hollywood and you've got you know like movie 
sets and all of that but it was like you know I've already been frightened and now I'm being 
frightened again and and I know my cars and I know all of that and I'm just and I as I'm looking at 
this car and I've been told in my head it's been put here so I don't forget and I'm like oh God 
so it then moved off in in the then it moves off and I'm then back in the traffic and then 
I am going around the road and um I'm going down the road and then I'm going back onto the freeway 
now because my windows wound down I can just hear this roaring noise and it's just roaring and then 
I look up and it's four five uh black military no numbers on it no nothing helicopters going 
straight towards UCLA college now they one of them was so close to me that I remember seeing 
the rivets on it it was out class and I think that me and Dolly had had a talk about this you know Dolly asked did I you know how was it flying well it was tilted as if to say it's in 
Pursuit and it was going and it went straight in the same line as where the craft had gone 
um I remember driving back to my apartment in the Woodland Hills and the synchronicity between this encounter and my other encounters is I had another UFO 
encounter here in England and it was the day that Corey Haim had died from who in the film Lost Boys 
Corey Hayne died in the same apartment Block in uh the wooden Hill Oakwood apartment where 
where I used to live when I had this encounter in Los Angeles on the day that I had a UFO encounter 
in England if that makes sense and also the synchronicity someone pointed out to me of the apartment I went to um was 911. the the the actual date of it was 9 11 and obviously 
my encounter happens in 93. so it's just a bit of another weird sort of like synchronicity but 
um I remember putting my I put putting the TV on and seeing if there was anything on the news 
um I remember then seeing Jane looking at me in the mirror and then the next day I just said 
to my boyfriend at the time Billy who I had had UFO experience with back here in England 
before that you can forget because I forgot that UFO experience I am I just just guys you're not 
going to believe what just happened and I couldn't I couldn't actually physically tell him um I did 
tell him in the end um but it was yeah I then after that I was so freaked out I left Los Angeles 
um after a couple of days I then went to um a place called um Actos 
um in Santa Cruz and went there for a bit and then I moved to Topanga and then into pangra I had another UFO encounter hence why I stole your posters
can I ask you a question regarding um yeah it's really unusual to have that course of an encounter 
daylight on the free were there other cars around at the time well well I can't believe this no one 
else has come forward but and even though the girl that was with me she left about two days 
later and we never heard from her we couldn't even track the girl down afterwards you know we um uh Billy Billy knew her parents I couldn't track down the parents we couldn't track down 
where she was because she could have been living out and it stayed out in America and and was living out there I tried to track down where she used to work in London you know um so it came as 
a dead end the car in front well you'd hope they would but no one's come forward with my the same 
encounters that I have had um at the Holiday Inn yeah did she say two words to you in the car at 
all and after she got out I mean did she see not really no no no no no not really no yeah yeah 
um I all I remember you got remember I was in such shock the only thing that I said that probably 
came out pretty much sensible was you know we're both going to get out at the same point at the 
same time and point in the same direction I mean I don't say stuff like that you know I'm a bit quirky and but I did and she did point it was we didn't talk on the way back um and all 
I just remember dolly is her face in the mirror looking at me and me looking at her and then I was 
so frightened after a couple of days I just needed to get out of La I didn't want to look at anything 
um and then like I said then I ended up in sort of like Topanga Canyon UFO Capital when it was 
when it was having Topanga you know Heatwave so all these years have gone by okay yeah 
um and you remember how you felt you felt it approaching you felt the fact that it was there 
do you have any other overall impression of why you saw what you saw that is there any anything 
in your mind that left an impression on you in any way shape or formed that gave you an idea of what maybe why this happened the way it did well um I believe that I had this encounter 
yeah such a big encounter so I can be talking with you so I can be talking with Preston so we 
can talk about our UFO experiences to everybody that you know this is now listen we couldn't do 
this 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago my mum when I came back from America oh what on Earth are you talking about you know um you know it's it's it's so important you know I know that it involved 
uh military helicopters trying to intercept it you know so it's I I had that encounter so 
I can go forward and talk about my UFO encounter with other experiences that's what I am you know 
I'm the same as yourself I don't call myself an abductee I have had um I have had you know I've 
had all of my encounters have been fine I have no problem with any of my encounters none of them 
have been negative even the man at the bottom of the garden I don't you know wasn't negative 
well so did you you know when when something comes that close to someone yeah someone has 
what a siding myth within 100 feet yeah I've come to learn that that's usually more than 
just a sighting that there's some level of contact there Beyond seeing it so did you have any dreams 
just did you yeah any sense there might have been missing time or anything else that might add to 
that well I under regression yes all I remember is like they're saying the filming of the uh the the 
the the feeling of being totally overwhelmed like static electricity um of um like an adrenaline and 
a fear and a happiness and like all of that all of those emotions and under the hypnosis with bud 
it was I had been taken from the car I had been taken through the steering wheel 
I'm holding on to the steering wheel I've taken through the through the steering wheel through 
the front dash through the engine components and up and then I was then placed in a field and I'm 
in a field which I couldn't find the picture but it's on one of my videos that I did with Nick Pope 
um that I drew it's I'm in a field with three being and those beings I felt very familiar with 
and those beings when I you know speak back to panga Canyon shortly um you know um you know the 
the Palladium beings with um light things all I remember in there when I'm looking at them was 
like a hair transplant they had like white long pieces of hair very thin very muscular very um I 
could see their veins they were pink iridescent veins um very beautiful light beings beautiful 
um I felt familiar with them they had a baby and they were holding a baby now um as you know that 
with hypnosis you trying to get what you can out of the hypnosis Bud was saying and not leading at 
all in any way but he was trying to say in lots of different ways is the baby yours the baby wasn't 
about it wasn't about the baby it was about the beings and for myself and which I know like um Kim 
Carlsberg it is about the babies and presentations to me it's always been about the beings and with 
like Dolly it is it is the beings for me you know they're familiar because I'd seen them before 
you have an overwhelming urge to um every now and then for them to just show up 
you know like come to my house sit in the living room let's talk I have enough well well I guess 
who I get feelings to say get out the car take a picture and you had take I said to you Preston you 
can take um a pitch of any of the pictures off my Facebook page that I've taken photographs of there 
is a great picture that I took of um light energy that I um just I knew that I had to get out of the 
car I knew that I had to point the my phone in that direction and took a lovely picture of it 
um that happened a few times I've got a few more pictures um and um yeah it's sort of like 
um a light being but not in not in that not in the form as of like we what I would remember them 
from Los Angeles yeah so this is the picture yeah yeah so so I was driving and I was then 
I just knew that in my head you've got to get out you've got to get out you've got to get out 
the car and I then literally pull the car up right up to this Bank climbed up the bank and 
then just took I took two snaps and it was that one and then there was another one the other one 
didn't have anything on it but it was that one and then I've taken another one in the evening 
um late at night I sort of like woke up um was um had been reading and then talk then I went 
online and then was talking to somebody and we were talking about walking I think I was saying about um talking about Timothy good and um you know the experience he had of like a walk-in 
and then I just felt the urge again to take a photograph and I hadn't sent you that one 
um present but you can probably see that one on my Facebook page that one's then
I mean did you get any sense of what this no no no not at all but again again it's 
at that house where I lived I had lots of UFO encounters with my son my son's called Orion and 
um I would drive him Bonkers I'd say Orion quickly come back there it'd be like on his computer I 
said come downstairs now now quick get down he'd come downstairs and one time I remember seeing like a fleet of them there would have been too many for us to to um to count um for the picture 
did you see it with your naked eye or is it just picked up yeah no so no it came out on the film no 
no I couldn't see that at all I just it was like to pass it was like Topanga and it was like um in 
Brentwood I knew that I had to get out and I you know just take take a picture it's sort of like an 
overwhelming film it's it's a bit like the Spirit guides next to you right just take a picture um
but at certain times of the day they they go into what I call they fully cloak okay themselves and 
uh you can't see it with your weird eye but your camera can pick up yeah energy from it 
and I've seen a lot of pictures of my day and this one looks just like what they look like when they're cloaking that's what I asked you because you wouldn't be able to see them but yeah 
it's almost like spirit so you can see they haven't yeah it's EMP is what it is it's 
electromagnetic pulse and you're seeing the pulse yeah of the energy so yeah you can you can see 
actually the top of the bank so that's the top of the bank so it was pretty much like probably 
a couple of feet away from me really yeah not bad yeah that's a good one I really wanted you to see 
that though yeah not bad you really got something there you were lucky that's cool they they let 
you have that I guarantee it because nobody I've I've never seen one like that ever I can see them 
when I'm on board but uh no that's pretty good well the fact that they called you out I hear 
that all the time yeah yeah yeah yeah I've I've got it I've I've had that happen three times to 
me and each time I've got something on camera so um yeah yeah yeah but you can see that the craft 
is in Full Tilt that lets me know it's not level like this it's tilted and that lets me know it's 
actually facing top of the uh facing away from you and that would be you're not in line of sight that also kept you that made you able to get the picture okay because the way the emitters work 
it has to be away from you so that's the second reason I believe I'm looking at the real deal the third reason I believe I'm looking at it is is because there is a the energy that when they pulse 
like that goes down because it's connecting with the ground it's the energy of the ground coming up to the craft it's the skiff they're surfing it that's the wave that it's on that's a real 
picture there is a little there's to the left of that it looks like there's another light so 
I was wondering if I didn't get another one next to it you probably did because they never travel 
alone they always traveling too yeah no no oh I know yeah yeah Breeze usually yeah yeah and for 
those who can't see it it does show this beautiful white sort of saucer Globe shaped thing with light 
coming down into a field yeah it's really quite extraordinary yeah thank you thank you [Laughter] 
just put that on your letter on your website on your Facebook put it on your head yeah 
yeah yeah yeah yeah so how long was it after that uh Contra on the freeway that you had the 
encounter in Topanga Canyon right so um so lots of as you know Topanga is a quite a strange community 
and um I had a friend a friend there called Pacer he used to live there so I used to 
um frequently go and visit him um I would say roughly probably about two three weeks 
because I remember leaving my place in the Woodland Hills 
um uh Oakwood Apartments I then went to um Aptos which was high up in you know in Santa Cruz right 
in the redwood forest for a bit and then we came back I was staying with friends and then 
um I we brought back a trailer from um uh Santa Cruz and we put it into panga and
um it was it was the other side of being of the seventh Ray which uh that that lovely 
little restaurant and um so it was the valley side not going towards the ocean side and 
um we actually moved it a few different places but we had a friend that lived by the end of the seventh Ray and um Seth and he was very spiritual very spiritual and of course I wasn't at the point 
of you know of like probably really opening up about it because I was still under shot 
and um I remember being at his place uh um and he had an extensive you know like me and you book 
collection and I was looking at all his books and um and it had um it had a player teeth it 
had it written and I'm looking I'm going I know that word why do I know that word and and I think 
I'd I just I kept looking and all of a sudden I'm thinking I know that one I know that word and then I'm having something build up yet again Steph and a few friends were playing music he played 
guitar there's other people singing and then I'm having that feeling again something's building up something's building up I'm starting to feel uncomfortable again and then I have in my head 
I describe it as like a TV in my head it's like I'm looking at tones like on a like a heart 
monitor you know going up and down and it was like a frequency was going fat to thin fat to thin and 
I connected it straight away it took me straight like to the to the craft in Los Angeles I knew 
that it was connected to the craft in Los Angeles and and it was so loud in my head and I could not 
get that image out of my head that I said to them I said shut up and they looked at me and said what 
is that I said can you not hear that and they said no I said you can't hear those tones and 
Seth said so calmly to me he said B you know what that is you know go outside and he lived down 
the road from the end of the seventh right up on the left hand side and it they had like peacocks 
roaming around and it was quite magical where they were and it was a sort of like getting late in the 
day and I just thought there is no way I am going outside because it was like I was being pulled to 
go outside because I knew that if I was going to go outside I was going to have another encounter and I was not ready for an encounter I knew that it was sort of like them sort of like calling 
me and I was like no no I'm not putting myself through that and so I didn't go but I did have 
unusual things happen to me in Topanga um and I had to go and see Dr Roy a few times because there 
were things that just wasn't medically right with me and um I did go to see him and which you know 
because he was your doctor at the time wasn't he as well you knew of him and um he had an 
encounter himself I interviewed him oh no oh yeah yeah there was the big wave of sightings during 
that time yeah uh well of course from June 92 to June 90 well through 94. and really Beyond yes
well my encounter in La was February 93. it was the end of February 93. I don't know the date I 
don't know the exact date but it was the end of February 93. so I would have been March 93 
in in Topanga so I was like in eye of the storm basically at that point and that's amazing oh you 
have to pass that encounter to me and I'll have to read that that's that's quite extraordinary 
he basically saw a point of light moving swiftly across the sky that clearly wasn't a shooting star 
because it was far too continuous too slow for a shooting star too fast for a plane and it was on 
the actual night June 14th 1992 or some 30 people throughout the canyon in different locations 
actually that number is going higher over the years wow so yeah you were yeah like you say 
in the eye of the storm because cars are being chased on the road yeah I sent you some great 
pictures throughout the years obviously you know I've collected anything that kind of resembles my 
encounter I could sort of like have a similarity to and I sent you some um an email with like three 
really good pictures that were taken over the Pacific Palisades you know and obviously down 
um above Lucky's um the the store down um on PCH I mean real close encounters that people 
have taken these these pictures of um so it was it was all happening around that area wasn't it 
at that time yeah yeah exactly so um we are at the midpoint of the show so we do need to take 
a very quick station break we are coming to you live well not live live streaming because 
we are pre-recorded from the United public radio network and the United paranormal Radio Network 
coming to you from New Orleans it is 107.7 FM and 105.3 FM and we just want to say hello to 
everybody out there if you're in radioland I hope that we're describing it properly to you and to everybody else who's watching us we are in chat tonight during this uh show so 
any questions you might have we will answer on there and that's it back to you Preston yeah so 
you were describing uh yeah I've got a photo that we're gonna flash on the screen here in a second 
uh of the one of the UFO over luckies I know this photo yeah so this is similar to what you saw yeah 
yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah if it came above if it was above that car in front of us yeah but 
that's a lovely lovely picture definitely yeah I know exactly where that is I've been in that story
yeah so that's um and then then there's another two other ones I mean there's quite a few that 
I have found that I sort of like quickly said because if you think about it where that was 
Topanga was only behind it really wasn't it you know that's down right on the beach but 
you the Topanga was you know over the hill literally yeah so that's very very close 
and uh yeah this is what a lot of people were describing to me as well but you said 
other strange things happened in Topanga Canyon yeah um yeah um so I remember yeah I remember
um well it seems silly to say but it's it was it was a very strange occurrence well two things 
two things a friend of mine in Topanga she had an indoor rabbit and indoor rabbits were quite 
into Topanga Canyon to the point of when I came back to England that's what I wanted I wanted that rabbit but she had met a guy in Topanga an older gentleman and I have his card and I will 
I will email it to you because I would like I'd be interested to know I think we I have emailed 
this to you many many years ago but she invited us around to hers for dinner and she invited this 
gentleman he was like a paranormal researcher he didn't know about my encounter and I didn't 
know that he was coming she just said that she's inviting a group of friends like-minded friends 
around and he came around and he was you know he was a lot older he would have been in his like 
but I was what 23. he would have been probably in his 40s late 40s maybe early 50s and he came 
round and he brought um nasturtiums he brought all the flowers edible flowers that you could 
eat and it was magical so you know she was vegan vegetarian she was you know we were putting it all 
in our salads and I was quite taken by this float that you know this gentleman he he looked kind of 
out of place of being there putting flowers around for us to all eat and and talk about and I got his card off with and I tried to find him years later and you know he never he never 
kind of like existed it was quite strange but he gave me his card it's a bit like the Chinese girl you know showing me her money the guy didn't exist but he was you know it said on his card he 
was authored and lots of different things and um then the other one was hitchhiker um like
I don't know if you looked into um the link that I sent to you about Ontario uh Canada 
um the gentleman that um has the audio with nefertia the Bigfoot 
um and his encounters well it was kind of like that in Topanga because it's so long 
and so windy you do pick up people um that are hit chiking I mean Willie Nelson lived 
down the road you know it's hippie country to Topanga totally and um we picked up a hitchhiker 
um and uh my friend was driving I'm in the middle we open the door we pick get he comes in the car 
and I my God I I just didn't look to the right anymore I just looked straight forward because he 
wasn't right there was something very unusual about him and he didn't say anything to us we 
got to the bottom of Topanga where the Topanga home shop was that you know Topanga stores the 
Homegrown I think it was called um and we dropped him off there and then he got out and then it was 
just like the most strangest experience and we afterwards afterwards we just both looked at each other goes what on Earth was that I mean he had hair everywhere I mean yes it could it 
could have just been a hairy hitchhiker but it was something very very scary oh my God I I wouldn't 
even look to the right I I was too I I'd say I was being polite but I I as soon as he got in I'm like 
check well I just looked forward and then we just got to we got to Topanga store and we just opened 
the door where he opened the door and he got out and he just walked off into the night it's like oh thanks yeah it's fanger but lots of people have had lots of strange things happening to panga 
yeah I interviewed one guy who said he was driving along on the higher ridges observation driver I 
think it was and came up on a gentleman yeah yeah can you just stop to see what he was doing and look through the telescope and it wasn't a normal telescope it was extremely advanced 
technology and the guy just kind of yeah hinted that he was not from here so oh yeah
you know there's a lot of them yeah they're not my stories but I've heard stories like that from other people um yeah sadly a very good friend my um Robbie Graham sadly passed away he 
had he'd always wanted to have a CA um crop circle and weirdly a crop circle appeared near his house 
and it's not sort of the country where you'd get the crop circle I can't remember what the crop circle was called and Robbie went to it walked around it went out of the crop circle 
and there was a gentleman um dressed in the wrong attire dated like very 1950s uh you know glasses 
you know a shirt how he was wearing um had sort of like the camera around him and Robbie said to him 
oh you better go down there walk take go over the gate walk down the field and there's a there's a 
fantastic crop circle for you to see and Robbie said to me it was like the guy couldn't speak 
English he and he didn't know how to get into the field he didn't know if how to open a gate and 
um Robbie at that point started to feel very uncomfortable and then he started to walk home very quickly and the guy was walking very quick with him and it 
was a bit like you know Timothy good as well he'd had an encounters before with um a bookstore wasn't it with um um what he called you know like a being trying to be 
looking like a human but Robbie said that was the most extraordinary encounter that he'd had 
yeah well going back real quick because there's one story you referenced it at the time I was 
doing the Topanga Canyon investigation I was going full out I was going door to door I was 
calling up people on the phone I'd gone to the police getting them my number and I was putting up this flyer with this UFO it says have you seen me yeah and I was putting up on all the 
bulletin boards and darn if those things weren't disappearing as fast as I could pick them up me definitely but that is how we're talking all of these years later yeah
the only one nobody else calls him about those flyers you no oh well back in the days is it 
I I sent him a letter I sent a present letter but more to the point of when you had Christine 
um on um a couple of weeks ago we were talking about you were talking about her paintings can 
I show my painting from Christine yes yes absolutely let's hope because this was from 
uh the TV show Roswell High and they were selling auctioning a load of things from Roswell High and 
I absolutely loved Roswell High the the TV show so I got this and then then I realized again it 
was a connection to Preston because I then looked up who signed it who who had done it and it said 
um it said um Christine Dennett and I'm like oh and then I had the art of Close Encounters book 
and I was like what and then it linked again so so my um my picture is from Roswell High the TV show 
so I don't know if you can see it yeah well it's still just a second yeah yeah absolutely that's 
Court I can see the UFO there on the left side it's the forest scene yeah I've been in the back 
yeah so that is my one that is my wonderful oil paint thing from Christine yeah from well from 
the TV show yeah and I love that it's up with my other UFO pictures paintings all up on the wall 
along with everything else that's UFO related synchronicities in this field I know Dolly has 
talked about that in her life how you know being a nurse should be put in scenes where she was there to help people yeah yeah all nurses carry Emergency Equipment with them in their cars 
yeah with an Ambu bag and everything and uh I never thought about it and the first time 
it happened to me I was only a nurse for about a year and a half and I was on 285 in Atlanta and there was this huge 30 car pileup right in front of us and I'm staring at it I came to a 
full stop I pulled off as good as I could because I didn't want to use anybody else hitting me and I thought oh my God and boom I had to get it get it now and I pulled it out and I went running up 
into The Fray and I took care of about four people who were desperately in need of care and this was 
in the day when there were no cell phones none yeah and uh it's amazing to me how help arrived 
so quickly we were close to the hospital where I worked actually on 285 and um yeah I thought 
oh my God you know thank God I put this in my car and it just kept it happening for me I'd have two or three a year after that for the rest of my life I'm not kidding all the way up through Georgia and 
Florida I mean it's crazy and it's um I often think about why I'm there and then I realized 
I put the intention there I will always help yeah I know what yeah and uh yeah so I'm gonna make a 
comment about you right now because I'm dying to okay oh yeah well I went I won't listen one of the 
things that I realized about you about two hours into the interview that we had uh for four hours 
four hours I don't meet many people who are fully conscious like I am okay um but I haven't really 
met anybody who gets it yet either until I met you and uh I slowly realized that you are on a 
mission I don't know if you understand what that is yet you might and some of us we do different 
things for et and one of them is bringing the message out and you stated it very clearly 
during our interview and tonight thank you very much that it's your support and help that's yeah 
very important and then I realized that I'm looking I'm I was looking for a certain type 
and then I realized I made a mistake it's not a type it's anybody with that ability that you have 
okay yeah your entire life talks to it completely and I do know for sure that you're going to wake 
up and completely with everything intact you won't need hypothesis at all it's just gonna happen yeah 
I mean yeah well you said something to me that you said to me that I just need to pause I need 
to sort of like sort of be sort of quiet and ask and ask ask to remember yes so with that obviously 
I've documented pretty much everything that's ever happened to me but I also documented a lot of my 
dream states and after after a couple of days of us speaking I was sort of like thinking okay all 
right come on what do I remember and I went to some books I used to write all my journal bits 
and Bobs in and I've written them down in dream form because I am psychic with my mum my both my 
parents mum and dad passed away if my mum comes to me in a dream she'll tell me things and whatever 
she tells me is pretty much true yeah and and then I've told my brothers and my brother goes well how 
do you know and I said well mum told me last night so I have dreams of being on Craft and I remember 
one in particular that I'm in this uh craft and then I'm just being I'm just going towards the 
window and the window is absolutely one of those massive windows it's all white everything's bright 
white and I'm looking out and I'm looking down out onto Earth I can see Earth and I can see that 
I'm obviously that's what I'm looking at and I just put it down to dream state so but the 
dream the the UFO dreams that I have some have been like where I've been helping and assisting 
um in in UFOs and in with craft or assisting and helping because I am that 
um I'm a people person so I'm I am helping them by doing what they want me to do 
um uh it's generally I'm the Observer but I'm I'm there as the Observer if that makes sense um to to 
it's a bit like healing isn't it that you're there to just sort of transmit that energy to know it's 
a bit like everything's okay you know and I'm a familiar I'm obviously I'm familiar to like 
um to other um X I don't say update these because I don't like that one you know experiences you know we all connect and we all have that empathy and that that knowing and and 
I I don't like it when people say well I've and I've got a very good friend that's had a 
um an encounter that wasn't very nice and I just I wish that we were all on that level 
which say you know what we're all fine you know and we are all here to to to speak Our Truth uh 
and and to say that you know what you know the the government we are the disclosure we 
are the disclosure the people that are having the experiences you know and I hate yeah yeah
you know we are the disclosure we and we always we all always knew that we were going to have 
the last laugh on everybody you know people like saying oh my God bae you were so right 
the government have come out and said about the Tic Tac blah blah are you joking me it's like we 
we we are going to have more encounters you know I've had I had an encounter in October last year 
I had two over over a course of a couple of weeks you know things are changing things are 
changing that I'm gonna smart myself up um Dolly I'm gonna start videoing you know I'm gonna start 
doing these things now because now is the time for me to do that if they're consciously allowing 
me to take pictures and intuitively I I know when they're around and what's happening I am going to 
do that you know I want to tell you something I don't hear what I'm saying now okay now you 
need to question what it is do take pictures of it because the government are putting their equipment up now and they're going out with it and they're showing themselves to everybody and 
pretending to bets and they're not oh I know yeah but you you know that feeling but yeah 
it's not not in our solar system right now that cannot be uh they would crash all the crashes 
over all the years so because our magnetosphere has been messed up and it got so bad in the last four years that they decided that's it and about a year and a half ago the last of them left they are 
not here okay so if you're seeing something in the skies it is not them it is not okay 
um no it was I I said it to you I had gone for a hearing test didn't I and it was a vibrational 
thing that had happened to me and it's a bit like the Topanga tones maybe that that the tones that 
I heard when I was having the hearing test that evening uh light outside my bedroom window bright 
red light I had three things that were next to me um which when I have had beings next to me they 
have always been the three of them um and um and then about a week late or two weeks later I had 
um if everyone watches you know the the what's it the Skinwalker Ranch 
they had they picked up a or beautiful orb that was just flying through the 
um through a pasture um I had that come to my um bathroom window Kmart waited and went back again
Preston by the way we showed the the that's what you were talking about okay 
okay oh no yet oh yes no so no I have got pictures of orbs I did Center press and that was 
um when I was at McMinnville I went to go and see what I call Big for Andy yeah and see um and his 
father his father had written actually a Bigfoot book and um Andy had Bigfoot encounter with this 
sister I went to go and visit him he became one of my sort of Facebook friends and went over to 
visit him because they went to issetti Ranch as well and that was quite amazing I mean you'd see 
um lights green lights coming out of I don't know if it's Mount I think it's Mount Hood isn't it 
from there Mount Hood Manchester Mount Rainier isn't it Mount Hood it was you know coming out um and then I would be able to I would say to um because it was um Mr Gillingham wasn't it Gilly 
Gilling lamb is it Gillingham um I know who you're talking about yeah yeah well he was yeah he was 
just about to go on and do his radio show that he has there and um so I said look it's going to go 
over to that star and the few people that were there that were all sitting down on chairs it just went into that star that I said and then then blinked out and then another one came out I said 
my Mike's gonna now go to that one so it's like a telepathy it was either playing with me or I was playing with it it did exactly what I said yeah so there's the ore picture that you were talking 
about you can see you standing in the fourth scene and there's a beautiful right away I gave you that 
one okay no there's there's another one I thought I sent you the other one there's another one that 
is absolutely it's like we're swimming in a mist of them they're absolutely all around us and you 
can see all of like the little indentations in each orb it's quite amazing yeah that one's just 
just the one but when I was with him um we went down by this um misused sort of like uh what was 
it an old air an old Air strip and where he had had in it UFO encounter and then above us blue the 
silver uh balls so they were probably they were smaller than um a basketball and you know bigger 
than a lot bigger than a tennis ball they were just like they flew above our heads really low 
um as we were picking uh blackberries and eating them um and yeah so I we I we had an encounter 
together oh yeah you have to pick blackberries if you're in Oregon oh yeah oh yeah it's 
it's Bridget because this is the thing I like to ask all experiencers and it's certainly true 
with Dolly and I think it's true with a lot of experience this is a connection to animals 
um how do you feel you know have you had any unusual animal experiences oh yes um well I've had dogs had an indoor cat called sorry an indoor rabbit called kipu I'll 
tell you her experience in a minute and um oh my my my beautiful love of my life 
um Griffin my ginger cat Tom 17 years he passed away last year and then I inherited a feral 
cat called custodian named after one of Dolores Cannon's books the custodians um a feral little 
thing lovely thing but and I've had horses um but yes I have had a connection a spiritual connection 
with my like to my angel rabbit so I had the key to four nine years and why I got Keepers because 
of Topanga Canyon because my friends had um uh indoor rabbits there and keep who didn't know 
she was a cat dog horse human or whatever rabbit she used to sleep on the bed she used to um sit 
actually hog the fireplace used to play Buckaroo with her where you could put a little book 
um you know a little bit of chocolate on her or a little TV remote until she played Buckaroo 
and then would run off um she would come and eat Terry's chocolate orange outfit that's an English 
um that's an English uh chocolate Terry's chocolate oranges um she'd nibble it and eat it for my mouth keep who got riddled with cancer towards the end and 
she started having fits and um that went and so I made the decision to have kipu put to 
sleep and I want to keep him put to sleep at my house and um my ex-husband he was a scientist 
and um so he's very black and white I'm literally the gray area in the middle and so 
um um no pun on The Brave Little but um so um he was with me and the vet was with me so we lived in 
an old chapel and that Chapel was the sitting room was upstairs the kitchen was downstairs so I heard 
the kid the kitchen radio was on downstairs upstairs we had the TV on in the background 
obviously you know I'm not enjoying this scenario at all and obviously very upset Keepers on my lap 
they go to go put the injection into kipu and kipu needed that little bit more in her so he 
gave her another dose of the injection and then she passed away the second that she took her last 
breath on me the whole electricity in the house blue everything went as she took her last breath 
so everything went off all the power no TV in the sitting room everything now says everything 
and they were shocked they were like whoa and I went and I was so calm because obviously the 
keepers on my lap and I just said I don't expect her to go any other way but like that because it 
was such a spiritual thing and they and you know obviously the vet he's quite scientific 
and then Steve and these scientific they couldn't believe that but it was she took all of the energy 
of her passing and took the electricity in the house out I love animals I love animals 
yeah dolly was a former zookeeper and has um a whole book full of amazing animal stories
Gibbon named Sarah we had her from four weeks old and uh she didn't she stopped thriving and we were 
trying everything and she wouldn't eat and brought her to the vet and the vet said she has leukemia 
and a frantic search began because we knew she had siblings four siblings and uh it took us a month 
of giving her every holistic thing we could think of was the vet doing support with her to keep her 
viable enough for a bone marrow transplant after we found a you know a donor and we did she had a 
brother and they were 100 match and we were going to go from Florida to Auburn University Hospital 
veterinary school there and um I was frantic I was emotionally freaking out uh you've fallen in 
love with your babies and um I was in New Tampa at a friend's house and uh when I went up to get 
in the car to get home it just exploded in my head I knew that they could help her okay and I 
made a friend thing you know beg you know please I can't do this don't make me go through this don't 
make us lose this baby you know we loved her very much and uh all of a sudden a drone shut up and it 
followed me all the way back to the zoo and when I got to the zoo it went down into we have a big 
it's a big 50-acre zoo and uh we have a forested area and it went down into the forested area and 
tweaked out and I thought oh my god well went home that night tried to feed her took care of her and 
we got up the next morning and she's sitting in her her we had like a little um you know how you 
have those giant dog boxes for your giant dogs that's what she had and she had a crash yeah a 
crate only it was open all the way around it was on the mesh so we could see her all the way around and she was sitting up and she was like hey you know what are you doing what are you doing what 
are you doing and we well standing there in dead shock could not believe what we were looking at 
got her a bottle she drank about four ounces which was wow because we couldn't get her to drink have 
announced to announce before that and she thrived after that she grew up she's a beautiful girl she 
has never had babies of her own but she's taking care of every other monkey baby in the zoo and uh 
you know I've got a dozen cases like that okay dogs being healed horses humans too yes 
absolutely wow when we need it you know I I said to you I'd hadn't I'd had a major operation and 
um my ex-husband he had taken the children away and and Orion my eldest son had stayed with me I'd 
made sure all of the food I'd cooked all the food it's all in the freezer so he knew what to take out when I needed it you know if I needed to go to the toilet my son had to help me go to the toilet 
but I had um a um big wardrobe and it was closed no gaps nothing that next morning 
after the operation after I got home the the Wardrobe was was open and it was like 
it's a bit like them sort of like leaving me a note you know they might as well have left me a note that we've been to visit you because there was absolutely no way that I could have 
you know my son or I didn't come in the room and open that those doors because there was no need um and it was just one of those confirmations we've been we've seen you you know 
I spoke about that on my my um uh the video that I did with the conference I did with Nick it it 
was on there that's on the website as well yeah I know you did a drawing now you did a drawing of 
the Grays which I think is just lovely now I'm I'm asking I'll get you to comment on that because uh 
that's gonna flash on the screen shortly here we are find the other one I couldn't find the other 
one that one that is on the um that this is so old it's like oh my gosh oh my God I need to go to 
Christine's painting class I think oh my God right right so so what you can't see there very well is 
um is it's more about his hair if that makes sense it was like like like implant in rows the hair was 
in rows and you what you can't see on that as well is like the little veins on him and things 
like that on them there's three of them actually there's another one over on the right hand side but um that that I did about yeah about 20 25 years ago but there is another property picture 
of like the um child presentation I couldn't find that one today for you but that's somewhere around 
um uh but that is on one of the conferences I did with Nick but um yeah it was more about the uh the 
transplant and the the veins on them you know they're living beings their energy being yeah 
yeah very interesting well another thing I would love for you to talk about because it's just such an interesting story as you had that whole experience at area 
51. I know you did a documentary where they didn't you know I watched it yeah
uh but yeah you had this awesome just interesting experience Yeah well yeah so so basically when 
was it uh it was in uh 2012. BBC got in touch with me to see if I would like to 
take part in a conspiracy road trip they did um four different types of ones I think they 
did one on 911 they did one on um sort of like cult they wanted to do a UFO road trip 
so they contact me would I like to be a part of it and I said yeah of course I will give it a go and they said right we're going to take you back to where you had your UFO encounter and 
we're going to go from um there and we're going to go and meet loads of loads of people so we met 
um very very interesting people uh Seth says Sasha kovich is it and um oh there's a lovely 
lady she oh gosh she actually I did write down her name and I bet you I can't find it um basically 
um basically yes I got arrested at Area 51 now to bottom line what happened is we decided 
we decided because it feels like a load of school kids we went with the comedian 
um and very well known stand-up Irish comedian so we thought that we were going to go to Area 
51 and just have a look around we were going to go to the gate and everything um and and just have a look around nothing more but then it turns into something it then turns 
into oh hang on a minute well yeah we've seen all of these sort of like shows where you can 
oh so that's all of us so Andrew Maxwell is the comedian in the white T-shirt and then there's all 
of us flonkers all all there and so they decided to take me on day one back to my um where I've had 
my UFO encounter as you know when you're doing any TV shows or anything it's it's about the 
um it's all in the timing you know and we had to do it quite quickly to move on to somewhere else 
because we did a road trip from there LA to Vegas and we met loads of great people along the way 
um what's that I can't remember the name of them there's a really good lady oh Annie Jacobs she 
said something to me that was it so we met Annie Jacob she said something to me she goes did I ever 
for once ever think it was a military craft nobody in all of the years had ever asked me that and I 
just sort of like paused because as you know the military are very good at setting anything 
up giving lots of false information and yes they can they can set something up you know it's like 
Hollywood where we were for God's sake but oh oh something moved over there my UFO Corner funny and 
um they're here area um and I just said no there's just there was no doubt that it was because of 
obviously the vastness of it the heaviness of it it had no fuel engine no nothing so I said no it 
definitely wasn't and I knew in my heart all of the feelings it was you know a real encounter 
and um so what happened is you we're at the gates of Area 51 and you've got that that gate 
that goes down and then you've got another gate that you can see right in the distance and then you've got like a little building block that looks like a little outside toilet little shed 
on the right hand side you can see the trucks to the right up in the mountains you can see the um 
cameras everywhere and you you know that there's microphones underneath the ground and everything 
so we just go a little bit crazy so Andrew Maxwell being the stand-up comedian set well should we 
dance into Area 51 hello and we just all laughed we went all right then so we went underneath that 
that that bit that flips up we went underneath there and then we thought we started being really 
stupid doing little dances and everything and then I remember me and Andrew and then the camera guy 
um he then went nearer and nearer to that building which looked like like an outside 
toilet little shed went nearer and nearer to it and then we could see there was a couple of 
guys behind some blinds there and it looked like they were watching baseball so I kind of started 
laughing thinking God come all this way it's very 51 and there's a couple of like guards watching 
baseball I mean that's quite a typical sort of like English thing with guys and so well then we 
then decided the camera guy um I forgot his name now and I'm really sorry um he then said I'm gonna 
go and knock on the door then so I'm like well go on then come on I'll go behind you so he went 
and knocked at the door he had the camera in his hand like filming and a few of the others one of 
the girls ran back to the minibus that was over the other side of the correct side of Arif of one 
um ran back she thought she literally like I could swear but she thought right I'm going back and 
um and all of the rest of us are there so cameraman's just knocks on the door 
I'm directly behind him and then all of a sudden literally these two guys two big guys got up 
come to the door ran to the door on the floor now and and literally we're like what 
what about what do you want about on the floor now on the floor now we had scuns get on the floor they're on the floor so we had to sat on the floor then they said right face to the 
ground face to the ground we are lined up like not like sardines we are lined up probably two and a 
half meters apart there's about eight of us seven or eight or how many there in the picture I can't remember all of us lined up like two meters three meters apart from two guys being in this little 
boo then it's very apparent that they come from down below because then they came loads of them 
about six seven eight nine and now there's like 10 of them now with us and we're on the floor and if 
I can't say that I was wrecking myself I would be lying because I absolutely was I thought to myself 
oh [ __ ] [ __ ] I don't know I know my first panic was oh my God and they said 
you know phones out phones out everything out get everything out flick your phone on the floor 
um so we had to push all of our cameras phones anything we had in our pockets on the floor they're they're patting us down for weapons like like we're gonna carry guns 
and they you know you know they they kicked off all of our phones out the way and everything 
and I'm thinking oh God I don't even know my son's number oh my God this is so wrong I'm 
never going to see my kids again you know you know it says don't go penalty um prisonman all 
of those things I'm like oh God so now there's loads of them there uh that the the cars the 
trucks of driving down all these cars coming from all these different things everyone's on their 
walkie-talkies blah blah talking guns still in our faces to our backs so now it's getting dark so 
this is like three hours later we're then allowed to sit up we're allowed to sit up I I typically 
asked one of the guys for a cigarette and he gave me cigarette I hadn't smoked for a long time but 
I wanted one yeah they allowed us they if we need to go to the toilet they walked us to the toilet 
and waited outside the toilet with us um which was there um so they've got our phones they've 
got absolutely everything on us they wanted to know everything where we live blah blah why we were here they took all of the camera equipment away from from um uh Barney Barney broonfield 
his the the the cameraman yeah he's the naughty one he's the one that got us into trouble and 
um yeah Andrew Maxwell naughty and so so now like it's getting dark it's getting cold it's really 
cold on the floor in in the middle of um area 51. so they then said to us right who's got ID so 
um some of us have ID some of us didn't so they walked us then back to one by one 
um they had everything on us uh I then went to go back to the um uh truck the big money mini 
bus that we were doing this um road trip with went back to the minibus went to go and get my passport 
I just look I was like oh I've got a camera I've got a camera quick so I then got my passport 
walked to the front of the camera which had the girl that ran off Frankie she was in there like 
oh my God oh my God are you guys all right are you guys all right I'm like no this isn't cool 
this is though not cool and then the the um coach driver he was just like in shock I just 
then put the camera quite low down and took two pictures and say just keep my camera right so he 
had my camera and then I walked down the steps and went out so you've got the two pictures I think I sent you the pictures so I had evidence that we had then been you know 
um arrested at Area 51 So what had happened then is one by one and it was a long time one 
by one we then had to go over the other side of that bit where we originally went under 
and got told off and Rapid we had to go back to that and then we got given which I didn't send 
to you but um it's it's on my website um my um oh actually is it well you won't be able to see it 
anyway my my ticket my arrest sheet for area 51. and it says everything about me it says everything 
about me it gives me um do not enter military installment oops and oh that was my timetable of 
what we did that day but everything is there and how they did it was the BBC had to pay 
um a heavy fine for all of us and we had the camera equipment taken away from us um but 
then they they did get it back and then that was put into the TV show so yeah you've got my arrest 
papers here and to say that I had got arrested there blah blah blah but they call it the boundary 
I think of of Rachel and whatever the address says on it um you know not they didn't well just a few 
years yeah anyway a few years back that there was a whole campaign to storm area 51. oh yeah 
oh yeah yeah yes I did yes I kind of followed it just to see what would happen but let me tell you 
out of all of us it was crazy the camera girl was crying to be honest it is like quite frightening 
and it went as high as the White House we got told it went as high as the White House they had to contact the White House to see what they could do uh to see sorry not to see what they 
could do to see how they were going to deal with the situation um um in which that's and 
then like I said that we could hear helicopters out for us and everything as well anyway then we all got back onto the bus so about five six hours later we're all back onto the bus and we're like 
we're a member of the bus went driving away and we Andrew Maxwell being a total comedian you know 
you actually need comedy after something like that he was absolutely phenomenal he's going oh 
my God you know we crashed Area 51 we danced into Area 51 he goes not many people have done it but 
we were Then followed that night we were Then followed to where we were staying we kept having 
the cars that were patrolling uh all of where the the the the little places we were staying at the 
little Community we're staying at the next day we went to the rememberabelia place though there's 
um an Area 51 big sort of like Museum I think yeah we went there but we went to this other 
place it's sort of like a big Museum looks like a massive corrugated sort of like Tin Shed with 
everything in it that you can buy well we were followed there and we had a car that came right 
up to us uh they would get out and literally from here to my kitchen someone would be there 
and they would be pointing a camera at your face taking a picture getting back in the car and going 
um and then um yeah so for two days we were followed around wherever we next went so on our 
last night before we flew out they only wanted to go back there so we we went back to the black box 
uh the Black Mailbox um and that's on the um uh the my on the on the TV documentary on the website 
um uh that's on there so what they were doing they were flying jets at through the sound and 
the guys didn't know what it was I said that's a sonic boom because he could just you could just see the afterburners of it flying they go oh my God what's that what's that I said it's you're 
gonna wear a sonic boom and then you'd have the sonic boom um and yeah yeah I got arrested there
did that affect your ability to re-entry this country with your passport wow 
no thankfully and you know what um Dolly I was so scared that it would because I support all of the 
American holidays and I know that this is going to be going out on Memorial Day you know you know how 
fantastic and um I know that um I know that you know I support all the American holidays because 
I kind of feel more American than I do English at the best of times but I was so afraid of that because I would be absolutely so upset with myself if I couldn't but no I've been backwards and for 
quite a few times and nothing's come up now thankfully okay well I think that just goes to 
show that you know area one shows several things one Area 51 is a real place those signs do me oh 
yeah do not enter you supposedly authorized but also destination our government is paying close 
attention to contactees and to the media that covers this in any way yeah so they're this is 
a serious subject in the highest Circle doesn't surprise me that yeah we're trying to decide 
well how are we going to deal with these people this is gonna go on TV yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
definitely and um Andrew he's you know he's been quite vocal about it as well because obviously at 
the time because that was like 2012. you know he's been on TV shows being the comedian he'll 
either put that in his comedy act because you know it's sort of like on the tick list isn't it it's like you know uh what have you done so stupid well I have done this and this and you know um
I can say that I've done it right yes absolutely you've probably done a lot more than a lot 
of people had in this country at that gate yeah yeah yeah yeah we're gonna do it again 
probably a good idea well we've got about 15 minutes or so left and one thing I do want to 
touch on because I keep looking at your books and I've got mine we got the same exact bookshelves so 
when did you start collecting yeah I mean I don't know I've probably got a thousand books or so
yeah and then when did you start collecting books and was that like part of your whole journey 
well banana I have my original book that I bought when I was 15 16 I used to work our Saturday job 
um in a Bookshop and it was it's called the UFO handbook by Alan Hendry it's just about um if 
you see UFO's which is quite strange that I've got my original one and I then remember um light 
years was came out um the Edward mirror so when I had my um when I had my sighting and because 
it was like a palladian um craft in LA that's how I knew the word Paladin because in light years um 
uh with for Edward mere he used to talk about the Palladiums so my book is very extensive so I have 
I have all of those all going all up then we have all of um the oh oh I don't know if I can sit down
um I don't know if you can you say oh I I've got I got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds 
and then and more um you know like I think between us uh we've probably pretty much got all of them 
haven't we I've got some of the rarest and some of the ones that never got came into circulation 
you know some that are like correct as proofs and all of the um every single Flying Saucer review 
I never stopped collecting and so I've been doing it a long time a long long time so I 
think a lot of researchers so I've had um Steve Bassett came over to visit and 
um Mike Cleve Cleveland um he came over uh to do some research and borrowed some of my books and 
because I got put in because I had an experience with an owl and um and it was UFO related that 
went into his book so people come to me to ask if they can um if I can you know um photocopy 
or you know for research because you know I like you you know Preston we've got a lot of 
books amazing amazing books I love them we did a show previously with Michael schrat and he 
he kept asking me can I come up because I have the entire collection of the UFO news flipping service
yeah so I've got loads of clippings as well because that's you know I when I talked to 
you the other day you were saying about news clippings what I've got absolutely loads as well I thought things that I think would probably be more valuable to yourself because they are of 
um encounters here in England I don't I don't need them I'm more than happy to photograph them and you use them for research practices because I got loads and I also inherited you know quite a lot of 
um Nick Pope's um uh books when he moved to the state so I did inherit a lot of Nick's 
um stuff as well so you know collectively you know we've got a lot of stuff and and also I 
love when you buy books that people leave little notes in it or they they when they 
write in it or they they've put something in it that's quite personal to them you know when 
you find that in a book and you just think only the other day I was in Glastonbury and I picked 
up a couple of books I didn't have and in those books that someone had had a little 
clipping in there of about a UFO on the on on the motorway here in England and it's a such an 
old clipping and you just think oh that's just so precious isn't it yeah yeah it's amazing we were 
talking about how some of the older copies we have are absolute collectors items and
oh yeah I mean you know that the value as you know it's like classic cars they're just going 
up and up I mean you know like you you've said it as well me and you were talking about our books 
the other day and you know if you go and look on a book like what one of them's like 800 pounds and you just think my God you know and then they are going up all the time UFO books now obviously
going up uh looking to see and oh my God they're reselling it yeah yeah yeah I know 
I I what I do is like you know the my book UFOs over Topanga someone says yeah you know 
do you have a copy because it's it's for still on Amazon for like 200 300 I'm like wait what yeah
well I I do have UFOs over Topanga obviously and actually I probably 
I have I've got about six I got one two three four five six seven of your book 
when did I buy that one because I usually generally write in them when I bought it oh Rock delay is written in this one for me he put two Bridget from the aliens and the scalpel please 
um please be at peace with the universe good luck and peace love Roger Leah I know 
and I got that in I got that in 1999 September 99 yeah good old Roger left 
um but I picked a book up the other day um flying sauces over Los Angeles I didn't have so I am so looking forward to reading that one I have that one that's got two authors 
I can't quite remember who they were but yeah yeah excited it's amazing but it doesn't have 
my encounter in it does it I don't think so but it's amazing because you know I've talked 
to a lot of people I don't know that I've ever met anyone who's as enthusiastic and has such a collection as you do I I am very well I know that it's like it's like having a giant 
spaceship in the house isn't it it's just like amazing up on the screen when we had our meeting 
and I'm looking at the books and I'm thinking is that is that a background or is that really hers
they all move I know I did hear from somebody and I was so shocked someone said to me that um 
during lockdown people were buying books and books and books to make themselves look more important 
when they were doing conferences and I was just like devastated I'm thinking because I am such a 
book lover I'm thinking oh that's just horrible to hear that that's just devastating wow well we have 
like five minutes left did we cover everything that you wanted to talk about [Music] um um
I don't know I don't know if I ask me anything ask me anything um with Mike you the one that you said okay yeah yeah yeah so that was that was weird because 
um that was very strange um I was sort of like in between sort of like writing a book and 
um I needed a printer and a scanner so I decided to go to the store go 
um into play School Plymouth go to um a shop and go and buy one so it was like on 
a Sunday I decided to go there and the house I was living in I'd had an encounter there 
at night with this massive like I said to you it was this massive light that that that was very 
big next to my car it didn't illuminate my car it didn't illuminate the floor it didn't even 
illuminate the bush that it was next to but Bit by Bit by Bit it went like um just dimmer and dimmer 
and dimmer I mean I I called my son downstairs we're watching it and he'd go what is it Mom and I said I don't know and then it just dimmed and dimmed and dimmed and then just went well I needed 
to go and get a printer scanner went to the store went to go and go and ask somebody to help me 
uh what's the best one to use for someone who's not particularly good with technology and 
they said some oh well they were all busy everyone was busy Sunday everyone was busy and I didn't want to approach and sort of like pester anybody so I thought okay I'm just gonna 
leave I just I you know there's no point I'll just sleep walked out to the car park got to my 
car there on the floor next to my tire there is a printer scanner next to the floor I obviously 
materialized a printer scanner and it's like it's not like anybody I could I was talking 
to anybody you know please can you help I need a print scanner and they had one in their car and I thought right we'll put it there um I didn't even say anything so unless everyone's 
telepathic in the shop and telepathic people so there was a printer scanner next to my my will 
of the car and I'm like oh my God this is just like quite scary this is weird and I remember 
looking around and it's like everyone has sort of like kind of gone home it was like late afternoon on a Sunday so I think to myself what do I do do I get do I pick it up put it in my car 
or do I leave it and I'm thinking I'm going to pick it up and put it in my car so I sit down 
and drive I'm then I'm then keep looking at it as I'm driving and as I'm driving 
and it's you know getting starting you know so I don't know it's sort of like winter time actually I think it was because it's sort of starting to get dark and I'm driving down the back roads 
and in my head there's um a um experiencer called um uh Suzanne Chancellor I had been 
um speaking with Suzanne the night before I'd known Suzanne now for you know some while and 
we were just sort of like talking about those things and we were talking about owls and and and and expert our experiences because I think she had because she actually had massive that's 
not right she had massive thunder and lightning at the same time that I had this experience right 
yeah so I was driving home and I'm looking at this printer scanner thinking oh my God 
this is really weird this is just really weird driving around the corner then boom I remember thinking about Suzanne first of all saying I can see you
because we had the conversation about hours or not well I was literally reliving it in my head I can see you then boom something hit my screen it was an owl hit my screen bounced 
off the screen and then went to went to the right hand side which was very tall grass 
and I was like oh my god I've just hit I've just hit it out oh my god I've just sitting out I pulled the car over it's dark at night I get my phone I put the torch on my phone I'm 
trying to look I'm trying to see if anything's moving in the grass I'm like oh my god I've just 
heard this at this hour I've heard this bird I cannot see any bird I cannot hear anything 
I'm like in the middle of nowhere down these country roads and I'm thinking oh my God oh my God right get in the car babe go home so I got in the car drove home 
I got out of the car and I called my son Orion I said Ryan and I told him this story I said 
oh I know what had happened and I said I've got a prince scanner in the car could you go and get it
