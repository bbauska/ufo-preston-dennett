WHEN UFOS LAND AND HUMANOIDS COME OUT: TEN TRUE CASES
Oct 3, 2025

Summary:
Oct 3, 2025
All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. Welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. This episode is called,
"When UFOs Land and Humanoids Come Out: Ten True Cases". I've taken from all
over the world over a long period of time. We're talking decades. All the way back to the 1940s actually and moving on
towards the present day. And again, from all over the world. And by that I mean 
the United States. Of course, South America, Australia, all across Europe... 
Italy, Spain, France, Scotland, Norway, England, maybe a
few other places. So, very much all across this planet. And in every single 
one of these cases witnesses watched UFOs land on the ground and humanoids
exit. Many of these cases do involve multiple witnesses. Virtually all of them 
have some sort of evidence. To them, so we have the full spectrum of physical evidence, that is often reported or close
to it. By that I mean certainly landing traces but also physiological 
effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic effects, psychological and emotional
psychic reactions. Really, some interesting evidence to a lot of these 
cases. Also, some of these cases do have a parent government involvement so there's 
some really unique and unusual aspects to a lot of these cases I think they 
provide some really good insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon and extraterrestrials their 
agenda on our planet and so forth so that's why I chose these 10 cases all of 
which are quite extensive and this is going to be a pretty big
episode so I'm going to move quickly along and get started with the first
case and the first case occurred in pitanga Brazil I like this case because
it's a very early case well before humanoids were being widely reported
well before Landings were being widely reported it's also got some really interesting aspects to it as we shall
see it was on July 23rd 1947 now this is
right on the heels of the Kenneth Arnold sighting in the Roswell UFO crash in New
Mexico there was a huge superwave of UFO activity sweeping across the United
States and the world and this is when Jose C Higgins a topographer was walking
through a field in patanga Brazil when he heard a high-pitched whistling sound
coming from a above he looked up and saw a sight that he said raised the hair on
his head coming down for a landing he saw a quote strange circular Airship
with protruding edges absolutely similar to those of a drug capsule as he says
the strange craft crossed over the field in a close Circle and landed softly
about 150 ft Away From Where I Stood now Jose wasn't alone when this
happened he was with a whole crew of other uh workers but all of them became
frightened they scattered and ran away but Jose himself was very curious and
remained to see what would happen and he said that this object was about 150 ft
wide and about 15 ft high so pretty big as he says it was crossed by tubes in
several directions but there was no smoke or fire only the that odd sound
coming from the tubes so as he watched this craft you
know landed on these flexible metal Landing legs he said the craft itself
was metallic gray white and color and he saw a port hole that looked like it was
made of thick glass and through it he saw two strange people looking out
through the port hole right at him uh here's the representation of what he saw
he says one of them turned away and shortly later a door hissed open and three of them came out they were wearing
a sort of inflated space suit with little backpacks on their back and he
described them as having large hairless heads very large round eyes he says
their legs were abnormally large and in fact the men reached a height of about 7
ft he said they all looked so similar to each other that they could have been Twins or siblings this is a feature we
see in a lot of these ET accounts one of them was carrying a strange sort of tube
likee device in his hand and he also noticed that they seemed to avoid the
sunlight and remained mostly in the shadow of the craft but he said they were absolutely
beautiful in appearance as Jose says in his own words I will never never know if
they were men or women despite the characteristics I described They Were
Somehow beautiful and appeared in excellent Health now they were speaking audibly he
believes they were speaking in a strange foreign language and despite being very
large in you know body size they moved very quickly and when they saw him they
formed three of them a triangular position around him and the one holding
the TU motioned for Jose to approach the door of the craft which he did and
looking inside Jose says that he saw what appeared to be a small entry chamber with round beams sort of
protruding along the edge so he attempted to communicate with them asking them where they came from um
using his own language and gestures as well uh the men did seem to understand
him and one of them actually Gra grabbed a stick and bent down and Drew a round
spot in the sand and seven circles around it and pointed to the Sun and
then to the seventh circle apparently in an attempt to explain their place of origin saying that it was the seventh
planet this is speculation from the UFO researchers who looked into this case
but this is what Jose described so he became frightened at this point that they were going to take him away and he
devised a little method to sort of trick them he thought he quickly pulled out a
photograph of his wife from his wallet and tried to make them understand that he wanted to go get her before going
along with them of course he had no intention of doing this this was just a rose by him to get away which apparently
worked or perhaps they weren't even trying to get him at all at any rate he walked off into the trees and watched
them from a distance and this is when he was amazed to see that they began playing around like
children jumping up into the air picking up very large stones and throwing them
around and they did this actually for about a half hour and then promptly
returned into the craft the door closed that strange whistling sound returned
and this craft moved straight up at first and then off into the clouds so this whole experience was so
bizarre that Jose I didn't know quite what to think as he says was it a dream
was it real sometimes I doubt that these things can happen and then I think that
if it was not for the workers together with me in the beginning it might have been a strange and fascinating
dream so yeah lucky for him he did have other Witnesses I really feel for people
who are alone when they have their UFO encounters because they go through this whole sort of doubt about the whole
experience and certainly he seems to have felt some of that I think you'll agree that is
quite an unusual case I find it very interesting that the witness said that these entities these apparent ETS were
very beautiful but that he wasn't able to determine their gender whether they
were male or female I also thought the way they acted was very interesting in
this playful manner and jumping around like this planet had less gravity perhaps
than their own planet that is of course pure speculation but it's certainly very
interesting but let's move to the next case and the next case occurred in
actually Australia this is in Newcastle New South Wales Australia this is also
an interesting case this does involve only one witness to The Entity but two
witnesses to the actual UFO and what I like about this case is the The Entity described is quite
unusual its appearance and also some of the things it did I don't think I've
heard more than just a few times so that's one of the reasons I wanted to include this case this case comes from
Australian researcher Bill Chalker and occurred in August of
1960 the main witness's name is Helen Aldridge and it was around 1:30 a.m.
when she was woken up in her bed bedroom by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home this is again in the Belmont
suburb of Newcastle in New South Wales Australia so she got up looked out the
window and there resting on the ground only 60 ft away from her was what she
described as a quote bright round object not unlike a large musical top so this
is a somewhat unusual shape of a UFO but certainly not unheard of she says that
there was a light on top of the object that quote rotated and projected a yellowish white beam Illuminating The
Paddock House and Garden as it swept around the object itself however glowed
red and gold and showed a surface pattern like a camouflaged tank it gave
out a continuous low pitched buzzing sound so Helen describes this object is
not being very large it was about 14 ft across 4 ft high and it had a 1T wide
illuminated band circling around the perimeter and then she saw movement
there was a short figure just under 4T in height which was actually approaching
her house through the backyard and she said it was dressed in an olive green skintight suit of a dull
material with a helmet of the same material but with a face piece of
non-transparent orangey plastic likee substance that those are her words she
said it wore white gray boots it walked along the fence looking down at the
ground and then at some point climbed over the fence and walked up to the window and only about 10 ft away she's
not sure if uh it saw her or not that's not really described in the report but
Helen was amazed to see this figure she could see that this was was not normal that this was in fact a UFO so she
quickly went to wake her son they rushed together back to the window
unfortunately by this time the figure was gone and the UFO was no longer on the ground but looking up they could see
what was apparently the same object moving away from them in the sky at this point it was about a mile away and it
moved off into the distance and was gone that is a pretty brief case but again
does involve m multiple Witnesses and a very unusually described
ET with the orange face plate and the way it climbed over the fence I thought
that was quite unusual it's a very interesting case but there's always more
where these came from and the next case I'd like to cover occurred in Pennsylvania more specifically in
Presque Isle State Park Pennsylvania and I like this case for a
number of reasons it has really outstanding ing physical evidence in the form of Landing traces a weird substance
left at the spot where this craft landed multiple Witnesses including police
officers actually and it also is a very unusual sort
of Bigfoot perhaps type ET as we shall
see uh it's definitely not your standard if there is such a thing UFO humanoid
case case this case occurred on July 31st 1966 and is probably the most
extensive case of the 10 I'm presenting here involves a lot of witnesses but
initially it was six people from Jamestown New York who had traveled to
Presque Isle State Park in Pennsylvania which has actually about seven miles of
beach along Lake Erie the main Witnesses are Betty Jean
CLM she's 19 years old at the time and Douglas J Tibbits who was 16 but they
weren't alone along with with them were adults Gerald label and Anita Hayley and
her two infant children they had all driven onto the beach and actually
gotten their car stuck in the sand so they weren't able to get out and finally
Gerald label agreed that he would go with other
in the park to go get a tow truck uh so the remaining Witnesses were
staying there in the car when police officers Ralph E Clark and Robert lobe
Jr showed up the witnesses described how they were stuck in the sand and uh that
uh Gerald was on his way to get a tow truck so the police officers said that
they would return to make sure that everything was right but then they left the scene
Now by now it's around 9:30 p.m. and this is when the weirdness began and
I'll just let Betty Jean Clen describe what happened in her own words as she says and I quote we were sitting in the
car waiting for help we saw a star move it got brighter it would move fast then
dim it came straight down the car vibrated I know we saw it we had taken a
walk in that area earlier there was nothing between those trees then all of
a sudden it was just there you could see it come down it was metallic sort of
silvery and it landed between two trees it was as big as a house it sounded like
the noise in a telephone receiver only louder it lit up the whole Woods in the
path it wasn't like a search light there was a light along the ground along the
whole path now Betty described the craft as sort of mushroom shaped with a narrow
base and an oval top structure with orange red and yellow lights on the back
she says it sent down a beam of light as it landed in the woods and the lights on the craft went on or more of them after
it had landed in the woods and this was about 450 ft away from them now Douglas Tibbits said that it
looked sort of hexagonal in shape and he said that there were actually mult multiple rays of light coming from this
object when it landed in the woods and he said they quote moved like they were searching for
something so this object is there in the woods and uh it's emitting this light
and this is when the police officers Clark and lob returned and the witnesses
explained what they had seen pointed to This Light glowing the woods and so
Gerald and the two police officers went to investigate and it was then that Betty
says she saw a figure coming out of the woods was quite large uh and she told
Anita who was sitting in the back seat don't look there's something out there
now Anita with her two infant children became quite frightened and she huddled down in the back seat and protected her
children and did not look outside but Betty of course did and she described
this figure as a dark featureless humanoid covered with hair kind of like
an ape she said and it was about she estimates 6 feet tall and as she watched
this thing it came closer and actually circled the car then came right up to
the car and clawed at the car itself this absolutely terrified her she
screamed in Terror and pressed down on the car horn not letting go at which
point the creature she said lumbered sort of slowly back into the woods and
moments later she saw the UFO rise from the woods and disappear and this is when
Douglas and the two police officers came running back to the car they did not see
the creature apparently they did not see the UFO takeoff either but as Officer
Clark says we made it back she was hysterical
screaming she said we've got to get out of here I just saw a monster so I said this is
enough everybody in the patrol car were going to the barracks now Betty was so
frightened at this point she actually tried to run away and the officer had to restrain her and they went to the
barracks and Betty she was still completely frightened she was sweating her hair was plastered to her head and
she refused to even sit with her back to the window this is how frightened she was the officers did verify the
scratches on the car so at the station all the witnesses
described over again what happened and afterwards the the police and the
witnesses returned to the car this time they were armed and uh examined the area there was
no UFO visible no entity at all and uh the witnesses returned to the the car a
tow truck was brought to the area and it was towed away but that's not the end of
this case the next morning Pennsylvania State Police and Air Force Blue Book
officer major William S Hall pictured here arrived and found what looked like
triangular tripod Landing marks these were 18 in Long 8 in deep there are also
weird skid marks based on the depth of these marks they estimated that this
object weighed somewhere between 750 and 1,000 lb now here's where it gets even
more interesting they also found a sticky substance pooling in the sand it
was colorless odorless and again Sticky but it wasn't evaporating it had
apparently been there all day so uh samples were collected by Air Force
officers uh who never gave any word on what they found but one of the police
officers very wisely collected a sample himself and he sent it off to a chemist
for analysis and the chemist identified it as
silicone now radiation detectors were also brought in but found no evidence of
radiation but when researchers converged on this case and there were quite a few of them John Keel and
others uh they found that at least eight people in that area reported seeing a
UFO on that night and it wasn't only that night 3 days after the incident
multiple police officers reporting seeing a UFO in this same
area again this was heavily investigated the national investigative committee on
aerial phenomena sent researchers to investigate and they pretty much wrote
it off as a hoax without apparently much investigation at all uh something the witnesses the police officers disagreed
with as as well as investigators from appro the aerial phenomena research
organization they also conducted a more thorough investigation and they believed the case to be genuine and as I said
police officers on the scene also believe the witnesses as Chief desano
says and I quote I know what people are going to say but this girl saw something
that scared her badly this is no joke as far as I'm concerned
now as I said uh Blue Book officers were on the scene major William S Hall and
they were unable to explain this incident and actually listed it as an unknown this is case number
10798 unidentified now they did mention the possibility that Betty had seen a
bear uh of course most of the witnesses and certainly her disagree with that but
in the days that followed this location became a circus it was became a magnet
for UFO Hunters who flocked there in large numbers in hopes of seeing a UFO
and publicity was never ending and in fact one of the witnesses Anita Hayley
ended up moving away apparently Tire tired of the publicity surrounding the
event now later Dr berold Schwarz a psychiatrist did a psychiatric exam of
Betty Clen and absolutely believed her and she came across as a normal
competent W witness and uh pass her psychiatric
examination yeah there's a lot to be unpacked from that case I like that it was declared unidentified by Blue Book
officers that they were actually able to analyze the substance left at the site
and identify it that there were so many corroborating Witnesses and of course it
is one of those rare UFO Bigfoot cases which are really interesting so yeah
there's a lot to like about that case and that's why I included it in this
compilation and now we move to the next case this is also very interesting a
multiple witness case with animal reactions and some physiological
reactions as well and it really got a lot of publicity this occurred in kusak
France and yeah it's a very interesting case
for sure this next case occurred on August 29 in
1967 again it's in a little village called kusak in France this is a tiny
little village uh but this case caused a huge sensation and therefore was very
well investigated the main Witnesses were 13-year-old franois delush and his
little sister and Marie who was 9 years old they were walking with their little
dog midor to retrieve the cows which had wandered off from their farm so they're
walking in a meadow right along Route d57 and franois was the first to see
what he first thought were four children standing behind a hedge on the other side of the road about 120 ft away so he
was intrigued by them uh because they were dark in color and he climbed up
onto a rock to get a better look and then both he and his little sister and
Marie watch these figures and realized that right next to them landed on the
ground was a large glowing sphere it was so bright it was painful for for them to
look at but they could see that it was resting on four short legs or I should
say an Marie described this little legs with sort of pads on on the bottom France SW does not remember that but
they do both recall that these little Figures were walking around the base of this sphere one of them appeared to be
bending over and inspecting the ground another held a little mirror like object
now these were not all the same height these figures they were different heights but all very short ranging in
height from about 4 to 4 and 1/2 ft they were all dressed in what the kids
described as shiny black silk their arms seemed overly long
though they did have normal sized heads but they were sort of pointed on top and
anarie said she saw one of the beings in profile and she said it looked like it had a pointed nose neither of them were
close enough to see eyes or ears but they did say they saw what looked like a short TFT of a beard on the chins of
these figures and again this was a pretty big sphere they estimated as at
least 6 feet in diameter luminous silver and extremely bright almost too bright
to look at so franois allegedly called out to the beings have you come to play with us
uh this was disputed in some reports uh whether or not that was said we don't
know but the beings at this point seem to be surprised to be observed and one
immediately rose up into the air and seemed to dive head first into the top of the sphere
the kids did not see any windows or openings or doors or anything like this
but it went inside the sphere and shortly after that the second one followed in the same manner and then the
third one now at this point uh the sphere was starting to rise and the fourth one
floated up and then back down to pick something up off the ground franois
speculates that it might have been the mirror likee instrument which he thinks it may have dropped he's not sure but
the sphere was Rising upward and at this point it was making a soft but sort of piercing Whistling noise and this last
and fourth being rose up almost 45 years into the air at this point and then
entered the sphere in the same way the other three had so this sphere rose up
and up getting even brighter and started making weird circling motions at this
point it scared the nearby cows in the area and as soon as the sphere reached a
certain point the Whistling noise completely stopped and the object started to move off to the
Southwest it was moving very quickly uh at this point and their little dog midor
actually started barking and chasing the sphere at it as it darted away and at
this point there was another very interesting detail the witnesses could smell a strong strange odor which they
likened to sulfur now the investigators on the scene speculated that this might
have actually been ozone uh which I think is a good possibility or
probability at any rate the sphere disappeared pretty quickly the kids ran
home and were weeping they told the adults what happened uh the adults
called the police and the police arrived right away went to the scene in time to
smell this strange odor now they didn't really find any Landing traces however
they did learn that the neighbor monser delure had heard the loud whistling sound at the time of the
sighting so there is some corroboration to this incident again animal effects as
well now neither child was a bit of sleep for at least 2 days following this
incident that's how upset they were and Fran suis his eyes watered really badly
after this incident and continued to water a few days afterwards so he had
pretty severe eye irritation that's a physiological effect so this didn't get
a lot of attention uh some investigators tried to explain this away as a
helicopter landing though no one was able to identify any helicopter in that area and certainly from based on the
description of the witnesses it's nothing like a helicopter this account did appear in newspapers and there was
in fact a fulllength book written about the case by researcher Jean Mark
Zulo now as an interesting side note right near this area is a very famous
cave filled with cave art dated around 25 to 30,000 years old old I'm not sure
there's any connection there but I thought it was an interesting sort of side note the kusak France case did
generate a lot of publicity it was published in newspapers in fact like I
said there is a fulllength book about it it's a very interesting case and certainly very well known in France and
I like it because it's just so unusual the way the ETS uh entered the craft there's a lot
of really interesting aspects to it and of course evidence as we've seen in the
form of physiological evidence and animal reactions and more so also the
odor I I found that quite interesting that the craft left behind a strange
odor but let's move to the next case cuz there's so many and this next case
occurred in Finland and more specifically in canula Finland it's
probably one of the better known cases in this country and I like this one for
a number of reasons it's multiple witness multiple Witnesses and it has
Landing traces as well and a very interestingly described
extraterrestrial this case occurred on February 5th 1971 it's not a very well-known case but
yeah I think does definitely deserves to be heard by a wider audience again this
Ur in canula Finland really out in the woods in a pretty remote area it was
about 3:00 in the afternoon and the main Witnesses were two forestry workers one
of them was Peter alaranta he's 21 years old and the other witness is Esco juhani
snck he was 18 they were pretty much finishing up their workday trimming
trees out in the woods in fact Peter had just turned on his chainsaw and this is
when he saw a metallic object overhead sort of descending straight down now he
first noticed it at Treetop level and it was sort of your classic saucer metallic
right above the Treetops and in moments it had landed on the ground on four thin
long Landing legs said each of these legs were about 6 ft long and it landed
right next to him pretty much it was about 40 5 ft away and he's watching
this in absolute amazement you could see little Port holes all around it now the
other witness Esco was still cutting wood he had his chainsaw on and didn't
see it at first but Peter described this object is about 15 ft wide and as he's
watching it come down he sees a little opening appearing sort of the middle of the bottom part of the craft and as soon
as it fully landed this little opening was completely open and a short little
being floated down in a weird gliding motion and according to Peter this being
was dressed in a sort of space suit type Affair a full body suit green in color
with a face plate and it was really short he says this was about 3 ft tall
and as soon as it touched the ground he began to walk towards Peter in short
sort of stiff-legged steps now Peter wasn't really frightened at this point he was very much intrigued so
he also began to step forward and it was at this point that the other witness
Esco turned around and saw the UFO and the little being and in fact he and
Peter could see at least three other beings through the port holes of The
Craft moving around inside so meanwhile Peter and this other
little being who's outside the craft approached to about within 30 ft of each
other uh when they got this close the being turned around and began to walk
slowly back towards the craft and Peter feeling sort of
emboldened by the behavior of this ET turning around decided he was going to Lunge forward and try and grab this
being which he did he rushed forward now the being was about 10 ft from the craft
and started to float up or sort of glide back into the air by the time Peter reached him so Peter lunged forward just
in time to sort of grab the being's right foot by the heel but he immediately let go because he says he
got a bad burn on his hand in fact this being's suit burned he said like hot
iron so be Peter at this point stepped back and this little man glided back
into the opening and the craft then began to emit this humming or buzzing
noise and it Rose into the air and while it's rising into the air the opening is
closing and the landing legs are beginning to retracted and it moved upwards and then
quickly darted off and was gone and Peter felt only a small puff of air he
estimates that the entire encounter lasted only about 3 minutes but it sure did affect them
profoundly because after it was gone they were both so shocked that they
couldn't even speak to each other they just kind of stood there speechless and here's another weird effect both felt a
strange and unusual stiffness all over their body especially Peter who was much
closer to the craft and they said it took them about an hour for the stiffness to leave enough for them to
walk around normally now looking where the craft had landed they did see four round prints in a
perfect square pattern it was about 6 feet to a each side and each print they
estimate was about 1 foot in width and within this Square the snow was melted
down to almost a foot deep and where the being had walked they did see little
round Footprints about 6 in long with a stride length of less than a foot
so they went home and told their families and friends pretty much all of who were skeptical uh Peter showed them
his badly burned hand so they didn't know what to think of that it was a pretty bad burn according to Peter it
took about two months to fully heal but both were somewhat traumatized by the
incident in fact Peter said he became afraid to walk alone at night and both
were very disappointed by the skepticism of those around them so they pretty much stopped talking about it until
researcher tapani kuningas heard about it and was able to interview both the
witnesses at length and he was very much impressed as he writes about this case
during the course of the investigation no details appeared of anything which could have made the story
questionable and in fact Tani learned that on the same day earlier in that
morning there was in fact another witness a Mr peny panin who was in the
same forested area about 7 miles away and he described seeing a glowing sphere
moving at Treetop level he couldn't tell exactly how large it was but he estimates it was at least 3 ft across so
I think there's a good chance that he saw the exact same craft again hard to
say but it's certainly an interesting case I think that's a pretty good case we don't hear a lot about UFO Landings
in Finland I suspect it's common all over the world we just don't hear about it but yeah a very interesting case with
multiple Witnesses physiological effects Landing traces corroborating Witnesses so
definitely deserves I think to be very well known and let's move to the next
case which actually occurred in Winchester England and and uh this is
just a mindblowing case in so many ways while there aren't Landing traces
specifically there are some very interesting physiological effects mental
and psychic effects government involvement and just some very unusual
behavior on the part of the ETS and certainly very unusual looking ETS this
case occurred on November 14 19 76 and boy I love this case it's so
weird this was again in Winchester England it was a Sunday evening around
8:50 p.m. when Edwin Pratt who was 58 years old and Joyce Bulls age 42 were
traveling by car back to her home now Joyce was driving and it was not long
after they got on the a272 highway that they both saw this
weird orange light overhead now it disappeared and reappeared and it looked
to Joyce actually like it was diving down toward the road that they were about to turn on to this is just a few
miles from her house house now this is chilcomb Road and as soon as they turned
on to chilcomb Road they said the car began to act strangely as Joyce says and
I quote it shuddered and shook as though it was coming to
pieces now Joyce immediately felt herself losing complete control of the car which started to carine diagonally
across the highway she felt as almost as though it was no longer in contact with
the Asault so she's struggling vainly to control the car and this is when Edwin
grabbed the steering wheel to help but this was to no avail Joyce even lifted
her foot off the accelerator but the engine continued to Roar loudly
and the car just cared right off the highway and into the grass and Not only was their engine
acting strangely their headlights blazed to about four times their normal
brightness so these are very unusual electromagnetic effects the engine was
still roaring like crazy at this point so Edwin reached out and yanked the keys
from the ignition to stop the engine from roaring which it did the car was
now stopped and this is when both Joyce and Edwin got a huge shock because right
in front of them on the highway about 15 ft in front of them a UFO had landed it
was a glowing orange cigar-shaped object was 15 ft long covering most of the road
and it was hovering maybe about one foot off of the road and again right in front
of them there was this weird fall fog or vapor swirling around underneath it from
what Joyce believed looked like Jets or vents coming from Beneath The Craft on
the top left of this object there was a large window and they could see three
heads looking out at them as Joyce says in her own words we we realized that
three Figures were watching us from a window in the cigar now without warning a male figure
emerged through the side of the object they saw no door open or close no opening it just sort of walked right
through the wall of the craft and this man was about 6 feet tall slender he
wore a silvery suit crinkly like aluminum foil said the witnesses though
they did see what looked sort of like a zipper going up the front they said this
man had long blonde hair brushed back from his forehead he had a dark beard
with sideburns his skin was very pale and clear at this point Joyce could hear a
quote Whistling noise she said it was like a teapot with boiling water but much softer now presumably this was
coming from either the craft or the man himself she's not sure but this man
stroe towards them quickly in about five steps and reached the right side of the
car the driver's side this is in England and he placed one hand on the roof bent
over and peered directly at them through the side window and this is when Joyce
and Edwin got a real good look at him they could see that he had a sort of pointed nose and really weird weird pink
eyes which Joyce said were quote like an albino
rabbit now these eyes had a strange effect on both of them Joyce said she
was so stunned by his appearance in the way he stared at her and particularly the eyes that she looked away and
looking away she said there were weird spots of Lights in her eyes as if she had looked at a bright bright light she
thought it was this man staring at her that caused this so she was quite afraid
she scooted back and grabbed Edwin and she noticed that his clothes were
abnormally warm meanwhile of course Edwin is watching all of this happen and he felt
a strange effect as he says and I quote the man looked at me and I think
transmitted some power which calmed me I was scared but when he stared at me with
very bright eyes I began to feel peace and Tranquility flooding through
me so this man remained outside of the right window they said for a full 2
minutes which is a long time and then at that point he sort of stood
up and walked to the rear of the car as Joyce says he peered through my window
at the dashboard controls then walked to the back of the car and then he and the
cigar simply disappeared so Joyce is terrified at
this point but Edwin is strangely calm he wanted to get out of the car and see
where the man went if he could see where this craft went but joy begged him not
to she was still so frightened Edward Edwin offered to drive but Joyce refused
she didn't want to exit the car so they could change seats so she tried to start
the car and the engine did Roar to life but when she tried to press the accelerator the car would not move she
said it was as if it was hitting an invisible wall now investigators later
wondered if this CRA if this car was possibly stuck in the wet mud in the grass off the highway whatever the cause
the wheels spun uselessly and the engine stalled so Joyce started the car again
and this time she was able to maneuver the car back onto the highway which I
think lends Credence to the what she said that there was something holding the car back at any rate once they left
the immediate vicinity Joyce stopped the car shakely lit a cigarette to calm her
nerves and continued the short drive to her home which was only a few minutes
away uh Edwin sometime later drove back alone and as he passed the spot where
this whole ordeal had happened he saw the tracks where their car had quote jumped from the road he was too nervous
to stop and in fact he says he drove at a higher speed than he normally would he
normally never speeds but he says on this night he did meanwhile more weird
effects began to occur Edwin says that he felt the same unusual
calmness and felt it for a full week following this incident Joyce however
felt the opposite she said that she was unable to eat for 3 days and was very
shaken and anxious and in fact a rash appeared on the right side of her face
perhaps related to her anxiety uh the car now this is so weird the car itself seemed to perform better
and joy said she no longer needed to use the choke to get it started she also
noticed that the watch she had worn during this incident started running faster and no longer kept accurate time
and finally she says that she felt like quote a different person that she had a
new Inner Strength within her and again not over yet 6 days
following this incident Joyce says she received a strange call from an
Anonymous gentleman who warned her not to speak of the incident and that she
would soon be visited by a man from the government she was not happy about this
she basically told him off and hung up the phone he called again and she hung
up on him now by this time she had been talking to investigators and no government man ever
showed up though Joyce did notice that her phone was acting peculiarly and it
would tinkle every time she terminated a call which it had not done
before now investigators questioned her extensively and they learned that she had experienced Poltergeist like
activity since childhood which was quite pronounced including objects being moved
around or flying through the air she frequently saw apparitions of a ghostly
nun wasn't just her actually other members of her house also saw it but
Joyce says that she does have the ability AB ility to do psychic healing Hands-On healing and she says that in
fact the energy in her hands builds up and if she doesn't use her ability this
Poltergeist like activity increases now investigators did their
job and they learned that there were many other Witnesses who saw UFOs on
that night but basically that whole week that night the day before and the days after
they found in fact seven other groups of of people who saw weird UFOs and even in
one case this what appears to be the same entity that Joyce and Edwin
saw uh they found out that Miss Sandra wheeler saw a hovering orange object as
did Norman Boise and his wife they interviewed a Miss Atkinson who was driving home with a car full of people
and they saw a large object in the sky with lots of lights on it there were
other witnesses to UF activity in the area at that time including Moren lovely
Josephine Rose and her entire family and another group of witnesses PJ Baker and
his friend but most interesting is the testimony which comes from Mr and Mrs
Haynes who said that they saw this really strange silver suited man
standing near the Chandler Ford Hypermarket this was only about 7 m distant from the encounter location
whether or not that's the same entity is hard to say but it's certainly intriguing I think you'll agree that was
a very dramatic case with you know so many weird parts to it the ET is so
unusual the way it acted um the effect on the car what we would call
electromagnetic effects but the psychic effects as well with one witness feeling
an extraordinary sense of peace and the other having all this psychic stuff going on it's a really interesting case
and also that weird sort of Men In Black aspect is also very interesting and of
course the corroborating Witnesses so much UFO activity from going on that
other people witnessed and apparently other people witness the actual entity as well so it's a very well verified
case next case I'd like to talk about is a really interesting case this one occurred in a really small town in Elgen
Scotland I like this case for a number of reasons there are two witnesses they're both little girls but they're
not the only Witnesses they're the only ones who saw the humanoid but there's other supporting Witnesses who help
corroborate this case and there's some interesting Landing traces as well some
other very peculiar elements involv in what appear to be threats to the
witnesses and yeah just some very weird elements that I think make this case
deserve to be better known this next case occurred on May 18
1977 the town of Elgen is a small town near Moray Scotland and it was around
6:30 p.m. on May 18 when two 10-year-old
girls their names are Karen mclenon and fion Morrison they were just playing in the
fields outside their homes on near 27 Robertson Drive this was in the
Thornhill housing estate at that time it was very uh Rural and not populated now
of course it's packed with homes but they heard this soft humming noise coming from the woods next to them and
they could tell that this was a very unusual noise so they went to investigate the source and this is when
they came Upon a long cylindrical shaped object with rounded ends and a dome on
top now this was pretty large they estimated it was about 30 ft long was
polished metal and it had a red rotating band around the circumference and a
bright red light on top of the Dome now this object wasn't directly on the
ground but close enough it was hovering about 2 ft at most above the ground and
it was pretty close the they estimate were about 12200 ft away a little less
and as they observed this object they saw a tall thin man with very long arms
standing right alongside the object they estimate he was about 6 feet in height and he was dressed all in
silver and Karen says it looked as though this silver suit had what looked
like buttons running down the front she couldn't be sure but they were quite
alarmed by his strange appearance and his craft especially when he began to move towards them and when that happened
they both turned and ran mind you these they are both 10 years old so after
running away for about 30 seconds they stopped and turned around the man was no
longer visible and the craft itself began to take off and it took off in a pretty unusual way it moved straight up
then moved off to the left then up into the left again and repeated this step-like maneuver one more time and
once it had reached a certain height it shot off straight up at super high
speeds so fast they couldn't really track it so the girls were amazed they
ran and told their parents now meanwhile their parents Caroline mclennon and
Moren Morrison had both heard the strange humming noise and thought it was
peculiar but did not look outside to invest tigate now Caroline one of their mothers
says and I quote I do not suppose I would have believed believe them had it
not been for the fact that I also heard a strange humming noise just like a
vacuum cleaner at the same time they were out playing several of our neighbors also said that they had heard
the strange noise coming from the woods so this is very significant this
absolutely brings more credence to the children's
testimony so the next day they went to examine the landing location and they
found a circle a circular area of about 100 yards in diameter showing what they
believed were damaged to the trees and singed
vegetation now interestingly it was that same morning the next
morning uh that this was 12 hours after the girl's sighting another neighbor
said that she heard that same strange Whistling noise again so the police were called and the
story made its way to UFO researchers pretty quickly they collected samples of
the burned leaves and uh strangely these samples were lost in the mail so they
thought that that might be significant and after this case was published in newspapers cuz it did get
some publicity the mother of one of the children Caroline mclennen says she also
received a weird phone call from an unidentified male who spoke in a weird
monotonous tone of voice and he threatened her not to tell anyone about the sighting if she valued the life of
her daughter in fact he said you will do exactly as I tell you do you hear
me and she received this same call several times
police were again called they were not able to trace the call uh and
understandably Caroline was very upset about this and for sometimes afterwards
escorted her daughter to and from school and that's not the end of this
case because following this incident she said in the weeks following it she repeatedly saw strange lights in the
forest very close to where the girls had seen this apparent craft land yeah an
interesting case for a number of reasons I really wonder what did happen to those Landing traces that were sent in the
mail uh in fact they stopped doing that these UFO organizations because so many
traces physical evidence were being mysteriously quote lost I don't know
it's hard to say whether that's an accident or not but H have it having happened a number of times certainly
makes you wonder but yeah a very cool case and one that I think has some
interesting insights to the nature of the UFO phenomena particularly how the UFO moved I also found that very
interesting as well and the next case I'd like to talk about actually occurred
in Italy more specifically in San giorio de nogaro Italy and this is another
Super interesting case in which a UFO landed of course and an ET came out and I like this one because
it does have Landing traces and while there is a single witness to The Entity
turns out there are other people who saw the actual craft
itself and again this did affect the witness uh very profoundly in terms of
how he reacted emotionally it's an important case this case occurred on SE
member 18 1978 and the main witness is a railway
employee his name is giorio Philip PTI he was 47 years old at the time married
and enjoying a normal life and he decided he would go on a little fishing Expedition along the Corno River and
this would change his life forever because as he sat along the river fishing he heard this oddly piercing
Whistling noise now he knew there was a steel factory nearby on the Osa Corno Road and his
first thought was that the noise was coming from there but at the same time he felt a rush of air and was strong
enough to cause the surface of the water in the river to become Disturbed he also heard a dog off in the distance begin
howling like mad so puzzled he decided he would leave his spot on the river to
go investigate and I'll just quote him directly as zorio says in his own
words no sooner had I reached the top of the embankment that I was terrified
literally terrified at the sight of an exceedingly unusual object standing on a
small dry mud flat covered with short vegetation it was like a sort of egg
like something disc shaped it was four or five MERS wide and it had a coua on
top it was supported on three thick legs about 1 and 1/2 M
high so this object said giorio was totally smooth there were no visible
Port holes doors lights or markings of any kind he said it was a kind of a
shiny brassy color and definitely looked metallic now at this point it was about
60 ft away from him and was still making a soft Whistling noise as it stayed
there and as he was studying its strange appearance he says a figure stepped out
from behind it this point he's still thinking it's some sort of weird government craft or something but
according to zorio this figure was a male No taller than 4 feet and looked
somewhat Asian in appearance and as giorio says in his own
words he was wearing a completely tight fitting overall of the color and
brightness of silver silver which flashed and sparkled vividly in the
sunlight and which left only the front part of the head from the forehead to the chin
Exposed on his feet he had boots of the height of those worn by paratroopers and
of a smoky black color his face dark bronzed had almond shaved eyes extending
back towards where his ears would be which I did not see because that part of
the head was covered by the overall the not and mouth were quite normal so now
he's getting a little bit alarmed this jumpsuit reminded jorio of silvery fish
scales he said the figure also had white gloves and there were small sort of
cartridg like cases attached to its waist so he was becoming more and more
alarmed as he slowly realized that this figure was not human and as he says in
his own words I was overcome by a profound emotional disturbance due partly to this
stupefaction and partly due to fear for the thing had taken me totally by
surprise I found it absolutely impossible to figure out this complicated situation in which I now
found myself so his first thought was to retreat run away but he also noticed
that this strange figure seemed surprised to see giorio himself and this
made him hesitate and apparently made the ET hesitate too because as yorio
says when he became aware of my presence he halted for a few moments probably
reassured by the fact that I was displaying ungovernable
fear so this figure kept his gaze locked on zorio giorio did the same this figure
dashed around the saucer and began fiddling with what giorio describes as sort of a
horse Sho shaped device on the side of the craft and in fact yorio had a
distinct impression that the figure was trying to conduct some sort of repairs
on the craft itself and this lasted for about 5 minutes at which point the
figure walked out of view behind the craft seconds later the craft emitted a
loud rumbling noise followed by an increasing pitch of the Whistling noise
and this craft slowly Rose vertically once it had reached a few feet off the
ground the landing gear retracted into the craft a bluish glow Came from
Beneath the craft followed by a long tongue of flame and he says when it reached a height of about 30 ft the
craft which had been horizontal actually turned on edge and
darted away as yorio says it was quote comparable to a missile meaning its
speed he says it quote was out of sight in a few seconds
I find this interesting because we do see a lot of cases where a craft will turn up and then assume a vertical
position and dart away I don't think he would have known about that so I think that lends more
Credence to his uh story so he went to examine where this craft had landed and
he found three circular imprints in the mud each was just under 2 ft wide he was
utterly amazed so he began searching the area around this uh location hoping to
find someone else who had also witnessed the event and he did find another
fisherman who did not see the event and also who did not believe him even when giorio showed him the landing
imprints so he was still shook up and the other fishermen agreed to accompany
him to a nearby bar on the Osa Corno Highway where giorio wanted to have a
drink and as they sat down they were both amazed to hear another Patron at
the bar describe just having seen a brightly lit object speed across the
sky so this first fisherman turned to zorio and said that he now totally
believed him it's an interesting case uh now despite this zorio was so upset that he
kept the experience initially secret even from his family he stopped fishing
and refused to go outside of his house except to go to work would very much upset him and he
didn't want to tell anyone about it until finally his brother angiolino was able to extract the story
out of zorio and persuaded him to publicly share his story which he did
and it was published in newspapers and this is how UFO researchers also found
out about it what a case yeah that's a really interesting case the witness
feels like the UFO occupant had landed to perhaps repair his craft I don't know
that's obviously pure speculation but it's a important case for I think the reasons we saw it's got
Landing traces it's got multiple Witnesses he was so close to it there's no Poss possible chance of misperception
it's just I love these cases they're so fascinating and here is another equally
interesting case which occurred in jurina Spain and I like this one because
it involves multiple Witnesses again Landing traces as well uh and it's just
a fascinating case of a UFO landing and a UFO occupant seen up close by the
witnesses this case occurred on November 24 1978 and again this is Jarina Spain uh
there were five men out hunting Southwest of jirina this is on the LA
pizana estate was on November 24 1978 at around 3:30 a.m. this is just east of
the guadiamar river so they were all out there hunting in the woods and one of the men decided
he was going to return to the car but the other four were still interested in hunting so they decided that they would
walk into this area which was wooded with eucalyptus trees and one of the men
his name is Manuel Gordo he was the first to notice these weird red lights
in the forest now there were some dirt roads in this area and he thought that
it might be C tail lights but then another one of the men was looking at the lights and he said hey what is that
in my mother's name in my grandmother's name what is that that is a strange
thing so at this point these lights were on the ground but pretty far off in the
distance on the other side of the river all the men had powerful flashlights so they walked closer and
saw more lights they decided they would get closer so they crossed the river now
at this point they lost sight of the lights they didn't really think that much of it at this point uh and
continued hunting they wandered off a little bit from each other until they saw the lights again in fact it was the
other three men who saw them much closer and they rushed together and called Manuel over and they began to talk about
it and as Manuel says I told them are we going to get closer they were very
scared the red light there was doing a strange thing as if it were shaking then
I told them watch me from behind I'm going to get a little closer so he was the most courageous of
the group two of the other men were too scared to venture forward but the third
his name is Francisco Lopez Rivero decided he would follow slowly behind
Manuel so the two of them walked up to within 90 ft of these lights and they
could now see that this was in fact an object on the ground with rows of colored lights on it these lights were
red orange yellow and green and on top of this object there was a bright red
light the object itself was quite strange in shape they likened it to a sort of vase or jar they estimated it
was about 9 ft tall 12 ft wide and walking it was a tall strong looking
figure now they couldn't see him very well in the dark but they could see that he was wearing dark boots silvery
clothes and a helmet with a face plate that was much like a motorcycle helmet
and as they watched him they later estimated his height at nearly 7 ft
tall so as soon as they got this close the man started to walk slowly towards
them making this sort of weird humming noise and he actually approached them to within about 30 ft at this point the two
men Manuel and Francisco became very frightened but the figure turned around
and went back to the craft and then approached the same distance again it
appeared to pick something off the ground and return to the craft this time going inside it and as Manuel says in
his own words I was a little afraid and I thought of my wife and my children so
I didn't feel very safe finally we got out of there very scared we no longer
felt like hunting so we left running and in fact Manuel ran so hard he tumbled
into the other people knocking them over and after that they ran to their
car and left the scene it was about one and a half months later that investigators heard about
this case and returned with Francisco to the scene and found what they believe
were Footprints from the figure these Footprints measured about 16 17 in in
Long an investigator Antonio Moya Serpa actually sat down with Francisco and
Drew the craft and figure and Francisco approved the drawing as being as
accurate as he remembered seeing I can only imagine what it must have been like
to be that close to a UFO and occupant so I don't blame the witnesses for running away in fear though I don't
think there's any evidence that the ET was there to hurt them I mean it was just approaching nothing
more than that but what a case and there's always more where that came from
the last case I'd like to cover today occurred actually in Norway and the city I'm going to try to
pronounce this correctly is stordal uh this is a single witness case
in terms of who well actually no there are multiple witnesses to this case
animal reactions as well uh but the main witness she's the only one in her family
who saw it she observed it through binoculars I loved that not only the craft but the being
itself and uh also what's interesting about this case is it occurred during
daylight hours uh a number of these cases have but that is somewhat unusual at any rate
it's got some very interesting aspects to it as we shall see was July 25 5
1981 and again this case occurred at let me see stordal Norway this is a
briefcase but quite interesting and I like it because it came from the Norwegian Institute for scientific
research and was also reported to AO the aerial phenomena research
organization the main witness is Miss hordis hwad was 7:30 a.m. in the morning and
everyone else in her house was sleep she was sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee and looking out the
window hoping to spot some deer which did occasionally appear and instead she
was shocked to see a metallic gleaming coming from less than 1,000 ft away in
the field now it was partially obscured by bushes so she wanted to examine it
further and was looking at it trying to figure out what this could be and her attention was diverted to a strange
figure of a man walking near this gleaming object she said it was very
short he was dressed in a gray brown what looked like a boiler suit which is a full body suit it covered him from
head to toe she said it was very bulky like a quote spacit she said it seemed
to have the hood of an anarak this is sort of a coat that Eskimos wear or well
other people wear it but it's a type of coat now she couldn't see his face as he had
his back to her but he was walking in this strange sort of quote rolling gate
it reminded her she said of an astronaut on the moon so she's watching him and
trying to figure out what's going on and she decided she grab her binoculars she had a pair of 12x 50
binoculars and she was able to get a closer look at this figure and more
specifically this object and as she watched this object
eventually Rose from the ground and the man was gone at this
point and this object moved steadily and silently actually towards her moving
directly over her home so she got a pretty good look at it she could now see it was cylindrical with a globe like
structure on top a metal bar protruded from the bottom of the cylinder and she
could see what she describes as a quote plate or a marking it was red in color and in the general shape of a heart she
thought and she thought there might be symbols of some kind on this plate but she really couldn't be sure of that the
whole experience lasted about 15 minutes and then it was over this object was
gone she did report the experience to the local newspapers who alerted the Norwegian Institute for scientific
research they send people over to inspect the landing site with a Geer counter no radiation was found however
the tops of some nearby shrubs were blackened as though exposed to high heat
and they also found crushed vegetation and they also learned that the cows adjacent to the hawk dad's
house had exhibited unusual restlessness during the time of the encounter so they
interviewed the farmer who had the cows and he says that he actually saw this craft come in for a
landing uh I don't know if he saw it take off or if he saw the being itself but he did say
that it took two hours before his cows calmed down an interesting end note to
this case is it took place only 5 miles from the very famous hin Valley this is
an area which has been known for decades upon decades for strange light activity
there you go another amazing case I wish there was more information about the other witness and what he saw but that's
just not included in the report on the case that I could find uh but again not
only uh is are there multiple Witnesses but there's apparent Landing traces
animal reactions it's amazing that people are still skeptical of events like these because they do have physical
evidence many forms of it as we have seen and that's one of the reasons I wanted to put this presentation together
for you today because it shows a number of things that this is an ongoing phenomena have been occurring for
decades upon decades upon decades also interesting is it's all over the world
North America South America all across Europe from top to bottom
Australia and of course these events are going on everywhere in the world and the
vast majority of them are simply not reported so I think it's far more common
than people realize and as you can see a good number of these cases do have multiple
Witnesses uh little children are seeing these things older people people of all
ages doesn't really matter your ancestry your your gender education all the other
things that we use to define or label ourselves uh shows that we are all people throughout this universe all
these people are humanoids and it's very interesting to see their descriptions because while
they vary widely they also have incredible commonalities so thanks very much I hope
you've enjoyed this episode of UFOs in the Paranormal again my name is Preston
dennet and I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and
until next time keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and
most important of all keep having having fun!
