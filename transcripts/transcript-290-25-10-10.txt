A face-to-face encounter with an unknown humanoid creature is often a very terrifying experience, one that changes the way a person thinks about the universe and their place in it. A direct confrontation with the unknown strikes at the very core of a personâ€™s belief system, challenging them mentally, emotionally and spiritually. This video presents ten exceptionally scary UFO encounters from all over the world. Most of these cases involve multiple witnesses. They include a wide variety of beings, including gray aliens, human-looking figures, ape-like figures and other unusual humanoids.
 
SOCK-SNATCHING ETS. One morning in August 1930, a woman was doing her laundry in a small stream outside of Montebenichi, Italy when an extraterrestrial craft landed a short distance away. She froze in fear as two strange beings emerged and approached her. The two creatures walked around her making odd chirping noises. Without warning, they grabbed the socks she had hung up on a clothesline to dry and ran back into their craft.
THE LITTLE MEN IN THE CLOVER FIELD. One summer morning in 1950, a 6-year-old girl felt a compulsion to go outside her home in Liiduvere, Estonia. As she stood in a field, she saw an oval-shaped craft sitting on the ground. Four red-skinned humanoids in green jumpsuits stood next to the craft. Two of the beings approached her and telepathically communicated with her. The witness fled in fear.

THEY LOOKED HUMAN. One day in the Summer of 1956, two couples were driving on a country road outside of Marseille, France when they came upon a large craft hovering by the road. They exited the car and stared in wonder as three human-looking men wearing jumpsuits stared down at them, studying them as if they were animals in a zoo. Moments later, the craft flew away silently at high speed.

I PLAYED DEAD. One evening in June 1957, James (age 6) woke up in the bedroom of his home in Birmingham, Michigan to hear his younger brother Mickey whimpering in fear. He knew there was something in the room, but he was too afraid to look. His fear increased when the mysterious being approached him and did something to his back. It was an experience that affected him years to come, but he never talked about it until years later, when he discovered his brother also remembered.

NEVER TELL THIS STORY. One evening in October 1968, a family and their friends went camping in the remote Malheur Forest of Oregon. Without warning, a massive UFO appeared overhead. Humanoids could be seen looking down at them through portholes. Panic reigned as everyone scattered. One witness went to get her camera, and coming out of her trailer, saw that the craft was gone. To her shock, nobody remembered seeing the UFO.

THE JETPACK HUMANOID. Around dusk one night in 1974, Phil and his grandmother were shocked when an unusual glowing object appeared and darted around the sky over their farm near Melbourne, Australia. Suddenly it revealed itself as a classic flying saucer. A door opened and a silver-suited humanoid appeared and began to fly around. Suddenly it landed in front of Phil, who found himself paralyzed. The man flew back into his craft.

FOUR APES AND A UFO. On the night of February 21, 1982, two women were camping in Gorliz, Spain, when an ape-like creature approached their campsite and walked off. Moments later, they saw three more creatures walk quickly passed them. The witnesses cried out in fear, alerting the other campers just in time to see a glowing UFO fly overhead.

MY HEART WAS POUNDING. In the middle of the night on November 2, 1997, Bret was awakened in his bedroom in Anchorage, Alaska by a presence in his room. Unable to move to first, he broke free of his paralysis to see a strange light fleeing his room. He went back to sleep, only to wake up later to the sense of another presence. This time he woke up to see a gray alien looking at him. He felt certain that he had almost been abducted, and that the gray allowed him to see it.

IT FROZE ME IN FEAR. On the night of November 9, 2010, a couple decided to take a walk in a grove of trees near their home in Omaha, Nebraska. Seeing shadowy figures running among the trees, they approached closer and were shocked when a weird humanoid stepped across their path, turned, waved and smiled, revealing a mouth full of sharp teeth. They ran in fear.

I MADE EYE CONTACT. It was 8pm on August 5, 2017, as an older couple drove along a remote highway outside of Nageezi, New Mexico. To their shock, floating alongside the highway was a small craft with two gray aliens sitting side by side. The couple felt as though they had surprised the grays, who turned and looked at them, making direct eye contact. Moments later, the craft disappeared.

Ten humanoid encounters, each adding to our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon. There can be no doubt that people are seeing strange beings. There are too many cases to explain away. We are not alone!

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dent and thank  you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and  
the Paranormal. Hope you're all doing well. I've  got a pretty exciting episode for you today. I  
think I am, of course, going to be exploring  some more humanoid cases. 10 humanoid cases, in  
fact. I call this episode I Played Dead and nine  other truly terrifying humanoid encounters. That  
is a very common theme. A humanoid encounter is  often very scary for people, which is completely  
understandable. The 10 cases I've chosen for you  today do come from all over the world. I've got  
five cases from outside of the United States and  five cases in the United States. And the locations  
in this episode include Estonia, France, Italy,  Spain, Australia, Alaska, Michigan, Nebraska, New  
Mexico, and Oregon. These cases do stretch over a  long period of time all the way back to 1930, well  
before the modern age of UFOs, up to 2017. So,  we're just going to take a little journey through  
time and space and explore various humanoid  encounters. Quite a different variety of humanoids  
in this episode as we will see. So, let's just  get started. And the first case I'd like to talk  
about, I call sock snatching ETS. That's right.  ETSs that are stealing someone's socks. This  
occurred way back in August 1930 in a little town,  Monte Benichi, Italy. And this case was unknown  
for a very long period of time. But it's super  interesting because again, it's a very early case,  
well before humanoids were being really researched  at all. Also, it has some remarkable parallels to  
another case which occurred very close to this  one. I think you'll find it a pretty fascinating  
case. This very early case was covered by multiple  Italian researchers such as Eduardo Lavachi,  
Bruno Manusi, Masimo Beneduchi, Vigin Varno, Solas  Boni, Robert Reichi and others. It occurred one  
beautiful early morning in August 1930 in the very  small mountain town of Monte Benichi. This is near  
Arezo, Italy. The witness is anonymous. I'll call  her Sophia. We're not sure how old she was. Some  
sources say she was quite young, 16 years old,  while others say she was in her 40s. At any rate,  
she had gone to the Umbrella Stream. This is  a tributary of the much larger Amber River,  
and she was doing her laundry. This is something  she had done many times. and she had just finished  
washing two pairs of hand knitted wool socks  and hung them on a clothesline that she had  
set up to allow her clothes to dry. And at that  moment, she heard an unusual noise. I'll just  
quote her directly as she says, "I suddenly heard  a hissing sound in the air, and at the same time,  
I felt a gust of wind from behind. For a moment,  I thought the weather had suddenly changed.  
But when I looked over my shoulder, I froze with  terror. Just 20 steps from me stood a strange and  
shimmering structure which looked like a big top  with the tip up. So this was a weird craft which  
she estimated was about 15 to 18 ft in diameter.  The strangest part however was yet to come. She  
moved cautiously towards it but stopped when  an opening appeared on the bottom of the object  
which she said was like a trap door. Immediately  a small ladder emerged from this opening and as  
Sophia says two little men came out of the lower  part at that time and spoken away that seemed to  
be a tweet. Now per Sophia these little men were  around three feet tall. She didn't really describe  
exactly what they looked like but she said they  walked around her several times making bird-like  
chirping sounds and at one point actually touched  her. During this time, she was immobilized with  
fear. But the encounter came to a quick end when  the humanoids apparently achieved the purpose for  
their visit. As Sophia says, "Then they took the  still damp laundry off the clothes line and went  
up into their top." They took my stockings off the  wire and took them inside the top. They had barely  
entered. It was whistling again so strangely. And  as another gust of wind struck me, the strange top  
rose incredibly fast, disappearing a few moments  later. It went up vertically in an instant, and I  
did not see anything anymore. So, unfortunately,  no description of the humanoids was provided,  
but Sophia was impressed enough to immediately  tell others about what had happened to her.  
As she says, as if driven by fury, I went back to  our village and told about my unusual experience.  
Everyone laughed at me. Nobody wanted to believe  me. I was very angry about it, and I'm still angry  
today because I had seen everything with my own  eyes. Now, researchers also interviewed other  
people in the area much later who confirmed that  Sophia had in fact shared the incident with other  
villagers. And in fact, it became the talk of  the town for some time and did eventually appear  
in newspapers. Interestingly, in 1954 years  later and only a few kilometers away in Cena,  
Italy, another case of sock snatching ETS and  they also stole flowers. This would gain wide  
publicity. In that case, a lady by the name of  Rosa Latti described this very similar incident.  
How bizarre is that? I mean, really, why would  ETSs come land and steal a person's socks? It's  
funny. It reminds me of an episode of Married  with Children where Al Bundy had an encounter  
and what were the ETs doing? Stealing his socks.  So, maybe there's something going on here. I don't  
know. It's a very odd case, but certainly not  unique. Now, here's another one which is quite  
interesting. I call this one the little men in the  cloverfield. This is another pretty early case,  
summer of 1950. This occurred in Leavir, Estonia.  And at this time, few UFO researchers were taking  
humanoid cases seriously. Certainly not in the  United States. People were studying sightings,  
but any cases involving humanoids were pretty much  disregarded. That was about to change because this  
is when humanoid encounters really started  becoming a lot more numerous. This one is a  
single witness case, but it's certainly, I think,  an important one. This brief but fascinating case  
comes from UFO researchers Tun Kellan and Juri  Lena and was published in the volume 24 number  
one issue of the Flying Saucer Review. There is  just one witness, a six-year-old anonymous girl.  
I'll call her Olivia, but she was interviewed  firsthand by the investigators. Reportedly,  
it was a beautiful summer day in 1950 as Olivia  was outside her family's farmhouse in Luvier Oja,  
Estonia. This is a very small rural village  just south of Shure Jeani. On that day,  
Olivia had a sudden impulse to go outside. As  she sat in a clover field surrounded by forest,  
she noticed a cigar-shaped object about  6 m long. That's almost 20 ft. Sitting in  
the field about 300 to 400 m from her home. So,  this is not far away, about a fifth of a mile.  
She said it was black in color except for the  ends, which were a sort of silver gray color.  
Now, she thought at first that it might be  an airplane, but it had no wings, no wheels,  
and in the center of the craft, there was a large  rectangular door. But most strange was that there  
were four men moving around near the object, or  what looked like men. They were quite small. They  
were about her size, just under four feet tall.  She said their skin complexion was very red,  
and they were wearing bright green clothes with a  hood over their heads. Their eyes also looked very  
strange and seemed to be almost immobile is how  she described it. She said they were moving very  
awkwardly around their craft. She saw one of the  little men actually raise his foot and kick the  
side of this craft. Then two of the men approach  within just a few feet of her. When they did this,  
Olivia spoke to the men out loud and using  gestures, and she said that they did answer her,  
though she cannot remember any of the contents  of their conversation other than to say that it  
was not audible. It was telepathic. During  this conversation, she realized that these  
little men were not normal humans. And this is  when she became seized by a sudden fear and ran  
directly home. Looking back, she saw this object  take off slowly, very smoothly, and silently.  
She told both her mother and her grandmother, but  neither of them believed her story. The next day,  
she did return to the location of the landing, but  admitted that it took her a very long time, as she  
was still very much frightened by the encounter.  At the time, she had never seen a plane. And when  
she did, sometime later, she was amazed to see  that they did have wings, so this was clearly  
not a plane or any normal conventional vehicle  as we would think of it. Pretty weird and I would  
imagine quite scary for the witness. It's this  weird pattern we have of UFOs landing, ETSs coming  
out and approaching people and then going right  back into their craft. It's not entirely clear  
why this is happening. Could this be a display?  Are ETSs conducting some sort of study? You can  
make up your own minds about it, but this is a  pattern that is really quite prominent in these  
humanoid cases. Now, here's another case which is  very unusual. This one is a multiple witness case.  
Most of the cases in this particular episode are  multiple witness cases. Seven out of 10. That's  
important because you can call one person a liar,  but if you start calling multiple people a liar,  
that you know starts to become problematic.  And it's clear to me that these cases cannot be  
explained away as hoaxes or frankly hallucinations  and misperceptions and mental illness despite  
what our governments would have us believe.  No, there's too many cases of these kinds.  
This one I call they looked human. This took  place in the summer of 1956 in Marseilles,  
France. And it's a fascinating case because  the witnesses in this case did not jump to the  
explanation that these were extraterrestrials  from outer space. This case comes from French  
researcher Jean Pierre Troek and first appeared  in the French magazine Lumiere Don Lanui that  
is lights in the night and this is the issue  number 154. In fact, it was pure synchronicity  
that Jean Pierre, the investigator, was able  to research this case, as he only heard about  
it from a friend who had walked into a bookstore  looking for a book on UFOs when the shopkeeper,  
Madmoiselle X, said she had no books on UFOs, but  said that she had already seen them. So, she's the  
witness. We don't know her name. And after getting  some of the details of her story, Jean Pierre's  
friend contacted him and Jean Pierre contacted  Medmoiselle X who shared her experience only after  
much convincing. Her previous experience with  sharing her story with others had resulted in  
ridicule and then in unwanted publicity. So she  was initially very reluctant to speak about it.  
But thankfully, Jeanpierre was able to get her to  reveal the details of her remarkable encounter.  
And as he says, her story seems and appears to be  highly credible, and she seems to me very balanced  
and very irriodite. Now, it was a summer afternoon  in 1956 as Madmoiselle X, her husband, and two  
friends were driving along a small remote outside  of Marseilles. Madmoiselle X and her husband were  
in the front seat and their friends were in the  back. And coming around a corner in the road,  
they came almost face to face with a strange  craft on the right side of the road only about  
30 ft 10 m away. It was hovering about 3 to 6 feet  off the ground and was perfectly motionless. The  
witnesses immediately stopped the car and exited  to get a better look. None of them felt any fear  
and were instead very much fascinated by what  they were looking at. They estimate that this  
craft was about 30 feet wide and 10 ft high. They  said it was metallic gray and had a classic flying  
saucer shape like two plates overturned on top of  each other. There were no visible markings on the  
craft, but there was a window or perhaps a row  of windows around the edge of the craft. It was  
through these windows that all four witnesses  saw what they described as three humanlooking  
figures watching them. These humanoids, these  human-looking figures were visible only from the  
shoulders up, but they did appear to be watching  the witnesses attentively like curious visitors to  
a zoo is how Madmoiselle X described it. They wore  uniforms, but again appeared to be normal humans.  
One thing was clear to the witnesses. The UFO  occupants seemed to be very interested in the four  
humans watching them. After just a few moments,  the craft suddenly took off at high speed in a  
climbing curve up into the sky, disappearing  in only about 5 seconds. It made no sound or  
no wind. Madmoiselle X does not claim that the  human-looking beings were extraterrestrial. And  
in fact, she speculated that they might be from  another country here on Earth. Though she did  
say that she was very much impressed by the speed  and mobility of the craft. A pretty unusual case  
and one of the few, if not the only one in this  compilation where the witnesses did not react in  
fear. Perhaps because these ETs did look human.  And perhaps they were. It's entirely possible  
that this was a reverse engineered craft. But that  begs the question, what the heck are these humans,  
if that's what they were, showing themselves  to people along the side of a road and just  
kind of staring at them? I don't know. You know,  there's always so many questions to all of these  
cases. So, let's move to the next one. I call this  next one I played dead. This is the title of this  
episode. And so this is sort of the cover story,  if you will, of this episode. This one really I  
thought was quite profound and clearly scary for  the witnesses. This took place in June of 1957 in  
Birmingham, Michigan. This is a multiple witness  case and it's very unusual. This case was reported  
to the National UFO Reporting Center, New Fork,  and involves three brothers by the name of James,  
Mickey, and Tim. Those are their real names,  though they do not use their last name. At the  
time of their encounter, they lived on Dorchester  Street in Birmingham. This is a suburb of Detroit,  
Michigan. You can see it here. The report comes  from James, who at the time of this incident was  
about six years old. His brother Mickey was  5 years old and their brother Tim was just a  
toddler in his crib. All of them shared a room  and it was one evening in 1957 June when James  
woke up to what would be the scariest moment  in his life up to even today. As James says,  
I was awakened by the sound of muffled panicked  cries coming from the other side of my bedroom.  
It was my brother Mickey. I became immediately and  fully terrified. I was facing the wall away from  
him and I knew there was no way I would look  in his direction because I knew something or  
someone was in the room. And from the disturbing  intensity of Mickey's whimpering noises, I knew it  
was not Santa Claus. I did not move a muscle or  make a sound, hoping that whatever it was would  
not know I was there. So, I literally played dead  as I desperately did not want the boogeyman to  
know I even existed. My heart was pounding in my  ears from fear. And my fears were not unfounded,  
as the next thing I hear was, "Look out, Jimmy."  So, this was his brother Mickey warning him about  
what James did not know, but he knew it couldn't  be good, and his fear escalated exponentially.  
As James says, I thought, "Oh no, he just told  it I'm here." Those words sent me crashing into  
a terror that in a few moments would increase  a thousandfold. I was lying on my stomach,  
and suddenly there was a long fingered claw  or hand planted firmly in the middle of my  
back and spine. Now, at the time, James,  of course, had never heard of aliens.   
He had no idea how to interpret the experience or  who or what was in his room touching his back. He  
wondered, "Was it the claw of a witch? Was it  an evil monster?" He really had no idea. All he  
knew was that he was deeply afraid. In fact, he  thought he was about to be killed. As James says,  
"I was going to die for sure. I'm not kidding.  This was the most frightening night of my life."  
Suddenly, I realized there was tremendous heat.  So much so, I could feel the heat coming clear  
through my body, through my chest and solar plexus  area, and onto the bed lying beneath me. I thought  
without a doubt in my little boy's brain, I was  being stabbed to death with a knife as I felt the  
knife slowly corkcrew deep into my body. I never  flinched or made a noise. That was my brave but  
useless way of hoping it might think I was already  dead. Now, as this was going on, James could hear  
a quote deafening hissing noise which was in  his head, which he assumed must be the sound of  
the monster's breathing. And as James says, this  only intensified my terror. During these moments,  
I was unable to appreciate the fact that it was  actually not painful. What I felt was more of a  
thick bluntness turning its way into me. Not long  afterward, I felt the knife come back out of me.  
I was shocked that I was still alive, though I  did not want the invader to know that. Then the  
heat stopped and its hand was removed from my  back. Now, at this point, James did not visibly  
react. He stayed perfectly still and silent, eyes  closed, still playing dead. In fact, he remained  
that way until the sun came up the next morning.  Now, he's not sure if he told his parents or not,  
but he guesses that he probably did and that  they told him he had just had a nightmare. But,  
of course, James is 100% sure that this  was not a dream or a nightmare. As he says,  
I knew it happened and I was not sleeping. It  was not a dream. I never for a moment forgot  
this experience as it was clearly drilled into  my memory. For several days to a week, I snuck a  
knife from the kitchen that I was not supposed to  have and hid it under my pillow. It was the only  
defense I could think of. But my mother soon found  it and took it away. As life went on growing up,  
I never discussed it at all with my brother  Mickey. And as an adult, I totally assumed that he  
would not remember that night. I was wrong. So, it  was 37 years after the incident in 1994. James was  
sitting with his wife and some friends, swapping  various experiences that they had had with ghosts  
and the paranormal. So, James decided to share his  story of the monster in his room. Then afterwards,  
one of his friends asked if his brother Mickey had  ever mentioned the story and James said, quote,  
"No, I am sure he won't remember anything." But  then he thought to himself, why not just ask him?  
So he went to the phone and called up his brother  and he started to say, "Do you remember a night  
back on Doorchester?" and he got no further than  that when Mickey interrupted him and immediately  
began to talk about the scary encounter. As Mickey  says, "I woke up to find what I thought was Casper  
the ghost floating over to the side of my bed. It  was peering down into my face with its hands held  
up in front and just above me. It had a big head  and big black eyes. I was completely terrified and  
totally freaking out. It just kept looking down  at me. I was frantically crying when it finally  
moved away from me and went over to the crib  that held Tim and it raised its hand over the  
crib opening and its hand lit up. Then it moved  away from the crib and I saw it go over to you.  
I tried to warn you and I said, "Look out, Jimmy."  It bent all the way down over you and looked like  
it was touching you. So Mickey is describing  this to his brother James. And hearing this,  
James felt as if he was about to faint. James at  this point shared his side of the story. And then  
Mickey added some new details. He recalled that  after the experience, he would wake up night after  
night shrieking from terrifying nightmares about  this incident. And in fact, he refused to go to  
sleep unless the lights were on. He said that  their parents finally took him to a doctor and  
had his brain x-rayed to find out if anything was  wrong. Now, hearing Mickey's side of the story,  
this changed how James felt about his experience,  and it really connected the dots for him involving  
other strange encounters in his life. As James  says, I am sure now that Casper, the big head,  
big blackeyed ghost, was a visiting gray alien.  What I am unsure of is what did it do to me. I  
figured that it either fixed something in me or  took DNA or left an implant or all of the above.  
I don't know any of that for sure, but I have  since had several uniquely close experiences with  
UFOs that occurred later in my adult life that led  me to believe we are connected somehow for some  
purpose that I hope to understand perhaps sometime  in the future. This is indeed a fascinating  
universe we journey upon. It seems like there are  a lot of witnesses who are young children. Not  
sure why that is other than perhaps contact often  does start at a very young age, but it's certainly  
a prominent pattern we see in humanoid encounters.  Another pattern that's certainly present in this  
case is that the children were not believed.  Luckily, they did have each other, but they still  
kept this encounter pretty much a secret for most  of their lives. So, luckily, they did have someone  
to corroborate their story. And as you can see, it  was very scary for them and did affect them really  
profoundly. That's also a very prominent pattern.  So now let's move to the next case. This one I  
thought was really interesting because it's got  some unusual elements to it that are not perhaps  
not unique uh but certainly not super common  because this one involves a lot of witnesses  
but apparently only one really remembers this  in any detail. I call this one never tell this  
story. This occurred one evening in October 1968  in Morgan Springs. This is in the Malor forest of  
Oregon. And yeah, this one is unusual to say the  least. This case comes secondhand from the aunt  
of the main witness as her aunt never wanted to  report it. The niece finally decided to reveal the  
details in the hopes that it might be corroborated  by other people in the area. This case involves a  
large extended family and their friends who one  evening in October of 1968, this is approximate,  
were camping in the rugged country wilderness  at Morgan Springs in the Maler National Forest.  
This is north of Burns, Oregon. By the way, Maler  is a French word meaning misfortune or adversity,  
which is a curious name for a forest, especially  considering what happened next. According to the  
niece, the main witness, her aunt was the national  chairperson of a prestigious real estate concern  
and was actually listed in Who's Who. She was, as  her niece says, quote, very successful, logical,  
and level-headed. I'll call the niece Alice. That  is, of course, a pseudonym. The experience began  
around 700 p.m. one evening in October of 1968  as the aunt was walking around the group with  
a tray of snacks. offering them to everyone.  And this is when a large saucer-shaped craft  
appeared overhead. As Alice says, talking about  her aunt, she stated that it soundlessly glided  
into view just above the treetops, large ponderosa  pines. It stopped hovering, not directly overhead,  
about 50 ft away, about 100 ft above the ground.  About half of the craft was visible. It was  
saucer-shaped. She estimated it to be at least  100 ft wide. Everyone freaked out. Women screamed,  
men yelled, some went for their hunting rifles.  She said it was so close and so obvious what it  
was that nobody said anything like, "What is it?"  Everyone knew. There were windows. She said they  
appeared after it stopped to hover. A yellow  light was visible, apparently emanating from  
the craft's interior. She said the shapes of more  than one humanoid was visible and movement was  
easily discerned with the yellow backlight. No  features were seen as no light was directed into  
the craft from the outside. She said the movements  were fluid, natural, but seem uncharacteristic of  
human movement. The proportions were odd as well.  She said they seemed curious about them moving to  
get different looks into the campsite. Now, at  this point, only a few seconds had elapsed. The  
aunt was a camera buff, and wanting to capture  a photograph of this flying saucer, she dropped  
the tray of snacks on the ground and ran to the  camping vehicle to retrieve her 35 mm camera.  
She grabbed the camera and quickly loaded it with  film. She says it took her no more than 3 minutes,  
but when she ran back outside with the camera,  she was confronted by an incredible sight. As  
Alice says, the entire group was still and calm.  The craft had gone. Some of those that hadn't left  
the fire area were again seated. A couple of  the group that ran were slowly walking back.  
Two men with hunting rifles were stoned still and  seemed catatonic for another couple of minutes.  
So the aunt was understandably astonished and  really puzzled by the way everyone was reacting or  
lack of reacting and she started asking everyone  what happened. Where did the saucer go? Everyone  
seemed dazed or entranced and only slowly did  they regain their wits. And when the aunt began  
asking about the UFO and explained her memory of  it, nobody remembered it at all. As Alice says,  
she was frantic, demanding answers. They all,  including her husband, acted like she'd lost  
her mind. They had no explanation or memory  of why some were away from the fire holding  
guns or unable to recall the tray of snacks being  dropped by her as she ran for her camera. She was  
incredulous, and being a strong willed, confident  woman, she demanded answers and insisted her story  
was true. and that it was they who were dafted.  It got heated. Her husband, my uncle, finally  
felt embarrassed enough to demand her silence.  In the coming days, she agreed at his request  
to never tell this story. To my knowledge, I am  the only one she told. Alice's aunt speculated  
that the reason she was able to remember when no  one else could was because she was in the camper  
and was perhaps protected by the metal skin  of the camper. Alice calls her uncle and aunt  
quote the greatest people I've ever known. She's  absolutely convinced that her aunt is telling the  
truth. And as she says, I need no additional  proof. I simply believe her. Hopefully, if any  
other events took place in that area, this will  add weight to their accounts. Very strange. It's  
hard to say why only one witness really recalled  seeing the humanoids and how difficult that must  
have been for her uh to talk about this in front  of people who were there but called her crazy,  
said it didn't happen. She stuck to her guns and  says that yes, this did happen. And yeah, we see  
that it's not unusual for there to be sort of a  selective amnesia where some people remember and  
others don't. But to be the only one in a crowd of  people, that's got to be tremendously stressful.  
And I can see why the witness said, "Never tell  this story." The vast majority of people do keep  
these kinds of experiences secret. That's one of  the reasons I do this research and put out these  
episodes so that we can move past that and that  people will feel more comfortable sharing their  
stories also to remove the fear factor because  one of the best ways to remove fear is to make  
the unknown known. So that's what I'm trying to do  here. Now let's move to the next case. This one is  
pretty unusual. One of you listeners out there  requested that I find a case involving sort of  
flying humanoids. I've presented a number of them  before, but here's another. I call this one the  
jetpack humanoid. This one occurred in 1974 one e  evening around dusk uh just outside of Melbourne,  
Australia on a dairy farm. This one is also a  multiple witness case and a pretty unusually  
described humanoid. This case comes from the  National UFO Reporting Center and was reported  
by the brother of the witness. The witness is  anonymous, so I'll give him the pseudonym Phil.  
It was around dusk one day in 1974 that Phil,  age five, was outside on the family's dairy farm,  
which was located southeast of Melbourne in  Victoria, Australia. He was playing near the  
gate of their property. His father and grandfather  were in the barn finishing up milking the cows,  
and his grandmother was standing in the doorway of  the farmhouse. And this is when something strange  
happened. According to Phil, he suddenly noticed  what he described as quote, "a big bright star."  
This was clearly not a star, as it appeared to  be hovering between their farm and the neighbors  
property, approximately 200 m away, 600 ft. So,  he watched as the glowing object began to abruptly  
dart around in various positions in the western  sky before hovering in place for some time.  
It then began to move closer and this is when  Phil could see that it was actually a solid object  
hovering about 50 m away from him. And as Phil  says, it was a metal machine, a shiny spaceship,  
a flying saucer like the flying saucers you see.  What happened next was vividly engraved on his  
memory. He said a quote hatch like a gang plank  opened up on the side of the object and a quote  
spaceman with a jetpack flew out. Phil watched in  amazement as this spaceman proceeded to perform  
various maneuvers in the sky, occasionally coming  close and then flying off at a distance. Finally,  
the spaceman approached Phil and landed on the  dirt road near the gate about 30 meters less than  
100 ft away from him. Phil was terrified and  turned to run, but found that he was totally  
immobilized, frozen to the spot as he said, "You  can't run. Even if you want to, you can't run."  
Meanwhile, Phil's grandmother, who was standing  about 10 m away, also apparently saw the humanoid.  
Phil's brother was unable to get much more  detail about this encounter from his brother,   
but presumably at this point, the UFO occupant  flew back up into the craft, re-entered it,  
and the craft took off. Phil immediately told  everyone in the family, and his grandmother  
allegedly confirmed this story, though she would  later refuse to talk about it. And when impressed,  
she actually denied the whole thing. Again, it  was Phil's brother who reported the incident to  
New Fork. And as he wrote, "What intrigues me  to this day is that as long as I can remember,  
the story has remained consistent among our  family. What has always fascinated me about his  
story is that he made my parents and grandparents  aware of the sighting at the time and it has been  
mentioned intermittently albeit with embarrassment  and disbelief by the adults ever since. In other  
words, he reported what he saw to them at the time  and in detail. So this is not some false memory of  
childhood recalled or invented many years later.  Recently, I broached the subject with him to get a  
definitive account of what I believe is a genuine  UFO occupant encounter. Very weird. There are a  
huge number of cases with UFOs and ETS showing an  interest in farms. That does seem to be a draw for  
them, a target. Not exactly sure why. Perhaps  there's something else about this area that is  
attracting the ETS. Hard to say for sure, but who  knows? The more cases we have, the more knowledge  
we have about what's going on here. So, let's just  keep adding to the database, and perhaps one day  
we'll have answers to all of these questions. So,  now let's move to the next case. I call this one  
four apes and a UFO. This occurred one evening,  February 21st, 1982, at a campground in Gorles,  
Spain. This is another multiple witness case.  I thought this one was particularly compelling,  
not only because it's got multiple witnesses,  but because the description of the humanoids  
is very unusual. This case was investigated by  researcher JJ Bonitez. It appeared in newspapers  
and in a couple of books. It was 15 minutes to  midnight on August 25, 1979 when two friends,  
Burmina Teniente and Maria de los Angeles Camin,  both aged 35, were camping at the Gorles Municipal  
Campsite in Vizkaya, Spain. They were sitting  outside the entrance to their little camping  
hut. A small stream was nearby and looking at  some bushes near the stream. This is when they  
noticed the silhouette of what looked to them  at first like an animal squatting down near the  
ground only about six feet away from them. Vermina  immediately turned to her friend Maria and said,  
"Look, what a strange dog." But then suddenly it  stood up and looked at them and they saw that it  
wasn't a dog. It was actually a humanoid figure  about 4 and 1/2 to 5t tall. Its face, they said,  
radiated kindness. So, at this point, they felt  no fear. They did try to shine their flashlight  
at it, but strangely, their flashlight would  not work. The figure then began to walk with  
long strides. In the darkness, they weren't  sure if it had thick, dark fur or skin, or if  
it was wearing blackish clothing that was somehow  reflecting in the moonlight, but they did see that  
its arms were long enough that they touched  the ground. This figure was not normal. The  
way it walked was very unusual with this sort of  hunched posture. And as it walked past their tent,  
they wondered if perhaps it was some kind of an  ape that had perhaps escaped from the zoo or a  
circus. They could see that it had an oval skull  with what looked like abundant hair flattened and  
swept back. They could see no mouth, no ears, only  two immense rounded eyes and a very large mouth.  
Eyes much, much bigger than a human. It strode  quickly past their tent, descended a steep slope,  
and disappeared from view. Both women were shocked  and were trying to calm down when suddenly,  
emerging from the same place where the first one  had appeared, three identical, strange ape-like  
humanoids appeared. These three were walking  much faster than the first, but instead of  
following the first, they climbed a hill and  disappeared in the opposite direction. Now,  
this did cause the women to become afraid. The  witnesses were very much impressed by their large  
eyes. Seeing these three creatures, both Firmina  and Maria screamed and actually burst into tears,  
waking up many of the campers around them, all of  who rushed outside to see what was happening. The  
witnesses explained what they had seen and pointed  to the location. and the other campers could see  
a trail of footprints leading up in the direction  where the woman had seen these humanoids walk off  
into the darkness. Now, this caused an uproar  at the campground, especially because just a  
short time later, an intense glowing light moved  silently overhead, so bright it illuminated the  
entire area. This very much alarmed the frightened  crowd of campers who now began to wonder if the  
unidentified glowing object was in fact the  vehicle used by the strange humanoids they had  
seen just a few hours earlier. While it is pure  speculation, it does look like that UFO sighting  
is in some way related to the humanoid encounter  that occurred just before it. Certainly, that's  
what the witnesses thought. But how unusual are  those humanoids? Certainly not your standard grays  
by any means. Wouldn't I'm not sure I'd call these  Bigfoot because they certainly weren't very tall,  
but they did have sort of an ape-like appearance.  The variety of humanoids is astonishing. But once  
again, they're almost entirely humanoid in form,  which I think is very significant and has profound  
implications. And I think shows once again, and  I've said this before, that our relationship to  
these guys is probably closer than we think.  In fact, some do look entirely human. Really,  
really interesting. I know I keep saying these  accounts are interesting and fascinating,   
but they are. They've got so much to teach us.  So, now let's move to another case, which was  
again truly terrifying for the witness. This is a  single witness case, but I think it's an important  
case. It's got some really unusual elements to  it in terms of how this encounter affected the  
environment around the witness. I call this  one My Heart Was Pounding. This took place on  
November 2nd, 1997 in Anchorage, Alaska. It's not  a super big town. Seth definitely does have quite  
a bit of activity though, and this encounter  is a really interesting humanoid experience. It  
was about 1:00 a.m. on the night of November 2nd,  1997 that Brett, that is a pseudonym, was in his  
basement bedroom in his home in Anchorage, Alaska.  He had an interview planned for the next morning,  
but found himself unable to sleep. He was  sleeping on a queen-sized boxring mattress on  
a concrete floor, and there was a toaster sitting  on the floor about 2 ft away from his head. This  
detail is important considering what happened  next. As Brett says, as I lay there, I suddenly  
became aware that there was someone else in the  room, but it felt like they had stepped into my  
mind and were observing. At this point, I tried  to move so I could see it. I could not move. As  
I struggled to move, the coils in the toaster  began vibrating. And the harder I struggled,  
the coils in the toaster would vibrate at a higher  pitch. Finally, using a great effort of willpower,  
Brett was able to break free from the paralysis.  And in one smooth motion, he grabbed his loaded  
Colt pistol with his left hand and sat up in bed.  To his shock, he saw a quote light brighter than  
the sun just outside his basement door. But very  quickly, this light moved away from the bedroom,  
took a left turn up the stairs, and went through  the glass window in the stairwell. At that point,  
he glanced behind him, and saw a second intensely  bright light move up and away from the window  
well. He couldn't see the source of the light,  but it was clear to him that whatever it was,  
they were retreating. So he sat up in bed and  remained vigilant for a half hour before finally  
laying back down, but this time placing  his pistol under his pillow. It was just  
a half hour later at about 2:00 a.m. that the  strange visitors returned. And as Brett says,  
I felt the same presence in my mind. This time  I left out loud because I knew who it was. And  
I thought it would be easy enough to break free as  I did earlier. I struggled to move, but this time  
they were immobilizing me with a higher frequency,  and the coils in the toaster were vibrating at a  
very high pitch. But I was determined to at least  see what or who was doing this. And finally,  
I was able to move my head enough to see a gray  alien partially phased through the ceiling tiles,  
staring at me. The room was dimly lit, but  enough for a good look. After a quick look,  
the room went dark and it disappeared. Now Brett  feels pretty certain that this was a gray alien  
who was trying to take him that night. As he  says, I was almost abducted by a gray alien.  
I have to believe it let me move to look at it as  they were prepared for me the second time. To me,  
the most interesting aspect of that encounter is  how the toaster seemed to sort of vibrate along  
with the buzzing sound or whatever was going on  with this encounter. I also found it interesting  
that the witness felt that the ETSs allowed him to  see them. A number of witnesses do say this. So,  
I don't know what to make of that other than  that ETSs do want us to know that they are there  
or are contacting us, but it was a pretty scary  experience for him as you can see. So, now let's  
move to another case that was truly terrifying.  I call this one It froze me in fear. This one  
occurred on the evening of November 9, 2010  outside of Omaha, Nebraska. This is a multiple  
witness case. What's interesting to me about this  case is the description of the humanoid. And once  
again, it affected the witness profoundly in a way  that really changed him for the rest of his life.  
This case involves an anonymous married couple  who reported their encounter about 10 years after  
it occurred with the husband providing his  firstirhand testimony of a truly fascinating  
encounter with an unusual humanoid. I'll call him  Wyatt. That's a pseudonym. He says it was 1 a.m.  
on November 9, 2010 as he and his wife were taking  an evening stroll into a wooded grove near their  
home. Now, this is something they had done many  times, and they knew the area quite well. There  
were a few houses off in the distance whose lights  were visible through the trees, and this is when  
they noticed shadows of figures darting through  the trees. Even though it was quite late, they  
assumed that there must be children playing in the  woods at night. So, they decided to get a closer  
look and perhaps scare the children as a kind of  practical joke. Little did they know they would be  
the ones who would receive a scare. As Wyatt says,  we got close to the trees and realized there were  
no children in the grove. No one could be seen  at all. The grove was well lit as there was a lot  
of moonlight and virtually no leaves left on the  trees. As we walked, holding hands into the grove,  
we abruptly heard a footfall in the leaves. At  that time the unknown entity crossed our path.  
It moved in glimpses as if under a strobe light  only no light was given off. As it crossed our  
path it was visible one moment then gone the next.  This alternated as it stroed in front of us. It  
smiled at us and appeared to be waving. I wasn't  prepared for this and seeing it froze me in fear.  
The entity was a biped that stood taller  than me at 5' 10 in. It was completely naked,  
though no genitalia could be seen, as you would  imagine a doll would look. The skin was a dark  
grayish color. It had very small black eyes which  reflected the moonlight. Its ears were tight  
against its head and came to a point. The jaw was  bigger than any humans. The jawline went all the  
way up the sides of its head as if its smile  started behind its ears almost. Rows of sharp  
white teeth were visible as it smiled at us. It  had slits for a nose and they were slightly flared  
at the top. I can't remember how many fingers it  had, but it definitely had digits that it held up  
as it waved at us. Now, this encounter was very  brief, only a few minutes at most. But seeing  
how unusual the entity was, Wyatt, who was very  athletic and about twice the size of his wife,  
grabbed his wife by the wrist and ran away as  fast as he could, practically dragging her out  
of the grove of trees to an open soccer field near  their home and to the safety of the street. His  
wife immediately started screaming and saying, "Go  back. go back and explain to him that she wanted  
to make contact with this entity. But Kyle was  too afraid and insisted they return to the house,  
which they did. Reaching the house, they stood  in the doorway looking at the grove. With the  
entity apparently gone, they decided to separate  themselves and write down independently what they  
had just experienced. And when they compared the  details, they of course matched perfectly. But for  
Kyle, this encounter was particularly traumatic.  As Kyle says, "This event has affected my life  
very negatively. My family thinks my wife and I  made it up or are just plain lying to get their  
attention. For a long time, I never told anyone  but my closest friends and my immediate family for  
fear that people would think we were crazy. But  it's come to a point that this itch in the back of  
my brain has gotten so bad, I feel it necessary  to tell others of what we saw. I've become so  
obsessed with searching the web for possible  information on the existence of alien life that  
I often spend hours of my time sifting through  garbage on the internet just to find someone  
somewhere who has seen an entity like the one I  saw. Not knowing what this entity was keeps me up  
many nights. I have thought about every feasible  possibility. A spirit, a human in a Hollywood  
style movie makeup, a hologram projector, or even  an alien. To this day, not knowing eats at the  
back of my mind. I fully know aliens exist. With  the vastness of space and countless stars in the  
universe, it becomes clear to me that we cannot  possibly be the only life. Even now, I can feel my  
heart racing as I recall the event. Did I miss out  on a one in a billion chance to communicate with  
another intelligent life form? I only have one  regret in my life, and that regret is not going  
back to find out for sure what it was. If I were  ever going to communicate with beings like this,  
we need to have love at the center of our  awareness so we don't flee in fear for no  
reason. So yeah, this can be seen. This encounter  has affected Kyle very deeply, very profoundly,  
but he remains firm in what he and his wife saw.  As he says, an unknown biped walked in front of  
us, waved, and smiled. I am not crazy. I guess  you could call that a gray ET, but even the among  
grays, there's a huge variation of descriptions.  What I found super interesting about the humanoid  
in that case is that the witness described this  figure as having very sharp pointed teeth. That  
detail doesn't turn up a lot, but a number  of people who have seen grays and seen inside  
their mouths have described exactly that. So,  I found that a particularly interesting detail.  
All of these cases have again more questions than  answers. Again, this is why I do this research,  
looking for answers, trying to figure out  are these ETs, are we being visited? I think  
so. But again, I'm just presenting these cases as  objectively, as factually as possible, so you can  
make up your own minds about it. And now, let's  move to the final case. This one was also really  
profound. I just found this one so interesting.  The witnesses were clearly sincere, clearly very  
emotionally impacted by what they saw. And I  think you'll find it a particularly compelling  
account. I call this one I made eye contact. This  one occurred on the evening of August 25, 2017 out  
in the New Mexico desert along a remote highway  near the small town of Nagizi. We've got the exact  
location of this encounter, which I think always  is interesting to see. But wow, the description  
of these ETS by the witness is very detailed.  So, I think you'll find it super interesting.  
The witnesses in this case were so impressed  by what happened to them that they reported  
their case about two months after it occurred,  but only on the condition of full anonymity.  
They're a couple in their mid60s. The husband is  a disabled veteran with heart issues. And he says  
it was around 8:00 p.m. on August 25, 2017 that  they were driving a 37 ft diesel pusher motor  
home heading at about 60 mph southeast on Highway  550. This is just a few miles south of Nagizi,  
New Mexico. And you can see the exact location  here. Suddenly, they saw a flash of light coming  
from the left hand side of the road ahead of them.  And looking at the source, they got an incredible  
shock. A very brightly lit craft was hovering  at eye level from their position in their motor  
home right along the left side of the highway  about 80 ft ahead of them. And inside the craft,  
through what appeared to be an open window with  no glass or plastic visible, two creatures sat  
side by side, 2 feet apart. They could only see  the front of the craft. The floor, the ceiling,  
and the panel behind the creatures glowed with  intensely bright white light. They could see what  
looked like a small pole rising up from the floor  in front of the beings, supporting what appeared  
to be a sort of control panel about the size of  a carton of cigarettes. The being on the left  
was resting his gopherl looking hand is how the  witness described it on this control panel. and he  
provided a drawing of what he says the ETSs looked  very much like. And as the male witness says,  
both individuals had a skin tone about the same as  mine. I am a white male. They had large heads and  
an upside down tear shape, very large black eyes,  a small mouth, and two small holes for a nose.  
There were holes for the ears, but only a nub for  the ears. The one on the right had very smooth  
face. The one on the left appeared to be older  with facial lines. Their bodies were skinny and  
were illuminated with a greenish glowing uniform.  There were roll type cuffs that also glowed but  
were beige. The arms and torso were slender and  about the diameter of a very small child of six or  
seven years of age, long and skinny, and appeared  to be weak. They reminded me of stick people.  
One detail that the witness reiterated was the  hands of the beings reminded him of the hands  
of gophers with claws that could be used as a  lethal weapon if necessary. It appeared to him  
that while their bodies looked weak, the uniforms  provided some strength to their body, but really  
it was their eyes which impressed him the most. As  he says, "My first thought was, is this real?" The  
closer we got, the more positive I was that what I  was seeing was real. When I made eye contact, they  
were talking when we interrupted them. The one on  my left wrinkled the right side of his mouth when  
he saw me. I made eye contact with the one on  my left, and I looked directly into his large  
black eyes. His eye was the finest surface I have  ever seen. The eye had no abrasions or scratches,  
no dust or mucus. I noticed that under the surface  of this perfectly clear outer surface of the eye  
was a grid of many individual eyes, like a  fly's eye, but much smoother, like a super  
fine glass surface. Another thing that impressed  the witness was the wall behind these creatures,  
which he said was very hard to explain, but he  tried. As the witness says, the wall was very  
brightly illuminated. It appeared to be divided  into about 18in cubes, but it was a flat surface.  
The light seemed to be boiling along the edges  of each panel in the colors of light green, blue,  
and violet. The power heaved with its changes, it  seemed. The back panel was incredibly beautiful,  
and something I'll never forget. Now, the light  was too bright for him to see the outer shape of  
the craft, but the strangest part was that there  did not appear to be any windshield at all. As  
they drove up alongside this craft, the witness's  hearing aids started screeching. And as he says,  
I felt I heard them communicating when we  approached. As the witness says, "The moment  
I saw them, the individuals were looking down  the road as if looking for something to arrive.  
There was a truck coming up the hill towards us  about 1/8 of a mile away. The craft seemed to  
swing and rotate from the shoulder on the other  side to a lane away and was at my side and maybe  
20 ft away. Once they rotated enough that their  faces were 180Â° to us, he saw us and disappeared.  
At this point, the witnesses looked behind them  through their rear view side mirrors, but the   
craft was no longer visible. Later, the witness  examined the area where they had seen this craft  
and noticed that the area where the craft had  been hovering looked as if it had been recently   
bulldozed. He's not sure if this is a factor here,  but it was strange enough to mention. They finally  
decided to report their sighting because, as he  says, I would like to know what is going on there.  
That one does seem to involve typical grays, if  there is such a thing as a typical gray. Uh, and  
you can see that this was really a terrifying and  difficult to process experience for both of these  
witnesses. One detail that really struck me is  how the witness felt like there was no windshield,  
no glass uh, in this window with the ETS looking  out of it. I suspect that there was. It's just  
that they do have the ability to basically  turn the walls of their craft transparent.  
People describe this all the time. They don't  see any glass. They don't see anything. So,   
it looks like the ETSs are out there exposed  to open air. Hard to say for sure because there  
certainly are cases like that where humanoids will  climb onto the top of a UFO or perhaps around a  
little balcony or rim or something along those  lines. But certainly a fascinating case and one  
that deserves to be more well-known. So there you  go. 10 cases. I'm guessing you probably haven't  
heard of most of these. I do like exploring these  lessernown cases and occasionally exploring some  
that are wellknown. But as the number of these  cases add up, it becomes increasingly difficult  
to deny them, to explain them away, to debunk  them with really we have a catalog of gosh,  
tens of thousands of these kinds of cases. So,  it's fine if people want to remain skeptical,  
but I think anyone who does objective research and  really takes their time to look into these cases  
without overlaying their own belief system  on them can only come away convinced that   something truly profound is happening here.  I think this is a really important subject.  
I think the whole world would change if all  of humanity could just simply accept the fact   
that we are not alone because that is certainly  what the evidence is showing us. So that's it  
for today. Thank you once again guys. I truly  appreciate you guys watching. Hope you enjoyed  
this episode. Perhaps learned a little bit. Until  next time, keep asking those hard questions,  
keep searching for the truth, and keep having fun.  I will see you next episode. Bye for now. Be good.
