EXTRAORDINARY HUMANOIDS: TEN TRUE ENCOUNTERS
Jan 12, 2024

Summary:
Jan 12, 2024
Encounters with extraordinary humanoids have occurred across the planet for a long time. They involve all different types of extraterrestrials who interact with a variety of witnesses in strange and unique ways. These cases are among the most fascinating of all UFO encounters. They are not simple sightings, nor are they cases that rely on hypnotic regression. The evidence to support these encounters is more extensive than many people realize with landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, medical effects and more. But most important, they provide a fascinating glimpse into what lies beyond planet Earth.

SMACKED BY AN ALIEN. On Jul 2, 1953, 14-year-old Maximo Munoz Hernaiz was guarding the cows on his family ranch in Villares Del Saz, Spain, when a UFO landed behind him. Three short men came out and spoke to him in a strange language. Then one of the ETs reached out and smacked him on the cheek. The ETs returned to the craft, which took off. Later, strange landing traces were found.

A HAIR-RAISING EXPERIENCE. Around 10am one morning in Jun 1954, a farmer in Bengough, Saskatchewan, Canada heard a strange motor-sound approaching from the air. Looking up, he was shocked to see a flying saucer with a large transparent cockpit, and seated inside were two human-looking men. The craft passed overhead no higher than 20 feet. It turned out, he was not the only witness.

WHY NOT TO FIGHT AN ET. At 2am on Nov 28, 1954, Gustavo Gonzalez and Jose Ponce were driving through Petare, Venezuela when they came upon a glowing spherical-shaped object blocking the road. A small, hairy humanoid approached. Gustavo grabbed the strange being, only to be thrown to the ground. He tried to stab it with his knife. Meanwhile, people all over the area were reporting UFOs.

THE MOUNT AIRY ALIEN. Late one night in Jul 1968, Mrs. Eggers was woken in her home in Mt. Airy, NC by her dog begging to be let inside. Opening the door, she saw a flying saucer hover at low level across the street. Inside it, a strange humanoid looked down at her. The craft stayed for twenty minutes, during which time, there was a local power failure. Afterward, the witness suffered weird medical effects.

WHAT TRUE BEAUTY IS. On the morning of Oct 2, 1968, Toribio Pereira was on a construction job in Lins, Brazil when a dropped from the sky and landed right next to him. Four handsome, human-looking figures wearing robes appeared. One of them struck Toribio with a beam of light while the others examined the surroundings, took soil samples, and departed. Later, Toribio had more encounters, and was apparently healed by the ETs.

THREE ALIENS ON HUDSON BEACH. Late one night in May 1971, an anonymous elderly lady was drinking tea in her home on Hudson’s Beach, in Waluku, New Zealand, and looking out the window, saw three strange figures on the beach. She thought they might be fisherman until they stepped on a silver-strip and were drawn into a reddish ball of light, which promptly soared high into the sky and disappeared.

SOMETHING WASN’T QUITE RIGHT. On the evening of May 3, 1973, Sigrid Karlson was walking her dog outside her home in Mantorp, Sweden, when she saw a red ball of light in the sky. Returning home, she watched it with her son, Robert, from the window. As it came closer, they both were amazed to see that it was a craft with a transparent dome, and inside were two strange humanoids looking at them.

TOUCHED BY AN ALIEN. On Feb 23, 1975, two 7-year-old boys were roller-skating when they saw a UFO fly across the sky and land nearby. They ran up to it as a door opened and a short figure came out. It walked up to one of the boys and touched him on the shoulder. The boys were paralyzed in fear. Finally the ET returned into the craft. The boys ran to tell their parents who also saw the craft as it departed.

COME WITH US ON A JOURNEY. Around 9pm on Jan 27, 1983, Alan was walking to a friend’s house in Bloxwich, England when he saw a UFO overhead. Moments later, two strange human-looking figures wearing gray jumpsuits appeared ahead of him. As he walked up to them, they said, “Come with us on a journey.” When Alan declined, and said he didn’t want to leave his life, they became insistent.

NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. On the night of Feb 18, 1990, a woman was walking with her dog near Korbach, Germany. Suddenly her dog whimpered and refused to move. A large glowing craft landed, and the dog ran away. The woman was struck by a beam of light. Shortly later, two short humanoids walked up to her and told her. “Don’t be afraid.” They ETs spoke to her and then departed.

These ten cases have much to teach us about extraterrestrial contact. They show us that many people all over the world are having these experiences, that contact often contains high levels of strangeness, that ETs come in all shapes and sizes, that a UFO experience can profoundly impact a witness, and much more!

Hello everyone my name is Preston dennit and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal I call this one
extraordinary humanoids 10 true encounters what else can I say about
humanoids that I haven't already said I find these encounters particularly fascinating I think the answers to many
of the questions of ET contact can be found in cases like these these are very
close encounters with little chance of misperception and it's far beyond a simple sighting
the cases I want to present today do come from all over the world including
Canada the United States Venezuela Brazil Sweden Germany England New
Zealand and Japan so quite a worldwide
series of events here these cases span five decades from the 1950s all the way
up to the 19 90s and involve a wide variety of humanoids what we would think
of probably as Grays but short little hairy dwarves certainly human looking
ETS many different types of ETS and of course the kinds of evidence we often
see and by that I mean Landing traces physiological
effects electromagnetic disturbances animal reactions these sort of things so
there's definitely quite a bit of evidence to support these cases a few are single witness cases some are
multiple witness cases and many of them do have outside supporting witnesses as
well and were professionally investigated so I think these are very
important cases some you may have heard of before some I'm sure you haven't and
even those you have heard before I think I've got some new details that you'll find quite
interesting so it's a lot of cases let's just get started and the first case I'd like to talk about I call smacked by an
alien this occurred on July 2nd 1953 in Spain more specifically in varz
Del sa Spain and while this is a single witness case it does have physical
evidence to support it in the form of Landing traces also there are some outside
supporting Witnesses who saw strange activity at the time of this encounter
and what I like about this this particular encounter is that it's a very early encounter and the ET behavior is
very unusual this very unusual humanoid encounter was investigated and reported
on by Professor Manuel pedrao he was the original researcher and wrote about it
in his book flying saucers and the evidence though it was later reprinted
in other books and magazines and in fact Spanish researcher Antonio Ribera writes
and I quote everything in the story points to it being genuine Gordon kraton
was the editor of the Flying Saucer review where this story was published and he writes I most emphatically agree
with Antonio Ribera I think this case Bears all the Hallmarks of complete
genuiness so the main witness is Maximo munes hernes and at age 14 it was his
job to watch over the grazing cattle on his family's Ranch in the small village
of varz Del s this is outside of quena Spain and he had to make sure that they
didn't eat the family's crops so he sat there watching them on the afternoon of
July 12th 1953 and this is when he heard a faint whistling sound behind him and he
ignored it at first but finally turning around he saw a large shiny gray Globe
he estimates it was about four to 5 feet in diameter not super big but by the
time he looked at it it was already sitting on the ground not too far away now this
witness has never heard of UFOs he's never been to school uh so he's never
has no idea what he's looking at and his first thought was that this must be a balloon which escaped from some
fair or celebration nearby but then he took a closer look and as he says I realized it wasn't one
of them it glowed brightly and it was just a short distance away so he got up hoping to
capture it before it blew away and he walked right up to it and as he approached to within arms distance an
opening appeared at the top of the sphere and three quote little men jumped out
they were very short about two to three feet tall he estimates stocky and build
with gray skin and sort of Asian looking features he says they wore quote very
smart blue colored suits and on their heads they had flat hats with what looked like visors he also noticed a
weird sort of flat metallic Contraption of some sort strapped to their
arms and they immediately walked up to him surrounded him one on each side and
one in front of him and the one in front of Maximo spoke to him in a foreign
language which he couldn't understand and as Maximo says when I didn't understand what he
said to me the one standing in front of me smacked my face then they walked off
they grabbed hold of a thing that was on the balloon and jumped and in they went
it glowed very bright it made the same sort of little noise as before when I first saw it and it went off very fast
like a rocket I was scared I ran home with the cows so Maximo says that the beings did
look around at the scenery before entering the craft he also noticed that the craft glowed more brightly as it was
taking off and going away so after arriving home he immediately told his
parents and his father was disbelieving at first but could see that his son was very much scared and even trembling so
he called the police and he and a police officer returned to the spot and were
amazed to find Landing traces four holes in the ground about 2 in deep and 1 inch
across and they were situated in a perfect square about 14 in apart and
they also found several small Footprints now later it was discovered
that a police officer by the name of Ceno Atienza Martinez was in the nearby
Village of Han ruia and he reports seeing a gray white sphere in the sky
around the same time as maximo's encounter and as he says when the affair
at viz delas occurred we saw what appeared to be a grayish white object
which was stationary in the air and then vanished shortly afterward words its
shape was very much like a ball it left no Trail and when it disappeared it went towards the east having come more or
less from the direction of Viara Del which is of course where Maximo had
his encounter and after sharing his encounter once Maximo refused to ever
talk about it again so we don't know if there's any followup to this
story there you go a thoroughly investigated case of of a humanoid encounter by a witness who's clearly
never even heard of UFOs or extraterrestrials and there's evidence
to support it physical evidence it's a truly unusual case I don't think I've
heard of anything quite like that uh and let's move on to the next
case because there are so many I suspect the vast majority of cases not only go
unreported but perhaps unseen people aren't around to even see these ET when
they come and land on our planet and do whatever it is they do but in this case
certainly they were seen and I call this case a hair raising
experience this encounter went almost very nearly unreported but thankfully
the witness did decide to report it after he found other Witnesses who apparently saw the same thing this
occurred in June of 1954 in Beno this is in Saskatchewan
Canada and I have a sneaking suspicion that this one might actually be a
reverse engineered human piloted craft though I can't say for sure because I
don't know what a human piloted test craft would be doing at
such low level and being witnessed by this farmer so you can make up your own
minds about that this case was investigated by Canadian researcher Dean F Clauson and again occurred in the
small town of Ben go the primary witness is anonymous he's a married middle-aged
farmer known only by his initials RF and it was a clear calm morning
around 10: a.m. one day in June of 1954 and Mr RF was out in the middle of
his yard pumping water when he heard what sounded like the motor of a Honda
motorbike approaching his farm this point he couldn't see anything but whatever it was it was getting closer
and as he says there was no mistaking the motor sound uh he says it didn't sound like a
jet or a helicopter because as he says quote it was reasonably silent but it was something so he looked
up and got an incredible shock and as DF says in his own words all of a sudden
this object came right over between the house and the shed there it was about 20
ft up it looked to be made of something transparent with two men sitting in it
with their helmet and goggles on there was a kind of stick shift in the middle like in today's cars it made the hair
stick up on the back of my neck I couldn't believe it so this object was
clearly not a helicopter as there were no propellers but according to the witness
RF it did create a quote big Whirlwind or vacuum as it passed over and as the
witness says I think it was going about 80 M an hour it wasn't that terrific a
speed at all there was kind of an uplift to it not a downdraft you know a suction
upward or a creation of air swirling But ultimately it was the
appearance of this machine that shocked him the most it was a perfectly round
saucer shaped craft and it had a 12T wide transparent cockpit in the front
with two human looking men sitting side by side inside it and the object itself
wasn't much more than 14 ft wide and according to DF it was about the size of
quote a good size room in a house and as DF says in his own words in
thickness the object looked like the lid of an old washing machine with this
windshield on the front something like a speedboat that you seen pictures with a onepiece
windshield the two objects or men I presume they were you could see their helmet and goggles quite
distinctive they were a darker color than the rest which was just like transparent I would say their clothing
there was no color to it now at the time the farmer did not believe in UFOs and
he immediately assumed that this object had to be some sort of secret military
craft and as he says I still think any way you want to look at it it's human
beings they're not from outer space as far as I'm concerned there's no such thing as outer space men controlling
these objects I figure this is a well protected experiment I wouldn't say in
Canada I wouldn't say even in the United States but it could be in Mexico as far
as small people manning these things I would say there's lots of small people in Australia and some countries that
could be trained to man these ships in no way will I connect them with outer
space so as you can see he's quite skeptical of the subject in General yet
he was stuck with what he saw and he as he says he figured that this object was
what people called quote these flying objects and fearing ridicule and
disbelief he decided to keep quiet and he did for about 14 years until he heard
two other Witnesses describing exactly what he saw and as Mr DF says I never
did tell anybody that I saw it for years because I figured well people would
figure that's another crackpot but this has to be one of them things you don't
forget thankfully this encounter had no lasting effects other than mentally but
DF doesn't appear to be particularly happy to have seen it as he says about
all it's done for me was give me a hair raising experience so perhaps this one did
involve a human piloted reverse engineered craft but if so it's a very
early case and also quite strange as why would they test a secret military craft
at such low levels right over a person's Farm as usual there are more questions
than answers but such as the nature of the UFO phenomenon definitely a very
unusual case whether it's human looking ETS or humans hard to say for sure but
certainly worth knowing about if it is reverse engineered way back in 1954
that's pretty early for that who knows and let's move on to the next case
which you may have heard of before it did get a lot of publicity I call this one why not to fight in ET this occurred
on November 28th 1954 in petare Venezuela this involves two witnesses
initially there were in fact quite a number of other outside supporting
Witnesses some undeniable physiological effects and what I like about this case
is I think it's a cautionary tale and provides some profound insights on what not to do if you have an ET encounter
the main Witnesses in this case are two men 25-year-old Gustavo Gonzalez and his
coworker Jose Pon the two of them were driving a truck in petare to pick up a
load of food Goods this time it was around 2 a.m. as they drove their
delivery van along Bella Vista Street on the outskirts of petara and this is when
they came upon a glowing 6 foot wide they estimate metallic sphere and this
was hovering just a few feet over the road ahead of them blocking their way
and as Gustavo says in his own words when I passed by the Bell Vista Street
in patare driving a van which belongs to me and accompanied by a collaborator I
was surprised and suddenly stopped the vehicle I was driving when I observed
that the street where we were was illuminated as if it were noon in Broad
daylight my collaborator Jose Pon also astonished opened the door of the van
and descended to the ground he came out running while seeing what I saw seconds
later having been able to observe an unknown living being which approach
approached us so this craft had two windows and what appeared to be a Copa on top and
there was this little being which was described as hay very short about 3 feet
tall with a round head very large eyes and had no clothes on except for a sort
of loin cloth or what Gustavo said looked almost like a diaper and instead
of fingers it appeared to have webbed claws so Gustavo grabs his own
flashlight and hurls it at the being his flashlight missed so he ran up to this
figure this apparent ET and grabbed it kind of in a bare hug lifted it up and
tried to carry it back into his van and he was surprised to find that this figure was quite light but was even more
surprised at how strong it was because it immediately freed himself from gustavo's grip and threw him 15 feet
away down onto his back on the ground now Jose Pon is watching all of
this and then he sees two other figures emerge from the the bushes they're
carrying what looks like hunks of dirt or rocks in their hands and seeing what's going on these two other figures
immediately jump into the craft and one reemerged and it was holding a tubl like
device in its hand and seeing this figure point this device at Gustavo Jose
turned and ran to get help at the local police station which was only a few blocks
away so meanwhile this first figure that Gustavo had tried to grab jumped up six
feet in the air moving towards Gustavo and this is when Gustavo pulled
out a little knife that he carries and as this being approached
Gustavo actually tried to stab this creature and he made contact with the
creature's body but the knife bounced off the surface of the creature as if it
was some sort of hard material and at the this time the other being holding this sort of tube likee
device shot a ray of light at Gustavo temporarily blinding him the ETS at this
point immediately returned into their craft which promptly took off now I just
want to give a quote from Gustavo now mind you this is translated from another
language so the wording is a bit awkward but I think it's worth hearing gustavo's experience in his own words as he says
at the beginning I felt as if something prevented me from moving but then I Advanced towards where the unknown being
stood I took it between my arms and tried to stop it but this small ombre
SEO small man as we could qualify it had much force and succeeded in breaking
loose from the catch of my arms which was applied to him although he had been raised from the ground it weighed
something like 50 kg and to have tried to carry him towards the van I fell on the pavement
at this reaction it quickly stopped me I tried to chase the Ombre SEO and when I
looked at him again I observed two more surprising things two more ombros came
towards me of which one of them illuminated me with a lantern coming apparently in assistance to His
companion the light prevented me from seeing what occurred during a while and a little time after while being in my
normal State all had disappeared when I left the state of quote trance holding
my Boy Scout knife in the right hand and realizing that the Ombre seal that was
to be stopped was approaching me by Instinct because I held up the weapon which I carried and I struck with my
weapon in the shoulder of the unknown being but my surprise was with out and
when the knife slipped on its hard skin not entering it at all
he appeared to have the skin of a rhino the weapon skidded on the rough body of the unknown being and slipped as if it
had hit a certain very solid material I could notice that his hands
were like four sharpened claws which tried to grab me Meanwhile my
collaborator Jose Pon came down by the small door on the right side of the van and moved towards the spherical ball
when arriving from the right slope of the First Avenue of bell Vista
a hairy hre seal quickly climbed the slope of the hill with joined hands and
carrying a lump of Earth so at this point after the being
shot this beam of light at Gustavo and returned to the craft and departed Gustavo rushed to the police station
joining Jose Pon who was already there and he reported what happened now the
police first thought they were drinking did not believe them but it quick quickly became very clear that the men
were telling the truth both were visibly traumatized and in fact Gustavo had a
long red scratch on the side of his body where he had grappled with his figure
gustavo's employer Antonio Sheri did vouch for gustavo's character and as he
says he has been on this job for more than a year he handles about a thousand items a day in money and always keeps
his account in order so at this point the police did believe them they took this account
seriously they went to the location and began to investigate and of course news
of the encounter began to spread very quickly and this is when many other people in the area revealed that they
had seen apparently the same UFO in that area at that time there were quite a lot
of Witnesses in fact Maria antona ja Yan
lived nearby and she said she was woken up around 1 or 2 a.m. by a loud
explosive sound followed by a weird Whistling noise three members of the dter stad
family were in their backyard in patare that evening when they saw a dis shaped
object flashing different colors moving in the sky for several
minutes another witness was concepion garan and he said that around midnight
she saw with others a silent glowing object moving across the sky again in
petare and it was around 2 a.m. that they heard an explosive sound coming
directly from Bell Vista Street where the encounter happened and there were
other Witnesses the Kabal family lived in downtown petar and they said that
they saw a brilliant white quote like a very intense star and they saw it around
two 2 a.m. the time of this encounter another gentleman a doctor Dr
Julio gares was driving his car very near Bell Vista Street around 2 a.m. and
he says he heard a man cry out in Terror in fact he stopped his car and looked around but seeing nothing continued on
his way another witness was Manuel Maria Soria and he said he was driving home
around 2:30 a.m. not far away from B Vista Street when he says a powerful
light Shone down on his car from above accompanied by a loud whistling
sound so he raised home and told his mother who confirmed that she also heard this strange sound a lot of other
Witnesses actually Francisco Le and several others who lived on nearby
Seventh Street so that they all saw intense lights heard weird noises and
several of them called the police about it and the police confirmed this they said they received several calls about
strange explosive sounds and unusual lights in the sky on that night they
actually sent out a patrol to look for it and it turned out that one of the doctors who would treat Gustavo Gonzalez
said that when he was returning home from a night call on that evening he also saw a
UFO so this case did get a lot of attention it was very well researched
and in fact the Witnesses were later interrogated by the Venezuelan government who showed great interest in
their case a lot to like about that case it being a multiple witness case with so
many outsid supporting Witnesses physiological evidence and people who vouch for the
sincerity of the witnesses and the fact that the Brazilian or the Venezuelan rather
government showed a strong interest in this case that's indication that they
absolutely found it credible so certainly an interesting case that deserves to be well known here's a case
you probably haven't heard before but it's certainly an interesting case because it does have animal reactions it
has some really amazing physiological effects electromagnetic disturbances as
well and just some very interesting behavior on the part of the ETS it is a
single Witness case but was investigated so I think it's an important case and I
call this one the mount Ary alien this encounter occurred in July of 1968 in
Mount Arie North Carolina and it's quite a profound
experience the witness in this case is Miss Harold Edgars we don't know her
name Miss Egger's husband Harold was at work and she was alone in their house on
the buck sh Road in Mount Ary now interestingly a little tidbit of
trivia here this town is allegedly the town which inspired the town of Mayberry
in The Andy Griffith Show so a nice little town and it was around 2:30 a.m.
When Miss Edgars was awakened by her dog frantically barking and scratching on
the front door of her home begging to be let inside so she got got out of bed and she
immediately heard this penetrating sound which she described as quote a huge
swarm of bees so she opened the front door her
dog ran inside hid under the bed and covered his ears with his paws and Miss Edgars was about to close
the front door when she saw something astonishing a large circular Flying
Saucer hovering only about 90 ft away from from her home and only 50 ft off
the ground so this is close she could immediately see that this craft had a
dome on top with about 12 square Windows around the circumference and in fact a red orange
light Shone brightly from these windows The Craft wasn't super huge about 15 ft
wide she estimates six or seven feet high it was metallic she said the base
of the craft looked like aluminum and she could see it glinting in the light of the full
moon so naturally she became a little bit frightened and immediately shut the
front door it was at this moment that the lights in the house dimmed she
quickly shut them all off and retreated in fear to the bedroom and she looked
out the bedroom window at the craft and this was when she was amazed to see a
sort of Strang looking short humanoid staring directly at her from one of the
middle Windows of the UFO and she could see it close enough to see that it wore a tight fitting silver
uniform some sort of silver helmet on its head and she estimates it was no
more than three or four feet tall so after almost five minutes of staring at
it she noticed that her dog was still shaking in fear under her bed so she
quickly closed her bedroom curtain in hopes that this weird craft would just go away however even with the curtains
closed she could still hear the loud buzzing noise coming from this craft so
shortly later she looked outside again and watched as this craft moved to the
east where it hovered across the street above some nearby Treetops she tried to just ignore this
craft just lie down in bed and go to sleep but she couldn't and she kept getting up and looking out through other
other windows of the house to watch this UFO she says it remained pretty much in
place pulsating with this redish orange light and making this very loud buzzing
noise she could see that this upper part of the craft was glowing with a yellowish light it stayed there for a
long time after about 20 25 minutes the craft Finly left this point Mrs Edgars
and her dog still remained in the bedroom and she says she was unable to sleep at all that night when the morning
arrived she did discover something strange three electric clocks in her
house had lost about an hour of time she also learned that there had been a power
failure in her immediate neighborhood that same evening so that doesn't sound
like a coincidence apparently the UFO affected the power in some way certainly looks
like that but when her husband Harold came home she told him what happened and
it was clear to him that quote she had certainly seen
something and now other than being you know frightened emotionally frightened by the
encounter the witness did suffer some fairly alarming symptoms including
insomnia dimming of vision and headaches which persisted on and off for several
days following the encounter why was the UFO there it's hard to say
but this area does include a Granite Quarry and a hydro El electric station
which were not too far away and both of which are known by UFO researchers to
attract UFOs so that could be a factor here but this case was investigated by
researcher faucet a well-respected researcher and it remained undisclosed
for 5 years until finally the witness consented to allow her name to be
used and as faucet writes I'm inclined to accept this story as a truthful
account especially in view of the witness's physiological effects the severe animal reaction The Sounds
described typically used to describe Bonafide UFO appearances at low altitude
the shape of the UFO often reported elsewhere the time the ENT occurred the
large number of similar UFO occupant reports worldwide a recent scientific
computer study report of UFO occupants indicates
69% are 4 feet and under that's very fascinating that most ETS that people
describe are quite short I wonder what we can take away from that I don't know
but it's certainly interesting and yeah that case is pretty well supported with
the animal reactions the electromagnetic disturbances and of course the
physiological effects that followed um after the encounter makes me wonder if
this was more than just a sighting there's no direct indication of that but I
wonder and now let's move to the next case which I call what true beauty is
and this case certainly got a lot of attention where it occurred in Brazil but I think it's virtually unknown in
the United States and elsewhere which is one of the reasons I wanted to cover it because it does have some very
interesting interactions and extensive interactions with these ETS
human-looking ETS I found this case particularly interesting because of the way the ETS
were dressed this also does involve an apparent healing though that's not
entirely clear it occurred on October 2nd 1968 in the city of Lind it's actually
more of a village back then certainly but it's near sa Paulo Brazil and what an extraordinary case
this one is the primary witness in this case is toribio Perera then a 41-year-old city worker
who on the day of his encounter was outside operating a tractor to begin
Excavating a lot at aen da saade this is on the outskirts
of lens it was about 620 a.m. again on October 2nd
1968 and toribio was replenishing the fluids in the tractor engine when only
feet away from him a beautiful sort of golden colored oval-shaped craft came in
for a landing at least he thought it was going to land on the ground but instead this
object seemed to hover about a foot above it made no sound that he could
hear but he could see that this craft was about 15 ft long 9 ft wide it had
this sort of weird platform around the center and a transparent Dome on top and
looking inside this transparent Dome he immediately saw four stools and a weird
control panel and he became very frightened wanted to run away
but found that he was unable to move and the next thing he knew four human
looking men had appeared now they did look he says
identical to each other like identical twins there were four of them and although they looked human they were
dressed quite strangely each one wore a blue robe with sort of a red skirt and
brown sandals on their feet he said they were 5 and 1/2 ft tall
very handsome and had smooth skin and childlike expressions and as toribio says in his
own words they had clothing like a saint down to the knees and on their heads a
hood they wore sandals open at the front so that their toes were visible the
color of their sandals was dark brown and they had narrow bands tied round their legs up as far as the knees like
the ancient Romans so these four men immediately separated and began doing separate
activities one stayed on the rim of the craft holding what toribio believed to
be some kind of weapon it reminded him of an electric drill the second one was
right next to this first one and he was scooping up soil with sort of a silver
shovel which reminded toribio of a con shell now the third figure walked right
up to to toribio's tractor and appeared to be examining the engine and the fourth stayed inside the craft in the
dome and was operating this strange panel which reminded tbio of sort of a
piano keyboard or a typewriter and all the time he was doing this this figure
was staring fixedly at toribio so this all happened in a matter
of moments and almost immediately The Man Standing on the rim of the craft
looked Direct directly at toribio and pointed the device he had in his hand at
toribio at this point it released a beam of light or a luminous orb which hit
toribio in the stomach area and this is when he felt this sort of severe pain
and he was absolutely paralyzed at this point but could still hear and see
everything and as he watched these beings returned into the craft they sat
on these four stools that were inside this Dome the platform that surrounded
the craft retracted this object made three very bright flashes Rose slowly upwards and
with a very soft sound it darted off at very high speed disappearing in a few
seconds as toribio says its flight was like that of a duck very smooth and low
at first and then rapidly putting on great speed so it took quite a few moments for tibio
to recover and it was with great difficulty he got up and waved down a
truck it turned out to be his friend ishmail who took him directly to the
hospital because torivio was pretty traumatized by this encounter he said he
felt quite weak very tired he actually went home afterwards and wept with
emotion and over the next few weeks he said he lost about 28 lbs and suffered
from this persistent tingling on his left side later returning to the site
toribio and his fellow employees did see strange marks on the ground and soil
that looked like it had been moved or scooped out so Brazilian Air Force authorities
were very interested in his case and interrogated him for three full days but
it doesn't end here was 1 year and 9 months later on July 19 1971 at 2:30
p.m. that toribio reports he was taking a nap in his home and he had this quote
dream that these same ETS showed up now he feels this was more than a dream
because in fact he felt physical mild electric shocks in his intestinal area
at the time he was suffering from some illness and the being said said that
toribio had been cured of the ill effects that had been caused by the ray they had shot at him but that they were
not responsible for his ill health which they said was caused by germs they told him that they could hear
everything that was going on around him and they then told him when you and
toribio took that to mean all Humanity when you have fully evolved you will
know what true beauty is and then the ET said that they would
not contact him again in this way so tibio woke up feeling ill and he
had an echoing hum ringing in his head and he was not sure if this was a dream
or a physical experience but I believe he's leaning towards this being a real
experience and interestingly according to researcher Nigel Rhymes he was
actually in the sa Paulo area on on that day and saw a brilliant light quote
shining like a yellow Pearl in the sky and this was just one one hour after
toribio's dream Nigel says that this object hung motionless for about 3
minutes then moved slowly off and disappeared now finally there's another
afternote to this case some years later the date is not listed toribio was
driving under the alcantar Machado Viaduct on aena rodel Lee when he saw
this same object again very low at the level of the underpass
itself and he heard a telepathic voice speak in his head which said don't be
scared because only you are seeing us we want to talk to you and they did the ETS
told toribio that they were not humans but came from a world world within our
own they explained a little bit about their culture and world but tibio says
he really didn't understand exactly what they were saying but he believed that they were trying to tell him that They
Came From Another Dimension the ETS told him that they were androgynous in nature that they
were on an evolutionary level above ours they told him that they reproduce
medically by taking fluid from the body and using incubators to raise their young they said that because toribio was
so weak they wanted to do an experiment on him and that's the last thing he
knows the next thing he knew they stopped communicating and the craft was gone that he says was his final
encounter he's unsure whether they did anything physically to him at that time
but that is where the case ends you that case is truly interesting because it is
very well verified and what's also interesting to me is that it wasn't just a oneoff this
involved multiple encounters I suspect that's more often the case uh really the
rule rather than the exception hard to say for sure because there are many cases that are
one-offs but absolutely a fascinating case and so is this next one which is
quite brief and I'm pretty darn sure you haven't heard of this one there's not a whole lot to it really but I found it
interesting and I call this one three aliens on Hudson Beach this occurred in
May of 1971 in wuku this is in Auckland New
Zealand and a very brief single witness case which wasn't appar apparently
officially investigated but certainly unusual this case was published by a local newspaper
but apparently never officially investigated and the witness is an anonymous elderly woman who lived along
Hudson's Beach and she wrote to the newspaper about her experience and I'll
just quote her directly as she says in her own words I live alone and a few
weeks ago meaning May 1971 a few weeks ago I was up having a
cup of tea between 2 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. the tide comes to my gate and this
morning it was in but not right up I drew my curtain a little to peep out and
I saw what I took to be three men chatting on the sand I thought it must
be some chaps cleaning fish then I said to myself not at 3:00
a.m. outside the gate is an old macra carpa and a pine tree and through the
big branch of the pine Shone a very bright red light which hovered slightly
the figures seemed to be shrouded in a gray missed a little later a silver
strip appeared in the water and appeared to light the way back for the men to get on the red ball as I watched the silver
strip disappeared and the red ball moved off slowly at first and it seemed to
bounce along in the air it was quite low then it gathered height before nearing
the aerodrome area at which time it soared very
high so that's all we know about this cas Cas but as the editor of the newspaper who published this letter
wrote all very strange but the story has the Ring of
authenticity and I agree but again unfortunately there is no further information on this case I like that
case just because the witness seems so obviously sincere it's a very unusual
although briefcase which makes me wonder just how many cases are out there how many go in reported and again how many
go completely unobserved because it was pure luck that the witness was actually
up at that late hour to drink a cup of tea and saw what she did a really interesting case and now we
move to the next one which I call something wasn't quite right that is of
course a direct quote from one of the witnesses I like this case because it's
quite extensive by that I mean it lasted a long time this UFO and the humanoids came quite
close to the witnesses there were multiple Witnesses there's a lot of interesting things about this case I
also like the fact that the witnesses made sketches of what they saw this case occurred on May 3rd
1973 in mantorp Sweden and while this case has been
widely reported I was able to find the original article in the Swedish language
in found some details that I don't think have been reported at all so if you've heard of this case I think I've got some
more information for you about it it was 9:45 p.m. as sigd Carlson left her home
to walk her dog near her home in mantorp Sweden she says it was a clear beautiful
starry night and as her dog ran off to relieve itself sigd saw a quote red
light approach from the Northeast she thought it was a plane at first so
she didn't pay much attention to it and just returned back to her home with the dog but back inside she went to the room
that faced the front yard and the room was in total darkness so she could now see that this object was still out there
this glowing red light and as she says the light ball was going too slow to be
an airplane and it stopped several times I realized that something wasn't quite
right right and therefore a wakened my 11-year-old son Robert to have as a
witness so Robert came over to the window and he and his mother watched as
this glowing red sphere stopped about a half mile away and hovered over a house
that was very well lit with flood lights and the object remained there for quite
a long time pulsating then suddenly it started to move away from the house with
a rocking for W movement and as sigd says as the ball of light started to
move we heard a jet-like sound that turned into a hissing sound like a steam
engine letting the steam out the sound didn't just come from the ball of light
itself but seemed to fill up the whole environment but it wasn't so loud that
we couldn't make ourselves heard when we talked about what it could be that we saw and after about five or 10 minutes
the ball of light turned and this is when it came right towards their house
and as sigd says as the object approached we could see that it was silver in color and that it changed from
the previously strong red color to yellow white and now they could both see that
this was actually an oval shaped craft with a transparent midsection very much
your classic saucer now Sigrid was a little B nearsighted but she could see
that there were two blurry humanoid shapes in the middle her 11-year-old son
Robert could see much more clearly and he was watching of course as this object
moved over a fur tree about 150 ft away maybe 180 ft high and this is when he
shouted out mother it's people watching us so Robert later told investigators
that this craft looks looked much like two saucers placed against each other
rim to rim and as Robert says in his own words in the middle of the craft I saw
the Silhouettes of two people bending over and tilting down at us the craft then continued moving
passed by the house moving slightly faster than a car sigd and Robert ran to
another room and looked out the window to continue watching it and a G says
from there we could see the craft again and as they watched this craft went over
a field moving in a swaying motion and hovering it started going slowly back
and forth as if looking for a place to land but then without warning it made a
uturn and disappeared towards the east now here is a map which shows the
path of the object point a is where the object appeared point B is where the object's
closest approach and where the humanoids could be clearly seen Point C is where the object moved
back and forth seeming to get ready to land and point D is the direction that
the object departed now when sigrid's husband a
night Watchman came home the next morning he listened in astonishment as
sigd explained the encounter and he had sigd sketch the CR craft and then he
heard the story from his son and had his son separately sketch the craft and when
he saw the similarity between their two drawings he no longer had any doubts
about what they had seen and later sigd called the police and asked them if they had any idea what
she had seen but they didn't Robert the son came away absolutely convinced that
they had seen an actual Flying Saucer and the occupant inside siget is a little more reserved
she says she doesn't know what it was but as she says it was neither a
helicopter nor an airplane I began to be afraid when the
object had disappeared it was an incredibly powerful experience I think I was a little
shocked by what I saw I think you'll agree that's a very compelling case with two witnesses who were both clearly
profoundly affected by what they saw I really do wonder what those ETS are up
to why they hung around for so long hard to say but now we move to the next case
which you may have heard of because it did get a lot of publicity but I absolutely found some information which
I am very confident other people who know about this case haven't heard of
before I call this one Touched by an alien because in fact the witness was
touched by the actual extraterrestrial it's a multiple witness encounter a lot
of supporting Witnesses some absolutely conclusive physical evidence in the form
of Landing traces I think that is one of the most compelling things about this
case it's why I wanted to report it but it's also extremely unusual it occurred
on February 23rd 1975 in kofu Japan it's another reason I
wanted to report on this case because we don't hear a lot of cases coming from Japan but they're there this may in fact
be one of Japan's most famous humanoid encounters it was 6:30 p.m. as two
7-year-old boys their names are masato Kono and katsuhiro
yamahata they were roller skating in a paved area not far from mado's home in
kofu Japan and looking up it was Kat suir who first noticed a strange light
in the sky and he pointed it out to his friend masato the two of them watched as
this light moved closer and now they could see that this was actually two lights both orange in color one was
slightly larger and apparently they were separate objects because the larger one moved off to the east while the smaller
one continued to move closer in this weird irregular motion and as it got very close to them
they could now hear a strange sound coming from it and both felt it was
coming for them so they ran and hid and watch this light fly around the area and
then move off this point they thought the sighting was over but things were about to get much more exciting because
it turned out that the light hadn't moved off at all and in fact it had landed in a Vineyard just a short
distance away now seeing a light there in the vineyard the two boys first thought it
might be a fire but as they approached for a closer look they saw that it was
in fact a dome shaped saucer 15 ft wide and 6 feet high with what looked like
three hemispherical Landing pods on the bottom the whole craft was glowing
orange but as they walked up close to it they saw that it in fact was silvery and
metallic masato was surprised to see five what looked like symbols on the craft that looked kind of Oriental but
made no sense katsuhira saw them as well but
katsuhiro approached and began walking around the craft itself and when he
reached the opposite side he heard movement coming from inside the craft
and suddenly an opening appeared and a ladder extended down to the ground from
the opening immediately a 4ft tall humanoid exited the craft via the ladder
this humanoid wore a shiny silver jumpsuit and was carrying what the boy said looked kind of like a rifle slung
over its shoulder this humanoid had dark brown skin and large pointed ears and where
the face would be there was a wavy sort of wrinkled surface which extended down
to the mouth ending in what looked like three sort of triangular Fang like
protrusions each about 6 in long you can see from their drawings what this
humanoid looked like so this might be a helmet though the children did not specifically say this they did say that
the head was abnormally large for the size of the body and had no
hair now the boys not only saw the humanoid but they could look through the open doorway and into the interior of
the craft and inside this craft they saw a second identical looking though
slightly smaller humanoid who was Seated on a chair with its hand on a lever of some kind and a screen in front of him
they said the interior of the craft was filled with all kinds of strange what looked like control
panels so at this point the boys became quite frightened and were about to run away when something truly extraordinary
happened the being that was outside the craft approached katsuro and patted him
twice on the shoulder actually reached out and touched him and this is when he saw that it had four finger fingers the
being then spoke some unintelligible words that sounded to him like a tape
recorder being rewound or something like that and this freaked him out poor
katsuhiro sat down on the ground paralyzed in fear the being kind of
walked around the boy as if inspecting him and KIRO being unable to move
decided to just play dead now at this point masado is freaking out and he
shouted let's get out of here but unable to move katsuhira said I
can't so at this point the boys were absolutely in a panic masado rushed
forward picked up his friend katsuhiro and literally carried him piggyback
style away from the site of this landing at one point they did turn around and
they could see that this figure was starting to follow them and again they could see inside the craft through the
open door and they noticed that you could look all the way across from the
inside to the other side of the craft and out the window and this was weird
because from the outside of the craft looking in the window was opaque but from the inside of the craft looking out
they could see the landscape in the environment around them so thoroughly freaked out and afraid they ran back to
mado's home which was only about 300 ft away and katsuhiro excitedly explained
that there was a landed UFO in the vineyard and he was told to just stop talking nonsense sit down and eat dinner
but when masado insisted that this was all true and their mothers both saw how
upset and frightened their children were the mothers decided to go outside and
they were amazed to see a bright glowing light in the center of the
vineyard and they were quite close to it they walked up and approached it to a distance of about 150 ft and we're
trying to figure out what this might be could it be a reflection or what as one of the mothers says it was a brilliant
orange color was like watching fireworks or something was really glowing brightly
it was spinning and and glowing brightly and blinking now at this point katsu Hero's
mother wanted to get a closer look but the boys begged her not to screaming
that there were aliens there who might take them away and it was at this point the light began to pulsate rapidly
increasing in brightness for about 5 minutes so at this point the mothers called out to their husbands to view
this site but at this point this light became dim decreased in size ascended
slightly and disappeared so the husbands didn't really get a good view at
it now venturing to the area shortly afterwards they at first found no
evidence of this craft masado himself was unable to sleep
that night and he cried through most of the evening and as far as katsuhiro the
next morning he was too frightened to leave the house alone to walk to school and insisted that his mother accompany
him but they did go to school and when they got there they were shocked and
amazed to see a drawing of The Craft that they had seen on the chalkboard it turned out that another
boy a local boy 8-year-old Ichiro Mishi
was driving with his parents through kofu about a half hour before the B boys
sighting and he saw a shiny object flying towards the area where the boys
had seen the craft land so all of them began talking excitedly and very quickly their
teachers took notice and realized something very strange was going on they
ended up calling some journalists and they all went together to the location to investigate and this is when they
found some amazing evidence a close examination of the spot where this craft
had landed showed a ring pattern on the ground and found in fact one of the
cement F fence posts there had been knocked over exactly where the craft had
landed and two other fence posts were also damaged also there was some steel
netting that was attached to the posts that was bent as if a heavy object had
bent it there were also numerous unexplained holes on the ground and what
looked like white ash so researchers took notice of this
soil samples were collected and tested and they showed high levels of
radiation this was really surprising so more tests were ordered and these
additional tests yielded the same results and it wasn't long after this
that more witnesses were discovered a man who lived nearby said he was drawn
outside on that night by his barking dog and he saw a yellow object move swiftly
across the sky and descend behind some buildings so he apparently saw this
object arriving also there was another man a priest who lived nearby he said that on
that very night he saw a yellow object zigzagging across the sky and
disappear and there was another young girl who is on her balcony again in the
same area and she described this strange yellow light in the
sky so years past the boys never wavered from their story they later granted
further interviews as teenagers and there was still a lot of interest in their story and in fact at
age 30 they consented to undergo hypnosis and they relived the event
though as far as I know no further details emerged but about eight years after the
boy encounter yet another witness surfaced and this was amazing because
this lady by the name of Midori was a driving was driving in the area
apparently by this location on that night when she heard what she described
as a loud banging noise and she says she saw two strange humanoids standing in
the road and I'll just quote madori directly because she granted a television interview and as she says
there in The Crossroads stood two boys they looked to be junior high school
boys about 130 40 cm you know 4 feet tall
their faces were completely black when looking from far away
thinking it's strange I beeped my car horn but they didn't move I approached
them and beeped again but they still didn't move I thought it was strange but I was in a rush so I continued to drive
when I came up beside them I saw that they were very dark and then one put
their hand on my windc screen I could see its Palm it was completely black it
had wrinkles going across it all down the Palm it didn't have the usual lines
we humans have and I saw its face the bottom of its eyes were completely
straight and its eyelids were very wrinkly I was shocked I only looked at
it for around five or six seconds I only saw its hand and face I was too
surprised to see anything else but there are some amazing
similarities to what she and the boys saw perhaps she saw them without their helmets because the boys did not
describe eyes hard to say for sure but this seems to be more than just a
coincidence there was a lot of interest in what the boys described as seeing symbols on the sides of the craft and
people tried to translate them not with a whole lot of success success but
whatever the writing meant this case became one of Japan's most studied multi- witness UFO humanoid sightings on
record I mean come on how can you deny that case with two direct Witnesses who
saw the humanoids and the landed UFO touched the ET their parents saw the UFO
people all over the area saw the UFO another person saw humanoids the
witnesses have never backed down from their case and of course the
extraordinary Landing trace evidence with the cement poles being knocked down the marks on the ground the abnormal
radiation readings and so forth it's an undeniable case of ET
contact and here is another one which is perhaps not as well authenticated but
certainly was researched and I'm sure you haven't heard of this one either because it's quite an obscure case I
call this one come with us on a journey this one occurred on January 27
1983 in blowick England and this case is super
interesting because of the interaction that this gentleman had with the ETS and
what they tried to get him to do which he was reluctant to do the main witness
in this case is known only as Allan he's a 29-year-old married factory worker and
he reports having had many paranormal experiences in his life Mostly Ghostly
encounters but he says he always had a feeling that one day he might meet
extraterrestrials which ironically he was skeptical of but it was around 9:10
p.m. again on January 27 1983 that had happened a face-to-face encounter with
humanoids it was a cold clear night as Alan hiked on this path that bordered
the Essington Canal which you can see here bordering or running parallel to
the m6 Highway in blowick England he was on his way to go visit a
friend and it was a TW mile long walk but he was quite fit so this wasn't a problem now this canal is immediately
adjacent to two nature reserves the piger local nature reserve and the
guff's nature reserve and at that time it was a pretty remote and natural area
so as alen walked his attention was suddenly drawn upward to a strange craft
that hovered at low level almost directly above him he said it was roughly saucer shaped it had a silver
mirror-like finish and a bright band around the center said it was surrounded
by this strange Haze and he only saw it for about 5 Seconds when it winked out
but it was long enough for him to determine that it definitely wasn't a plane he was puzzled by it but as it had
disappeared so quickly he just kept walking but it was only moments later
and he just walked a few yards ahead when he saw two humanoid figures
standing to the right of his path looking right at him and he was struck
immediately Amazed by their appearance both were male he estimates about 5 1/2
ft tall they looked human they had dark curly hair high cheekbones and kind of
looked Asian in appearance but were very light complected and had blue eyes both
were absolutely identical in appearance with perfectly proportioned muscular
bodies they both wore tight fitting light gray jumpsuits with a strange
Insignia on their left chest and even though it was a dark night he could see
them he could see them clearly because they were both surrounded by a strange glowing
Aura so at this point he's not really afraid he's more intrigued by their
strange appearance and he walked right up to them and this is when they began to
speak in unison together in an almost mechanical robot likee voice in English
but with this absolute perfect diction and they asked him told him come
with us on a journey and Alan said that even though they spoke their mouths remained open
and their lips were not moving so this freaked him out and he declined their
invitation and explained to them I don't want to leave my wife and they replied
you will see her again Allan told them no that he still
did not want to go and they told him you will be rewarded still Alan declined and by this
point he was becoming Afraid by their insistence and that they might take him
forcibly but to his surprise and relief they didn't they just departed but they
left in this very unusual way he says they kind of turned and quote glided
away with their feet off the ground like ice skaters he also noticed that the tall
grass all around them had no effect on their speed so Allan was absolutely stunned
and baffled by this encounter was clear to him at this point that these were not normal people these were ETS but why he
wondered did they want him he admitted that he was not really an educated man
and he also wondered what they were doing there in such a lonely remote area uh how could they possibly have
known he would be there none of it made any sense to him so afterwards he told
his friends but they did not believe him he told his wife but she thought that he
was quote mad the encounter did have a profound effect on him he began having
Vivid nightmares he says nightmares about strange robed beings and other
colorful exotic planets and these were serious enough that he actually went to
a doctor to seek treatment and got a prescription for sleeping pills he says
his appetite suffered and he lost about 14 lbs following this encounter he did return to the site
hoping to find an alternative explanation for what happened but of course there was none and frustrated by
the response from those around him he did try calling UFO organizations but
found little support there either so he began reading UFO books hoping to find
some answers and finally heard about Jenny randle's a very prominent English
researcher and contacted her and she did take his report seriously in fact his
case was later published in the northern UFO news it was according to Jenny
randles the first humanoid case in Britain in over two years but as reported in local
newspapers both before and after Allen's encounter there were in fact several
other impressive sightings in this same area so apparent was not an isolated
event now I can't blame Allan the main witness for not wanting to go with the
ETS that must have been quite a surprise and a certainly a big decision I'm not
sure how I would have reacted I'd like to think I would say yes take me on a journey I think that would be one of the
most fascinating experiences a person could have but he declined for whatever reason and I can't blame him it must
have been a real surprise to see these guys approach him like this what a case
and here's the last one in this little collection I call this one nothing bad
will happen to you and that's a direct quote from the ET I'm not sure if the
witness will agree with that we don't have a whole lot of information about this case but it's certainly an
interesting case which occurred on February 18 1990 in corbach Germany
and I like this case because are physiological reactions with the witness
as well as animal reactions and it's just a very interesting ET human
interaction this next and final case comes from pioneering German researchers
or magin and elbron Van ludger the witness is anonymous and it
was around 7:30 p.m. on the evening of February 18 1990
as the witness was walking her dog in the wall deck Hills this is near corbach
in Germany and suddenly for no reason that the witness could see her dog lay
down on its back began to whimper and wouldn't move wouldn't take another step
she was unable to get her dog to respond so she physically picked her dog up and
began to carry him and it was just shortly later around this time she heard
a low hum and this weird humming sound continued for about 30 seconds and then
stopped and this is when she noticed a large craft about 30 ft wide and 5T High
floating above a clearing and as soon as she saw it it was glowing incredibly
brightly for about 30 seconds but then became dim and she could now see that
this was a metallic craft the bottom half she said glowed red like a fire
very coal the craft was very low to the ground and appeared to be resting on
four Landing legs at this point the witness's dog
escaped jumped from her arms and ran off and the witness at this point had
been so dazzled by this bright light from the craft that she was having trouble seeing in the dark and she
wanted to run away she was about to run away when she says she was struck by a quote blue red of light and this
rendered her unable to move she says this light beam remained
focused on her and she started to feel this weird shortness of breath and she
began to perspire quite heavily so she was unable to call out for help then
suddenly as the witness says quote there was a voice she said it sounded metallic
and yet female and it spoke to her saying don't be afraid nothing bad will
happen to you but this provoked even more fear in the witness who now she
says was in a state of panic and this is when the blue ray of light kind of changed to a green color and she now
felt an improvement in her ability to breathe and this is when she noticed that there were two strange humanoids
standing in front of her they were both very short just over four feet in height
in height but they did have normal looking facial features she said their skin was quite
gray in color their heads were totally bald both wore dark green overalls and
the overalls had a strange symbol that she doesn't quite remember what it looked like on the
chest they apparently spoke to her but she was not able to understand what they
said shortly later they returned to their craft at this point the green beam
which had been on her the whole time vanished and the witness says she fell unconscious to the ground and when she
woke up it was already 9:30 about 3 hours had passed her dog was nowhere to
be seen she began to stumble home she took a few steps and actually vomited
she continued home vomiting once more when she arrived home she found her dog
still waiting for her so this case was researched but but the researchers
provide no further information on the incident I do wish we had more
information on that case I suspect it might have been more than just a simple sighting but without further information
any such conclusions are impossible to make but I'd be surprised if that was a
oneoff given that this witness had such a close encounter with these ETS given
that she fell unconscious I mean she may have been taken on board I don't
know uh that's one of the problems with this field is due to the cover up due to
the ridicule and disbelief it's very difficult to get a full
investigation thankfully things are changing so that is the show for
today 10 really extraordinary cases coming from all over the world multiple
Witnesses supported by a wide variety of compelling physical evidence I think
it's absolutely insane that people are still Skeptics I mean how many cases do
we need to convince people that this is actually happening it is and it's been
going on for a very long time and given that pretty much without exception
people are seeing humanoids that's also a very important takeaway and like many
contes have been told we share a common Heritage and I think these humanoid
cases speak to that but certainly some very interesting interactions by a wide
variety of ETS so thank you once again I hope you've enjoyed this episode perhaps even
learned a little bit I truly appreciate you watching and until next time keep
searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important of all and
I mean it keep having fun bye for now.
