ASTOUNDING: TEN TRUE HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Aug 16, 2024

Summary:
Aug 16, 2024
Few experiences are as astounding as a direct face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid from another world. And yet, the number of cases is far greater than most people think. They have been reported for well over a hundred years and probably into antiquity. Cases come from all over the world. This video presents ten little known cases, each one adding to our knowledge of ET contact. There are far too many cases to be explained away as hoaxes, hallucinations, or misperceptions.

THE ETS AND THE SAUCER. On the afternoon of May 5, 1954, eight-year-old Arnaldo Ribeiro de Freitas was goat-herding near his home in Fregim, Portugal when an odd sound alerted him to two UFOs hovering nearby. One flew off, but the other remained, and Arnaldo could see two big-headed humanoids sitting inside it. And one was looking right at him! After it departed, it left weird landing traces on the ground.

ANOTHER ALIEN MICHELIN MAN. One afternoon in May of 1960, Professor Miguel Timermans Ceballos was driving his motorcycle near Cadiz, Spain. Looking ahead, he saw a strange humanoid figure which looked very much like the famous Michelin Man. Seconds later, a second figure appeared. Both walked clumsily across the road before disappearing into the brush. Miguel was convinced they were not human.

IT WASN’T ANYTHING HUMAN. Late in the evening of October 23, 1963, Robert W. Smith drove in a rural area of South River, NJ when he saw something odd in the beams of his car headlights: three very short humanoid figures dressed in tight-fitting, silver, one-piece suits. They darted across the road far faster than a human could move. Robert was too frightened to stop. It was an experience he would never forget.

THE FLOATING HUMANOID OF COFICO. On July 2, 1968, numerous residents of Cofico, Argentina observed UFOs and/or humanoids hovering overhead. Three witnesses at one home described a glowing humanoid figure floating in the air. Another witness described a 9-foot-tall robotic figure, also floating in the sky. Another witness in a different home described the same thing. Even policemen witnessed strange activity.

THE JAY-WALKING ALIENS. In early May of 1969, numerous residents in Rockville, Virginia started seeing UFOs darting around overhead. But on the night of May 11, 1969, Mike Luczkowich saw actual humanoids. Driving along Route 622, he saw what he first thought were two deer. Instead, he realized they were four-foot-tall humanoids with giant heads. They crossed the road in front of him, followed by a third one.

THE DUMBBELL ETS. On the night of October 24, 1976, Romeo Lucarelli and his young daughter were driving to their home in Hobling, France when a brilliant light appeared ahead of them. It zoomed towards them and revealed itself to be a dumbbell-shaped object with two humanoid figures inside. To Romeo’s fear, the craft followed them home. His wife ran out just in time to see the UFO dart away.

IT DIDN’T SEEM LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. On the night of January 21, 1977, Juan Pedro Hernandez of Camuy, Puerto Rico was shocked to see an ET craft hovering at low altitude overhead. Inside he saw a skinny figure with a big head and dark eyes looking at him. Suddenly he was struck a beam of light from the UFO. The beam retracted and the UFO departed. Juan followed, but govt agents appeared, blocking his way.

THE UFO GNOME. In late March of 1978, Constantina Imbibos and her husband began seeing UFOs behind their home in Villamare Di Sapri, Italy. After several sightings, on April 25,1978, Constantina saw another UFO, and seconds later, a strange gnome-like humanoid wearing an orange suit and pointed hat. It bounced around like a gnome. Soon more UFOs would be seen, and more gnome-like entities.
 
AN 8-FOOT-TALL GRAY. On the night of July 31, 2018, a military veteran with a Top Secret clearance was driving on State Route 13 just north of Mount Vernon, Ohio when an eight-foot-tall, incredibly thin, hairless humanoid crossed the road in front of him. It had black eyes, a small mouth and four fingers on each hand. It was not human. Truly frightened, the witness decided not to stop.

I SAW SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET. Around 5am on July 16, 2020, Paul Froggatt was bicycling home from work in Warwick, UK when a UFO appeared. He snapped two photos with his camera, but became frightened when the craft seemed to follow him. Moments later he came face-to-face with a 7-foot-tall, praying mantis humanoid. He was so frightened he began to cry. He fled the area, thoroughly traumatized.

As hard as it might be for some people to believe, the growing number of cases involving humanoid encounters make it undeniable that we are being visited by extraterrestrials. Thankfully, as the government UFO coverup collapses, and as more people reveal their encounters, the truth is coming out. ETs are real! And it’s time that all of humanity knows it.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs in the
Paranormal I call today's episode astounding 10 true humanoid
encounters it's amazing to me how many cases there are like this and almost without exception when people have these
encounters they're very surprised and of course astounded it's why I gave it this
title and the 10 cases I've chosen for you today come from many different
places across our planet including England France Spain Italy Portugal the
United States including Puerto Rico and Argentina the cases I've picked started
in the 1950s all the way up to 2020 so some current cases as well and of course
involving a wide variety of humanoids so we see the typical grays
but human-looking ETS as well short Little Gnome like beings human-looking
ETS robotic humanoids and more but pretty much all humanoids some of these
are single witness cases some are multiple witness cases and of course there is evidence for some of these
cases mostly in this compilation electromagnetic effects and
Landing traces certainly some compelling cases and further evidence that we are
not alone in this universe so let's just get started and the first case I'd like
to talk about today I call the ETS and the saucer this is a single witness case
though it does involve apparent Landing traces that occurred on May 5th
1954 in fim Portugal and it's a pretty interesting case this case comes from
researcher Vicente Juan ballister Almos was 2: p.m. on the afternoon of May 5
1954 as 8-year-old Arnaldo rera de frus tended to some of his goats in the Hills
surrounding the small village of fim Amarante Portugal where he lived this
area back then was far more rural than it is today lots of wilderness uh thick
with pine trees and suddenly he's out there hurting his goats when he hears this strange sound kind of like a
whistling that he said resembled a radio receiving static and interference and it
seemed to be coming from a dip in the terrain about 500 ft away from him so he
ran towards it to investigate 10 seconds later he reached this area and saw that
the sound was coming from an object which was now flying off towards the nearby Tomo River he watched it rise
upwards from the ground slowly revolving on its access it then reached a height of about 60 or 70 ft and accelerated at
high speed towards the north at which point it did emit a powerful hot wind
but meanwhile Arnaldo noticed a second object which was sitting in the middle of this dip in the terrain only about
130 ft away and it wasn't that large it was about 4T tall maybe 6 feet wide
shaped like a half sphere he said it had a gray metallic circular base which went
around the bottom of it but the Dome on top was transparent and the Dome itself was topped by a
brown colored turret now inside this craft he could see two humanoid figures which didn't
look quite normal they both had very large heads large widely spaced eyes
just an opening for a mouth and what looked like antenna on their heads they
both wore bright blue uniforms that reminded Arnaldo of armor one of the beings appeared to be
operating a lever type device while the other was staring directly at the witness he says it looked to him
like they were both sitting down and he watched them in absolute surprise for about 20 seconds which is a long time
when you're seeing something like this so close up then without warning this
object took off and it was gone now later checking out this area he
discovered that the location where the second craft had risen from the ground
was bar burn of growth in an area of about 10 by 25 ft and it would remain
that way for at least the next 20 years nothing would grow there in most ways I
would call that your typical UFO encounter with humanoids
what I like about it is the witness did get a very closeup look at these
ETS and also he clearly didn't have a whole lot of knowledge about this
subject so it's not likely that he made it up and also considering the fact that
there were apparent Landing traces that always lends an extra level of credibility to the account it's a
fascinating case of humanoids and again occurring all over the world as this next case illustrates I like this case I
call it another alien melin man if I knew that there were so many cases like
this I probably would have done a singular episode on just melin
type encounters cuz there's a lot of them and this one adds another to this
long list of ETS that look like the melin man this one occurred in May of
1960 in kadiz Spain I like it because the witness is very credible he's a
teacher a professor and he got a pretty darn good look at these really unusual
humanoids this case comes from Spanish researchers Antonio Ribera and Miguel
perro Garcia both who interviewed the witness directly and yeah it's another
addition to a long list of cases involving ETS that look like the classic mitchellan man the witness in this case
is Miguel timman seos he's a teacher from jurz de la frona in kadiz Spain and
it was one afternoon around 100 p.m. in May of 1960 that the witness Miguel was driving
by motorcycle cycle from pra Del Rey to his home in jerz now he was in between the two small
towns of Aros DF Frontera and El Bosque at the time of his encounter this was a
dirt road it's now paved but he was going up a short Steep Hill when he saw
a strange figure alongside the road only about 500 ft ahead of him and its
appearance was so strikingly strange that Miguel knew instantly it was not normal
probably not human cuz it was wearing this puffy reddish suit composed of
dozens of inflated rings from its legs all the way up to its body and its arms
as well and as Miguel says he was completely red from head to foot and
suddenly appeared at the edge of the highway rather tall something like 2 m or more having trouble walking and his
walking was like a mechanical doll that is to say like a robot with stiff sff
arms so needless to say he was shocked and surprised by its sudden appearance
he stopped his motorcycle and carefully observed the strange humanoid he saw
that it was walking along the edge of the road and it took about six steps when suddenly another almost identical
looking figure appeared and began to follow the first now this second figure
had two major differences from the first he was much shorter just about one meter
or less than 4 feet tall and he also wore what looked like a single black
boot on only one of its feet so strange now Miguel could not see any facial
features but he could see that both these figures appeared to have trouble walking as he watched these two figures
traversed the highway at an angle and curious but cautious Miguel debated with
himself about whether he wanted to get closer he said if he had another person with him he would have but being alone
he hesitated so he waited until they crossed the road and as these two figures disappeared into the brush on
the other side he finally decided to start up his motorcycle which he did and
he drove up to where he had seen these two figures disappear unfortunately by the time he
arrived they were no longer in View and he estimates that he had seen them for about 30 seconds he did look for
evidence of their passing Footprints or anything like like this but there was nothing there the whole encounter did
leave him frightened and convinced that he had seen something that was not from this world having an encounter like that
has got to be astounding so I don't blame Witnesses for not wanting to approach closer as this witness said he
would have gotten closer if he had someone else with him but he didn't unfortunately there isn't any real
physical evidence supporting his account but given that he is a professor I think
uh this account is definitely worth attention so there's always another
account where one leaves off just goes to show this is happening all over the
world and this next case shows that this one comes from South River New Jersey it
occurred on October 23rd 1963 and I call this one it wasn't
anything human this is a single witness case involving a gentleman who saw ETS
while driving down the road at night but it's a good case and what I especially
like about it is it was very thoroughly investigated by researchers who were
quite well experienced it's rare that a case is investigated to the depth that
this was so I think you'll find it a really compelling case this case was
thoroughly researched by professional researchers Ted bletcher Roger wescot and his wife and the main witness was
initially Anonymous but we now know him to be Robert W Smith and it was around
11 p.m. again on October 23rd 1963 as Robert drove from Boston
Massachusetts to Matan New Jersey strangely he missed his turn off on the
Jersey Turnpike exit 11 so he proceeded to the next exit New Brunswick got onto
Route 18 and took what's now called County Road 615 towards Route
9 coming around a sharp corner he hit a straight away and he started to
accelerate to about 50 or 60 M hour and this is when he saw something he could
hardly believe and I'm just going to quote Robert extensively because he described this in such vivid detail as
Robert says suddenly I noticed something shining on the left side of the road in
an instant three small man-like creatures darted across the road all
three wore tight fitting silver gray onepiece suits they were about 3 ft tall
and moved faster than Homo sapiens is capable their legs which were clearly
outlined by the tight fitting suits appeared to move like Pistons as if unaffected by gravity now there was
something very unusual about these figures it was in the way they moved these figures 3 to 4T tall did not run
like a normal human being would I would say that their movements were at least twice as fast as the fastest Sprinter
and their leg movements which I seem to remember mostly the tremendous speed at which their legs moved this was what
Disturbed me the speed and the actual leg movements it was almost like they flooded across that road they didn't run
the body movements did not look human to me there was something very unusual about the movement of the leg that I
just can't describe I don't remember seeing any feet the thing that sticks in
my mind are those legs those small legs and how quickly they moved almost like Pistons sort of spindly but there was
shape to them I would say it was almost muscular I could see a calf and a thigh
they were sort of luminous actually it was like a silver gray they seemed a
glow once they hit the headlights the beams reflected of them but not before that they crossed ahead of the car at a
distance of perhaps 50 to 75 ft it was a clear night I think I had the high beams
on and I got a good look at them but I could see no features except that they were two-legged and they were faster
than any living thing that I had ever seen including animals I've seen deer and all kinds of small game and I never
saw anything move that fast so hardly able to believe what he
had just seen Robert decided to not slam on the brakes and as he
says my immediate reaction was to let my vehicle come to a halt without applying
the brakes is I did not want to stop too close to where they crossed the road
when my car stopped I looked back but saw nothing and after thinking about the
situation I decided not to investigate alone as I was somewhat frightened it
sort of frightened me I was going to go back and take a look at this whatever I saw but after considering the fact that
it was a sort of desolate lonely area and I had not even a flashlight I
decided to forget about it and just go on about my business I was actually afraid to go back and look I hate to
admit that but man I'll tell you that's the only time in my life that I know I
experienced fear I actually was afraid that made the hair stand up on my head
whatever I saw I just didn't think they were normal and so I didn't want to get involved in anything I didn't know about
so he did drive home and upon arriving home he told his wife who initially laughed and told him it must have been
children playing a prank but Robert told her no it wasn't anything human so she
absolutely believed him now later after thinking about his encounter Robert
concluded that he must have seen extraterrestrials and he wrote a letter to Jay Allen heck and this is what began
the investigation and robertt said that these figures were quote the damnedest
thing I ever saw he said he would never forget it and afterwards he did admit
that he regretted not going back to see if he could get a closer look at them can you imagine traveling down a rural
road like that late at night and what do you see but three ET beings crossing the
road right in front of you this witness as he said does regret not stopping to
go back and investigate but I can hardly blame him cuz that has got to be a real surprise
coming upon something like that but to his credit he did come forward and I'm
glad his case was investigated because there's a lot like it a lot of cases of
people driving along late at night and they see something they did not expect to see and it changes their world viiew
forever and here's another good example I call this next case the floing
humanoid of kofo this occurred on July 2nd 1968 in a little town called kofo in
Argentina and this is a really interesting case particularly not only because the humanoid scene is pretty
unusual very tall and floating but there were so many
witnesses a bunch of people in this small town saw activity on this night and some of them saw the humanoid as
well July 2nd 1968 turned out to be quite an eventful day for the numerous residents
of the kofo area this is south of salta Argentina and very near a mountain peak
named the peak of February 20 they all became witnessed to very unusual
activity but one of the first reports came from a young child by the name of Sylvia Rosa Olmos was about 5:00 p.m.
when she reported seeing along with two other St stone masons who were working at her house a glowing humanoid figure
in the air now three hours later three policemen reported their sighting of a
UFO over the nearby ptoo District it was apparently around the same time that
there was another witness Corina Robel who stepped out of her backyard and saw
this huge disc-shaped object which was sending down a bright beam of light
seeing how unusual it was she ran inside to get her mother quickly ran back outside and now saw that there was a
huge robot-like figure which she estimates was about 9 ft tall this
figure was suspended in the air but very quickly started to move off it slowly
drifted away until it was lost behind some hills now all in all about 15
people reported seeing unusual activity which had the entire neighborhood in an
uproar with some of the residents saying that all of this sounded too fantastic to
believe but events weren't over yet the real Clincher happened when a boy by the
name of Francisco Amelia Sola he's 14 years old he experienced what was
probably the closest and most extensive Encounter of that day he was at the local sporting club when he saw a UFO
hovering over this same mountain peak and it was then that he saw a seven or
8ft tall glowing figure hovering in the air very close to him only about 10 to
15 ft away he said it was strange because as he watched this being started
to spin in place and then it went off again towards the top of this mountain
peak he immediately ran to the police who were already overwhelmed with the recent
reports now this mini wave of sightings was later published in a few local
newspapers but otherwi remains virtually unknown and as far as I know has never been investigated by UFO
researchers well it does appear that that case was never officially investigated given that there were that
many witnesses it's hard to deny that something really unusual occurred in
kofo it's a really compelling case when you have that many
witnesses and if you disbelieve that case of course there's always another one to take its place this I think is is
really the best evidence we have the fact that there are so many cases far
far more I'm sure than the general public realizes and here's another one which I
call the jaywalking aliens quite a few cases of people seeing ETS crossing the
road in front of their car at night here's another example this occurred on May 11 1969 in Rockville Virginia and
while this is in most respects a single witness case in terms of the witness seeing humanoids there are some
corroborating witnesses to UFO activity in the area at that time not to mention
what appear to be landing traces involved with this humanoid sighting
this amazing case involves a series of unusual events which began on May 4
1969 following a thunderstorm this is when numerous residents in the Rockville area reported
hearing an unusual sound in the sky Herbert C cayor his wife and son all
said that they saw this glowing pulsating object which was about the size of a car hovering in the sky for a
full hour now 5 days later 15 minutes before midnight on May
10th it was 18-year-old Debbie Payne was being driven back to her home in
Rockville after going on a date now as they approached her house
she was startled to see a luminous oval-shaped object hovering very near her home she watched as it flared in
brightness and disappeared but then reappeared twice before they reached her house now the driver did not see the
object so Debbie didn't have any other Witnesses and that would have been the extent of it except for two hours later
and a half mile to the west where another gentleman was about to experience one of the most puzzling and
astounding events of his life Mike lucovich a 20-year-old student was
driving to his home at about: 145 a.m. now May 11th he had visited his
girlfriend in nearby Rockville and he just turned South onto Route
622 and was passing the Rockville General Store when he saw what he first
thought were a couple of deer about 150 ft ahead of him crossing the road but he
realized almost immediately that these were not deer and instead they appeared to be two small humanoid figures each
about three and 1/2 to 4T tall they both wore large spherical helmets about the
size of basketballs with a large circular face plate where the face would be and these two figures stood
motionless when the beams from Mike's car hit them the these face plates
reflected a pale green light but as soon as these headlights hit him almost
immediately they scuttled and scrambled across the road to the left side climbing up a 4ft tall embankment which
was overgrown with weeds and Vines and Poison Ivy and other plants and escaped
into a field of barley where they disappeared so he watched this and as
soon as they disappeared at that very moment a third figure dashed across the road again from right to left and was
now only 75 ft ahead of Mike's car this humanoid followed the same route as the
others only per Mike it moved much faster he said all three Figures were
dressed in light brown coveralls which were loose fitting and baggy around the
legs but fit snugly around the ankles so they disappeared quite quickly
it was a pretty brief sighting but he saw close enough and he was so shaken by
the encounter that he told nobody at first he thought about it all day but
later decided to report the experience and he returned with three other people to the site where they did in fact find
a trail in the poison ivy and honeysuckle which led to a path that went right through the barley cases like
these always make me wonder what are these ETS up to it's clear we are seeing just a portion of what's going on behind
the scenes cuz they're coming down they're doing things and they're taking off and we don't hear about it we only
of course hear about what Witnesses are able to see so who knows maybe they were
there to pick plants or pick somebody up hard to say it's pure speculation they
were clearly there for a reason and apparently there for a while because there were so many sightings in that
area at that time and now we move to another case this one is really
interesting it is a multiple witness case it's got some really compelling Landing trace evidence as well I call
this one the dumbbell ETS I gave it that title because the shape of the object
was described as dumbbell shaped very unusual this could be a matter of
perspective hard to say for sure it occurred on October 24
1976 in hbling France and I think you'll find it a very compelling case this case
received considerable attention from investigators and was published in both Publications lumier Donan
and hypotheses extraterrestrial the primary witness is Romeo lucarelli and was around 10:30
p.m. on the evening of October 24 1976 and Romeo and his young daughter
were returning from the village of Hest France to their home in hbling they had
just visited some friends and now were going home they had driven about a half
mile when he noticed two oddl looking lights ahead of him now these were off
in the distance and he thought at first it might be a car parked up on a hill he didn't think too much of it he continued
to drive normally but kept his eye on these lights and as he got closer he
realized that this wasn't a car these lights were actually a craft of some kind hovering in the air and as he
watched it actually zigzagged from the right side of the road to the left and it could see that yes this was a large
craft about 50 ft long s shaped kind of like a dumbbell two circles with a
rectangular structure in the center now it was flashing a multitude of colored
lights and as Romeo says when I started to go up the road I saw that the machine
was hanging there and not moving so getting close to it he now
could see that this was in fact a UFO he was absolutely amazed as he says I never
would have thought that it would happen to me frankly I was afraid now his young
daughter was sleeping at the time so he quickly woke her up told her to hang on tight as he was going to have to drive
real fast and as Romeo says at the moment when I passed by them they were
still hanging about 100 m high and about 100 to 150 M on the left side now they
began to follow me so this really frightened him and he continued to race
down the road until he reached a forested area where he thought he might have some protection as he says there I
slowed down I said to myself that maybe here I will be calmer and they can't land because of the trees because I
immediately imagined that they were looking for something so I slowed down
maybe to 30 or 40 an hour and a few seconds later I started again at full
speed and then there they come out of the forest it really looked like they
were following me and then they started to descend with their aircraft now it was then that Romeo and
his daughter could both see two figures inside who appeared to be maneuvering to
control their strange craft as Romeo says in his own words they were leaning
forward and then naturally as I saw that I started flashing my headlights because
I was driving quite fast and then I saw that they were coming towards me and stood in front of me I then saw in the
middle of the device a screen lit very dimly by an orange light which came from
inside the machine and immediately after this light Two Silhouettes appeared in
this rectangle as if to look at me I understood that they wanted to land in
front of me but they didn't have the opportunity because then there was the village so he was approaching his home
at this point he said one of the figures appeared to be standing the other was sitting down in what looked like some
kind of chair Romeo's daughter also observed this confirmed it with
investigators they both saw that the one sitting in the armchair appeared to be
maneuvering the craft using a thin stick with a sort of blue ball at the end of
it now she did say that one of the figures appeared to have dark hair and a beard Romeo did not notice this he at
this point of course was approaching the village and his house and as he did this
object shot away and he told himself that he was now free of them and he pulled into his driveway his wife came
out to greet him as she normally would and it was at this same moment that the UFO in fact returned and now was
hovering not far above their garage and as Romeo said to his wife there's the
machine there it followed me I was all trembling and all white he said now his
wife seeing this thing said it's not possible and Romeo replied yes it
followed me up here and I'll just let Romeo describe what happened next as Romeo says so she
looked up for a minute or two with me and then I said go get the binoculars so
I can see what it is up close so she comes in takes the binoculars at the
same same time as she came out the machine began to move forward very
slowly then I took the binoculars while I was about to fix on the device they
turned off the light and we just heard a little noise a rather dull hum it was a
noise I could not explain to you so this was a weird noise that he had never
heard before but as they watched this object then flashed a big white light in
the center of it and it moved slowly off into the distance so the next day he
decides he's going to return to the field where he first saw this object and he didn't in fact find three Landing
traces which were very unusual they were sort of composed of two tangential
double Circles of crushed grass each about 50 ft wide it looked to him like
the craft had slid along the ground before coming to arrest now it was just a few weeks later
that Romeo did speak with you UFO researchers they could see that he was still quite shaken up by the experience
they went with him to the location where this object was first seen and they saw the landing traces as well they spoke
with the police who confirmed that Romeo was intelligent and well balanced and
the police did a little bit of an investigation uh they did confirm that
Romeo and his wife and daughter did apparently see something but they did
try to explain away the sighting they said that perhaps Romeo had seen a tractor on a hill and that the Figures
were actually two men in the transparent tractor cabin because it turns out there
was a tractor in the area at the time but they apparently just ignored Romeo's
description of the multicolored lights the fact that this object was hovering in the sky the fact that it followed him
home that it was making an unusual low buzzing noise that it disappeared and
reappeared and hovered over the garage and so forth so that appears to be a pretty ridiculous debunking
explanation and it sounds like a really wellc confirmed sighting of a UFO and
humanoids I have to say that made me laugh when the police tried to explain
this case away as a tractor being reflected into the sky which is
ridiculous considering that the husband and the wife and the daughter all saw
the thing hovering right over their garage it followed them home they got a very clear look at it clearly not a
tractor and the police themselves said that the witness is an intelligent and
honest person but it's a good case thoroughly researched Landing traces as
well that have yet to be explained so it's hard to dismiss this case which I
think is why it's worthy of attention and certainly being included in this little
compilation and now we move to another another really compelling case I call
this one it didn't seem like a normal person this is in most respects a single
witness case though there were other people there they were apparently government folks this is an interesting
case because it points towards these craft being reverse engineered so that alone is very
important people do need to know that we have to some extent gotten our hand on
ET technology the military has and our reverse engineering it so not everything
people see in the sky is necessarily ET you can make up your own mind about this
one it's got some really interesting elements to it that I think Point towards at least one of these craft
being truly ET it occurred on January 21st 1977 in kamui Puerto Rico lot of stuff
going on there that's quite unusual so really interesting case this case comes
from longtime and prolific researcher Jorge Martin and it does involve a
single Witness by the name of Juan Pedro Hernandez it was 1:30 a.m. on the
evening of January 21st 1977 as Juan was driving from kamui to
mayz in Puerto Rico when he noticed an unusually brilliant star-like object
which You Could See Clearly wasn't a star because suddenly it started to descend towards him he had just crossed
over the bridge over the camui river when he saw that this light was now no
more than a half mile away and what had been a brilliant white light now changed to a vivid violet
color and then to turquoise blue and you could see now it wasn't just a light but
in fact a solid craft very large about 800 ft wide and 500 ft long he got out
of his car to take a real close look at it and as Juan says it was vast enormous
it was triangular and was now down to a height of about 80 to 100 ft above me I
could see lights on it a row of iridescent lights as well as others that
were changing color all of the time in sequence red yellow blue white on top it
had a Koopa inside of which I could see the silhouette of a person and it didn't
seem like a normal person but tall slender with a strangely shaped head
like a pear large in the upper part and small below at the Jaws the light was
strong enough for me to see his eyes which were big and dark so this sounds
very much like a gray onean was curious but frightened and his emotions became
stronger when this craft did something that affected him him personally as Juan
says suddenly from the top part the Koopa came a beam of light that shown on
me it wasn't like the light of a torch a flashlight which becomes dispersed as it came down gradually it
was controlled and keeping its shape contained within itself and it enveloped
me I was still standing there looking at the being in the coupa and now I felt a
sensation of vast peace a Tranquility such as I have never known before so
clearly this is not a normal light this beam of light remained on him for a full
three minutes he estimates now he got a good look at the bottom of the craft and he saw it looked like six to eight
blades moving rotating very slowly no sound whatsoever was audible this craft
then withdrew the beam of light from him and it started to move slowly away now
Juan very interested hopped back into his car and tried to follow it but he
hadn't gone more than 20 ft when the road ahead of him was blocked by a black
van with darkened windows so ju came out of his car walked up and asked why the
road was blocked a man dressed totally in Black came out and one asked him if he was
seeing what he would what one had seen and the man replied enigmatically if
you're seeing it or not seeing it is of no interest to me and he then told onean
threateningly to stop following it or else something might happen to him but
onean was not to be deterred and the man shouted again at him you aren't going to follow it and
that's that but still undeterred Juan walked up to the van peered directly
inside and he could see three other men all dressed in black and in the back of
this van he saw what looked like radar equipment which he was familiar with he could see the screens and what
apparently were blips on the screen showing this UFO and what looked like two other craft approaching and sure
enough right on Q two other craft did in fact appear now these looked very much
like the first one he had just seen which Shone a beam a light on him except these craft were very noisy the first
craft which was still visible a short distance away now lit up with a brilliant violet light which obscured
the fact that it was a craft now appeared to be just a ball of violet light and it darted upwards at super
high speed in only seconds becoming a tiny point of light Among the
Stars now when this happened the other two craft veered off and per one they
were leaving a trail of smoke soan believes that this first craft was
actually extraterrestrial piloted by ETS but the other two he thinks were
probably reverse engineered military craft and as onean says they are trying
to present themselves to the public as being them the ETS and trying to show
the public that those other folk the supposed extraterrestrials are bad coming to devour us to inflict damage
all in order to create a false image of what those other personages or whatever they are can be I have to give kudos to
Juan for Having the courage not only to report his sighting but to really confront these government agents
apparent government agents in the way that he did I also found it really interesting how he describes when he was
struck by this beam of light he felt this incredible peace and Tranquility this is a detail I've heard in many
other accounts and I think points towards that being an actual ET craft
but the other ones no they sound like government reverse engineered to me that's certainly what the witness
thought I found his interpretation of what's going on here very interesting
because there is a lot of talk about false flag and governments pushing a ET
Invasion portraying ETS as malevolent so you can make up your own minds about it
but I thought it was an important case and now we move to another one which is super fascinating to me I call this one
the UFO gnome the description of the ETS in this case is really interesting
because it some in some ways parallels the many reports we have of fairies and
gnomes and elves and other little people all across the world this is actually a
series of events which occurred through March and June of 1978 in vmar D sapri in Italy and it is
a multiple witness case it does have Landing traces it also has electromagnetic effects there's a lot to
I think confirm the validity of this case this very unusual case comes from
Italian researcher Alberto Tarico and morito verga it appeared in numerous
Publications and it involves numerous strange events over a period of months occurring primarily to 26-year-old
constantina imbio but it does also involve other Witnesses and some very
interesting evidence events began at around 5:30 p.m. starting on March 20
1978 when constantina and her husband observed a white conical object which
appeared to have orange horizontal bands and was hovering just above the ground not far from their home in viamar da
sapri this is outside of cerno Italy and as they watched this object swung around
a little bit then disappeared behind some trees and was gone but it was just
one week later on March 27 1978 that they were in their house when
suddenly all the lights went out for no apparent reason a few minutes later they came back on and acting on her intuition
constantina rushed outside and sure enough she saw this Dome shaped object
emitting a pulsating white light underneath it after just a few moments
this object moved downwards and seemed to disappear towards the ground and
after it was gone it left this strange fog or Mist which very quickly dissipated the events weren't over yet
something really interesting was about to happen because one month later on April 25 1978
events came to a climax when constantina saw a huge orange sphere hovering above
the trees behind her house now she grabbed the camera and tried to take a
picture but she was too frightened she wasn't able to do it and as she watched this sphere appeared to shrink down to a
diameter of 4 to 5 ft when she first saw it was almost the size of a house she
says but once it shrank down she says a humanoid figure came out of it and it
was strange in fact this figure reminded her of a gnome in a number of ways his
face looked mostly human but it was very bright had very thin lips he also
noticed that there was a quote conical structure or what looked like a hat on its head and he was wearing this weird
orange suit and black boots and as constantina watched this gnome likee
figure looked all around darting its head back and forth making slight
movements and then it started to move in this weird hopping around she said had very thin Limbs and was hopping in this
way that reminded her again of a gnome meanwhile this sphere continued to
shrink until it completely disappeared this little being continued to hop around at one point coming as close as
150 ft to constantina and it looked right at her so at this point she became
quite frightened and called her husband immediately the being squatted behind a truck quote disappearing in a slight fog
which persisted a few seconds so unfortunately her husband did not come out in time to see this gnome likee
being but events weren't quite over yet just over one month later on June 9
1978 constantina saw three strangely shaped objects which were hovering very
close to the ground and on impulse she set out a telepathic
message thinking to herself if you hear me disappear she looked again and the
objects were gone but the next day she and her husband and others did go out to this
area and they saw that the grass where one of these objects had been was now yellowed and it was in the same shape of
the object itself later that month constantina had another sighting she said she saw no
less than 15 disc-shaped objects descend from the sky land very quickly on a
nearby Hill and then take off again leaving this fog which dissipated
quickly she reported also seeing smaller blue orbs about a half foot in diameter
she said on one occasion she saw one of these orbs which actually touched the branch of an olive tree causing the
leaves to shrivel and dry up and that's the extent of it but perhaps related to
Constantino's UFO gnome like being is this remarkably similar humanoid
sighting which occurred get this only 2 days earlier on April 23rd
1978 this is also in Italy but in a town of Sero which is to the north not far in
terms of how fast a UFO can fly now this case was investigated by
researcher Moreno tambellini and on that evening numerous Witnesses reported
seeing a V formation of glowing objects fly over the city but it was later that
same evening cesarina Campion was getting ready for bed when she noticed a
strange glowing light in her backyard looking outside to investigate
she saw two 3ft tall figures which were wearing shiny metallic loose-fitting
clothes an outfit that covered their entire body she said that they had a
dark belt around their waists and also wore sort of a pointy con shaped hat or
helmet with a visor where the face would be so very much like what the previous
witness constantina saw now cesarina's curiosity turned to fear when she heard
these weird beings speaking out loud with this sort of guttural metallic
sounding unintelligible language and she says they also moved around with strange
Leaps and Bounds very much like constantina had described so they bounded around and finally disappeared
into a nearby Olive Grove such a weird case that one it's amazing that the
witnesses described these ETS apparent ETS in such similar detail as being
short and having these pointed hats and bouncing around like gnomes definitely
makes you wonder about the earlier reports throughout history of other little people perhaps these were
misinterpreted as being gnomes or fairies when in fact they were ETS or perhaps there's something else
going on here hard to say but I think this is why research is so important
because it will hopefully lead to the truth coming out and further clarification on what is going on here
on planet Earth now let's move to the next case which is incredibly interesting I like
this one it's another example of an ET crossing the road in front of a car at
night so again that seems to be a pattern we see quite often I call this one an 8ot tall gray it certainly seems
like this is what the witness is describing this one is fairly recent occurring on July 31st 2018 just north
of Mount Vernon in Ohio and it's a good case although it is a single witness
case the witness himself is a trained Observer a military officer has a top
secret clearance I think this makes him a good witness the case was also
researched by an experienced muon field investigator so he himself interviewed
the witness firsthand went to the site so it looks like this is an absolutely legitimate case but wow what an
unusually disg cribed humanoid this very bizarre humanoid sighting was researched
by Ohio based Mutual UFO Network field investigator Ron
mclone the witness reported his case to muan he's requested anonymity but he
says that on the evening of July 31st 2018 he was driving along Ohio State
Route 13 which is a couple of miles north of Mount Vernon in Ohio when he
saw what he first thought was a deer walking across the road but he quickly
realized this could not be a deer as it was walking upright and was clearly
bipedal and in fact he said that this being had a quote a tall slender body
arms and legs small in diameter hands and feet that looked oversized for its
body proportion a small neck with an oval elongated
head he further described this being is having a dark tan or brownish skin a
bald head no visible body hair black eyes no apparent nose a small mouth and
four fingers on each hand but most amazing was that this figure was
somewhere between 7 to 8 ft tall he said he watched it come out of a corn field
walk across the highway and actually Traverse the whole width of the highway in only two or three strides
and he said that it moved very quickly at quote a tremendous rate of speed and
off into a soybean field and I'll just let the witness describe this in his own words as he says I noticed the creature
in my headlights from 50 to 75 ft away as I was traveling at a rate of 55 to 60
MPH as it came out of the corn field I immediately let off the accelerator the
creature slightly turned its head towards my vehicle headlights and I saw the creature's black eyes and small
mouth just open slightly as it continued to cross the road I was in total shock
and I thought I should check it out at first but then I thought for a second and being uncertain of what I may have
just seen I had better get out of the area I lost sight of the entity due to
Darkness although he only saw this for a few moments he was absolutely convinced he saw something extraterrestrial there
was no way this thing was human given its appearance so he reported this encounter to the mutual UFO Network and
he was put in touch with field investigator Ron mclone who conducted an interview returned to the sighting
location with the witness to look for any evidence unfortunately no evidence
was found but the researcher Ron mclone did say that the witness appeared to be
a quote credible witness and in in fact turns out the witness is a
24-year USAF retired Air crew veteran
who has a top secret clearance so clearly a good witness and in his report
to muon he wrote would somebody please advise me on what I have seen because it
still and truly frightened me when people talk about gray yeah they usually say oh maybe 3 feet four 5et even 6 feet
I've heard s ft as well but it's rare that you get one s or 8T tall there are
cases they're somewhat of outliers but I don't know it's a really unusual case this guy did not see a
craft that itself again is Not Unusual as we've seen in this compilation there's a number of cases of people
seeing these weird humanoids and no UFO no craft was seen so hard to say what exactly is
going on here maybe the UFO is off there in the distance we don't know but
there's always another case and here's the last one in this little collection which is really compelling I was a bit
on the fence about this one but the more I investigated it the more it seemed absolutely credible to me I like it
because this gentleman actually did capture photographs of the UFO he saw
not the humanoid unfortunately but wow it's a really bizarre case and very Rec
I call this one I saw something I will never forget this occurred on July 16
20120 not that long ago in Warwick England and the poor witness while he
did have the courage to come forward suffered a lot of disbelief and ridicule
about it his case did get National headlines I'm really glad he did come
forward we don't hear about the huge majority of cases like this so kudos to
him for coming forward and sharing his story the witness in this remarkable case is a young man by the name of Paul
froggit he's 26 years old at the time of his encounter and it was 500 a.m. on
July 16 2020 as Paul was riding his bicycle to his home in Warwick this is in West
Midlands England he had just worked a 12h hourong night shift at his job in a
dog food factory and he of course had no idea that he was about to have an
experience that would earn National headlines and alter the course of his life forever and it started with a
simple UFO sighting as Paul says in his own words it was a glowing orange sphere
just hovering on the horizon at first I thought it must be Venus or a satellite but it seemed to be
much closer than either of these things I stopped on my way to take some photos
the object looked looked a fair bit bigger in person than is visible in the photos this is when the object started
to move around and rotate in shape I could see it was circular with a part sticking out from the main body when
this started I got chilled on my back and felt like there was something wrong
here I hurried on my way home as I kept cycling I could swear the object was
moving along my course but I just told myself it must be some kind of optical
illusion now Paul's encounter was now about to move from a simple sighting a
close encounter of the first kind to direct contact with an alien entity a
close encounter of the Third Kind now his path on his bicycle now took him to
a wooded area known as Oakwood and blacklow spinny this is a Warwickshire
Wild Life Trust area and as Paul says in his own words I
entered a wooded area and lost sight of the object through the trees usually at
this time of the morning there is a chorus of bird song and insects but the
woods were dead silent as I cycled down the path I came around a bend and I saw
something I will never forget standing a few meters ahead is what I can only
describe as a humanoid praying mantis this thing was at least 7 ft tall
light green with a triangular head and big black oval eyes it had all the
features of a mantis but stood on two legs and had a somehow humanlike shape
about it I was completely Frozen with fear for what felt like an age but was
probably only a few seconds I stared into this creature's eyes and it stared
back I felt like it could read my mind and I could read its my fear was repl
with completely alien thoughts of utter hatred and evil I felt projected from
this thing I suddenly snapped out of this hypnotic kind of state and it made
a step back as if it was going to pounce on me it sounds crazy but I felt I could
sense its feelings towards me and it was just like pure alien hatred you know
when you're watching a David Attenborough documentary and you see a spider eating a fly and just a
malevolent sense of evil so this is what Paul sensed he was
actually shaking with fear he began to cry but he was able to break free from
this mental hypnotic grip at which point this creature apparently disappeared
Paul raced home he was unharmed but thoroughly emotionally traumatized
physically he was fine but following this he began having a lot of trouble sleeping at night he was having
nightmares he did decide to share his experience with his fellow fellow co-employees at work this might have
been a mistake because they ridiculed him mercilessly actually began to call
him the Mantis man of Warwick it got so bad he actually had to quit his job now
finally Paul did decide to share his story with the media despite those who
disbelieve and ridicule him Paul insists that this incident truly did take place
that he was not drinking or on drugs and he does have the photographs to prove that he did see something now he
hopes that someone else will come forward and confirm that they saw a UFO
in that area on that night that's one of the reasons he came forward so yeah Paul
although he remains alone with this story he's sticking to it and it's certainly sticking to him because yeah
this did get National headlines it was published in the newspaper and he says that for him the
Alien Invasion has already begun cuz he's still having nightmares about being on board a craft being examined not only
by praying mantis but short little Grays now if he's had any prior
encounters or anything after this he's apparently learned to keep quiet about it and who can blame him I think you'll
agree that's a pretty interesting event and what's fascinating about it is
although he felt that this was not really a benevolent encounter nothing
actually happened to him he wasn't harmed he was just thoroughly frightened by the encounter unless of course there
was missing time which is a possibility given that he's had dreams of being on board following this experience but the
poor guy I mean the ridicule he suffered is absolutely unfair uh with people saying such things
as he's eating too much dog food or he's on drug drugs or he just got too tired
and dreamt up the whole thing I mean he suffered the full range of ridicule which is really has no place in UFO
research as Jay Allen heinik himself said but certainly a case that's worthy
of attention so that's it for today I want to thank you all for watching I truly
appreciate it I find this subject endlessly fascinating there are so many human accounts ' got so much we can
learn about them uh about what is out there in the universe and really about
ourselves how we react to something that's unknown and many other things
these cases definitely do have to teach us so that's it for today humanoids from
all over the world reaching back decades to pretty much the present day those who are skeptical well I understand it I was
once a skeptic but I hadn't examined the evidence and I'm convinced if anyone has the courage to examine the evidence
objectively not through the lens of their own belief system but actually taking a look at the evidence and trying
to account for it you will only come away convinced that something very profound is going on here so thanks
again that's it for now I will see you next week but until then keep searching
for answers they're out there keep searching for the truth it's up to you to find it but most important of all
keep having fun cuz if you're not having fun what are you doing see you next time guys bye
