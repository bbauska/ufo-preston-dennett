May 31, 2024
With nearly a million reported and documented UFO encounters, it is clear that we are not alone in this universe. ETs are visiting our planet, and people all over the world are encountering humanoids of many different kinds. This video presents ten super-strange cases of humanoid encounters, many with multiple witnesses and compelling evidence. Face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials provide important insights into the UFO phenomenon and answer many of the questions surrounding this subject.

POLICE OFFICERS SEE LANDED UFO AND HUMANOIDS. At 1am one evening in January 1956, French gendarmes (Henri Barboule and Msr Simon) were in Barre-des-Cevennes, France, when they heard a deafening roar. Looking up, they saw a flying saucer pass overhead and land a short distance away. As the craft released a probe, four humanoids exited the craft. Both officers were paralyzed with fear.

UFO LANDS IN CITY PARK. Around 9:30 pm on the night of December 9, 1962, driver/waiter Antonio Candau was walking to his home near Bologna, Italy when he saw a flying saucer land nearby. He watched in awe as two olive-skinned human-looking men wearing yellow jumpsuits exited. The two men approached him, speaking a strange language and gesturing to him. The experience changed Antonio’s life.

FOLLOWED BY A UFO. One night in January 1973, five people were driving near Nowra, NSW, Australia when a UFO appeared and began pacing their car. One of the passengers was shocked to see humanoid figures looking out at him through the portholes. The craft followed their vehicle for many miles, before suddenly darting away. The next morning, one of the witnesses would have another encounter.

THE CLUMSY ROBOT. Early in the morning of July 10, 1976, Miguel Angel Ruiz Samperio, and his friend, Margarita Cagigas were getting ready to car-pool to work when they saw a strange figure walking down the street of their home town of Escalante, Spain. To their shock, it looked robotic and was at least nine feet tall. After walking off, it disappeared. They later learned that other people saw it too.

ALIENS AT THE FRONT DOOR. On the night of July 11, 1978, “Amalia,” was in her home in Alta da Mooca, Brazil when she heard a thump and a strange buzzing noise, her dog began to bark, and her TV filled with static. Opening the door, she was confronted by two short humanoids and a landed UFO behind them. She was paralyzed as the figures shone strange lights around and returned to their craft, which took off, leaving Amalia utterly shocked.

UFO LANDS AT SUGAR-CANE FARM. Late at night on April 26, 1979, farmer Mamerto Demetillo was woken up by light filling his home in Talisay, the Philippines. Rushing outside, he saw three flying saucers landing next to his farm. He watched as two human-looking figures exited each craft, and examined the area. After 20 minutes, they returned inside the craft which took off, leaving landing traces. At the time, there was a wave of sightings in the area.

THE MOST REMARKABLE THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. One night in the fall of 1989, shortly after reading some UFO books, an anonymous witness saw a UFO outside her home near the Apalachicola Forest in Florida. Suddenly, a glowing sphere emerged from the craft and entered through her window. An eight-foot-tall figure appeared. The witness fainted and for 2 years, forgot the encounter.

YOU ARE ME. On the night March 9, 1992, two women were driving to their homes in Hamar, Norway when a saucer with two short humanoids hovered in front of their car. They both experienced missing time. Later that night, one of the witnesses, Gry Jannicke Jarlum, was visited at her home. She remained in contact with the ETs who began to teach her volumes of profound information, completely changing her life forever.

A ROADSIDE GRAY. While driving to his home in Cary, Illinois one evening in March 1995, an anonymous man was shocked to see a short strange-looking figure alongside the road. Thinking it was the victim of a car accident, he slowed down, and was amazed to see a short figure with a large bald head, huge dark oval eyes, and pale white skin. It was not human, and the witness drove off in shock.

THE MEN IN THE SKY. On the night of April 26, 2009, a man in his home in Bad Neuenahr, Germany noticed a brilliant light in the sky. He watched it approach, revealing itself to be a multi-colored rectangular craft with numerous portholes. And through the portholes he saw the silhouettes of several figures looking out at him from only 100 feet away. He was convinced it was a genuine UFO, and watched as it flew slowly away.

Ten super-strange alien encounters from all over the world! And there are so many more. How many cases are needed to prove to the world that we are not alone? Earth is being visited by extraterrestrials of many kinds. The truth can no longer be denied, covered up or explained away. The evidence speaks for itself.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is called Not Alone 10 super strange alien encounters I love encounters
involving humanoids they're endlessly fascinating there's so many different types it's been occurring for such a
long time coming from all over the world and that's of course what I want to talk about today I've got cases dating all
the way back to 1956 up to 2009 and again from a wide number of
geographical areas including Australia France Italy Norway Spain
Germany the Philippines actually Brazil and of course the United States many
different types of ETS the typical Grays tall humanoids short little humanoids
even robotic type figures human looking ETS many many different kinds now most
of these are pretty extensive encounters with some interaction several do have
multiple Witnesses and of course many types of really interesting and I think
compelling evidence including Landing traces certainly physiological effects
animal reactions electromagnetic disturbances and more I think the most
consistent feat feature that is present in pretty much every single case is that
the witnesses themselves are affected profoundly often for the rest of their lives yeah that's very consistent I
think each of these cases is important because they provide insights into the
nature and origin of this phenomena UFOs
and extraterrestrials and I know there are different types of entities out there but I do think the cases that I'm
presenting here do involve extraterrestrials in the classic sense people like us but from other planets
and simply my assessment Others May disagree I know there are Skeptics out there but think about this I've
presented probably close to a thousand humanoid encounters just on this channel alone
that's a lot and this these 10 cases here are just the tip of the iceberg
there's plenty more where these came from so yeah I mean you might be
skeptical of some of these but there's always more cases and I've said it many times to me the best evidence is the
fact that there are so many cases and they're remarkably consistent in detail
I find the commonalities just as interesting as the differen is but yeah
a lot of cases uh some are multiple witness cases some are single witness
cases but there are so many of them and
and this is going to be a fairly long episode so let's just get started and the first case I want to cover I call
police officers C landed UFO and humanoids this is a really fascinating
case it's quite unusual quite extensive it occurred in January of
1956 in a little village in France called bar de
s and it's unusual in many ways I like
it because it does have physical evidence to support it and multiple Witnesses and it's just a really
interesting series of events this first case comes from French researcher jeene
chod it was 1 amm is two je these are French police officers they were pushing
their bikes up a hill located at bar de seen these officers included HRI barbul
and his partner mure now it had been an eventless night until
just about at the crest of the hill this hill is called lau and this is near a small barn that
the two officers had stopped when they heard a loud noise approaching they
first thought it was a truck coming up the hill that they had just hiked up with their bikes and wanting to mark
their passage in their log books they leaned their bikes up against the wall of this barn and waited for what they
thought was a truck to arrive but as this noise grew louder it became much too loud to be a truck and it actually
seemed to be coming from above when suddenly just 10 or 20 ft above the ground and about 150 ft away from them a
strange craft appeared they said it was about 30 ft wide maybe 4T High circular
in shape black in color and it was emitting reddish Flames from openings
located along the bottom section and as it passed by them they could see that the Flames were coming from what
appeared to be little nozzles and one of them cried out it's a saucer so they leaned against the wall
of the barn and they could actually feel a hot strong wind coming from the object
and was strong enough they said to almost pin them against the side of the barn and make their clothes
flutter now mure Simon put his hand down to his revolver and tried to draw it out
of the holster but at this point found that he was mysteriously paralyzed and
the other officer HRI barbul also said he was unable to move now whether this
was from fear or a physical effect they couldn't really say but they did say that their legs were shaking and both
were considerably frightened now HRI had lived through World War II and had felt considerable
fear before but he said this was different he thought of his family as the craft went overhead and wondered if
he and his fellow officer were going to be cooked like sausages from the heat of the craft so yeah he was quite
frightened the object then began to descend towards the ground and as it moved lower the bright red Flames coming
from beneath it became darker and at the same time a dome or cupula on top of the
craft began to Glow an opaque Ivory white with the glow seeming to come from
inside it now as the object actually landed on this flat section of the
nearby Field blindingly brilliant colored beams of light including green
yellow and blue came out from the base of the coupa shining in all directions
now some of these beams were brighter than others they were really bright the officers compared them to the brightness
of welding arcs meanwhile the wind coming from the object continued to blow
fiercely then suddenly it lessened the Dome itself self appeared to almost
change shape as a white sphere detached from the craft coming from between the
Dome and the base where the beams of light were being emitted they didn't see exactly how it came out of the craft but
it was just there illuminated by the colored beams and now floating next to the craft it wasn't super big about the
size of a basketball or so maybe a little larger but this sphere itself glowed a soft Ivory white color the same
color the Dome of the craft and it then proceeded to move at an angle to their left then moved in a straight line at
only a few miles per hour towards the nearby mountain of Castle now to their amazement this
sphere began to actually circle around the mountain itself disappearing behind it and coming around the other
side as it did this the two officers noticed something else as soon as this
white ball began to move around the mountain they both noticed four large dark humanoid figures standing next to
the craft they did not see them come out they were just suddenly there and these
figures began to walk around the craft as if inspecting it in fact they walked around it several times moving slowly as
if looking for something meanwhile the glowing sphere made a second revolution around the
mountain reappeared and went towards the machine passing pretty close to the two
officers about 150 ft away they said it was totally silent they quickly
re-entered the craft as mysteriously as it had come out of it and as the sphere
entered the craft the strange humanoids also disappeared presumably into the craft though the officers couldn't say
for sure seconds later the brilliant beams of light and the glowing Cupa were
extinguished this hot wind coming from the craft began to blow again and the deafening noise increased and the this
object Rose vertically and then accelerated extremely quickly away so fast they
could barely track it as it disappeared into the night sky now they were still afraid after the object left they
quickly got on their bikes feeling some pain in their muscles and they left the area they felt no other physical effects
however enri barbu did say that the watch he was wearing at the time of the incident had stopped working and he took
it to a watchmaker who asked him a very curious question he asked barbul if he
had worn it while he was under an x-ray which of course he hadn't uh he tried to fix the watch but
it never did work again the two officers did report the incident to their Superior who actually went to the spot
and did an investigation and they discovered that several people in the town that night had heard this loud
roaring noise now the hill that the UFO wasn't expecting does have an interesting geological aspect to it it
is very rich in Granite and quartz so that's the kind of case I think that's
really hard to deny I mean we have two police officers of excellent
credibility we have physiological effects and electromagnetic effects some
really good evidence here also I find it interesting that the UFOs showed
particular interest in this area geographically speaking
there must have been something about this mountain that they were interested in to send a probe circling it not once
but twice it's a really unusual case and now we move to another one which is
equally fascinating I think this one is a single witness case I call this one
UFO lands in City Park this occurred on December 9 1962 in balona it Italy and
while it is a single witness case there are some apparent Landing traces and it's just a fascinating case because
this UFO landed in a fairly Urban location this single witness case comes
from Italian researchers Pao fiorino and Gian Paulo grino and it was published in
the Italian UFO publication revista D informasion
eup so the main witness is Antonio can da he's a 27-year-old driver and waiter
and he had gone to the movies but decided not to go to the movies and went instead to a little restaurant and it
was around 9:30 p.m. that he left and began to walk along via kadva this is a
treelined Avenue by the San Michelle Park in bosow near bolognia Italy very
close to the Orthopedic Institute of rizoli and actually the site of military
Barracks where ant IO himself had served prior in the military it was a cool clear evening
again December 9 1962 there was little traffic pedestrian or automobiles and
after about 15 minutes of walking Antonio heard a strange hissing sound
and looking towards the park he was surprised to see a strange craft of quote fairly large shape like a deep
plate he said with a dome on top and was covered with rotating multicolored
lights they reminded him of ambulance lights now this object was descending
from the sky and clearly coming in for a landing just on the other side of a
fence Antonio was frightened by the sight naturally and instinctively stepped back and hid behind a tree and
as this object landed he peered at it from behind the tree and could see that
it was about 30 ft wide metallic it had a silvery gold appearance he said he
couldn't see the base of it from his Vantage Point as there were some bushes and very small trees in front of it now
he could see that it had no Port holes or markings of any kind it was just these spinning lights and this loud
hissing noise decreased to a very soft but still audible level then suddenly
right below the Dome a doorway opened gradually from top to bottom and at this
point Antonio could see that it was well lit inside this doorway opening and he
saw the Silhouettes of two people standing there as he watched a small small ladder-like staircase of about six
or seven steps went down from the base of the doorway to the ground and the two
figures immediately stepped down from the now open doorway down the steps
moving side by side in synchronous motion Antonio could see that they were
about 5T tall human looking though that they did have dark olive colored skin
short dark hair and very reflective eyes he said they were both we wearing tight
fitting jumpsuits of a quote beautiful yellow color there were no markings of
any kind on them except for a large dark belt at hip level and this belt held a
small rectangular box along their hips so Antonio was amazed he stepped
out from behind the tree and just stood Ed and at this point both of the strange men looked at him and the man on the
right spoke a few words out loud in a strange language and then extended his
arm and pointed his index finger at Antonio now Antonio could speak a few
languages he was familiar with of course Italian but also French English and
Russian and he said the language that they spoke was none of these but he did have the impression that they were
asking him a question of some kind but not knowing what it was he didn't answer
he did notice strange Shadows of movement in the doorway behind the two beings but couldn't say what it was from
at this point these two strange men kind of looked at each other turned around
simultaneously and climbed back up the steps walking into the craft still synchronous side by side the door closed
and immediately the object began to rise slowly from the ground making that same loud hissing noise that Antonio had
heard upon its arrival this object Rose slowly about 10
to 300 ft straight up and then very quickly darted away at a right angle
heading Southwest towards the church of San Michel in Bosco now as it darted away Antonio ran
down the Avenue via kadva hoping to see where this object went but it was gone
and he says the whole experience lasted about 2 or 3 minutes now at this point he did see a car going
by and he considered flagging it down to see if they had seen anything but
fearing he would be disbelieved if he told them about his experience he decided not to he continued walking to
the trolley bus and then went home and although he did go to bed he said he was so shaken by his experience that he was
unable to sleep at all that night so the next day he went to work and he told his employer about the
encounter and his employer seemed very open to it said he had heard about flying saucers but advised Antonio not
to tell anyone as the reaction might be negative he did say to look to the
newspapers for any corroboration or other reports unfortunately Antonio couldn't
find any corroboration in the newspapers but about a week and a half after the encounter still unable to get it out of
his mind he returned to the spot of the landing and saw what looked like impressions in the grass but when he
checked a few weeks later these Impressions were no longer noticeable so he didn't really talk
about it until about 24 years later when he still couldn't get out of his mind
and decided to report it to UFO researchers who did find him to be sincere and of sound mind Antonio did
say that the encounter affected him deeply and ignited a strong interest in the subject of UFOs which would remain
for many years yes this is a single witness case largely resting upon one
person's anecdotal testimony with some apparent Landing traces which unfortunately weren't investigated at
the time of the encounter but the encounter itself was researched by professional investigators I think that
lends a level of credibility to it but what I find super fascinating about this
case is not only the location this craft Landing in an urban area but the fact
that this saucer comes down these ETS come out say a few words to the witness and off they go back inside their craft
and it takes off there's quite a few cases like this where they just come down say basically hi to the witness and
off they go it's very odd but so many cases like this and here is yet another
case it's incredible to me how many cases there are of humanoids and this one is quite unusual
I call this one followed by a UFO this occurred in January
1973 near NAA Australia this is a really interesting case because it is quite lengthy in
terms of duration and there are four Witnesses at least one who is a military
officer and they were followed by this UFO for quite some time one of them
insists he saw a humanoid inside this craft and this particular witness is in
fact a military officer and this case also has a very interesting aftermath to it this unusual
multiple witness case comes from Australian researcher Bill Chalker and was presented in his book The Oz files
there were five witnesses the main reporting witness being Elizabeth
C now they were driving along the south coast of New South Wales nearby the town
of NAA again in Australia it was late one dark evening
in January of 1973 and they had just driven past the turnoff to the Sussex Inlet when
Elizabeth noticed a strange light ahead she thought at first that it might be an approaching semi-truck but it seemed to
move to the left and approach the car more like an aircraft than an
automobile so she immediately alerted the others in the car to its presence
and at this point it still looked like a single bright light light but then
suddenly the object reversed direction 180° and came very close to the car and
to the ground and began to actually Pace their vehicle they could now see that it
was a pretty large craft saucer shaped with round edges a dome on top and a
smaller Dome on the bottom and they can see that the bright light was actually coming from a light source on the center
bottom Dome they could also see about 10 round Port holes lining the perimeter of
this saucer-shaped craft these Port holes were glowing with light and underneath the port holes
there were thin ribbons of red light the light on the bottom was sending down a
quote search light type beam that rotated continuously one of the passengers was
an army officer and his position in the car afforded him the best view of this
object and he said that looking through the port holes he clearly saw a figure inside of it multiple figures in fact
now this craft followed the car down the highway for the next 15 miles finally
near the turnoff to the hmas albatross Naval Base the object
seemed to vanish and looking around they saw that it had actually instantly moved
to a very high altitude they did not see it do it it just suddenly appeared much
higher up and it was now moving in a large Arc see to circle around the town
of NAA and then moving out to seea disappearing off into the distance and
that was the end of the sighting but events weren't over yet because later
that morning one of the group was camping at schol Haven heads when he and
a group of campers actually were gathered at the Ocean's Edge in order to
watch a group of helicopters that appear to be chasing this fiery glowing object
head out to see now three of the witnesses to the initial sighting decided that they were
going to report their encounter to the military at the hmas Naval Base they
were afraid of being laughed at or disbelieved but to their amazement the
Military Officers at the base did in fact show a deep interest in their encounter and conducted an indepth
interview with all three of them and Military Officers told them that there
had been other Witnesses and that the object had been detected on their
radar now the army officer witness said that when he returned to his unit he was
interviewed Again by Intelligence Officers Bill Chalker the main
investigator interviewed Elizabeth and the army officer and as he says and I
quote I found them to be impressive and compelling witnesses there seems little
doubt that something extraordinary happened but no official confirmation has been made I contacted the Navy which
denied all knowledge of the incident no surprise there but I will
say that both prior to this incident and following it this location was the area
of several other impressive UFO encounters so there's something about
this location perhaps it's the Naval Base hard to say for sure yeah there's lots to like about that case it's clear
that this UFO and the ETS inside of it were showing strong interest in these
people having followed them for many miles I think it's interesting that there was a second encounter immediately
following this one and most interesting to me was that these Witnesses did report their encounters to military
authorities who showed strong interest in it this shows to me that while our
governments made may deny the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials it is a
subject they are in fact taking quite seriously they know it's real we know they know this coverup is absurd at some
point it's got to end all right now we move to the next case which is very unusual I like this
case because it does have quite a few Witnesses who saw an apparent ET very
close up I call this one the clumsy robot this occurred on July 10
1976 in Escalante Spain and yeah multiple Witnesses who saw this very
oddl looking figure very close up and a very tall one a very tall figure so that
alone makes this case really interesting there are two witnesses two main
Witnesses in this case including Miguel Angel Ruiz samperio a 28-year-old old
electrician and his coworker Margarita kagias was 5:30 a.m. as these two
individuals who worked at a local Factory prepared to depart for their place of employment located just a few
miles away from their homes in Escalante this is in Santander
Spain now Miguel was driving the car and had gone to pick up Margarita because
for several years they car pooed and would meet at the Town Square before going to work Miguel was sitting in the
driver's seat waiting for margarita she had just arrived had her hand on the car
door and was about to enter when she was alarmed to see a gigantic humanoid
figure only about 200 or 300 ft away from her now this figure did have its
back turned to them and was walking awkwardly along the right side of the
road she could see that it was exceedingly tall as its head reached up to one of the high Windows of a home by
the road and measuring it this would give this figure a height of over 9 ft
closer to 10 now Miguel saw this all as well he
noticed it the same time as Margarita did and they were both very much impressed and I'll just let Margarita
describe in her own words what happened as she says we were going to get into the car and we noticed this monstrosity
of a pH phenomenon that was moving clumsily we were perplexed I grabbed the
car handle and didn't know how to react for a few seconds I could see him in profile he was almost in front of Ramon
ruiz's house on the road from Noya to caso in the middle of the town on the
corner of general street now they got a good look at this being they could see that its chest and
legs were shiny and white they could also see that it was moving moving rigidly slowly and cautiously kind of
reminding them of how astronauts walk on the moon now Miguel estimates The Stride
of this figure was somewhere along the lines of about 6 feet they both also
noticed that its body did not sway back and forth as a person's normally would when they walked and they wondered if
this figure might in fact be robotic now Margarita said that the
figure seemed to be floating slightly or not quite touching the ground as she says it was flying as a bird
does now this figure did not pay any attention to them did not seem to notice
them and they themselves made no movement for fear of drawing attention to
themselves they couldn't see his face but the street lights were bright enough that they could see a kind of conical
shaped bright helmet quote something like a bathtub or Basin turned upside
down they said it had looked like a silver three-pointed disc on its head
and hanging down from it was a colored quote handkerchief looking thing which
hanged down to about its shoulders they couldn't see or didn't see the hands and feet but they did
notice that the figure was extremely thin they also said it looked like it was wearing Loos looking shiny brown
colored clothes which ended at the knees the figure walked away from them down
the street and when it reached a point of about 100 to 120 ft away right before
the street curved it suddenly disappeared Into Thin Air they don't think it walked around the curve it just
disappeared both were very impressed somewhat shaken they did go to work and
their co-workers could clearly see that something profound had happened to them Angel wanted to keep silent but
Margarita shared what happened and to her dismay she was disbelieved and even
mocked ridiculed now this despite the fact that they were both married Margarita had
kids both had worked at the company for 12 years had never considered the subject of UFOs or aliens and were well
respected in their Community such a shame now investigators did interview
the witnesses and learned that the local mayor of the Town also saw the entity
and he said that luminous flashes of light were coming from its chest area
also a few days before the encounter a witness in the adjacent neighborhood had
seen an unexplained glowing red object sitting in a meadow next to her house so
this does appear to be somewhat connected and this perhaps confirmation
but as the witness says I got up to drink water and Through the Windows I saw a very powerful red light in a
meadow it scared me so much that I went to bed and after that she did not look
outside so we don't know what happened to it such an interesting case I really do wonder what kind of ET that was if it
was robotic hard to say but but so interesting because it wasn't just those two witnesses who saw it I mean the
mayor of the Town saw it as well there was a UFO landing near that area around
that time always adds another level of credibility and corroboration to a case
and just weird weird and fascinating I that's a very tall figure 9 plus feet
really unusual but there are many cases a very very tall humanoids of all
kinds and now here is another case which is really interesting this is a single
witness case doesn't have a whole lot of evidence to it other than animal
reactions and some physiological reactions I call this one aliens at the
front door this occurred on July 11 1978 in Ulta deuka Brazil and this was
an area that was really quite heavily populated so that itself is also quite
unusual the location of this incident Alta dhuka is a pretty densely populated
area of sa Paulo Brazil and this case despite being featured in several
foreign magazines is virtually unknown in the United States certainly cuz it
was just before midnight on July 11 1978 that the witness known only as
Amalia age 44 was watching TV while eating a freshly peeled Orange in her
living room and her three sons were asleep in their bedrooms when suddenly several
weird things began to occur at the same time first there was a loud thud coming
from outside second her little dog immediately began to run in circles throughout the living
room into the kitchen then to the door barking furiously thirdly the screen on her
television began to flicker in an odd way so she didn't think too much of all
this but she got up from the couch still holding an orange peel and went to the front door and as she approached the
door she noticed something else strange there was a loud quote mechanical
buzzing sound she still didn't think too much of it as she lived next to a mechanic's
Workshop but when she opened the door she got an incredible shock because
standing on either side of her doorway were two small humanoids and directly
behind them just a short distance away in the middle of her yard was a small
oval craft resting on four conical Landing legs they were thick at the top
where they were attached to the craft and thin at the bottom she said the craft itself was about 9 ft wide and 6
ft high it was dull silver with a bright silver band around the circumference and
oval Port holes around the top Dome with a yellowish light on top that was flashing multicolored
lights now this craft did have an open door through which she could see some strange instrumentation inside one of
which she said was kind of like a ball with countless moving threads giving out colored lights reminding her a little
bit of a porcupine she did see two glowing lights outside and separate from the
craft this point her dog had stop stopped barking and actually ran away
taking Refuge somewhere in the house Amalia now noticed an overpowering
oppressive silence she says it was as if she was deaf or the entire world had
become silent she described these in detail she said they were about 3 and 1/2 ft tall
very slender they wore fullbody soft looking gray jumpsuits which covered not
only their entire body but both their hands and feet it had a thick belt which
contained various small cylindrical instruments one of them she said wore a
round metallic chest plate with a light in the middle this one was a little heavier than the other one and she had
the impression it was female now they both did have overly large heads in relation to their body
and they wore metallic gray helmets which covered pretty much the entire head and the mouth leaving really only
the top part of the face visible she said a blue light shown from the forehead area of the helmet but looking
through the face plates she saw that they had tightly drawn yellowish skin
deep set round eyes which were tilted no eyebrows or lashes and a flat
nose and she also noticed one other thing they weren't quite on the ground they were hovering a few inches above
it now one of the small figures standing by the door reached out and gave her a
sort of reassuring sign to wait there while the other quickly floated across the yard to the gate looked both right
and left then glided and floated back to the front door Amalia at this point
discovered that she was unable to move her body though she could move her eyes she did manage to cross her arms over
her chest but could not move after this she could not speak out she say she also
felt a strange cold sweep over her while at the same time her entire body began
to sweat then one of the ETS reached out and patted her on the head the other
went back to the craft appearing to investigate the landing site he removed a strange device from his belt which
illuminated the ground with an unusual solid looking yellow green light he shown it briefly into the kitchen area
then the yard and finally on the craft itself this light increased and
decreased in size at intervals this figure then pulled out another device
which heitt it a kind of steam which briefly covered both the humanoids they
then motioned Amalia to come towards the craft but when she didn't move because she couldn't move they waved almost as
though to say goodbye and then entered the craft the door closed smoke or vapor
came out from beneath the craft the craft itself began to rise yellow lights
flared up on either side and the craft rose further now looking inside through
a port hole Amalia did see a third figure then the craft accelerated very quickly away and she could now detect a
strange odor somewhat like a IA in the air the entire encounter lasted she
thinks about 10 minutes Amalia now found herself able to move but she was quite
shaken up she went inside she was still struggling to talk she went to her
daughter's room and she noticed that Amalia was ice cold pale breathing
rapidly unable to talk and she in fact believed her mother might be having a heart attack Amalia had never believed
in UFOs never read anything about them and actually thought they were Pure Fantasy and while she did contact
investigators she only agreed to be interviewed upon the condition of complete anonymity so there you go
here's another case of a UFO landing in a fairly urban area et's coming out
walking up to the witness actually patted her on the head that is so strange I can only imagine what that
must have been like she like many witnesses reports being temporarily
unable to move that is a very consistent feature the appearance of the ETS has
some really remarkable commonalities as well also some unusual differences it's
all around in an interesting case and each case is kind of like a piece to the puzzle to figure out what's going on
here now here is another Super interesting case this is one of the most
extensive accounts in this little collection and man this guy has got a
close up view of these landed UFOs and apparent ETS I call this one UFO lands
at sugar cane farm this occurred on April 26
1979 in a town called Talis this is in matabang in the Philippines I think this
is the first case I've ever covered in the Philippines so I find that alone particularly interesting this case case
is also interesting because this witness was so close to the ETS observed them
for quite a long time they were really unusual in their appearance but most interesting is not only the fact that
there was Landing traces but there was a ton of witnesses this occurred during a
huge wave of sightings a lot of people were seeing UFOs at the time but this guy saw them very close up the witness
in this case is a 47-year-old farmer by the name of mamerto Deo he at the time of his encounter was
married with 10 children and was a member of the barang court to help settle disputes so a standup citizen now
we also did some work interestingly as a faith healer but it was around 400 a.m.
on April 26 1979 that mamerto woke up to go to the
bathroom and he noticed a very bright light filling the inside of his home and
looking outside he saw a bright glowing object hovering above the field of his Farmhouse again located in talles this
is in bang matabang Philippines and as mamerto says I went
outside and saw a flying object shaped like a saucer about 20 yard from the ground I followed it because it seemed
to be looking for a place to land so that's when he noticed two other
similar looking craft they were all following each other moving moving slowly clearly coming in for a landing
and he ran towards them about 600 ft away from his Farmhouse and hidden a
ditch behind some sugar cane stalks now I just want to quote mamerto extensively
and let him describe his encounter in his own words as mamerto says two of the
crafts had already landed in the road while the third one was hovering and coming into land it just gradually came
straight down near the other two and it was the one near nearest to me they were about 20 M from me it was very bright in
the area because of these objects and I was only 2 MERS or so from the lighted area I was lying on my belly watching
and then I saw doors open and two beings got out of each ship the people had to
stoop coming out and they stepped down the ladders they didn't all come out all at once but gradually the two from the
first vehicle first then two from the second and then the third I saw two
people get out of each spacecraft and form a circle they were pointing in all directions and I assumed they were
conversing and nodding their heads the craft were about 8 ft in diameter about 6 ft deep and seemed to be made of
aluminum all around the objects were very small holes where Flames came out
when they were flying but after they landed only bright light came out of them spreading like beams of a headlight
on a car each was resting on four legs about 2 ft long extended from the door
to the ground the people were wearing what looked like gray rubberized plastic
suits with brown belts black gloves and boots they were about 6 feet tall
although one was a little shorter than the rest they look like human beings but
taller and bigger they walked very slowly I thought they were Americans I
couldn't see their faces they wore helmets that covered their heads except for their eyes eyes and a visor covered
them there was also some kind of wire mesh where the ears would have been
everything they did was slow all their movements even their gesturing was much
slower than humans would do it they had to lift their feet slowly and they walked very slowly it seemed they had to
exert more effort so mamerto said that their pants
were tight fitting their shirts on the other hand seemed to be loose and had bulges on their shoulders
he said that they had belts crossed over their shoulders and what looked like thin white
backpacks he said their boots went all the way up to the knees and he saw what he thought were zippers along the side
while they seemed to be talking he heard no sound coming from them or from the craft but he did see that they were
holding strange instruments in their hands which he speculated might be weapons of some kind but as he says I
can't be sure they were guns they were white white and rectangular what seemed to be a barrel was rectangular like a
ruler and the handle was rounded then very quickly this encounter
came to an end as myto says they were there about 15 or 20 minutes I couldn't
see anything inside the craft through the doors only a brilliant light I was very worried all the time because I was
afraid they'd see me I was afraid they'd kill me or take me with them they then got back into their craft
and the ships rose up one by one and flew out of sight when they flew off I could hardly stand up because I was
shaking all over I was so afraid I was frightened and immediately ran back
home so the next morning my merto went out there and found some very
interesting Landing traces and what appeared to be Footprints as he says when it got light that morning I went
back and found marks of the landing gear maybe 5 cm deep along the edge of the
road they were like the webbed feet of a duck I also saw Footprints some 25 to 30
cm long I wanted to tell someone but I was afraid nobody' believe me I was
afraid they'd think I was insane but impressed by his encounter mamerto did notify authorities and
police captain Alberto Olio arrived interviewed mamerto and investigated The
Landing site and he notified military authorities and Colonel Paterno lomongo
arrived to investigate and he also interviewed mamerto he was very impressed by his
report and said quote I'm not saying that what he said is really true but considering the circumstances it is just
possible that this fellow May really have seen something there's no history of this fellow making up stories like
that while he's an ordinary farmer and not very literate he is well known in
the community I found no reason to think this man was lying to me I thought he was sincere in telling his story I found
no reason for thinking he was lying to me in any way now interestingly and importantly at
this time there was a huge wave of sightings going on in the area one week earlier around 4:00 a.m. on April 19
hundreds of people described seeing a huge quote Mother Ship over the city of
talisay there were many witnesses one was rufino s Tolentino a guard at a
Milling Company and he said that as the object flew overhead it released more
than 30 disk-shaped objects all of different colors including green yellow
orange and blue there were a lot of witnesses and this wave of sightings
actually occurred over a thre mon period Rolando Espina he's the bureau
chief of the Philippine new news agency said quote literally thousands of people
in the Philippines have seen these objects throughout dozens and dozens of area there have been so many UFO
sightings it is almost as if the pH Philippines have been invaded by
UFOs now Colonel Paterno lomongo who had investigated mto's encounter did tell
reporters that he was quote Gravely concerned unquote about the sightings
that many of the witnesses were police officers that they saw the craft with their own eyes and that we quote do not
know what these are and anything we do not know about I worry about it's an
interesting type of UFO ET behavior these big waves or flaps of sightings
where suddenly a particular area gets really active uh activity with lots of
UFOs uh and that's clearly what was going on in this case hard to say why
but certainly an interesting Encounter of a landed UFO and humanoids all right here's another case
this one's super interesting I call this one the most remarkable thing that ever
happened to me that is of course a direct quote from the witness who had an experience in Fall of
1989 in Tallahassee Florida this case could possibly be
considered a close encounter of the fifth kind for reasons we shall shortly see but it's such an unusual encounter
with a UFO actually entering into a person's room and this ET manifesting
and boy this had a real profound effect on the witness this case which comes from the Florida UFO Network might
actually be considered a close encounter of the fifth kind a human initiated encounter the main witness is an
anonymous Woman Who Lived in a little house along the border of the appalachicola forest in South Leon
County near Tallahassee Florida she had always been fascinated by UFOs but never
really did anything about this until the fall of 1989 when she went to the local library
and checked out four or five books on the subject and it was shortly after reading them that she had her first UFO
experience and I'll just quote her directly as she said for some reason I got more than I
bargained for one night I woke up in a slight Panic something was going on when
I opened my eyes I saw a red beam of light shining in the window next to where I had been sleeping it was moving
around like a search light might I jumped up to look out the window and my first thought was this is it was not an
airplane or a helicopter but unmistakenly a UFO my second thought was run I ran as
far as the opposite side of the room where I crouched down near the floor with my back against the wall I guess I
thought I'd be safer inside than out after all the UFO was outside but not
for long as I looked up at the window a small ball came flying through it it
made a little dip then flew towards the ceiling as it flew it emerged into a
dome shaped framework about 5 ft across composed of grayish looking bars with a
small apparatus of sorts on top then it stopped suddenly tilted towards the
ceiling and I started seeing Sparkles of light under the frame these Sparkles
became more numerous until in a matter of about 3 seconds a being was
formed now this all happened very quickly and as the ball of light came into her room she could actually hear it
making a quote whooing noise and in the space of one or two seconds these Sparkles quickly transformed into a
humanoid shape and she had the feeling it was male well she's not sure why but
as she says in her own words this being I assume it was a being only because it
had a human shape was approximately 8 ft tall entirely covered by a brownish tan
cloth and it ties around its neck waist wrists and ankles needless to say I felt
I had seen a enough just then I got the message telepathically probably he is
going to reveal himself and luckily for me at the time that's all I remember
except that everything went black I could still see but there was nothing to see no being no room
nothing so the witness saw no real features she saw that this figure did
not have any real neck very wide shoulders a thick body with hands and feet covered by this same material that
covered its body and head now thankfully the witness was not unconscious for long
but the strangeness wasn't over yet because as she says my next memory is
being in the process of getting up off the floor it wasn't until I was halfway
up that the lights came on again reality that is suddenly the world was back I
stretched and yawned remember feeling pretty good and said to myself I think I
will go back to bed now I laid in bed maybe 15 or 20 minutes thinking very
calmly about what had just happened like it was the most normal thing in the world I told myself that the next day I
would go in check with my neighbors surely they had to have seen the UFO but I never got the chance to do this
because the next time I remembered this event was about 2 years later and I was
living in another part of the city that's what happened so like many
witnesses she experienced some Amnesia with this event and despite the fact
that this experience was initially frightening she believes ultimately it was a very benevolent encounter and
she's glad to have had it as she says in her own words it was the most remarkable
thing that had ever happened to me in my life and I wouldn't trade it for anything what an amazing and strange
case that was uh even though the witness was initially quite frightened as you
can see they said that this experience was ultimately one that they are very glad they have this is a pattern I see
with many many cases what might start out as very frightening the witnesses
realize they weren't harmed and in fact they often get great benefits from their
encounters quite an experience to have and so many people are having these
experiences that's largely why I do this research is because so many people are having these experiences and are looking
for information for confirmation for any recourse to help figure out what's
happening to them all right moving on to another case I call this one you are me and I call it
that for reasons you you shall shortly see this one occurred on March 9
1992 in hamar Norway this is a multiple in this case this does have some really
profound evidence in the form of physiological effects and what I like
about this case is the main witness did come forward after initially being
anonymous and spoke publicly about her encounters wrote a book about it and
while it was initially frightening she absolutely reversed her opinions and
feels that this was an incredibly benevolent experience for her this
amazing case involves two witnesses who initially insisted upon anonymity though we now know one of them is a very famous
person actually by the name of gray janique jum and it was around 10 pm. on
the evening of March 9 2009 that these two witnesses aged 30 and 22 were
driving to their homes near hamar Norway and the first strange thing they noticed
was a low frequency humming noise and a vibration which quickly grew stronger
and they could actually feel it in their bodies when without War morning a dazzlingly powerful bright white light
appeared in front of their car so bright it hurt and almost burned their eyes they said but looking at this light they
could see that whatever it was it was hovering about 45 ft in front of them on the road about 5 to 10 ft above the
road's surface they could now see that it was in fact a solid object with a
triangular or somewhat triangular base and a transparent looking glass Dome or
coua it had three lights on the bottom section but inside this clear Dome they
could vaguely see two forms now suddenly the light dimmed down
to almost nothing and they thought at first that the object had actually disappeared but it hadn't cuz as their
eyes adjusted they could see that this object was still there or had reappeared and they could now clearly see two
humanoid figures sitting side by side in this trans transparent Dome they said
they were moving in kind of quote choppy motions or appeared to be chattering to each
other now they were quite scared at this point though they did Drive closer
instead approaching to almost 6 feet away from this object and we're able of
course to see this object and the humanoids in considerable
detail both figures had very large dark eyes the one on the right side had what
looked like a steering wheel of some kind in in front of him now this one on
the right also had what looked like long blonde hair the one of the witnesses felt this might have been an illusion
caused by the bright light but yeah they were both both close enough to see that
these figures had eyes with black pupils in them both of these figures were staring directly into the witness's eyes
and they described this stare as cold piercing even Wicked or evil and
malicious this was their initial impression now one of the witnesses does admit that she
was so frightened she didn't really get a good look at the figures instead she
concentrated more on the craft itself which she said did not really have a triangular base but was more
rounded so these are minor differences in what they perceived but without
warning this object suddenly disappeared they drove home and went to bed and when they got home they found
now it was about 4:00 a.m. so it's clear they probably had some missing time now shortly after going to bed gray
heard the same loud buzzing noise outside her bedroom window and in fact it grew in volume and intensity to the
point where she felt that this object was right over her house was making her entire body vibrate she said it was even
more frightening than the initial encounter where they saw the object in front of their
car and that was it now there were some other strange after effects because in the days following
the encounter they both suffered from some temporary he hearing problems much like tonius some visual impairment of an
inability to focus and nose beds for a full month both felt completely drained
of energy graay says she was emotionally drained and both of them complained
about being unable to relate to people in the way that they used to now gray considered undergoing
hypnosis after the encounter but I don't believe she actually did but her life changed greatly she
became a famous pop musician she even had her own talk show she did a lot of
interviews about her encounter she said that she remained in contact with these ETS and began to kind of Channel
information from them doing a process known as automatic writing she said the
information was coming from an entity who identified himself as
VRA they gave her all kinds of information they told her there will be more Wars all all sorts of stuff and
some weird experiences continued once she was in New York City in a hotel room with a friend when they both felt this
weird Force entered the hotel room and her friend said that she seemed to grow
in size and gree said she actually had that same perception and she says her
eyes actually changed to a greenish color for about 2 days now although her initial encounter
on the road was very frightening she now feels that her encounter with the ETS
was very friendly and as she says quote I've only met the nice one I have gained
new values so she ended up writing a book about her experiences called du ERJ
which means you are me and it describes her encounter what she learned from the
ETS addressing all kinds of topics such as reincarnation religion emotions
politics wealth and poverty life on other planets and much more she says
that Earth is actually a school where souls are given a second chance to learn
so what an amazing case that is multiple inness case physiological evidence and
to me the most interesting aspect is how profoundly it affected the main witness
spiritually psychically she went as far as to write a book sharing all the information she learned from the ETS
really deep information in terms of you know philosophy and psychic abilities
and predictions and all kinds of stuff this is a pattern we see in a lot of cases I think it shows the ET mission on
our planet they're here to guide teach heal Warn and wake people up to our own
psychic abilities I've said it many times and I think the W the firsthand
cases speak to this very clearly all right now we've got another
case and this one is also very interesting it is quite brief but I found the testimony for this Anonymous
witness to be quite compelling they shared it in their own words I call it a
roadside Gray this occurred one evening in March of 1995 in a rural area of
Kerry Illinois and while this case wasn't professionally investigated I
found the witness to be very credible and I think it's an interesting case and there quite if you like it and that's
why I wanted to include it in this collection although this case wasn't formally investigated by a researcher it
was reported firsthand to the website UFO evidence. Org the witness is a married
man aged 32 at the time of his encounter with two children and says he works
full-time as a printer and during this time was attending college one night a
week and it was one evening March 1995 as he was driving his Honda Civic along
a Rural Road near Kerry Illinois and I'll just let the witness describe in his own words what happened
Z says while driving home from work I saw a strange figure now he later found
a a photo or a drawing rather on the internet as you can see here that approximate what he saw but as he says I
was going down a road with a forest on both sides and a gravel pit past the forest on one side and I saw something
coming out of the forest 40 ft away and step up to the road at first I thought
it was a large dog but it was walking on two feet my next reaction was that there was a
car accident and this was someone who was hurt and needed help whatever it was
it noticed my headlights and started to walk towards my car right now it was about 30 ft away while rolling down my
window I estimated that this individual was as tall as my car it had a large
head large dark oval-shaped eyes two holes where a nose would be with white
skin I remember the arms and legs being very thin and as it was walking the arms
were swinging upwards almost as if it was weighed down when it was about 5 ft
away I kept thinking it was a victim of a car accident but looking at the face I
realized this was not possible the hair on my neck was standing up I pulled
forward not really scared just not sure what was happening I kept going thinking
that there was an accident and what I just saw was would be explained well there was nothing and I went straight
home so once he got home the witness could not get this encounter out of his mind so the next day he returned to the
location and took several photographs now driving this same route for work he often wondered if there
might be a repeat encounter so he began to carry a camera with him but this
experience turned out to be a one-off he had no further encounters and for many years he kept quiet about it but after
10 years finally did make a report and as he says I've only talked to any
extent about this to my wife and kids several others at the time thought I was nuts for even bringing this up so
I quit talking about it but to this day I can still see its face and the weird way that it walked I also think about it
every time I drive down that road such an interesting encounter and what's
really interesting to me is that the witness went through what J Allen heinik calls Theory
escalation very rarely do people jump to the immediate conclusion that they're seeing an ET they're looking for
something that's more explainable more normal uh and they were very reluctant
to report this as an actual ET even after the encounter itself and it's also interesting how
profoundly it affects the witness again this is a very consistent feature but I can only imagine what it would be like
to be driving down the road see a gray ET that close up and then have to go
down that road every single day on your way to and from work so that creates
quite a dilemma for Witnesses in fact I know of cases where people had an encounter along a certain stretch of
road that they had to regularly travel on and decided you know what I'm taking a different route even if it's longer
really interesting such a shame that there wasn't a repeat encounter because the witness was so affected by this
encounter that yeah as I said carried a camera with them following it so
interesting all right and now we move to the last case in this little collection
and I call this one the men in the sky this is quite an unusual case in terms
of the description of the craft this occurred on April 26 2009 relatively
recently and it occurred in the city of bad nunar in Germany this is a pretty
urban area the witness got a very close up look at this craft and humanoids and
yeah just an incredibly unusual description of this UFO this case comes
from German researcher natal Guido Cincinnati and was published in the German UFO publication juu f f the
journal for UFO for it's a very brief but unusual case
of a close encounter of the Third Kind it was around 1 a.m on April 26th 2009
when the witness who is anonymous saw something he couldn't explain just outside his home in bad nunar Germany as
the witness says in his own words shortly before 1 a.m. I saw a white dot
coming from the south which quickly grew in size suddenly a square search beam
went off so as this object approached this witness could now see that this was
actually a structured object long and rectangular in shape with a black
rectangular structure on top and another smaller rectangular structure on top of that the topmost section was where this
squarish beam of light was coming from and this beam shown first to the left
then above to the right and then Below in the mid structure there were three lights one green one white one red now
this does sound somewhat like a plane but apparently it's not because this
main bottom structure was very unusual was divided into three colored sections
green on the left orange in the center and blue on the right but more unusual
was that there were nine large rectangular windows covering the entire side of the object reaching to just
above the mid point of the bottom structure almost to the base and even more unusual is that the witness could
see full Silhouettes head to toe of six humanoid figures standing behind these
windows only the second Fifth and eighth Windows had no figures in them and as
the witness says the people were clearly visible standing it looked like a modern
ship's Upper Deck it was about 30 m in front and away from from me flying
quietly over then I ran to the bathroom window opened it and watched the flying
thing slowly come in flying North into the Horizon with a quiet jet noise no
plane so yeah this is very odd I mean he's only 100 feet away from this thing
it's moving slowly it's pretty quiet so clearly not a plane and at this point he says the
object moved quickly off and was gone and he was so impressed that he filed a report with UFO researchers only 2 hours
after the sighting however following this the witness declined to be interviewed any
further making it unknown exactly how large this object was and leaving several questions with researchers who
wondered if they this gentleman might have seen a plane given that he did
describe red green and white lights but the investigators cannot
reconcile the sighting with a plane due to the closeness of the object to the witness the shape of the object the
color of the object its relative quietness and the witness's description of humanoids seen in the windows and as
the researcher natal Guido writes both with regard to the observation of
occupants in the flying object as well as with regard to the close distance between the object and the eyewitness
this case stands out from the majority of reported sightings such a shame that the witness
in this case refused to submit to further interviews we probably could
have gotten a lot more information but the main W or the main researcher
definitely feels like this is a legitimate case worthy of attention worthy of being publicized and that's
why I included it just because this UFO is such an unusual description of UFO I
don't know that I've heard anything quite like it but it's one of the fascinating aspects of ETS and their
craft is the huge variety of descriptions and the reports that people
give so there you go 10 cases of humanoids from all over the world many
different types of humanoids several multiple witness cases reaching back way
back in time all the way up to pretty much the current day I think this is important because it CHS just how common
this is I've said it over and over again but most people don't report their encounters especially if it involves
humanoids so any estimates as to how common this experience is are probably way off I'm guessing it's probably
closer to 10 at least or a 100 times of any official
estimates so so so many cases all right well that's it for today
I hope you've enjoyed this episode episode and perhaps learned something I really want to thank you for watching I
truly appreciate it it's because of all of you out there that I do the This research and put out this information
very much fact-based no sensationalizing no speculating just the facts I think
the facts alone are amazing enough there's no need to dramatize or
sensationalize people's accounts this is happening and if you don't believe these
cases again there's more where these came from So yeah thank you again and
until next time keep searching for the truth it's out there it's up to you to determine what it is keep asking those
hard questions and most important of all keep having fun that's why we're here
see you guys later bye for now
