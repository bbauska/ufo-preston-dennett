UFOS OVER CATALINA ISLAND: THREE BOY SCOUT UFO ENCOUNTERS
Dec 20, 2020

Summary:
Dec 20, 2020
Catalina Island, located off the southern California Coast, is the central focus of a huge amount 
of UFO and USO (unidentified submersible objects) activity. The cases in this area reach back more 
than 100 years and are still occurring today. Among the strangest and most dramatic are several 
cases of UFOs seen by groups of boy scouts and camp directors.

This video presents three incredible cases in which UFOs have put on a display for a large group 
of boy scouts and adults on Catalina Island.

In 1952, an encounter at Camp Fox, Catalina Island was viewed by 350 witnesses and reached the 
highest levels of military intelligence.

In 1992, a group of boy scouts and directors at Camp Cherry Valley, Catalina Island observed 
a dramatic display involving an object darting around, spinning, and sending down beams of light.

In 2013, boy scouts and camp directors from Emerald Cove Boy Scout Camp observed a fantastic 
two-hour long display involving more than 200 objects of many different shapes and sizes.

These incredible cases provide some unique insights into the UFO activity in this area, and 
into the nature of the phenomenon itself. For those who would like to hear more about these 
and other cases, please check out my book, "Undersea UFO Base."

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and the title of today's presentation is ufos over 
catalina island three boy scout ufo encounters catalina island is located about 26 miles off 
the Southern California coast and right in the middle of a huge ufo hot spot i've documented 
more than 150 cases of ufos not only ufos but usos unidentified submersible objects so there's 
definitely something going on in this area ufos have been seen since at least the 1920s and 
activity is still occurring today and catalina island is absolutely a prime viewing spot for 
all of this activity catalina is probably best known as a tourist spot but it does actually 
have a number of boy scout camps on it and the reason I wanted to include these accounts in 
this video is because these particular encounters all have some really interesting elements 
they are all very widely viewed not only by boy scouts but by adults they all have some interesting 
and unique details to them and all of them involve what I would call a ufo display or the object 
or objects are know they are being seen or want to be seen or are in effect putting on a show 
perhaps so let's just dive right into these very interesting cases the first case I want to talk 
about occurred at camp fox in august of 1952 camp fox is located on the leeward side of the 
island the side that faces the mainland at about the midpoint of the island along the shore and 
this was a bright sunny morning when this occurred clear skies about 300 boy scouts and 50 
adults were all lined up for a formal ceremony around the flagpole and some of the boy scouts 
started shouting and pointing up the sky everyone looks up and there's this ufo approaching it 
appears to be a classic flying saucer disc shaped metallic one of the witnesses clyde vroomin 
he was a 13 year old boy scout at that time uh he estimates that the object was about 800 feet 
in elevation and perhaps 150 feet in diameter a classic saucer shaped there were no markings on 
it no protuberances there was however a series of evenly spaced portholes around the circumference 
with very shiny silver like aluminum he said and came right over to the camp and everyone and 
just hovered and started rotating around a little bit at some point it assumed a horizontal 
position it was totally silent the whole time one of the most interesting details that everybody 
noticed was that although it was a bright sunny day with blue skies the area surrounding this 
object was dark as night it was like a black band 
surrounded this object something or s was causing this weird effect to cause the blue sky to look 
like night sky this was something they all noticed and it was very apparent to everyone 
that this was not a plane or a helicopter or balloon or anything like that it was far too 
low and everybody was singing this they were shouting out the word ufo at this time 
and after just a few moments it moved off very quickly and disappeared 
at this point everyone was still very excited and talking about what they had seen so the camp 
counselors decided to get everyone together and have them write up their testimony about 
what they saw do a little write up about their impressions of what they had seen so that's what 
they did and they didn't stop there they actually took all these testimonies some 350 testimonies 
and put them all together and sent them off to the air force they ended up at march air force base 
and what's very interesting is they actually got a response turns out the air force officials 
were very interested in their testimony and they got a response not only from air force 
officials but from the commander of march air force base himself colonel charles w bicking 
wrote back and in a statement said that he thanked them for their testimony said that their testimony 
had been forwarded to air force headquarters in fact and he told them and I quote while the 
information from these reports may seem only meager to you when combined with other reports 
it may possibly indicate information which will be of great interest to our intelligence office 
this is an important fact because at this time the air force had begun a policy of  ridiculing witnesses and covering up events but it's quite obvious here that they took this report 
very seriously I think perhaps because there were so many witnesses viewing conditions were ideal 
and this object was so low that there's just no possible way it could have been misperceived 
at any rate they did get this incredible response from the air force and that itself is pretty rare 
another very interesting detail about this particular sighting other than the fact that  it was widely viewed uh was apparently a display because this object came so close 
uh and turned horizontally and then zipped away there was this black band of darkness surrounding 
this object the main witness clyde wrote uh years later that perhaps the cause of this sort of band 
of darkness around the object was from the engines of the ufo itself perhaps it used 
uh engines that affected the gravitational field around this object causing the light to 
be refracted or bent in some way that it made the sky around it not blue but black like 
night so yeah maybe the gravity around it was so powerful was actually uh refracting the light rays 
from the sun itself so it's a very interesting case in a number of ways and that's the first 
one and the second case is equally interesting the second case occurred at cherry cove boy scout camp 
and this uh not too far actually from the first encounter near the two harbors area not too 
far away from there this is a more recent encounter this occurred on june 19th 1992 
at that time there was a lot of activity in this area this particular case took place at night 
during a sort of presentation that the camp counselors were putting on the this particular 
boy scout camp was called the tribe of torqua which was named after a mountain on catalina 
island by the name of torquamata and during this presentation the camp directors and counselors had 
dressed up as native americans and were canoeing back in and this is when the incident occurred 
there's there was this bright flash of light from above it was bright enough that it caused everyone 
to look up and a large group of boy scouts and some adults saw this kind of star-like object 
but it was very bright and it was moving in this very small portion of sky in a darting 
pattern with zipping back and forth at right angles for a short period of time then suddenly 
it darts off to the north where it stops and it hovers over the water and here we have this sort 
of display type behavior when this thing starts to spin rapidly sending off what appeared to be beams 
of light upwards into the sky and also downwards onto the water it did this for just a few moments 
before suddenly darting off and disappearing off into the distance the entire sighting lasted no 
more than a minute perhaps less but still it was a very dramatic sighting and convinced everyone 
there that they were seeing something very unusual so again where these boy scout camps are 
being treated to a very unusual display of ufos and it appears as if the ufos want to be seen 
and that certainly seems to be true in this next case this next case is the most 
dramatic of the three by far and was really the reason I wanted to put together this video 
i was able to interview the witness first hand shortly after the incident his name is alan 
bergholt he was 13 years old at the time and this occurred at the emerald bay boy scout 
camp this is again just a few miles north of the other two encounters right along the coastline on 
the leeward side of the island facing the mainland almost towards the very end of the island actually
and this case took place on the evening of june 26 2013. 
alan and some of the other boy scouts and camp counselors decided that instead of spending the 
evening at emerald bay itself they would take a two mile hike along the edge of the coastline 
there to a place called parsons landing which is another campground it's a pretty remote area very 
beautiful with a nice view of the santa catalina channel and the mainland itself and as they got 
there and started to set up this huge thick fog bank rolled in obscuring much of the area they 
built a fire they cooked their dinner they set up their tents after everyone had finished dinner and 
talked for a little while they decided to retire for the evening and everyone went to their tents 
and this is when this the fog suddenly rolled out so that was unusual for this very thick fog 
to just roll in and out over a period of an hour or two maybe and now it was a crystal clear night 
and really beautiful allen and his two friends lay in their sleeping bags in their tent with the 
flap open and we're looking up at the stars it was a very starry night and they noticed 
not only stars but what appeared to be planets more than one at least three very bright planets 
and uh these were exceptionally bright and they're trying to figure out what planets they might be  when something very unusual happened that made it apparent that these were not planets at all 
these very bright objects started to flash and pulse and brightness and kind of 
vibrate almost and i'll just let alan describe what happened in his own words as he says 
what we thought was a planet caught our attention because it was so very bright all of a sudden it 
started to vibrate then slowly exploded with a burst of bright light for about 10 seconds 
then dimmed itself and moved slowly to the right it made no sound whatsoever and moved in a pattern 
that no plane or planet could do during the time of this bright light explosion the light reflected 
off the water then another two bright lights that we originally thought were planets started to do 
the same light explosion process but not as bright so alan and his friends were totally in trance 
this weird kind of silence had settled over the camp and it was just eerily quiet and 
they could not believe what they were seeing because shortly after all these objects had pulsed 
and kind of vibrated a fourth object appeared and again it was this very very bright object these 
four objects were all at varying distances but all seemed at pretty low elevation and one of them was 
quite close to them and after they had pulsated and dimmed uh it became clear to allen and his 
friends that these were not planets obviously are not stars because they weren't really exactly 
spherical shaped they had almost a pure middle shaped to them as well kind of a pyramid shape 
they could definitely see this in the one that was closest to them for sure 
and this is when another amazing thing happened these four objects  all brightened up at once pulsated shivered and a ufo appeared this object just appeared in a 
portion of the sky and started darting around and moved off to the east it was sort of a tear drop 
shaped object and it wasn't long before these four planet-like objects these spherical pyramid-shaped 
objects pulsated and shivered again and another ufo appeared and this began to happen over and 
over again there was a wide variety of objects that started to come out of these each time these 
lights would flare up a group of objects would come out sometimes five times sometimes 10 or 
20 and they would dart around hover in place but usually move off quickly in just a short period of 
time and usually towards the east some would turn at right angles some would go in other directions 
and there started to be different shapes so after this happened a number of times  they started to count the number of objects and this went on for quite some period of time as 
alan says and i'm quoting we saw this happen many many times over the space of two 
hours I would estimate we saw this happen about 50 times the four large pyramidal sphere ships stayed 
in the vicinity for almost two hours whereas the other smaller ships would disappear to the east 
one ship stayed still for almost two hours whereas the other large spherical ships moved around some 
but didn't leave the vicinity other lights started appearing and going extremely fast zipping across 
the sky the lights were traveling about 10 times faster than I had ever seen a supersonic jet fly 
in the sky and they would suddenly change directions when I looked up one went so fast 
it appeared to leave a lightning bolt trail on my retina for a fraction of a second some craft 
seemed to come towards us then turned to the east others went directly east the lights of 
these incredibly fast-moving teardrop-shaped craft were red and orange there were a few that were 
blue I would estimate that we saw approximately 200 of these ultra fast but small spaceships
so this just went on and on and the boys were while they were very excited they were also 
kind of entranced and very calm calmer than they thought they should have been  they just lay there in their tent watching this none of them had any phones or cameras they did 
know many of the other people there had cameras but nobody was getting out of their tents or  talking about what they were seeing but they it was obvious to alan and his friends that other 
people had to be seeing this because this was very dramatic very obvious you couldn't miss it 
and it was just going on and on and uh some of these of the four large objects 
the one that was closest to them seemed to stay in place but the others kind of moved around lazily  and at one point got really low and they did actually see some 
of these objects go into the water itself so they not only saw ufos but you know usos 
uh as alan says there were two identical bright pyramidal shaped ships 
at one point one was semi-submerged in the ocean water the other identical ship was hovering about 
a half mile above the water they both pulsed the exact same colors at the exact same time 
after about two to five minutes of a synchronized light show with each other the lower ship sank 
back into the water and the one above silently moved over to where the other ship had submerged 
it sat there over the same spot for a while then suddenly it took off vertically at an enormously 
fast rate of speed and quickly disappeared it was very obvious to alan and his friends 
that these were not planes or helicopters or balloons or anything conventional at all 
some of them would come quite close to them some were much farther away the ones that came close 
they could get a really good look what was most interesting to them is the huge variety of shapes 
these things came in allen actually drew these craft after he'd seen it he drew them the next day 
and there was a half dozen different types there was spherical objects there were triangular shaped 
objects rectangular shaped objects teardrop shaped objects saucer-shaped objects diamond shaped 
just a huge variety and they were putting on this display for as alan says at least 
two hours and i'd just like to give you another direct quote from alan about what he saw 
as alan says a diamond-shaped ship and a u-shaped ship came towards us they were closer and lower 
than the other ships the u-shaped ships had a slight protrusion at the bottom of the u 
that we thought might have been a cockpit that was where most of the colored lights 
were there were four different lights placed in a perfect diamond pattern on the bottom of the ship 
those u-shaped ships were the ships that got closest to us and afforded us the best view 
the lights were different colors but they changed colors slowly they didn't blink  but faded into different colors the colors were yellow purple green white and magenta 
in total we saw hundreds of ships and probably a dozen variants of different classes of silently 
flying objects some were cigar shaped some pyramidal some u-shaped some stingray-shaped 
some triangular shape that would break apart to become smaller triangles 
some tear-dropped and some small disc shaped it was like a whole flotilla of flying objects 
but not one of them looked like conventional aircraft or made any noise the silent phenomena 
lasted over two hours uh this is from alan's written testimony that he wrote 
the next day after seeing all this as you can see he's a very intelligent young man and a very good 
observer and having seen these things for so long and so close up they knew for sure that these were 
not conventional objects they believe they're extraterrestrial they don't think they're military 
there is some military not far from this area point magu naval base uh port wainey 
is off to the north end of all this activities but it's many miles away 
and i'm thinking though that they probably had to be aware of what was going on if so 
they did not send any air force jets out after this and alan and his friends and the other 
boy scouts and some of the camp counselors were apparently the only ones who saw this or at least 
the only ones who reported it now here's another very strange detail about this case at some point 
while all of this was going on allen and his two friends were looking towards the mainland 
and they could see it very close up uh much more close than you could normally see it normally 
you can see the mainland but you can't make out individual buildings or cars or anything like that 
but as they were looking at the mainland across you know at least 26 miles of uh open 
ocean here actually more than that because the closest is you know towards rancho palos verdes 
so this is considerably more miles than that they were looking across towards this expanse of 
water and they could see individual homes they could see individual cars and their headlights 
going along the pacific coast highway this is impossible there's just no way you could see 
these details that close up so somehow it was magnified and they studied the coastline and 
actually saw this lighthouse it was just a sort of typical lighthouse but later in the 
days following this incident they were able to see this lighthouse closely enough that 
they could identify it and they believe it was the lighthouse at point conception which by the way is 
more than 90 miles away this is beyond where they should be able to see so if that they're correct 
in identifying this lighthouse and it's the only lighthouse that matches up to the details they saw 
then there's definitely some weird effect going on here perhaps the space time continuum is it being 
bent in some way or this is a portal that's affecting or causing a distortion in the distance 
between catalina island and the mainland here at any rate it's a very strange effect which 
all of them noticed and could not explain as alan says I have no explanation for how we could have 
possibly seen these landmarks so effortlessly that we're so far away
so at this point the is really ramping up it's clearly some sort of sky show 
there's a lot of objects at one point zooming all around in the sky at once 
it became so active that uh they weren't able to keep an eye on any one thing they actually decided 
they were going to divide this guy up and each watch a portion of the sky because so many things 
were happening at once it was like all coming to a climax as alan says and again i'm quoting 
soon many lights and movements started happening quickly and all at once there were so many objects 
that it was hard to keep track of them my three friends and I decided to divide up the sky so we 
could look in different directions I was looking to the north we only did that for a little while 
as one of us would point out something incredible to our friends and then we would all look 
we were incredibly excited and could barely believe our eyes as to what we were seeing 
some of the scouts were asleep through all this but my friends and I were extremely excited 
and we saw other scouts and adults along the beach also intently watching this most amazing sky show 
the whole event seemed to be sort of orchestrated by these four large pure middle sphere shaped 
objects because each time they would pulse and dim and vibrate a new wave of objects would appear 
so perhaps it was these objects uh which were sort of causing this weird uh magnification of 
the coastline this weird sort of warping effect and this weird perhaps uh maybe it's a portal 
that's allowing these objects to come through but there were so many of these objects that that 
was kind of the most amazing thing of all and uh there there was just no way this could have been 
military with that number of objects they were really beautiful many different types of objects 
there was just no way that they could explain this and finally it ended as alan says eventually 
the ships flew off within a few minutes as if they were following some silent signal the sky 
ships all departed and the fog appeared to roll in over the mainland uh yeah immediately after 
this incident occurred the fog came rolling back in and I don't think this is a coincidence either 
because we do have weird fog banks that appear or disappear in association with dramatic 
ufo encounters and that seems to be what happened in this case it's a truly incredible encounter 
and uh it actually had lasting repercussions alan and his three friends were completely amazed and 
they wanted to talk about it the next day but the camp counselors who saw uh this activity refused 
to talk about it and didn't want to talk about it and everyone just became sort of taboo to even 
talk about it alan was able to find some other witnesses he learned that some people had camera 
cameras and cell phones and tried to take pictures but could not because the cameras and 
the cell phones powered down so it was a really amazing event that alan will never forget and he 
uh and the his friends thought it was important that it be recorded for posterity and that's why 
he agreed to an interview uh it's had a very strong and profound effect on him and 
has convinced him of the reality of ufos he has no idea why he was so lucky to see this 
but he's amazed that he did and as he says and again i'm quoting at least 20 scouts including 
myself witnessed all or part of this amazing event on the clear june 26 evening some boys were from 
my troop others were from other troops in other cities there were also several adult staff members 
who saw this the adults did not appear to want to discuss this matter the next day I felt that they 
were unsure how to handle the amazing events of the previous night and feared that they would get 
into trouble if they discussed what many of us had witnessed it seemed pretty clear to me the 
next day that it was not a good idea to discuss what we had seen as the leaders disapproved of it 
and as I mentioned some people did try to film it one guy had a gopro camera and he said it actually 
powered down to zero it had been at 80 percent when he had it and after the incident it went 
back up to normal 80 percent and the same thing happened with one gentleman who had a digital 
camera actually so uh when he tried to film the event it became mysteriously drained down to 
about two percent so that none of them were able to take pictures and this is certainly 
something we've seen in other cases where people try to take pictures the person's camera fails 
so yeah I mean there are very many strange elements about this incredible event 
and it was very widely viewed and I think has some important things to say about not 
only the ufo phenomena but the activity that's going on in this area all three of these cases 
do and that's why I want to again include them because they're all very widely viewed these were 
at least two of them very low level sightings all three involve what appeared to be a display 
and this last incident has electromagnetic effects effects and this very strange sort of 
space warping effect where the witnesses were able to see the coastline magnified to 
an incredible degree so I don't even know how to explain that neither do the witnesses uh it's a 
very interesting encounter to say the least and uh all of these cases are presented in my book 
undersea ufo base an in-depth investigation into uso activity in the santa catalina channel 
and as I said I mean these are only three of more than 150 documented cases in this area 
i think it's probably a lot more than that because most people do not report their 
encounters and the fact that alan and his friends and the other witnesses saw so many 
objects makes me wonder what exactly is going on in this area and could there possibly be a base 
and i've got other reasons for thinking that but that's actually the topic for another show until 
then once again thanks for listening and keep having fun.
