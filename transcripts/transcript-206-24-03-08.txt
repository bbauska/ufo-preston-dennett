WHEN ASTRONOMERS SEE UFOS

Summary:
Mar 8, 2024
There is a misconception in the field of ufology that no astronomers have seen UFOs. But the truth is exactly the opposite. In fact, there is a long list of high-profile astronomers who have had incredible UFO sightings. In 1952, Blue Book astronomy expert, J. Allen Hynek held a conference with astronomers. “Over forty astronomers were interviewed,” he said, “of which five had made sightings of one sort or another. This is a higher percentage than among the populace at large.” Researcher Alejandro Rojas, writes “Often people will ask me, ‘If there are so many UFOs, why aren’t astronomers seeing them?’ They are! In fact, astronomers have been some of the most influential advocates for the serious study of UFOs.” This video presents more than a dozen cases of astronomers who have seen UFOs.

In March of 1676, Edmund Halley (the discover of Halley’s comet) observed a “vast body apparently bigger than the moon,” which he estimates was 40 miles high, moving in excess of 9000 mph. He had other sightings of unexplained lights in the sky and on the moon, and on March 6, 1716, saw a strange UFO which remained in the sky for 2 full hours.

In 1783, Sir William Herschel (discover of Uranus and several moons) observed several unexplained lights on the moon. And again on October 2, 1790, he saw more unexplained lights. On several occasions he reported seeing UFOs in the sky which he described variously as, “round…oval…and disc-shaped.”

On April 12, 1879, astronomer Henry Harrison observed a strange object in the skies over New York City which remained in view for three hours. Unknown to him, another astronomer Spencer J. Devoe saw the same object. Researcher Morris K Jessup triangulated the two observations and calculated that the object was a half-mile wide.

On July 10, 1947, leading astronomer Lincoln Lapaz was driving through New Mexico when he and his family saw an elliptical-shaped object high in the clouds. He estimated that the object was 160 feet long, 65 feet wide. It was silent and appeared “self-luminous” against the dark clouds.

On August 20, 1949, Clyde Tombaugh (discoverer of Pluto) was with his family in New Mexico when they all saw a “curious bright object” move across the sky and darting off. Says Tombaugh, “This remarkably sudden ascent thoroughly convinced me that we were dealing with an absolute novel airborne device.”

On February 16, 1950, Dr Charles Shane of the Lick Observatory in Santa Clara, CA saw a “queer object” which he said was “moving unusually swiftly.” He said, “I call this celestial phenomenon one of the most unusual objects sighted in the sky for a long time.”

On May 20, 1950, Seymour Hess was at Lowell Observatory in Arizona when he saw a glowing and “extremely prominent” object move at 200 miles per hour across the sky and into a cloudbank, against the wind. He estimates the object was about five feet wide.

On August 3, 1951, Walter Webb of Hayden Planetarium in Boston, Massachusetts saw a glowing object move across the sky in a weird wave-like pattern. Says Webb, “No known object I could think of followed a path like that…my UFO appeared to be a bright, glowing object moving in a regular, wavy pattern.”

On January 25, 1954, astronomer Robert D Schaldach described his observation of a “yellow-white” pulsating light move across the sky at White Sands, New Mexico. Another military officer observed the object. They reported it to Project Blue Book saying that the object “was not any kind of meteor.” Blue Book did no investigation, but called the object “astronomical…meteor.”

On June 11, 1954, Percy Wilkins was flying over the east coast of the US when he saw two objects that “looked exactly like polished metal plates reflecting in the sunlight.” He concluded that the objects were likely "built, piloted, and controlled by intelligences that surpass that of humans.”

On November 1, 1955, Frank Halstead of Darling Observatory in Duluth, Minnesota was on a train with his wife in Death Valley, California when they observed two UFOs. Says Halstead, “both objects were very shiny, we noticed. But this second one was definitely disc-shaped… The time is long overdue for accepting the presence of these things.”

Jacques Vallee needs no introduction and is a towering figure in the UFO field. In 1961, he was at the Paris Observatory in France and tracked an unexplained object. Says Vallee, “I thought, here we are at a renowned institution seeing something we can’t explain, and destroying data for fear of ridicule.”

As can be seen astronomers all across the world have been seeing UFOs for a very long time. Even Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb says, “UFOs should be the subject of mainstream inquiry. Science must bring clarity.” The time for skepticism is over. The evidence for UFOs is conclusive. We are not alone!

Introduction
everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal thank you very much for joining me tonight I think I have a pretty interesting episode today which I
call when astronomers see UFOs there's a misconception out there
that astronomers have not seen UFOs and that's simply not true in fact there are
some 300 plus cases documented of astronomers who have seen UFOs now many
of these are what we would call amateur astronomers but some in fact are quite
well known not too long ago I was surfing the internet and looking at all
the Facebook groups on this subject and I saw quite a bit of discussion about where are all the reports from
astronomers well they're here there's a lot of them and I found this quite synchronistic because I just recently
put out a new book it's called not from here volume Five and I included a
chapter all about astronomers who have seen UFOs so that's what I want to talk about
today I've chosen over a dozen cases which I think are super interesting and
very credible involving very high-profile astronomers what I'd like
to do is present those cases in a chronological order so you can see that
in fact yes astronomers have seen UFOs many high-profile Witnesses have there's
celebrities politicians scientists Pilots of course it's a total
misconception that only uneducated people out in the wilderness see UFOs it's just not true and I really wanted
to talk about astronomers because I think this provides really good evidence
against Skeptics astronomers are very well-trained observers it's their job to
look up at the sky and determine what's going on on there so their accounts are particularly
important so let's just get started and the first astronomer I'd like to talk about is someone I'm sure you heard of
it's Edmund hiy Edmund hiy is of course the discoverer of hi's comet and he
Edmund Hy
reportedly saw a UFO way back in March of
1676 he described it as quote a vast body apparently big ger than the moon of
course he's not talking about how's Comet here this is an object of some kind which he estimated was about 40
miles high and he said it made a noise quote like the rattling of a great cart
over Stones it darted quickly across the sky he said and he estimated that its
speed was very fast somewhere in the excess of 9,000
mph sounds like a UFO to me and it wasn't his only sighting he had a
number of them one year later in 1677 he reported his sighting of quote a
great light in the sky all over Southern England many miles high and over the
years he would have other strange sightings in fact in 1715 Edmund Hy says he saw quote bright
flashes of light on the moon We Now call these TLP transient lunar phenomenon
which have yet to be explained some thought they were perhaps seismic
activity on the moon but we now know that the Moon is not seismically active
so what is this we don't know and another sighting on the evening of March
6 1716 Edmund Hy says he saw an unexplained bright light in the sky
which endured forget this a full two hours and as he wrote in his own words a
man could easily read print in the light thrown out by the spears from this same
body it did not change for two hours and then it seemed as if new fuel had been
cast on a fire so this was something out there that he could not
explain yes that sighting did occur many many years ago centuries but wow it's an
impressive sighting and coming from a gentleman who's quite educated in
astronomy we still talk about him today and here's another astronomer who has
been extremely influential in our understanding of what's going on in the skies above us and that is Sir William
hersel and he's had some really impressive sightings Sir William herel
Sir William Herschel
is a towering figure in the field of astronomy he was born in 1738 in Germany
but did later move to England and he worked very closely with his sister Caroline learning to become an expert
lens grinder and later a leading astronomer and in fact he built a 20ft
reflector telescope which was then the largest in the world and then he
proceeded to shock the world with a series of incredible discoveries in fact
in 1781 he discovered the planet Uranus and
this was the first new planet to be discovered in centuries and this was followed by many other discoveries
including the moons of Saturn and Uranus binary stars and more including of
course strange lunar anomalies in
1783 William hersel was watching the moon when he observed several unusual
bright lights on the lunar surface he recorded this strange event and
continued his observations and four years later his patience was rewarded
again he observed several unusual bright lights on the moon's surface and once
again he wrote this all down he theorized that perhaps these lights were caused by active volcanoes but again the
moon has no active volcanoes and he said that some of these lights appeared to be moving quote above
the Moon so clearly this is something flying around another
amazing uh event was on the evening of October 2nd 1790 hersel made one of his most
discover most stunning discoveries of all there was a total lunar eclipse on
this evening and hersel was closely observing the moon's surface as it was plunged into the shadow of the earth and
to his shock as the moon's surface became covered in Shadow he still
observed several bright glowing objects on its surface in fact he was so
impressed that he wrote to the Royal Astronomical Society in England describing his observations and saying
in part we know too little of the surface of the Moon to venture a surmise
of the cause and remarkable color of these points now of course there's been a lot
of research into UFO activity on the moon Moon and some of the stuff that the
astronauts allegedly found up there it's pretty compelling stuff but hersel was
talking about this way back in the 1700s and not only that he reported
seeing many UFOs throughout his life which he provided various descriptions
of sometimes fuzzy objects sometimes quote round or oval and on a few
occasions quote dis shaped so these are modern-day
descriptions and on some occasions he viewed them through telescopes and he says he could see markings on the
surface of them and these were structured craft of some kind and he
said that their movements excluded them from being explained as meteors or
comets there you go hersel sightings are hard to deny and there's quite a few of
them makes me wonder and as we shall see yeah most astronomers
aren't talking about what they've seen he did so kudos to him but as we'll find
out there is a bit of a coverup going on in the astronomical field where a lot of
astronomers are simply not talking about what they've seen But one who did is
Henry Harrison he's not super welln but he had a very interesting and quite
well-confirmed sighting back in the late 1980s which I
think everyone deserves to know about moving up through time sightings by
Henry Harrison
astronomers continued because it was on April 12th 1879 when astronomer Henry Harrison of
Jersey City New Jersey observed a glowing circular shaped object which he
said appeared to be hovering at an extremely high altitude over New York Harbor but what puzzled Harrison was the
fact that this object remained in place while the Stars continued to rise and set with the Earth's rotation and after
3 hours he was even more surprised to watch this object abruptly change
direction towards the east so apparently this is being propelled somehow the next
day it was gone which rules out any theories of comets or other large natural astronomical
bodies so astronomer Henry Harrison reported his sighting to the Naval Observatory in Washington but received
no response he then contacted the New York Tribune and Scientific American who did
publish his account and as it turns out at the same time of Harrison's sighting
another astronomer Spencer J devvo of manhattanville also apparently observed
the same object which he described his quote wonderfully
brilliant and like Harrison devot was also astonished by the strange
appearance and movement of the object at one point he took his eyes off the
object he decided to take a short coffee break and when he returned this Myster
mysterious object was gone so he didn't get to see it leave now astronomer Morris K Jessup
carefully studied the written reports of both astronomers and after triangulating the numbers he made some pretty
startling conclusions writes Jessup considered from any approach this
object appears to have been organic intelligently operated and hovering over
New York City from Devo's rough description of the size this object
would have been about a half mile in diameter and at an altitude of 80 to 100
miles now interestingly two years earlier on June 17
1877 astronomer Henry Harrison also saw an unexplained light on the moon which
was observed by another astronomer all the way over in England and his name get
this this made me laugh his name is Frank dennet as far as I know there's no
direct relation uh but it could be because we do have the name Frank in our family as
well or my family so H that definitely made me scratch my head but just a
little interesting synchronicity there I always love it when there's multiple witnesses to a single UFO sighting
Witnesses who are separated by distance and don't know of each other because of
course it lends an extra level of credibility to their sighting and when they're astronomers I mean you can't
deny it they know exactly what Fireballs are and satellites and you know anything
that's going on in the sky that's their job so it really behooves us I think to take
the reports seriously and here's another case from a very high-profile astronomer who became
quite active in the UFO field in a sense uh his name is Lincoln lapaz and when
there was a whole wave of these very strange green Fireballs sweeping down
over a particular section of the United States he became one of the lead investigators in them and was absolutely
convinced that something very strange was going on here and he became a
witness himself on July 10 1947 a leading astronomer who at the time his
Lincoln Lapaz
identity was withheld by the editors of Life magazine he reported that he his
wife and two teenage dra daughters were driving from Klein's Corners to
Clovis and this is in New Mexico this is when they saw an elliptical-shaped
object high in the clouds the astronomer who we now know of course to be Lincoln
leaz carefully carefully observed the object and estimated that it was 160 ft
long 65 ft wide and moving up to about
180 mph horizontally and up to 900 miles per hour vertically so he was very
puzzled by the way the object moved in this strange wobbly motion but most
impressive to him was that this object was silent and quote self luminous
against the dark clouds there was no exhaust Trail and he
watched this object for nearly 3 minutes until it moved behind the clouds and
again Lincoln lapaz is a huge figure in astronomy and became very much involved
in the studies of the green Fireballs Lincoln aaz is quite an impressive
character and if you look into his history and what he did in terms of
research I mean he bleeds into Roswell as well uh the Fireballs of the late
1940s early 1950s he's got some very interesting things to say about the whole UFO
field now one of my favorite astronomers who has seen a UFO is none other than
Clyde Toma who as we shall see is a very influential astronomer he
changed our understanding of the solar system in a number of ways and he had a
really impressive and by the way a multi witness sighting of a structured craft
that he himself absolutely insists was not anything conventional in 1930
Clyde Tomba
astronomer Clyde W Tas stunned the world with his discovery of the planet Pluto
unfortunately some astronomers have now downgraded it to a mere planetoid that was in 2007 but the discovery of Pluto
really electrified the world and earned Claude Tamba a permanent place in the
field of astronomy and it was 19 years later on August 20
1949 that Tomo announced his own UFO sighting and it failed to generate any
of the kind of publicity that his discovery of Pluto did but it
was at 10:45 p.m. again on August 20th when Clyde his wife and mother-in-law
sat in the backyard of their home and lost crues New Mexico it was a particularly clear night and Clyde Kon
noted that even the faintest stars with a magnitude of brightness of six
magnitudes were easily visible so these are fairly dim Stars but he could still see them that's how clear it was when
suddenly he and the others saw something they could not identify flying overhead in a geometric
formation were 6 to8 blue green rectangular shaped
lights these lights were at pretty low altitude he estimated and moved quickly and silently from the Northwest to the
southeast and it soon became clear to him that these lights were attached to a single solid
object which actually appeared to have about a half dozen windows or Port holes
along the front and side that emitted this bright light and Clyde Tomba
concluded instantly that these were neither meteors nor conventional aircraft but was clearly a quote solid
object so he wrote an official report to the Air Force sitting in part all four
of us almost simultaneously became aware of a curious bright object almost
motionless it showed a sharp and firm rectangular outline namely one of a
Smooth Elliptical character much harder and sharper than the edges of the cloudlets the object clearly exhibited a
sort of wobbling motion uh he says he was quote thoroughly convin this
thoroughly convinced me that we were dealing with an absolute novel Airborne
device I have done thousands thousand of hours of night sky watching but never
saw a sight so strange as this and he later wrote a letter to
naikap the National investigative Committee of aerial phenomena in which he stated quote as I have said before I
was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was really petrified with
astonishment consequently some of the details I might have noted were missed
so years later Clyde Tomo continued to be very vocal about the UFO phenomenon
for example on February 13 1954 he gave a talk to the astronomy
Society at Los crues New Mexico surprising the Audience by predicting
that there would be an increase in UFO sightings and of course he was correct
about that there sure was three years later he wrote a letter to researcher
Leonard Stringfield in which he revealed that he had seen quote three objects
within the past seven years which defied any explanation of known phenomena such
as Venus atmospheric Optics meteors or
planes so he wrote that on these other occasions he had seen the Unexplained
green Fireballs over New Mexico which of course Lincoln laaz was
researching and Tomball closed his letter saying quote I think that several
reputable scientists are being unscientific in refusing to entertain the possibility of extraterrestrial
origin and
[Music]
nature well uh of the three different types of objects that I have seen I would say the most extraordinary one was
uh one I saw in 1949 in August in Las cruas from my backyard on that
particular evening my wife and her mother and I were uh enjoying the cool air and uh I was admiring the beautiful
transparent Sky With the Stars and I happen to be looking overhead and suddenly I spied a strange uh uh group
of lights moving and I said uh look uh and they saw it immediately and uh then
I would say they were visible for about 3 seconds of time uh and uh they uh
disappeared at a height of about 35° above the south southeastern Horizon uh no sound and uh they seem to
kind of pale out the rectangles of feeble light seem to foreshorten into
slits and uh I've never seen anything like it before s and I'm very much
puzzled as to what the thing was I wish we had more astronomers like Clyde Toma
who showed no fear in going public with his sighting and actually became quite a
strong UFO Advocate and really push for other astronomers to talk about what
they're seeing but unfortunately a lot of astronomers simply are too afraid to
risk their reputation but there's so many there's so many cases here here's another one
involving an astronomer by the name of Dr Charles Donald
Shane he's quite a well educated and well-respected astronomer who had a very
impressive sighting despite allegations of Skeptics there are many accounts on record in which professional astronomers
Charles Donald Shane
have observed UFOs such as the following particularly credible report from
astronomer Dr Charles Donald Shane of the Lick Observatory on Mount h Hamilton
in Santa Clara California because it was on February 16
1950 that chain observed a quote queer object which he at first thought might
be an asteroid except for the fact that it was he said moving unusually swiftly
and as he says I call this Celestial phenomenon one of the most unusual
objects cited in the sky for a long time it happens that I saw it by chance now
he was able to obtain eight photographs of the strange object
but no one knows what happened to these photos or I certainly myself was not
able to find them do wish we had access to the photographs he allegedly took and
wasn't able to find them or any evidence of what happened to them but it's still
another per another astronomer who had a really impressive exciting and as we go
through the years I mean it's just one after another after another lots of astronomers are seeing UFOs and they
don't know what they are many are concluding these are extraterrestrial
craft one very impressive and well-respected astronomer who had an
amazing sighting is none other than Seymour Lester Hess astronomer Seymour
Seymour Lester Hess
Lester Hess is best known for his work at LEL obser obervatory in Flagstaff
Arizona and yeah he joins the long list of astronomers who have seen
UFOs was at 12:20 p.m. on May 20 1950 hes was of course at LEL
Observatory when he saw a dis shaped craft was moving slowly against the
prevailing wind at an altitude of about 12,000 ft so clearly not a balloon and
he said it would couldn't be an airplane or a bird there were no wings or propellers he actually observed this
object through binoculars and was absolutely convinced that it was a powered vehicle of some kind as he says
in his own words it was extremely prominent and showed some size to the
naked eye that is it was not merely a pinpoint now this object was totally
silent and as he watched it moved across the sky and disappeared into to a large
Cloud Bank it wasn't huge he estimates that it was no wider than 5T but was
moving at about 200 mil hour admittedly that is a brief case without a lot of
information but as we go through case after case of astronomer after astronomer it begins to add up uh
astronomers are seeing UFOs there's simply no doubt about it it's
undeniable and another astronomer who become very active in the U UFO field is
none other than Walter web he actually ended up writing a book about UFOs and
quite a bit of research into the subject itself he's very well known in the UFO field and he had his own sighting he
became an astronomical consultant for a number of researchers and organizations
so his sighting is for me of particular interest it was on August 3rd 19 51 that
Walter Webb
astronomer Walter Webb who was then the chief lecturer on astronomy at the
Charles Hayden planetarium in Boston Massachusetts that he saw a UFO and
again I'll just let him describe what he saw in his own words because he describes it vividly as Walter web says
it was a clear moonless night I had been showing two boys various celestial
objects through my three in one head half in reflecting telescope and pointing out
constellations the time was about 11:00 p.m. or midnight suddenly I noticed a
glowing yellow or yellowish red light moving in an undulating path but on a
straight course over the hills of Silver Lake as the object traveled slowly
westward in this peculiar manner the three of us watched in Fascination it
was at such a low elevation that its regular wav likee course caused it to
dip behind the hills a few times so this is an important observation the sort of wobbling
undulating motion is something we do see with genuine UFO reports and Walter web
knowing astronomy was absolutely stunned and realized he was seeing something
very unusual so he swung the telescope around to view it but unfortunately by
then the object had gone nevertheless he was very impressed as he says I had seen
something in the sky that I could not explain no known object I could think of
followed a path like that my UFO appeared to be a bright glowing object
moving in a regular wavy pattern there you go another astronomer and he's
unequivocal about what he saw that this was something exceedingly strange and
not explainable as anything from Earth so how many cases do you need
because here's another and this comes from shalak who is a very esteemed astronomer
and had an incredible sighting along with another gentleman and we're able to observe this in a very scientific
objective way it's an impressive sighting this case is a really good
example of how Project Blue Book officers appear to be bias in their
investigations because it was in 1954 that shalak a former astronomer for L
Observatory was at the time working in a civilian capacity in the technical service unit at wh Sand's Proving
Grounds in New Mexico this is an area of lots of UFO activity his duty at the
time involved the camera monitoring of missile launches it was at 10 p.m. on the
evening of January 20 5 1954 he was setting up his ballistic
camera to monitor a launch and as he looked at the stars to calibrate his
instrument he noticed a quote yellow white light moving from the Northeast to
the southeast in a shallow Arc and he said this object seemed to pulse in brightness at regular
intervals now he was not the only one seeing this meanwhile 17 miles Southeast
of his location another white Sand's employee also viewed the object and both these
gentlemen were trained observers and Co correlating each other's observations they quickly
performed triangulation measurements and determined that this object was
apparently about 12 miles distant and moving at get this
12,000 mph far faster than anything we have far
too slow to be a meteor and as shalak says quote I have observed many
thousands of meteors and can definitely state that this object was not any kind
of meteor now shal did work with famed astronomer Clyde
Tomba and quickly alerted him of this sighting while Clyde Toma in turn
encouraged shalak to report the sighting to project Bluebook with which he did
however despite the fact that these professional astronomers insisted that the object was not a medeor blue book
investigators wrote in their official conclusion of the case quote was
astronomical meteor how about that I heard that
Project Blue Book officers labeled that case is a meteor I mean I laughed out
loud cuz they're not astronomers they are clearly debunking in this case
throwing away the almost unimpeachable testimony from people
who's train are trained observers and know what they saw and said over and over again this is not a meteor so for
Project Blue Book officers to call this a meteor is absolutely ludicrous just another
indication that as Jay Allen heinik himself said Project Blue Book was not a
true investig ative body what a travesty what a shame our own governments are
really mishandling this UFO situation up to this very day it's why I've often
said it I simply do not trust them I don't think we'll ever get true disclosure from them we need to look to
the firsthand Witnesses if we want the truth about what's going on with UFOs
and ETS and here's another case from a very well-known astronomer who also became
quite active in the field his name is Dr Percy Wilkins and he had a crazy
interesting sighting on to our next case June 11 1954 esteemed British lunar astronomer
Percy Wilkins
Dr Percy Wilkins was on a plane flying from Charleston West Virginia to Atlanta
Georgia when at 10:45 a.m. he saw two brilliant
oval-shaped objects hover hovering above the tops of cumulus clouds he estimates
about 2 miles away he said that these objects were quote sharp edged objects
they looked exactly like polished metal plates reflecting the sunlight so your
classic Flying Saucer and he says the objects were moving North against the direction of the clouds and he then saw
a third object which was behind the cloud dark and not reflecting any
sunlight and as he watched this third object suddenly accelerated arcing
across the sky and disappearing and he estimates that these objects were about 50 ft in
diameter and I love this quote from Percy welcom about this Z says if these
UFOs are made of solid matter and capable of moving by their own will in all directions and at all speeds then
they are built piloted and controlled by intellig inces that surpass that of
humans it's a very good observation another fantastic case and here we have
an astronomer saying flat out I think these are
extraterrestrial and you know it's one thing for people to speculate about what these are but when you have a firsthand
experience that's knowledge that is unimpeachable you you it's not
speculation whatsoever he's saw it and that's what I love about these
astronomer sightings is that they are really well educated and they can rule out all the natural astronomical
phenomena such as Venus and fireballs and ball lightning and what have you uh
something clearly is going on here all these Skeptics simply don't have a leg to stand on anymore because there are
too many well-trained observers who have seen UFOs very close up and this next case is probably my
favorite of the bunch because it involves an astronomer who's very well known very well educated highly
respected and he is Frank Hallstead and he had a really interesting sighting
which he was very vocal about and talked about it without any fear of ridicule or
disbelief and actually spoke against all the ridicule and disbelief that is surrounding this subject and is
causing even astronomers to remain silent it was on November 1st 1955 that
Frank Hallstead
astronomer Frank holstead who was then the director of darling observatory in
duth Minnesota he was traveling with his wife on a train through Death Valley
California and I will just quote Frank Hallstead directly as he says my wife
was sitting next to the window and she called my attention to an object which she saw something moving just above the
mountain range our train was running parallel to this range of mountains and
this thing was moving in the same direction as the train just above the
mountains at first I thought the thing was a blimp you know one of those cigar-shaped
durables but as I watched it I realized it could not be a blimp they are only
about 200 ft long and this thing was gigantic antic about 800 ft
long now suddenly they both saw a second object swoop up behind the first and as
Frank holstead says it was a dis shaped thing in fact both objects were very
shiny we noticed but this second one was definitely disk shaped and he estimates
that this second object was at least 100 ft in diameter and he and his wife
watched it for several minutes as both of these objects maneuvered about 100 ft over the ridge now that
certainly wouldn't be a derable not maneuvering like that not at that low altitude certainly not in that area and
as they watch these objects first rose slowly then faster and in a few seconds
darted away blimps don't Dart so clearly not a blimp now later Frank holstead
would become a member and an adviser for naikap again the national investigative
committee on aerial phenomena and he has some very strong
words about the whole UFO phenomena as Frank says all over the world credible
Witnesses are reporting experiences similar to mine holding these people up
to ridicule does not alter the existing facts the time is long overdue for
accepting the presence of these things whatever they are in dealing with them and the public on a basis of
realism you go Frank you tell him this is way back in 1955 he's still fighting
against UFO secrecy and what do we we're still dealing with this darn UFO coverup
here he is talking like almost 70 years ago and we're still trying to overcome
the ridicule and disbelief surrounding this subject it's ridiculous I think
you'll agree Frank halstead's sighting is truly amazing of a structured craft
he wasn't alone when he saw it Ian it's a great sighting now a discussion about UFOs and
astronomers of course wouldn't be complete unless we mentioned Jacques valet who as I'm sure you know is a true
Pioneer in this field has been working on UFO studies for many many decades and
came into this field as an astronomer very skeptical until he had an encounter
himself and saw that this subject was being covered up and evidence being
destroyed so just like to provide a brief quote from jacqu ble himself yeah
Jacques Valle
anyone who's been in the field of UFOs for any length of time knows jacqu Valle the author of countless books a very
vocal person on this subject of UFOs and he was an astronomer when he
became involved in this subject and I will just quote him directly as jacqu says when I was
beginning my career in science the main argument against UFOs was that
astronomers never saw them and I found that argument
convincing now this all changed in 1961 when he and others were at the Paris
observatory in France and they actually tracked an unexplained object and the
reaction to this absolutely stunned jacqu valet as he says in his own words
I thought here we are at a renowned institution seeing something we can't explain and destroying data for fear of
ridicule that for me reopened the entire question so yeah you heard that right
they were getting rid of the data of these UFOs because they didn't fit into the world view and they didn't want to
confront Skeptics for fear of ridicule that's not science so thankfully Jacques
fet said that's enough and that's what brought him in to the UFO field there
you go jacqu Val himself had an experience I know he had some interesting and somewhat controversial
theories about the origins of UFOs I don't think
he's completely ruled out the Extraterrestrial Theory despite what some people say I mean he did in fact
recently write a book Trinity about a UFO crash so I think it's important we
leave open the possibility I personally think that this is extraterrestrial in origin just based
on the evidence we all have the freedom of course to make up our own minds about
it and interpret the evidence as we will but to deny the possibility of extra
terrestrial origin for UFOs is I think fool hearty because you only need to
take a brief look at the sky see how many stars are out there and it would be
inconceivable that we are alone in this universe and certainly the evidence is showing us that we aren't alone and that
is what most contactees will tell you they believe UFOs and their experiences
can be explained as extraterrestrials the vast majority of them certainly okay and now I'd like to quote
for the great J Allen heck jayen heinik has who is I'm sure you know was the
astronomical consultant for Project Blue Book and while it's not super well known
he apparently had a sighting himself and he certainly has something to say say that's very important about when
astronomers see UFOs another person who I'm sure you've heard of if you've heard
Jay Allen Heinik
of UFOs is Jay Allen heck who for years was the Blue Book astronomy
consultant now in 1952 he did something very interesting
regarding UFOs and astronomers he held a conference with astronomers on this
subject which of course at the time was even more controversial and after interviewing 45
astronomers he learned that several of them had seen UFOs as he says over 40
astronomers were interviewed of which five had made sightings of one sort or
another this is a higher percentage than among the populace at large perhaps this
is to be expected since astronomers do after all watch the
skies now now Dr Jen heinik also apparently had a UFO sighting while the
exact date is unknown and I don't believe he ever spoke personally about it it was prior to
1972 he was on board an airline flight and saw an object outside his window
moving at the same speed of the plane he reached down grabbed his camera and snapped two photos but what the objects
were has never been determined yeah highneck is is a superstar in this field
when he talks about UFOs I think we really should listen because he's been
there he's done that he's studied it for many many years even his son to this day Paul hinek is in the UFO field on the
lecture circuit carrying on the legacy of his amazing
father and another gentleman who's an astronomer and very well respected is Dr
Peter sturk who wrote a book about UFOs approaching it from a very scientific
method and he found out some very interesting things about what happens
when astronomers see UFOs Dr Peter a sto is a professor of physics at Stanford
Peter Sturk
University and he decided to tackle the UFO subject in a scientific manner
because in 1977 he sent out
2,611 questions s all to members of the American Astronomical
Society and about half responded he received 1,356 responses 62 from astronomers who
said that they themselves had observed apparent UFOs but they said most of them that
they elected to remain silent in fear of damaging their credibility among their
colleagues and others said that they never had sighting but if they ever did they would not report it for the same
reasons again how can you possibly call this objective science so there you go I
mean how many cases do you need of astronomers who have seen UFOs there is a compilation of more than
300 astronomers who have seen UFOs it's not too hard to find on the internet if
you just type in astronomers and UFOs and perhaps type in some of the names I
presented above and you should be able to find it pretty easily yeah a lot of cases again it's a
complete misconception that astronomers don't see UFOs because they do
researcher Alejandro roas also spoke vocally about many of
the astronomers who have seen UFOs he has some interesting things to say for sure Alejandro roas is well known for
Alejandro Rojas
being one of the researchers on open Minds TV and he has spoken about this
connection between astronomers and UFOs because as he writes and I quote often
people will ask me if there are so many UFOs why aren't astronomers seeing them
they are in fact astronomers have been some of the most influential advocates
for the serious study of UFOs we reviewed some of these sightings and the
incredible contributions astronomers have made to the study of UFOs another
person who's been very vocal about UFOs recently is Harvard astronomer Avi
lob who has got some controversial views on this subject to say the least but has
put forth some very positive statements about UFO reality as we all know
Avi Loeb
withholding evidence or the truth does not help scientific progress
and Avi lobe a professor of astrophysics at Harvard University has been quoted on this
subject a number of times and as he says UFOs should be the subject of mainstream
inquiry science must bring Clarity and ail lob said in the July
2021 statement quote science should not reject potential extraterrestrial
explanations because of social stigma or cultural preferences that are not
conducive to the scientific method of unbiased empir empirical inquiry it's
quite a mouthful but yeah he's just basically saying we need to be objective and consider the possibility that we are
being visited by extraterrestrials I totally agree because I think that is
exactly what the evidence is showing us well there you go all you Skeptics out
there who say that it's astronomers haven't seen UFOs well they do and they are and they
have so I think this provides great ammunition for anyone who's trying to
convince a skeptic out there let them know that yes Edmund Hy Percy Wilkins
Frank holstead sear Hess so many astronomers out there have seen
UFOs that it's time to just leave that misconception behind it's not true and
again if you want to learn more about this I did put a chapter in my book not from here volume Five it's called when
astronomers see UFOs and I go into all these cases in some detail so definitely
check that out if you're interested but either way this is just another piece of
the puzzle that lets us know that this is a real thing going on here I don't
even like to use the word phenomenon because it's not it's just another
natural event in our universe we're not alone I don't see what's so hard to
believe about that fact is we are here living on a planet physical Flesh and
Blood beings who do have interdimensional aspects too by the way that does not preclude us from being
terrestrial or extraterrestrial or call it what you will I think the evidence
speaks very loudly that there are other people out there and these cases from astronomers again provide another piece
of the puzzle pointing towards this so that's this episode for today I hope
you've enjoyed it and perhaps learned a little bit I really appreciate you guys
watching I am truly honored and delighted and just want to thank you so
much for being a part of this journey and that's it until next time
keep asking those hard question questions always keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep
having fun that's it for now bye.
