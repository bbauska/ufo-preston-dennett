Among the most fascinating and extensive cases of UFO contact are landings and face-to-face encounters with humanoids. These accounts have volumes to teach us about the ETs, who they are, why they are here, and their agenda on our planet. This video presents five fascinating cases of UFO contact, each providing some profound and unique insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon.

THE ALIEN WITH THE BEAMING SPHERE. Late at night on June 14, 1968, Pedro Jacobo Pretzel of Villa Carlos Paz, Argentina, drove up to the Motel La Cuesta (which he owned) and saw two hovering red lights. He didn’t think much of. Going inside, he found his daughter, Maria, kneeling on the floor, babbling about a strange man. Maria had an amazing story to tell. She said that a tall blond man in a shiny blue jumpsuit had entered the motel and confronted her. He held a weird glowing sphere in his hand, which caused odd sensations in her body. “Don’t be afraid,” he said. Then he pointed a beam of light at her, causing her to float slowly to the ground. It was just the beginning of a complicated interaction with an ET. It was a case which would go all the way to the Argentine Air Force.

THE ALIENS ON THE MOUNTAINTOP. Around 8:30 pm, on October 19, 1973, Gabriel Demogue and his girlfriend took his motorcycle up Malmont Mountain near Draguignan, France. When she saw a UFO pacing them, she insisted they turn around, which they did. Returning to town, Gabriel told his friends what happened. Four of them decided to return to the mountain in two cars and investigate. To their shock, they came upon a UFO landed on top of the mountain, out of which came three ET figures. Two of the men fled in their car, while the other two found that their car’s engine failed. While trying to get away, they had repeated sightings of the ETs. Meanwhile, the friends who had fled the scene also saw the ETs crossing the road in front of them.

THE ALIEN ON LONGFORD ROAD. It was a late August afternoon in 1976 when three 10-year-old children, Susan and John Harris, and their friend Paul Smith went to play outside their homes on Longford Road West in Reddish, England. Susan went inside to get some juice. That’s when the boys heard a strange sound, saw a flash of light, and a human-looking ET dressed in a silver jumpsuit floated out of the bushes nearby. Moments later, he disappeared. Back in the house, Susan looked out the window and the same ET looking right at her. He turned, bent down and started taking soil samples from the ground. Susan screamed and the man disappeared. Running outside, she met with the boys and together they saw the strange man again. And shortly later, a flying saucer rose up from the field.

THE SOUTH MIDDLETON ALIENS. On the evening of January 7, 1978, Theresa Gould saw a bright object land behind her home in South Middleton, Massachusetts. She called a friend and strangely, the phonelines went dead. Unknown to her, Theresa’s relatives were trying to call. Her 14-year-old son, Douglas, had gone to sleep over and a strange glowing man appeared in the children’s bedroom. The father thought it was their imagination, until he saw the figure himself. The next day, Theresa’s husband, Thomas, was cutting wood on their property when he saw the same figure. He had seen it several times over the last month and tried to chase it down. He could never catch it, so this time, he just watched it. After an hour, it disappeared. Thomas drove near his home and came upon a landed UFO. He told his family, The next day when the UFO landed again. Soon everyone in the family began seeing the ETs.

THE ALIENS BY THE BOBR RIVER. Around dusk on July 8 or 9, 1990, Ryszard P parked his car along the Bobr River. Walking into the woods, he heard a strange sound and smelled an odd burning odor. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a huge silver object landed by the river. Inside a window of the craft, he saw two humanoids. But outside, he saw more than a dozen of the short figures. They wore helmets with white faceplates and mummy-like green uniforms. Their arms flexed in both directions, but their legs seemed bound together. The beings jumped around like kangaroos. Each held a tubelike device in their hands, which they were using to test or measure the vegetation. Ryszard watched in awe, and then he coughed. At that moment, he lost all awareness. He woke up, still standing, but found that an hour had passed. The craft and the beings were gone, but the effects on Ryszard had only just begun.

These five cases show how UFO encounters can be both strikingly similar and incredibly different. The shapes of the UFO craft show great variation. And the different types of ETs. But each involves unknown craft and face-to-face encounters with humanoids. These kinds of cases make it clear that we are not alone, that people all over the planet are being visited by many different kinds of extraterrestrials.

Introduction
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I call this episode five fantastic face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials don't get me 
wrong sightings are very interesting but I love those cases involving landed UFOs and face-to-face 
encounters with ETS and that's what this episode is about every one of these cases involves a 
landed UFO and humanoids of some kind now these cases do come from all over the world they spend 
decades all but one of them involve multiple Witnesses some do have physical evidence of 
various kinds as well they're pretty well verified investigated by professional UFO researchers 
there are cases in the United States on South America Europe of course so pretty widespread 
what's interesting about these cases is because they're so extensive they have a lot of information they have a lot to offer in terms of the different types of 
ETS that people encounter the different things that can happen when someone has a face-to-face 
encounter and they're just darn interesting because some of them contain very strange and 
unique Elements which always seems to be the case when people have an extensive encounter 
so let's just get right to it because there's quite a bit of information with these cases 
and I called the first case the alien with the beaming sphere I have to say I haven't heard a 
case quite like this one involves some really strange elements in a number of different ways 
as we shall see and it also has confirming Witnesses this one occurred in Via Carlos Paz 
Argentina this very complex case began around 1am on June 14 1968 when Senor Pedro jacobo 
The Alien with the Beaming Sphere
Pretzel was driving Northeast along the national 20 road again this is in Via Carlos Paz Argentina 
now he had almost reached the motel La Cuesta which he owned and this is when he saw red lights 
ahead of him sort of alongside the highway now he first thought these were the red tail lights of 
another vehicle but as he got close he could see that this could not possibly be the case because these lights were in fact floating about five feet above the road and were very 
widely spread from each other a distance of he estimates about 15 feet between them 
and it was his impression that these these were attached to a very large solid object 
and whatever it was was hovering near his hotel about 200 feet off the side of the road 
so he wasn't thinking too much of it but he drove into his hotel and as he did he got into the parking lot he noticed something else that was a little bit 
peculiar most of the lights in his hotel were off this was unusual they're supposed to be on 
and then he went inside and he was shocked to see that his daughter 19 year old Maria 
elodia Pretzel was kneeling on the floor with her head in her hands she was very upset in 
fact she could barely speak she was so upset and finally she blurted out to her father a man a man 
so at this point Senor Pedro is thinking there's an intruder so he quickly searched 
the premises and found nobody he returned inside and asked Maria what happened 
and Maria explained that she had just shown out two Hotel guests who had left the hotel she had 
returned inside and this is when she noticed that there was a strange light in the dining room area 
so she was curious about that and entered into the room and she saw a very strange looking 
male figure he was pretty tall over six feet tall and looked basically human he had a human 
The Alien with the Spear
face and blonde hair however he was wearing a shiny skin-tight light blue one-piece coverall 
and it had a blue belt the suit itself had a texture that reminder of fish scales but he had 
very pale skin and he had this weird smile on his face now this is not the only thing that's strange 
in his left hand he held a large glassy spear which was emitting a blue white beam of light 
and he was swinging his arm back and forth shining this beam back and forth on the floor of the room 
Maria at this point also noticed that the back door was open so she assumed that's how this 
strange figure had entered into their hotel at this point she's about 20 feet away from 
him but as soon as she saw him she said her body started to feel very strange sensation 
almost like it was being distorted or drawn out sideways or made thinner particularly her face 
but really her whole body she had a hard time describing exactly what she meant by that 
but at this point she was quite afraid she wanted to scream but she couldn't and in fact 
she felt like someone else had entered entered into her brain and was kind of controlling her 
to a certain degree now she was able to raise her arms but at that point could no longer move 
and this is when she heard a very loud and Stern voice speaking to her telepathically in 
a male voice and it said don't be afraid don't be afraid this was speaking in Spanish and not once 
or twice but over and over and over almost like a recording now here's where it gets even stranger 
suddenly without knowing how she got there Maria found herself in a different position in the room 
she was no longer at the entrance of the dining room she was instead gripping the counter of the 
nearby bar area which was just a short distance away but definitely not the same place where 
she had been and now she was much closer to this strange man about nine feet away and he 
of course was still swinging this weird sphere back and forth sending out this beam of light 
Maria couldn't move but she did feel her legs tingling as though they had quote gone to sleep 
so now she's much closer to this man who is still smiling and she could see that on his right hand 
he wore a square black device which kind of fit over the top of his hand sort of like a gauntlet 
and on the fingers of his right hand were also emitting light perhaps due to this strange 
instrument at any rate he raised his right arm at which point something very strange happened 
Maria's entire body became drained of strength and she fell in very slow motion to the floor 
and stopped about a foot above it just hanging there at that point her body Rose back up into 
a vertical position and she was able to again cling to the bar top so it's pretty clear that 
whatever is happening to her this gentleman the strange ET is causing this to happen 
and he did it again he raised his right arm again and this time Maria's body fell again 
in super slow motion to the right almost hitting the floor but again stopping just above the floor 
and then again she was floated back up to a vertical position the whole time this man's still 
smiling and still repeating telepathically over and over again do not be afraid 
now at this point he started to approach her this really quite frightened her but there was 
nothing she could do she couldn't move but as it got closer and closer she noticed another 
very peculiar fact there was light which appeared to be coming out of his toes too 
so all at once this weird glowing sphere in his left hand stopped emitting this beam of light and 
it turned to a dark blue color at the same time that do not be afraid refrain that was repeating 
over and over in her head completely stopped the men turned around and apparently walked out 
we didn't fully see this because at this point she fell to the floor in a state of nervous shock 
and this is how her father found her shortly later so this is what she told her father and 
together they went to the police station which was very close to the hotel just across the street 
the police were very Cooperative they took the report and here's where it gets even more interesting within one day UFO researchers later learned the police forwarded the police report 
buy special request to the Argentine Air Force so this was something the officials in the Argentine Air Force were taking very seriously 
and turned out there was more eyewitnesses was later discovered that their neighbors 
right next door had seen strange lights in the field during the time of Maria's encounter 
this case did get a quite a bit of press coverage and was eventually published in the Flying Saucer 
Journal which gave it a full accounting I think you'll agree that's an absolutely fascinating case 
with multiple Witnesses I think what intrigues me the most is not only the appearance of the 
ET but the tools he was using this weird beaming sphere that device on his right hand 
and really I think what's super bizarre is how it affected the main witness Maria her falling down 
in slow motion and then being lifted right back up over and over again I mean that's just I don't 
even know what to think of it it's very strange so certainly an interesting case and here is another 
and this one I call the aliens on the Mountaintop this is again a really extensive case involving 
four Witnesses this went on for hours the location of this case is in the city of dragunyan France 
I might be mispronouncing that I'm I apologize I'm doing my best but this technically occurred 
on melmont mountain and the four Witnesses had gone up there and as we shall see they had an 
incredible and very extensive encounter with a landed UFO and multiple extraterrestrials it was 
The Landed UFO
around 8 30 p.m on October 19 1973 when Gabriel de mag and his girlfriend decided that they were 
going to take a drive up on his motorcycle up to the 1500 foot high mountain peak called malmal 
now this translates in French by the way to evil mountain or bad Mountain so that's kind 
of curious at any rate they were going up this little narrow road to the top of this mountain 
which overlooks the city of dragunyan and it was his girlfriend who first noticed an 
orange yellow glowing sphere sort of pacing them as they were approaching the summit and 
it wasn't very far away from them about 1500 1600 feet they estimate and they watched it 
kind of Zoom forward up to the summit ahead of them now this frightened Gabriel's girlfriend 
and she said no I don't want to go up there take me home and so he agreed to take her home 
and once he got home he started telling his friends about what they had seen his friends 
were very interested in UFOs so they decided to investigate four of them Gabriel himself stayed 
behind but his friends including Arlene leika took his car up there with one of his friends 
and two other guys uh Georges mccret followed in his car with his friend Christian bensa 
so there's four people in two separate cars and they take this narrow road up to the summit 
and at the top there's this little sort of display marker and benches and they had arrived there 
parked the cars and were exploring and looking at this little spot which overlooks the city and it 
was shortly after they had arrived and allowed their eyes to become accustomed to the darkness that they noticed a strange white glow at the very top of this mountain this is just about 240 feet 
away there's a little pathway leading up to the top so they can see this light at the same time 
they hear this strange kind of whistling staticky noise I had a hard time describing this noise 
but no sooner do they see this light and hear this noise when they felt a very strong wave of heat 
sweep right over them they could feel this very clearly and following this they saw a 
red light leaving the white light on top of the mountain and start moving towards them 
and it became pretty clear to them that this was a figure because they could hear the sound of heavy 
footsteps and Pebbles being brushed out of the way as this red light approached so they became 
concerned and a little bit frightened and they all decided to hide Elaine he laid down on one 
of the benches while the other three hid behind a low wall a short distance away Now Elaine signaled 
them all to wait and he would see what happened next because he was the closest to his figure 
so they all watched as this they could see now the Silhouettes of two figures one was six feet 
high pretty much normal height but the other was not he was closer to nine feet tall and it just 
kept approaching and approaching and pretty soon these figures were about 75 feet away from them 
at this point they're much closer to their cars the figures are than the witnesses themselves 
at this point the figures stopped appeared to bend down and pick something up the red light 
which was on the uniform apparently of one of these figures uh went out became extinguished 
but they could hear this same figure walk right up to Elaine's car and actually began shaking the car 
so at this point the four Witnesses pretty much panicked Elaine signaled his three other friends 
that it was time to run away so George and Christian fled to their car meanwhile Elaine 
and his friend ran for his car and Elaine and his friend were about to enter it this is a 
little Fiat when this powerful beam of light Shone down on them from the very peak of the mountain 
so they Dove to the ground in fear taking cover waited for the light to stop which it did after a 
short time and when it went out they got into their car but no surprise it wouldn't start 
meanwhile their friends Georges and Christian just drove off leaving Elaine and his friend behind 
luckily Elaine's car was facing downhill so he and his friend opened the door and pushed started it 
down and were able to get the engine running and they drove the car just a short distance and this 
is when Elaine stopped the car and looked back and he says that about 18 feet behind his car 
he could see this figure and looking more closely he sees it's not just one figure or two but three 
so this concerned him he drove about 40 feet forward but again became curious and looked back 
at this point the three figures behind them had stopped so he became even more intrigued and he 
decides he's gonna back up now his passenger wasn't happy about this but Elaine did decide 
to back up he backed up his car about 15 feet away from the figures stopped the car and began to get 
out again his passengers not happy but doesn't do much about it so Elaine steps about halfway 
out of the car faces them and says are you good or are you bad now according to Elaine the three 
figures now began to advance towards them in weird jerky steps then stopped when he spoke looked at 
each other and appeared to be conversing because they were making these weird whistling noises 
so he can see the these figures now because his tail lights are on and he says our they seem 
to be wearing helmets one is wearing a weird sort of gas mask type device or so he thought 
and at this point these three figures started to approach more quickly this freaked Elaine out so 
they hop back into their car and drive off again so he drives about 150 feet and stops to see if 
the figures are following and they aren't now at this point his car is at a point where there's a 
wide spot he's able to turn around and that's what he does now his friend meanwhile is absolutely 
frantic with fear and is begging Elaine to stop and continue going down the mountain but Elaine 
doesn't do this he turns the car around and drives back up only to see that the figures are now gone 
but this encounter gets even more complex because meanwhile there are other friends who had fled the 
scene and left them behind that's Georges McRae and Christian bensa they're driving down in their 
own car fleeing the scene and they said that they drove about 300 feet down the mountain came around 
a curve at which point they saw a figure with kind of a glowing red suit run across the root Road 
right in front of their car in just two steps and at that very moment their headlights and Dashboard 
Lights Went Out George slammed on the brakes just for a moment so that he wouldn't hit them but as 
this figure disappeared they continued driving now his friend Christian says he was so frightened 
he Dove down and hid underneath the car's dashboard he refused to get out he remained 
hidden under the dashboard there as they continued driving another 450 feet to a parking area 
towards the bottom of this small Mountain and there they waited for just a few seconds for 
the other car not long and it wasn't arriving and George says he was just too frightened to 
drive back up there or even to wait both men were pretty much in a state of panic so they continued 
to drive and they had gone less than a mile they were pretty much off the mountain at this point 
when they saw another figure apparently the same figure crossed the road ahead of them again 
now Christian didn't see it actually he was still hiding under the dashboard but George did see it 
but they got off the mountain and we're about halfway to the city of dragunyan when they said 
their car was struck by a mysterious Force which through it physically sideways at a right angle to 
the road and then suddenly Struck it again pushing the car back in the right direction on the road 
and off they went to the city that freaked them out so they returned to the outskirts 
of the city and there they did wait for their friends the other car arrived shortly later all four men shared their experience Now Elaine was still curious and very excited so he and the 
original witness Gabriel de nog decided to return to the site nothing was there no light or figures 
however both men did smell a very weird odor which they said was somewhat similar to Burnt insulation 
yeah a truly astonishing encounter it's amazing to me that it went on for so long and loved so 
many witnesses and that some of them returned to the scene and continued their encounter and even 
leaving the scene apparently these ZTS followed them I mean it's just an interesting encounter 
on many different levels and here's another one this is an encounter involving three children 
who saw not only an ET but upon investigating Came Upon the landed UFO 
I find the behavior of this ET particularly fascinating not to mention his appearance 
I call this one the alien on Langford Road and this occurred in reddish England 
it's quite an amazing case now this case was investigated by Jenny Randalls a very experienced 
The Three Twins
UFO researcher and it occurred on the afternoon of August 1976 and involved three ten-year-old 
children who at their parents request have remained anonymous they were given pseudonyms by 
the researchers the Witnesses are Susan and John Harris who are twins and their friend Paul Smith 
what's interesting about this case is the exact location is known and it took place right off 
of Langford Road West in North reddish this is somewhat close to the border of Manchester 
and again this is a pretty urbanized area there's a waste dump nearby a school a railway line 
and it was around 1 pm and the children were playing in the field alongside Longford Road 
and one of the twins Susan decided she was going to go inside and fix some orange drinks 
for herself and her brother and friend so while she's inside the boys remain 
outside and they saw this bright flash of light and heard a weird crackling noise 
and looking in the direction of the noise they saw this strange figure emerging from the bushes
now he looked generally human he had long blonde hair a short Gray beard but his skin was very pale 
he had very long narrow slanted eyes that reminded the witnesses of cat eyes so his 
eyes were definitely not normal and the clothes he was wearing were also very strange he was wearing 
a one-piece silvery jumpsuit with what looked like buttons down the front and a belt containing 
what they thought was several small pouches he had silver gloves on and big black boots 
but he was not walking he was floating about six inches above the ground so the boys watched in 
shock when this man suddenly vanished Into Thin Air as one of the witnesses John says 
it was like a light bulb being switched off one a minute he was there the next he was gone 
so meanwhile Susan the other twin is inside and had just finished making the orange drinks 
when she heard this strange kind of rustling sound right outside the window she walked up 
to the window and looked out and there was this figure who is now standing just a few 
feet away from her right outside the window and in fact they locked gazes for just a few seconds 
the man didn't really react he just kind of turned away grabbed a small shovel from his 
belt and began to take soil samples from the yard and deposit them in the pouches around his waist 
now Susan could instantly see that this was not a normal man she became frightened and 
yelled for her brother and friend at that exact moment the man blinked out again and vanished 
so she runs outside and told the boys what she had seen and they said that they had seen the 
same figure so all three of them decided to go back to this field and investigate and as they're 
walking through this field very near the school they saw this figure again a short distance away 
he was stooped down by the fence and apparently collecting more soil samples 
now he didn't seem to be aware of the children or certainly wasn't reacting to them 
but as they watched him after just a few moments he disappeared again and the children said it was weird because it almost looked as if he went quote down into the 
ground and just vanished now where he was standing there was a little dip or a hollow in the ground 
so that could account for that possibly but that's what the kids said and they walked up to this spot to investigate and this is when they saw a saucer-shaped object 
sort of your classic Flying Saucer Rise Up from the playground area of the school 
as you can see from the drawing it had a flat bottom two dark spots along the edge and what 
looked like four dark portholes around this small raised Dome it Rose very slowly in a vertical 
position and then started to move in a horizontal trajectory South Southeast towards Tennyson Road 
as soon as it was gone the kids ran home and told their parents the parents could see that the kids were telling the truth because they were so emotional about it 
in fact the parents confirmed to investigators that the kids were quite frightened and upset to 
the point that all three of them were too scared to go out outside at night after that and in fact 
John was so scared he wouldn't come out during the day to play so it's a pretty interesting case the 
kids did try sharing their experience with their friends but they were ridiculed and disbelieved so 
they learned to keep quiet like many witnesses do but they were very Cooperative with investigators 
who were able to go directly to the scene didn't find any physical evidence except perhaps a 
broken fence where this guy had disappeared so they couldn't say that that had anything to do with the actual case so that appears to be a typical case of a human-looking ET taking 
various soil samples carrying around his little shovel and putting the soil into little pouches 
it's interesting that the Witnesses were able to get so close to the ET it's interesting how you 
would just disappear in a Flash it's also quite interesting that this occurred in a place that's 
relatively urbanized so you'd think there would be other Witnesses possibly there were but as we 
have found out most people do not report their encounters but yeah certainly a fascinating case 
and here's another one I call this next case the South Middleton aliens 
and this involves an entire family and actually their relatives as well who had a very long and 
extensive and complicated series of encounters this is by no means a one-off this was sightings 
going back years and it really came to a Peak at one point where pretty much every member of the 
family had face-to-face encounters this very interesting looking extraterrestrial so yeah 
as we shall see this is a very interesting case which occurred in South Middleton Massachusetts 
this next case involves the Gould family who live along River Road in South Middleton Massachusetts 
The Gould Family
this occurred on January 9 1978 but again that's just when the events came to sort of 
a climax it's a complex case involving multiple incidents which actually reached back to 1962 
and move on forward through the years but it was the events of January 9th through 12th in 
1978 that really caught the attention of the witnesses and of course later the researchers 
the Gould family includes Mr Thomas Gould who is at that time 50 years old his wife 
Teresa 51 and their children Alan age 21 Nancy age 20 and 14 year old Douglas 
so it was around 7 30 p.m on January 9 1978 when Teresa the mother saw this large yellow orange 
light coming down to the ground outside their home she says it actually may have been more than one 
light as many as three it was in view for about 15 or 20 seconds she ran outside in time to see it 
wink out behind the trees so she went inside and called a friend to tell her hung up the phone and 
decided to call her friend again but at this point the phone was dead and meanwhile unknown to Teresa 
her relatives nearby were trying to call her but couldn't reach her obviously because the 
phone was dead and by coincidence or for whatever reason on that same night 14 year old Douglas had 
decided to sleep at this relative's house now these relatives have requested anonymity so we 
don't know their names at any rate Douglas and the other children had gone to bed 
and it was only about 15 minutes or so 20 minutes after they had gone to bed around 7 30 or 8. 
when they woke up and one of the children started screaming daddy there's a man over there and he 
was trying to touch me and this child described seeing a white figure at the foot of his bed 
now the father told his child that it must have been a dream and exited the room but as he closed the door at this point he heard a knock coming from inside another nearby room which 
was unoccupied so you open the door to investigate heard a knock on the window and looking out the 
window saw a white figure standing on the roof of the porch right outside the window looking in the 
window it shouldn't be possible for someone to be up on the roof of the porch like that 
at any rate the figure looked like it was wearing a hood or a mask 
though the father could see two dark eye holes and this apparently disappeared because he went 
outside and later and saw this figure again nearby standing by the porch and again it disappeared 
so he didn't know quite what to make of it but it was the very next day that events escalated 
January 10th back at the Gould residence the father Thomas was chopping wood outside around 
2 30 P.M when he saw apparently the same white hooded figure it was about 90 feet away from him 
it was quite short he said it was about four and a half feet tall had a squarish helmet two dark eye 
hauls broad shoulders and gloved hands now this was not the first time Thomas had seen this figure 
and in fact he'd seen this same figure four or five times the previous month in December of 1977. 
and on those occasions he had tried to chase this figure down but it always disappeared so this time 
he decided he wasn't going to chase it he was just going to watch it and the figure watched him back 
and this was kind of a stare-off that went on for about an hour and this figure never 
moved the whole time so after it left Tom got in his truck and was driving down the road 
and he couldn't believe what he saw there was a large white object landed on the ground 
and I'll just quote Thomas directly as he says and I quote it was egg-shaped wider at the front 
than at the back it's got little Windows all over the sides of it the windows look like a frog's 
eye it had a hood like thing over the windows the surface was dark gray and looked roughly textured 
uh it was this object was about 40 feet long 13 and a half feet wide and 10 feet high 
and it was parked about 300 feet away from where Tom had seen this being so he's looking at this 
thing he can see that it's a landed UFO but he was too afraid to approach it and left the area 
he went home told his family who oddly did not believe him and laughed thinking he was joking 
our researchers later investigated the site and found broken branches and Thomas confirmed that 
those branches were not broken before deciding so that does appear to be landing traces 
but it was the next day events escalated even more January 11th Tom went outside to cut wood 
and saw this same UFO in the same exact spot so this time he decided he wasn't going to be the 
only witness he called out his son Alan and his daughter Nancy now it's around dusk at this time 
and they came out and they could see this object all three of them they got to about within 50 feet of it Nancy wanted to go closer but her father said no that's not a good idea but 
Nancy confirmed what Thomas had described she said that there were about seven windows or portholes 
and describe the object the same way as our father did it's kind of like an egg laying on its side 
so events continued the next day on January 12th Allen was in the bathroom this is around 10 A.M 
when he saw an object rising up from the ground about 100 feet away from their home 
and he like the other Witnesses said had a dull sort of smooth metallic surface silver gray 
looked very much like a flattened disc it was flat on the bottom and round on top and as it 
Rose upwards he could see two Landing legs on the bottom so after it took off and disappeared 
he went to the location where he had seen it rise up and did find Landing traces Holes about four 
and a half inches deep and six feet wide as you can see here this was later confirmed and viewed 
by researcher David F Webb and of course this is when the researchers really started digging 
in and learned that activity had been going on for years all the way back to June of 1962 
when the grandmother had seen a brilliant round light that had separated into four different objects that casted multi-colored rays of light onto the ground for about five minutes 
and it just went on and on after that in 1974 Allen who was then a much younger teenager saw 
a yellow orange red object sort of land behind the pool said it was cigar shaped and pretty big 
much larger than the 18 foot long pool it went straight up and out of sight now that same year 
the entire family had gone on vacation at Coleman State Park in Colebrook New Hampshire and all of 
Coleman State Park
them saw a very large cigar-shaped object probably connected to all the events that were going on 
back at their home but from 1973 to 1977 each and every member of the family reported seeing 
The Goulds
strange figures of different types one was a human looking figure that would prowl around the house 
and they could see he had dark pants and a white shirt and hair long dark hair 
could never see his face but they saw him so many times and on several occasions 
in fact the police were called the police patrolled the area and never saw this figure 
so it's hard to say what this figure is but they the witnesses don't believe he's human because he 
was walking in a very strange way very very slowly very erect with the arms rigid by its side and the 
knees never bent so a very stiff legged walk and many of them saw it I mean the grandmother saw 
the figure from the porch only seven feet away for a second she thought that this was one of 
the members of the family and turned to call the son Douglas that's who she thought it was 
and she looked back and the figure was gone now in November of 1977 Douglas saw the same 
white helmeted figure walking again stiff as a board it went right behind the shed so he 
called his father Tom to investigate Douglas was too frightened Tom went behind the shed and saw 
this figure and walked right up to it and it was very interesting because this figure was about 
four and a half feet tall wearing a white suit a gray helmet and sort of mittens on his hand 
and he reached out to touch it on the shoulder at which point it completely disappeared 
now during this whole period the Gould's home was stricken with all kinds of poltergeist activity 
doors opening and closing objects moving weird buzzing sounds strange sulfur-like 
odors probably the weirdest of these events was that knives would be jammed into the door jambs 
making them very difficult if not impossible to open and that happened over and over again so 
that was very strange but over and over again they kept seeing these figures including Grays 
on one occasion Doug and his cousin saw two gray-skinned figures which they described as 
having large wrap around dark blue eyes bald heads they became very frightened and ran away 
so all members saw all these different types of figures from Grays to this white helmeted figure 
to this other sort of Prowler one cousin saw one of these Grays looking at her through the window 
at a very low level and she said described it as a typical gray except said it had sort of 
gold looking eyes so this appeared so many times that all of them were able to get a really good 
look at one time or another as you can see from the many drawings we see here it's interesting 
because there's so many different types of figures we're looking at human looking all these sort of 
suited figures and of course these grays quite a complex case that I suspect is still ongoing so 
The Aliens by the Bobbi River
those are the experiences of the Gould family live along River Road in South Middleton Massachusetts 
as you can see it's a very complicated series of events involving multiple types of ETS ongoing UFO 
sightings physical evidence it's a great case and I suspect the events I presented here are just the 
tip of the iceberg but yeah what a case I think it does have a lot to offer in terms of understanding 
ET Behavior how people react to it the UFO phenomena in general 
and here's another case this one is super interesting it does involve only one witness 
but it has got some very unusual elements I call this one the aliens by the bober river 
and this took place in Poland actually more specifically near the town of brazca Poland 
and I don't think the witness realized what was going to happen to him when he pulled over and 
decided to stretch his legs and take a little walk into the forest but as we shall see he 
had an encounter that he would remember for the rest of his life this next and final case was 
investigated by polish researcher Damien trailer he's the author of several books in Polish about 
UFOs and it occurred on either July 8th or 9th of 1990 the witness isn't sure but the main witness 
his name is rizard p does not want his full last name used but he had been driving for many hours 
and decided that he was going to stop by the side of the road and this is near the bridge over the 
riverbober which you can see right here this is the exact spot of the encounter it pulled over 
along right off to the bridge alongside the river and decided he was going to stretch his legs by 
taking a short walk into the forest and so he had walked maybe a few hundred feet into the forest 
and this is when he heard a very strange sound which he couldn't really describe other than 
it was definitely not Birds I'm looking towards the source of this noise he saw a landed craft 
and it was shaped like an upside down Ball but quite narrower quite tall 
he said it was gray green in color and around the perimeter of this object there was a bright 
glowing band of light very intense very brilliant the object itself wasn't quite on the ground it 
appeared to be resting on a beam of light that was the impression of the witness but yeah quite large 
he said it was 75 but yeah quite large he said it was 75 feet across and about 15 feet in height 
and as he's looking at it he noticed a strange odor which he said was somewhat unpleasant but 
reminiscent of burnt chocolate and of course he immediately noticed that surrounding this 
craft were about 15 humanoid figures quite short bustling around next to the craft most of them 
he did see two inside the craft through what was either a window or a transparent section 
the rest were outside and he said they looked strange they almost looked like mummies he said 
they were dressed in tight-fitting uniforms the color of quote rotten peas so I guess 
that's sort of a dark green color at any rate they were very peculiar he says their arms 
were very strange as the elbows seemed to bend in both directions or that was his impression 
you couldn't see their faces as they had a sort of a helmet over their heads and where their 
faces would be there was a white mask very much like a welding mask or almost mirrored he said 
on this helmet or this helmet-like thing over their head you could see slight protrusions 
where the ears would be now they had no visible necks but broad shoulders very thick torsos 
that he said resembled a quote stuffed sack you can see the drawing here he said their hips were 
unnaturally large and even more strange their legs appeared to be joined together 
now they each held a tube-like device in their gloved hands and seemed to be touching 
the various vegetation in the area with these tubes as if measuring or testing them somehow 
even more strange was the way they moved they didn't walk like a normal person but took broad 
jumps very much he said like a kangaroo would now the witness razard said that he had the 
impression that the beings were aware of his presence but didn't care just kind of ignored 
him that is until he coughed and at that moment as soon as he coughed he says he lost consciousness 
now he woke up and he was still standing in the exact same position however to his shock 
an hour had passed the craft and the beings were no longer visible he could still smell this burnt 
chocolate odor which actually persisted for a day in fact he says when he went home that 
night he had a lot of trouble sleeping which I can imagine I mean that's quite a dramatic encounter 
and a very unusual case so that's the last case I'd like to present today but yeah that's a very 
interesting case involving a very interesting type of E.T I don't think I've heard one quite like 
that his the witnesses missing time event is also very unusual I mean the whole case has got some 
very interesting elements to it but apparently very well researched and just plain interesting 
so that's the show for today I hope you found this interesting perhaps learn something new again I 
love how these cases are spread out all over the planet although they've been occurring for decades 
how they involve so many different Witnesses how they present all different kinds of evidence 
those who are skeptical of UFOs simply haven't done their research the evidence is there for 
anyone with the courage to objectively examine it there's no doubt we are being visited by ETS as 
these cases show and of course as you know this is just the very tip of the iceberg so that's it for 
now I want to thank you once again for watching it's truly appreciated until next time keep 
searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun bye now.
