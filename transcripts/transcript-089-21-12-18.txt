THE FLYING SAUCER AND THE ATLANTEAN BRACELET
Dec 18, 2021

Summary:
Dec 18, 2021
UFO encounters are known for their high strangeness. While cases of alien contact do have many 
similarities, each case is also unique, and sometimes contains bizarre and unusual details never 
reported before. One such case of very high strangeness comes from a gentleman by the name of 
James Santiago. 

James Santiago was a popular and successful nightclub performer. In 1982, James and a friend, a 
world-famous artist named Cleo Jensen (pseudonym,) began a two-day-long road-trip through the 
Canadian Rockies. What James didn't know is that Cleo was a UFO contactee. Shortly after their 
trip began, Cleo revealed her secret and told James that she was being followed by UFOs, and 
that she had been having ET contact her whole life.

James had never given much thought to UFOs, and he wasn't sure what to think about his friend's 
strange announcement. And then, while in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, Cleo announced that a 
UFO was coming, and they were about to have an extraterrestrial encounter. 

So began one of the strangest events in James's life. A glowing green flying saucer appeared and 
began to pace their vehicle. And then events went from strange to bizarre, forever altering the 
course of James's life. The first encounter was followed by several others, one after another, 
leaving James with a whole new awareness, not only of humanity's place in the universe, but of 
his own life. James began to look at other unexplained events in his life, from childhood onwards, 
and realized that he himself was very likely a UFO contactee.

This unique account of UFO contact reveals some interesting and profound insights into the nature 
of the UFO phenomenon, and it shows just how bizarre and strange UFO contact can be.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal 
i call this episode the flying saucer and the atlantean bracelet this is one of the most 
unusual stories of UFO contact I have ever heard it has unique elements lots of high strangeness 
and I think it provides some really important and profound insights into the nature of the UFO 
phenomenon this account comes from a gentleman by the name of james santiago he was a very wealthy 
famous nightclub performer and singer and his story begins in 1982 in calgary canada I am going 
to play live clips of my interview with james so you'll be able to hear his story in his own words 
so in 1982 james was performing in calgary canada it was a month-long engagement it went very well 
he got standing ovations every night and his next engagement was in vancouver canada which is 
on the other side of the rocky mountains some hundreds of miles away on the west coast of canada 
and james was planning to fly because he absolutely hates long car rides and then 
his plans changed when his makeup artist a lady I'll call melanie that's not her real name wanted 
to introduce james to her mother I'll call her cleo turns out melanie's mother cleo is a world 
famous artist she's not only famous she's super successful extremely wealthy and has paintings 
hanging in museums and important institutions all across the united states and the world and 
james himself being an accomplished artist was pretty excited to meet cleo melanie warned him 
that cleo was a very very eccentric woman and all these strange and wild things happened to her 
and although melanie warned him about this james wasn't too concerned he himself was a 
little bit eccentric and uh being an accomplished artist he was very excited to meet her as well 
and then when he met cleo he was a bit taken aback because cleo was quite strange she was an 
elderly woman well her mid mid 50s somewhat heavy set she had long white hair which she tied up 
in sort of a may west knot she wore makeup in a very peculiar way with dark rings around her eyes 
she was very opinionated she had a hundred little idiosyncrasies she was a very strong vegan uh 
she was just a very strange woman but james was entranced by her and cleo herself 
uh was delighted by james and they became good friends very quickly 
and it turned out that cleo had an engagement in vancouver at the same time 
james did and she invited james to ride along with her into vancouver 
james didn't want to do it he hates long car rides he told her and he absolutely refused 
but melanie also encouraged james to go ahead you'll have a good time you guys will have fun 
james didn't want to go on this car ride but both cleo and melanie kept encouraging him 
and finally he gave in and as james says in his own words she was a very strange woman 
really strange a very peculiar person so I'm definitely not driving with her 
but she worked on me for a week and a half I cannot tell you to this day why I agreed to do it 
but finally I said okay I caved under the pressure and I did it so the time 
arrived for them to leave and cleo and james got into the car and took off on this 
long would be a two day long road trip across the canadian rockies and about 15 minutes into the 
trip cleo made a very strange announcement and I'll just let james describe what cleo said so
we get in the car and she's got like this james bond secret agent car was this old 
giant lanyard monte carlo right and it was blue blue blue and it was all shiny you know 
then um white leather on the insides and you know an upper scale car but it's not 
you know like a rolls or something like that anyway so this is and it's big and 
square and gigantic lanyard like those old lincoln continentals you know it was just huge so
i get in the car with her I can't believe him getting in the car I mean they're just like like 
oh god you [ __ ] what are you doing I'm hating it right so we start driving and we're just 
pretty much quiet about 25 miles out of town where there was nothing she stops and says oh 
um do you have any pennies on you I'm like oh yeah I have pennies and she said do you have 
a lot do you have a lot of change I said oh I have a box of change in my luggage you know just 
changing it but I it collects so much so easy right so this big box of change and she said 
well would you mind taking out all the pennies in the the quarters that are sandwiched with copper 
no why and she's like well um I think you should know I'm being followed by UFOs 
and I'm like oh my god there I am in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere in canada with this 
crazy woman right who's being followed by UFOs and she wants to know if I have any cover you know so
well I said well here let's open the bag so I take my get my luggage and I take 
out this box of change that I have and I say kid and he said come here 
here this is your lucky day to give this box of change to this kid you know I'm sure his mother 
still doesn't believe that story but anyway you know he probably got about 40 bucks and change 
right but it was just I'm not gonna stop and go through every coin I get back in the car 
and she says you don't believe me do you well she had her whole car everything that was copper 
replaced in silver that's what she told me so there was nothing but this car had some I mean 
i don't know how many hundred thousand dollars she paid for this car because it did it was like 
a james bond car it had all this weird stuff in it and I but it looked like a normal car but 
her daughter told me well you know my mom lives in her car this is a wealthy woman 
a very wealthy woman she does she can have houses everywhere but she lives in this monte carlo 
and she checks into a hotel and changes the hotel every two days or even two or three days 
right but nowhere ever than three and travels all over the place doing that 
and enterprise possessions are in that or were in that blue car and
so I was to find out a little bit about that car as this trip progressed so after this little 
incident uh james kind of regrets getting into the car with this very strange woman 
who is being followed she says by UFOs but it's too late now so he just continues the trip 
and as the trip progresses it turns out they have a really good time they start discussing all these really interesting subjects such as ghosts atlantis other esoteric and spiritual subjects 
cleo basically gave james a very advanced spiritual education and james was absolutely 
fascinated by this woman and just had a great time with her so they drive into the foothills 
of the rocky mountains around dusk they find a restaurant a little cafe and have 
dinner and this is when something very strange happened something that james remembers because 
particularly because of what would happen afterwards as they were eating dinner there was a 
table next to them where two gentlemen two elderly gentlemen were seated just normal looking guys 
but these two gentlemen stared at cleo and james for the entire duration of their meal 
never once took their eyes off of them james thought this was really quite odd and given what 
would happen next he remembered this incident vividly and wonders if it was somehow connected 
to what would soon be the single most unusual experience of his entire life 
so at any rate they finished their dinner got back into this blue monte carlo and 
continued the drive into the rocky mountains and james was terrified to find how steep 
and treacherous these mountain roads were there were steep gorges dropping hundreds of feet onto 
the side and mountains rising hundreds of feet all around them and cleo seemed to be a good driver 
and as they continued the drive they were right into the heart of the rocky mountains 
and this is when something very peculiar happened cleo turned to james and said 
that they were about to see a UFO and I'll just let james describe this entire incident in his 
own words because it's so strange we're driving along enjoying the night and it had to be around 
nine or ten o'clock at night now and it goes do you feel the pressure and I'm like 
no there's oh you will we're about to see oh UFO
you know not believing her just thinking oh god you know and I'm looking at the window 
we're just driving along and all of a sudden I feel this pressure 
it was like somebody was pushing not in a painful way but there was definite pushing on my head 
and on my shoulders and just pushing my body into the seat yes on my legs yeah 
yes my whole thing was just like pushed into the chair right it was but it was the palpable 
pressure you know almost you know like if I pushed your head in your shoulders
the whole thing it's like holy [ __ ] no I was like surprised of course and then um looked 
at me and smiled and it didn't hurt at all it was just surprising and disconcerting you know 
because I've never experienced anything like that so then and then before we could say too much more
right in front of us is the UFO a saucer shaped UFO now I did not see any individual lights 
on it like I've heard many people see lights different lights right the entire thing glowed 
and exquisite turquoise right and it looked almost like neon light only it was the entire 
craft was glowing this brilliant turquoise and I couldn't see the top we could only see 
the bottom of it right the round disc shape you know the classic flying saucer I would 
assume but we didn't see it from the side on the top and just and it was 
and it just went right over the car and stayed there right exactly with the car I was looking out 
of the windshield like that and I could see it and I didn't have to move very far it was huge right 
but it wasn't that huge that's what surprised me it was maybe only 15 times the size of the car 
right but for considering where it had to have come from and so forth I thought well it's kind 
of small and it was just and I could just look out and see this glowing disc and I was so excited 
i have never been that awake in my life you know I was so in the moment and I remember it so vividly 
and I remember looking out and saying to myself remember this forever and for all time burn this into your memory in your mind's eye 
really be here because you're going to tell people about this and they're not going to believe you 
but you know something now for sure and certain that maybe other people don't you know and it 
was just really so in the moment and so excited I was not the least bit afraid I was totally 
um enthusiastic and excited and hoping they would land and I'd go up and go 
welcome wagon you know maybe 40 or 50 feet above the car no that's pretty close you know um
it scared she put the pedal to the middle and we went flying around these curves like 
that with these tremendous gorges right and a little railing like a toothpick and I was 
like oh my god I was terrified they were driving but I wasn't of them I was hoping they would land I really wanted to just get out and go sell out it stings you know
she said see I told you you know hey I apologize for that how could I have known 
but I did apologize but I did say well you know the world doesn't know yet and now I know you know 
i never thought anything like that would happen to me and um
it stayed with the car for a really long time I mean like 10 minutes 
and that's an eternity in that heightened state it was long enough that I started relaxing with it 
and you know I was really getting into it because I was just looking at it so much but it was so 
beautiful the turquoise glow of it right the entire thing goes simultaneously didn't pulsate 
and there was no sound as the time increased the pressure increased and towards the end it was 
starting to get uncomfortable like I didn't like it and I was getting a little bit afraid right 
well it just felt really weird you know um it not only felt like you were going into 
being being pushed into the seat your ears felt like um you know when you dived to a bottom of 
a swing pole and it's you're not pressurized you get that feeling it's kind of like that um
i remember so vividly seeing the white 
of the dashboard and the upholstery I mean these are things that every time I think about the story 
these images come to my mind right of her driving or feet driving and of the whiteness of the doors 
and the way they were lit by this turquoise light I can see that in my mind's eye so perfectly 
right and that was the only light the headlights and that it was very bright 
it was beautiful but it was really pretty but it didn't send any beams down or do anything it might 
have maybe that pressure was a beam and I didn't couldn't see it because I could certainly feel it 
maybe that's what kept it perfectly with the car I didn't really even think of that until this moment 
because I was so focusing on that I don't remember seeing other cars I've thought about that so many 
times well I wondered if we had missing timer or not I never even thought to check that 
and I don't know if she did either and we were in the middle of the stinking rockies one lucky looks like another so you can't mark the distance or where you were I was scared 
then but I was still excited I still would have gotten out of the car and go and say hello 
so they're driving along they feel this pressure on their body this UFO appears it's about 50 feet 
above their car it's this beautiful emerald green cleo is screeching around these mountain roads 
james is terrified of the way she's driving but he has no fear of this object itself he's absolutely entranced and as he said he felt more awake than he's ever 
felt in his entire life I found this particular detail quite interesting because it's certainly 
something I've heard from other experiencers I've also heard other experiencers describe 
this weird pressure on their body so these are some important little details that I think lend 
corroboration and authenticity to his account because james had no interest or education on 
ufos up to this point he did not even know if they were real but it was this feeling of awakeness 
and awareness that really affected him deeply now the energy that I got out of that thing
felt I don't want to stay comforting but comfortable 
um I was not afraid she was afraid but even she wasn't making me afraid
i was just don't be afraid of so I was excited I was so excited so awake oh 
i mean I've never been that awake in my life that aware that crystal clear of my consciousness 
yes it was a state of awakeness that I don't think are many people ever experienced this was 
an excitement I felt an anticipatory excitement that's what it was and it was like a fun thing 
and now their encounter moved from strange to absolutely beyond bizarre when cleo instructed 
james to open the glove compartment empty it of its contents the maps and sunglasses and such 
and press a hidden latch and remove a secret object from the bottom of the glove compartment 
and I'll just let james describe what he found inside this glove compartment looked at me 
and she said open the glove box take everything out reach your hand in 
and you'll feel the button push the button and the door will open 
and reach in and take out the contents and put it between us I'm looking at it right
oh okay you know it's like what am I doing with this crazy woman right so 
open the glove box take out the maps and sunglasses and [ __ ] and put on the floor and I reach in and I can see there's a button in there so I reach in you know I'm like armpit deep 
and you know glove box push the button and this door goes and like snapped in my fingers like ow 
and I should have had to go but anyway it came up and I reached in and I could feel something heavy wrapped in cloth and I picked it up and I pulled 
it out and it was this really beautiful but dark purple cloth velvety kind of cloth with some other 
kind of fabric on the outside it was dark I really couldn't see it but I knew it was purple anyway
she said unwrap it and put it between us it was heavy and I unwrapped it and it was this magnificent bracelet but it was very large and very heavy it would have to be 
for a man it would just knock a woman over right and it was it would fall off a woman's wrist too 
because it was big you know and it was thick and it was big like that and it weighed a lot and it 
was all solid gold and it was so intricate and all this filigree work that was just like magnificent 
and then there were these big oval faceted stones that were sort of a seafoam green 
right and I think there were either six or seven of them set around in this I mean it was like for 
a king definitely you know or someone equivalent it was designs but it could have been symbols that 
i was unaware of at that time you know but the workmanship I'm an artist and the workmanship 
um it was staggering I mean it was just so beautiful and the glimmering stones and the way 
they were glimmering in the light with that thing over us right they were agreeing about see that 
sort of sea foam between us well I was now that was the other thing I was in such sensory overload 
i have a UFO over me that I never even thought I'd ever see one or that you know I believe there was 
life out there but I didn't think it would come visiting right right now and there it was so that 
was really cool and that's enough to just send you over the edge for lifetime but now I've got this incredible piece of art in my hands that's heavy and it's radiating I know it I mean it was 
something powerful right and she said put it between us and I did and she put her 
hand through it we both had her hands through it she said rub it and I rubbed it and as we rubbed 
it the pressure started to lift within four or five seconds yeah so that's fairly immediately 
and then the craft just kind of went up and it kind of went and it was gone 
so after they rubbed this bracelet and he put it back and this UFO departed james was absolutely 
awestruck he's not sure what to make of this alleged planting bracelet that cleo said she 
had found while diving off the coast of spain and was led to it by some telepathic voice 
he's not sure if that's true or not he only knows that this bracelet was in fact real very heavy 
huge and perhaps the most exquisite piece of artwork he has ever seen in his entire life 
but uh he replaced it back into the glove compartment and following this very strange encounter he and cleo continued the drive they didn't really discuss much what had just happened 
other than to acknowledge that this UFO had appeared and moved off but it was only moments 
later that james saw two UFOs a quarter mile away on the peak right opposite them 
between them and a gorge so it wasn't like I could go over there and see these objects any 
closer but james described these two UFOs landed on the opposite peak about a quarter mile away 
i'll just let him describe this in his own words and then a few minutes later as we're coming around some bend there was two of them landed we had stopped 
rubbing the bracelet we rubbed it for a while after the crap left but by the time we put it 
down I said what is this what's the bracelet well I can see that but where did you get it what is it 
and she said well it's from atlantis and that she had found it while diving off the coast 
of spain and she heard this voice to tell her to go get this thing and she found it 
it told her the inner ear while she was under water diving where to get it and she went and got it said okay now you've seen it you are sworn into secrecy 
of course I'm going to put it back and put everything back the way it was um 
then we saw those two that were landed the two craft that were landed right next to each other 
and one rocky away but impossible to get to there's no way we could get unless we grew wings
so that was fairly close those two crafts were colored like one was kind of a bluish silver and the other one
i keep seeing is like reddish but I can't remember clearly now anymore 
i will never forget that one that was right over us well they're a distance away from us 
and they're not coming out and gene is definitely not stopping and there's no way that I could get over there without you know certain death but my reasoning was if they land and I gotta say 
hello and they answer I will know something and I've seen something that whatever it is 
i have that knowledge how cool is that I love that we just drove down the road kept driving 
and until they were out of our sight from other mountains and I didn't see any more that night
but that was enough you know so cleo made no acknowledgement of these other objects and they just continued their drive 
out of the rocky mountains and around midnight they finally got through reached the foothills 
found a hotel and spent the evening in this hotel it was uneventful they woke up the next morning 
and spent the entire day driving into vancouver and finally they reached vancouver they saw the 
bay there and were coming up on the lions gate bridge it was evening when cleo pointed out a star 
and told james look at that star it's not a star it's a UFO james did not believe her and I'll just 
let james describe what happened in his own words we drive all day we're driving now into vancouver 
and vancouver looks very much like san francisco they used to call them sister cities 
it's hilly with a lot of victorians and there's a bridge that looks like the golden gate bridge 
only it's green this is a suspension bridge right and it's called the lions 
gate bridge and from where we're going we had to cross the landscape to get into vancouver
so we're approaching the bridge entrance and did you see that star
and wars that's not a star she said look at that star it's not a stone I'm like well what is it she goes it's the UFO okay we saw UFO for real I believe you 
know it's been following us like how could it be following us so well it has gone well it's 
not a star and so she just keep your eye on it it was kind of like
but it was way up there with the stars you know it was the second step so I thought we're just driving onto the bridge to approach the toll gate so we're 
actually right there on the bridge and I'm watching the star and it goes
and it's like oh my god okay I believe you I'm sorry it's sort of it's all new 
it went straight up and then went as it went to the side it just 
kind of made this lining like that you know and then it was gone I just said oh my god I'm so 
sorry I believe you it's just this is all new for me and you know I'm a [ __ ] so after this star 
that turned out not to be a star darted off james was super apologetic and uh really just absolutely 
awestruck by these experiences he had had with cleo and how unbelievably strange this woman 
truly was but he had no choice but to believe her because he had seen UFOs now three 
times and he went to his hotel which overlooked the bay it overlooked stanley park cleo also got 
a room in the hotel melanie flew in a short time later and she had a room below james 
james had a very successful engagement in vancouver and he was enjoying his stay there so 
he decided to stay a little longer he had friends in vancouver and one evening he went out onto his 
balcony which overlooks stanley park looked up it was an overcast and saw strange lights in the 
clouds and I'll just let james describe another profound UFO sighting about two months later
i was staying at this hotel that was right on the beach on the bay there and I used to like 
take a shower and go out and dry my hair on the balcony and look out at the boats and the water 
and because there was a plug out there it was nice and just pleasant right so I'd go do that so 
it was an overcast day it was getting to the dusk it was still light dusk it wasn't dark dusk yet 
but it was dusk right and I'm about to look up and I see these lights up above the cloud layer 
and they were kind of cool they were kind of like dancing around right and 
i remember they were like well through the cogs they were like these light colors you know like 
soft blue and like a soft reddish pink and kind of like an opalescent one you know that I could 
see the moving up above the clouds I think what on earth is that I'm not thinking UFOs yet right that 
is so weird must be like um I thought might have been klig lights you know those big lights fish
what is that right and then all of a sudden they decide to show me what 
that is but it's daylight in front of god and everybody right on the beach and there's a million 
buildings all right on that beach like that right and then all the people coming and going 
right so and then stanley park is off to the side stanley park is like 
golden gate park all beautiful and manicured and so forth but then after uh several acres 
it becomes natural wilderness and it stays real forest and everything until it hits the ocean 
it's totally beautiful like standing apart so
i look at him and all of a sudden two of them out of the two discs come out of the cloud cover and go and right into the direction stanley park 
oh my god and those were metal disk shape again they didn't have color once they came out of the 
cloud thing they moved so fast I really couldn't see what color they were but they were kind of metal-ish so he saw these two objects dart off into stanley park and melanie 
comes running into the room she saw them too and they're out on the balcony reliving this incident 
they cannot find cleo and just talking about what had happened when suddenly these same two objects 
come racing out of stanley park at treetop level dart upwards into the clouds and are gone 
and they are just absolutely amazed they were clearly UFOs and it was a short time later that 
cleo comes running into the room her hair is completely disheveled she's frightened and 
she says did you see the UFOs and they said yes we saw them arrive and we saw them leave 
and cleo said that she was out painting in stanley park when these two discs 
dropped down out of the sky and hovered directly over her and were trying to take her and she ran 
out of stanley park and evaded them and took refuge in the hotel room so this was what james's 
fifth UFO sighting with cleo so it was clear to him that cleo was telling the truth 
that she was being followed by UFOs turns out cleo basically lived out of her monte carlo she stayed 
in hotels two or three days at a time she said she was being watched very closely by both the u.s 
and canadian government and she was constantly trying to evade them a short time later
cleo james and melanie were together they were planning on going out to dinner with a friend 
but it turned out james's friend had an abscess tooth and he was in a lot of pain 
and cleo offered to give him a psychic healing but she would only do it in complete privacy 
so she took james's friend into the bedroom and closed the door 
while melanie and james stayed in the living room and james couldn't help but look over when he saw 
a strange and eerie iridescent blue light coming from beneath the crack in the door he thought 
that was very strange and a short time later cleo comes out and said that james's friend is sleeping 
which really kind of struck james's odd because it was still very early evening and cleo said don't 
worry he's all right he'll probably wake up in a little bit and sure enough he did james's friend 
came out into the living room and announced that he was completely healed and was ready to go out to dinner and so they all went out to dinner and james's friend ordered steak his 
abscessed tooth was completely healed this turned out to be the last time that james ever saw cleo 
and that was his UFO adventures with cleo and so I questioned james about these experiences 
uh and got all the details I've heard him tell this story many times to other people we became 
quite good friends and his story never changed though sometimes he did add new details but 
following my interview with him I wanted to know if this was a one-off or if he had had any other 
unusual experiences and james did have a lifetime of unusual experiences paranormal events he saw 
the ghost of his mother after she passed away when he was just a little boy it had a number of ghost 
encounters some very highly mystical encounters that he prefers to keep private and personal he's 
had a number of paranormal events and I asked him questions to determine if he was a UFO contactee 
because I wasn't sure if he had possibly had missing time during this incident with cleo 
he's honestly not sure there's no clear indication that they did 
uh but uh I asked him has he ever woken up with strange marks or scars on his body 
his eyes became quite wide and he said yes that happens to me fairly regularly and in 
fact I have one right now and he showed me this triangular shaped bruise on his arm 
and he says these things just appear overnight I don't know how they come but they always heal up quite quickly does this mean anything and I said well yes it could it might be 
an indication of UFO contact it's certainly one of the indicators and I asked him has he 
had any other unusual experiences perhaps in childhood because as investigators know 
if a person is a UFO contactee they will often have childhood encounters and james immediately 
said yes he had as a really young boy he had a little toy phone and he said this toy phone would 
often start beeping by itself and he thought that was very unusual and I asked him has he ever seen 
strange figures entering into his bedroom anything like that and he said well no not into his bedroom 
but he did have a very unusual experience when he was around 10 or 11 years old while staying at his 
uncle's ranch in oregon his uncle lived in a very rural area surrounded by a pine tree forest 
james was instructed never to go out into the forest that there are wild animals there and that it could get lost and of course that's the first thing james did was start exploring the forest 
around this ranch and one morning he's out in the forest sitting on a log poking the ground with a 
stick when he looks up and sees two very strange figures who we would probably describe as typical 
greys at the time as a kid he had no idea about such things but I'll just let him describe this 
incident in his own words and it is quite possible I have been a UFO contactee 
i have no recollection of that but I did see two very white-skinned men in a forest on my uncle's 
ranch when I was nine and um I looked up and there they were and I looked down at the ground because 
i knew I'd be in trouble and then I really cut they were weird-looking and I went wait a minute they're not supposed to be here this is my uncle's ranch and I look back and they were gone 
they were looking directly at me but those big ferns they have in oregon you know they're really 
giant as tall as a man they were standing behind two of those they were right in front of them 
and it was a forest so but this was the clearing in the forest I was sitting on a log in this kind 
of meadow thing and it was just magnificent I was just sort of sitting on the log doodling in the 
sand with the stick just being a kid right and enjoying the day right and I just kind of felt 
like weird like something was where I called my attention you know I was nine so I didn't 
really articulate it to myself but I felt something over there I just kind of looked 
and I saw them and I was like oh and then I looked down really fast because I was 
not supposed to be in the forest that was the first thing they told me do not go in that forest alone you know it's dangerous you can find your way out you'll get lost there's 
all sorts of dangerous animals in there blah blah blah so anyway that was the first place I went but
that's just back up for what happened in the later years but I never until I met you really 
put all that together and all the other stuff that's happened but it was so fast because in 
my child's mind my first thing when I saw them was oh god I'm gonna get in trouble I'm not supposed to be in the forest I just got busted right and then I was like wait a minute 
they didn't look right did I see that and it was like what are they doing in the forest is this my 
uncle's forest who the hell are they and I look back up and they're gone so yes this appears to 
be a close encounter with gray ET's and is another very strong clue that james may be a contactee so 
at this point I asked james if he had ever seen any other UFOs or had missing time and again his 
jaw dropped his eyes became wide he said actually yes I did have a UFO sighting and missing time 
and it's something he had forgotten about for some time but uh definitely remembered it 
as a young man he and three friends had gone on a boating trip in the san francisco 
delta was late in the evening and they were enjoying themselves on this boat 
there were no other boats around it was pitch black at night and they had just finished dinner 
when suddenly looking up they saw a very bright red and white dazzling 
object drop down out of the sky right over their boat and disappear it was very obvious quite large 
very bright and almost as if it wanted to be seen they all ood and odd and freaked out a little bit 
just a few moments later this was followed by a another bright emerald green light or object which 
dropped down out of the sky very low right over their boat and again disappeared the next thing 
they know they're waking up they're not sure how much time had passed an hour perhaps too 
but they wake up they're on the deck of their boat they had it literally fallen asleep where they sat 
they just keeled over and fell unconscious right on top of each other all in the group 
this was very peculiar they could not believe that they had fallen asleep so quickly right there on the deck of the boat that's something that they would never have done they could not explain it 
nobody even tried to explain it they didn't talk about it at all and instead just shuffled 
back into their cabins and went to bed for the evening and it was never discussed after that this 
is another strong indicator of UFO contact where people do not discuss a very profound UFO sighting 
so this is a clear-cut case of missing time I think probably something more happened than just 
this sighting though james has no memory of it at this point I asked him another question I ask 
of all contactees have you ever dreamt about UFOs or aliens and again james became quite surprised 
and said yes I've had UFO dreams my entire life ever since I was a little boy over and over again 
it's a repetitive dream that's pretty much always the same with slight variations he dreams that a 
ufo arrives and lands in many cases in his dream and he's not scared but many people around him 
are scared and it's his job to calm people down and to instruct them to get on board the UFO 
and they do they all go on board and he goes on board and the UFO takes off 
i asked him for a specific example and he said the most vivid dream that he could remember involved 
him being at a carnival fairground and there was a ride that's known as the spin-out or perhaps 
the tilt-a-whirl it's a ride which is shaped as a round disc it's got little sort of compartments 
all along the edge and it spins really quickly people get into the little compartments along 
the edge and as this object spins the floor drops out and people stick to the walls
by centrifugal force and he says in this dream he was ordering people to get on this carnival ride and they all did 
they got into their little slots james got on board he got into his slot and this carnival 
ride starts spinning quickly the floor begins to drop out at which point it turns into a UFO 
these compartments sort of encase each person and this UFO takes off and flies off into outer space 
so this is another strong indication of UFO contact so I think probably yes james is a UFO 
contactee and he was quite shocked to find out all these details connected he had never really 
looked at them all in the totality and uh he now believes or uh following this he believed he was 
probably a UFO contactee I told james's story in its entirety in my book on board UFO encounters 
it is absolutely one of the strangest and most unusual stories of UFO contact I have ever heard 
and that's really why I wanted to share it with all of you because it is profoundly strange very 
unusual with unique elements but I think it shows how a person can spend much of their life being a 
ufo contactee and never even know it because all the only indicators are just these few clues scars 
on the body dreams sightings of strange figures uh UFO encounters missing time this sort of thing
and I think this case is also important because it shows how strange UFO contact can be 
i'm not sure what to make of the whole atlantean bracelet uh but it is what it is 
so that's james's story I hope you've enjoyed it and found it interesting 
i want to thank you once again for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for the truth keep asking questions and keep having fun
