FIVE REALLY WEIRD EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS
Apr 26, 2024

Summary:
Apr 26, 2024
UFO contact is known for high strangeness. When people encounter ETs face-to-face, or are taken onboard, things can go from strange to truly bizarre. This video presents five cases from across the world, which contain incredibly odd and unique elements of high strangeness. Each of these five cases include sightings, landings, humanoids, and an onboard experience. Each contain physical evidence of some kind or another. These cases have some remarkable insights into the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon.

THE CASE OF CATHIE CONNELLY. In the summer of 1940, Cathie Connelly was walking down a country lane in Meriden, England when she came upon a small, strange structure. There were tall odd-looking men wearing jumpsuits standing near it. When she returned later, it was gone. Later, while working at a factory, she saw one of the men she had seen next to this craft, and he told Cathie that he was an ET. So began Cathie’s contacts. She was soon taken onboard. She saw human-looking people and blue-skinned beings with cat-like eyes. She was physically examined and given a tour of the craft. They took her to an active war-area and to New York, showing her the Statue of Liberty. Many other incidents of high strangeness occurred, including going back in time to certain childhood events, and to a country in Africa.

THE CASE OF ARNE-HARDER JORGENSEN. One day in Aug of 1956, Arne-Harder Jorgensen (age 10) played Cowboys & Indians with his friends near his home in Vaklev, Denmark. Suddenly he heard foreign-sounding voices and laughter. Peaking outside of his hiding place, he saw three short, bald humanoids wearing jumpsuits and eating berries from a berry bush. Suddenly the ETs turned and stared right at him. Arne tried to run, but found that he couldn’t move. One of the humanoids studied him up and down, and walked away. Then, a silver saucer-shape craft took off. Arne’s paralysis lifted. He ran home to find that it was now dusk. The next morning, they discovered four deep holes in the ground. Also three chickens were missing from a neighbor’s coop. Later, Arne had two close-up UFO sightings.

THE CASE OF ONILSON PATERO. On the night of May 22, 1973, Onilson Patero was driving to his him in Catanduva, Brazil when he picked up a hitchhiker, a young blond-haired, blue-eyed man. As he dropped off the hitchhiker, the man said they would meet again. Continuing his drive, Onilson’s car suddenly lost power. A UFO appeared and shone a beam of light onto his car, turning it transparent. Onilson ran from his car and fainted. He was found unconscious lying next to the road. One year later, on the night of Apr 26, 1974, Onilson saw another UFO. He was struck by a beam of light, and taken onboard, where he saw the same hitchhiker. Onilson was given an exam and experienced many strange events onboard, including seeing his own twin, being taken to another country in Europe and more. The ETs dropped him off. It was now six days later and he was 745 miles from his original location.

THE CASE OF DAVID HAMEL. On Oct 12, 1975, David Hamel (a carpenter,) his wife Ruth and a friend were watching TV in his home in Maple Ridge, Canada. Suddenly the TV screen became staticky and two Asian-looking figures appeared and pulled David up into a craft. David was given a tour of the craft, and volumes of scientific and philosophical information. The ETs warned him about nuclear power, and then told him that they would give him detailed instructions about how to build a free-energy motor. Returning him to his home, David’s life changed as he remained in contact with the ETs. David began a lifelong quest to build a UFO craft, using a concept of counter-rotating magnets. David spent thousands of dollars and eventually built a motor, which spontaneously exploded. He continued his efforts, eventually attracting the attention of prominent scientists. Two books have been written about his case.

THE CASE OF ELIZABETH HESS. In 1954, 13-year-old Elizabeth Hess (pseudonym) and her mother experienced missing time during a trip to the store near their home in New York City. Years later, in November 1989, Elizabeth woke up to find three strange humanoids in her Manhattan apartment. They led her down the street to the Hudson River, where she met a tall gray and 30 other people who had also been led there. A strange experience followed where Elizabeth was instructed to pick a glass and give it to a homeless woman. Next, Elizabeth was back in her home, undergoing a medical procedure at the hands of the ETs, who told her to quit smoking and eating chocolate. Later, Elizabeth had miscarriages where the fetus was missing.

These five cases typify the high strangeness that is so often present during UFO contact. They reveal some of the ETs’ agendas on this planet, and that people all over the world are experiencing contact with a wide variety of humanoids. The evidence speaks for itself. We are not alone!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal today's episode
I call five really weird extraterrestrial encounters I think UFO encounters are by
their nature very unusual it shouldn't be this way there are a lot of people
having encounters I think the only reason people are even skeptical is because there's been a very well
orchestrated and well-funded coverup and disinformation campaign by our own
governments it's such a shame CU a lot of people are having these experiences
I've chosen five cases which are really unusual that's the theme of today's
collection these are cases which have unique and high strangeness elements
some I've actually never heard before but these are cases from all over the world I have a case from Canada one from
the US one from Brazil one from England one from Denmark so quite widespread
geographically speaking the earliest case took place in 1940 the latest in
1989 so over a long period of time as well and yeah each contain really unique
elements that provide I think interesting insights into the nature of the phenomena every single one of these
cases involves sightings Landings face-to-face encounters with humanoids
and an onboard experience as well there is one which is a little bit questionable in that regard but the
witness did have missing time so I think it's quite likely he was taken on board though he does not actually recall this
but still super interesting because these cases all have evidence of one form of another physical evidence so
hopefully you'll find it interesting let's just get started first case I want to talk about today I call the case of
Kathy Connelly and huge thanks to Bob Tibbits for providing his research on
this case and pointing it out to me it's a super fascinating really unusual case
also interesting because it took place quite some time ago 1940 this took place in uh 1940 in
Meridan England and it's a very complicated series of events all the cases in this
collection are but this one especially and I think you'll find it quite interesting I know I sure did this very
unusual and extensive case comes from researcher Bob Tibbits so huge thanks to
him for pointing this case out to me and providing his notes on his investigation
into it he did write about it in Q for's syonic magazine many years ago and later
in one of the volumes of haunted Skies this is a single witness case again the
primary witness's name is Kathy Connelly who was for many years a factory worker
from Meridan England Bob tibits first met Kathy at a UFO meeting and she agreed to share her
story with him and he describes her as quote a genuine lady who firmly believed
in what she had experienced it was back in the summer of 1940 that Kathy then age 18 decided to
take a walk down a Country Lane in Meridan this is near centry and as Kathy
says in her own words by sheer accident I came across a metal dome-shaped
structure which I took then to be a permanent building now she did see several tall men who appear to be
working on this structure as she says all the men were wearing one piece
garments they had unusually high foreheads and their skin seemed to be tanned this was unusual because during
the war people tended to be p tasty faced there was definitely something different about the eyes the structure
appeared to be quite strong that is solid giving off a gray blue light so a
lot of strange things going on here which puzzled her she did notice little chimney like structures next to the
craft so as she's walking by she did smile at one of the men who after a few
moments did smile back and then seemed to study her she didn't think much of it
at the time until she returned on her walk and found that this structure was gone so this was confusing but again it
was a brief encounter she realized then that must have been a craft of some kind
but little did she know this was just the beginning of what would be a very complicated series of
events cuz it was a few months later while working at the Reynolds chain company in centry she was in the machine
room when she noticed a man with unusually clean overalls and she immediately recognized him as one of the
men she had seen months earlier in Meridan standing next to that strange
craft and this is when a pretty weird conversation followed because this man
spoke to her and said your war is upsetting my world and she replied it's
your world too and he said no I don't come from this world so it just got weirder after this
CU he asked her to take him to see the king and queen and she told him she couldn't do that he asked her if she was
colorblind and she said no apparently she did have some color blindness he
asked her who he should contact then and she told him scientists leaders now she would see him several
times and he asked her several times if she would go with him and she told him
no each time and she didn't see him again in the 3 years she worked there
but she did often think of him afterwards and then one day a man showed
up at her home and said he was a messenger and started talking about meeting this man she had seen at the
factory now Cathy's memory of what happened next came back to her in bits and pieces so she apparently had some
missing time and Amnesia associated with all this but she started to recall that
she had been taken on board more than once to this same craft that she apparently saw all those months ago in
1940 so her memories are pretty interesting she recalled being on board this craft being physically examined on
a table a strange humanoid told her we only want to see if you are pregnant and
this was of course not a normal looking guy this humanoid had bluish unblemished
skin a kind of cat-like face she said there were no whites to his eyes a long
mouth she had long flat almost animal-like ears his clothes were unusual he wore a
blue coverall she saw other men like him also wearing either blue or brown
coveralls and she also saw human-like figures human except they were pretty tall some of them up to 7t tall and had
very high foreheads and sort of oiled black hair this is what she recalled now the
man told told her that the humanlike beings could not leave the ship but the others could and Kathy told this Blu
skinned being that there were plastic surgeons on Earth who could change his face if he
wanted uh he seemed to be pleased by that answer but she was then taken around the craft which she said as many
witnesses do was well lit but had no discernable light source that's an
important detail because we hear this in modern day accounts she said in one room she saw a wall
filled with meters or gauges another had a table in the center which slid right
into the floor again A Familiar description she said in one side of that room there was a screen or a scanner of
some kind and looking through it she got a shock cuz she saw scenes of War
airplanes fighting each other below them in Ocean filled with crowded ships Kathy
could actually hear the radio conversations going on between the pilots inside these planes this was all
moving and live and the ET told her several times this is your world which
Kathy denied now at one point one of these planes approached the craft quite closely apparently to shoot it but then
she heard the pilot say not to shoot as they saw a woman on board and then a
child uh the craft approached another plane at one point and according to Kathy the crew of the plane was close
enough off and looked straight at them apparently seeing her and others on
board and one of the crew of This Plane actually made the sign of a cross over
his chest when this happened one of the crew members of the UFO asked Kathy if
she knew this man and why did he do that she told him no she did not know the man
but that the man was probably praying for her now the next thing she knew
still looking out the screen she saw New York she saw the Statue of Liberty she
saw them flying over a New York Street and lots of news vendors selling papers
at some point she was taken into another room where she was asked all kinds of questions about life on Earth about her
own life and what her thoughts were about the difference between right and wrong actions in her own
behavior they warned her about the power of thought particularly negative thoughts
and I mean she saw a lot of stuff this is all somewhat disconnected so this could be separate incidents at one point
she was shown a scene of a man on a cross while people were throwing dirt and stones at him and again the ET said
this is your world Kathy denied it and said this was the past and the ET said are they any
different to that where you come from so they were apparently
warning her or informing her about how Savage the human race is how unevolved
spiritually but Cathy was very much impressed by this encounter she said the
ETS were very friendly and she says they are very kind and patient and I always
felt at complete ease with them the older members of the crew told me that
it would do me no good to tell of my encounters as it would be of no benefit to me personally
I was told that in order to have success in making contact a great number of people had to believe that it is true
and can be done one of the crew members claimed to be a member of the quote Wildlife preservation Society so as half
jokingly told by Wildlife they meant our human race but they very much wanted to
help mankind so yeah Kathy believes she was taken on board a number of times and she
they showed her many things far too much to talk about here in this little video
but at one point she did see a thick dark book with what looked like shorthand or Chinese type writing she
says they took her into the past into her childhood a number of times Kathy was apparently partly colorblind and had
trouble reading street lights uh which caused some problems crossing the street
and the ET is apparently cured her of this condition in another instance of extreme High strangeness this is so
weird she says the ETS dropped her off on a road in this country which turned
out to be she believes rhia and told her to get on a particular bus and when she
did she discovered that all the people on this bus were black and her being a
white person they were unhappy that she had boarded the bus and she had trouble getting a
seat now this appears to be a sort of demonstration to see if she tolerated racism which she didn't because she was
taken off the bus the people on the bus now were very friendly and the ET
scooped her back up very strange but she was taken to see other events from her
past again her memories are somewhat scattered and incomplete at this point
she did provide a long handwritten letter to Bob Tibbits and other
researchers have looked into her case and found her to be sincere and honest
so it is a bizarre case that does raise more questions than it answers but again shows many of the features we see in
modern-day accounts so you can see there's a lot to unpack in this case of
Kathy Connelly but what an unusual and amazing case she had such extensive
interactions with these ETS some of the things she does describe are certainly
reflective of of modern-day accounts but some are absolutely unusual going on
this bus ride and having what appeared to be a lesson involving the
Discrimination perhaps she apparently had a healing of color blindness I found
that super fascinating a lot of really interesting elements to that
case and now we move to the next case which is so unusual and really
interesting I had never heard of this case before this was also provided to me
by a listener so thanks to you know who I call this one the case of Arie Harter
Jorgenson and this is a gentleman from Denmark who had a very very interesting
encounter with a landed UFO and humanoids and missing time as well this
is in vlv Denmark it occurred in August of 1956
and I have to say there are elements in this case that I have never heard before and as with every case in this
collection it's not just one event uh he had a series of encounters but this
first one is a real amazing and extensive encounter this very
interesting case is pretty much a single witness case with the witnesses name
being AR Harter Jorgenson he was born in 1946
as he grew up he worked in various jobs including as a cook in the military he later became a lieutenant and after his
military service worked as a poster worker but was it was his encounter at
age 10 one evening in August 1956 that changed everything he was
playing Cowboys and Indians with some of the other kids in his hometown of vlv
Denmark and all the kids had made their own little private hideout and Arie wasn't his when he heard strange foreign
sounding voices coming from the garden next door where there were a bunch of berry bushes he said the language
sounded quite strange kind of like Japanese or Korean uh appeared to be male voices he could hear them laughing
so he was curious and he crept forward he had a little air pistol in his hand
uh which worked this isn't exactly what we would call a toy gun uh but he was hiding behind the bush and peaked out
and he was shocked to see three really short humanoids about 4T tall and they
were eating berries off the bush as he says they had huge heads in relation to
their bodies I was then a head taller than them the mouth was a small crack 3
to 4 cm wide with two small holes and a small bulge with a small hole for the
nose the the body was Slender with long thin arms each with a hand with five
fingers they had thin legs with large clumsy shoes that were almost
boots so he says that each of them were wearing skintight featureless
jumpsuits there was no buttons no zippers nothing like that and yeah real
really weird heavy Footwear Their Eyes Were Striking he said they were a vivid violet color and
he had the distinct impression that these were sort of plastic goggles or
part of their suit he said all of them looked pretty much identical and again
judging from their voices were all males and it was also amazed to hear them
apparently farting and it actually smell the stench of it which he said was real bad suffocating
almost now suddenly they turned and seemed to notice that Arie was looking
right at them they immediately t tossed away the berries began speaking very
loudly in their strange language and it sounded to Arie like one of them was ordering the others around now this
freaked Arie out he turned and ran or at least he tried to as Arie says in his
own words suddenly I felt myself being slowed down and pulled back there was
something that just controlled me I was aware that one of them was right behind me as I could distinctly hear him
breathing it's it sounded like a dying asmatic I reached down to the shelter
but could not slip into it a mysterious force ensured that I Stood Still in
front of the shelter unable to do anything and I was spun around to face
him I then stood in front of their Commander at a distance of 2 MERS and
stood straight like another Soldier so at this point the other two
humanoids ran up the one in front of Arie ordered them away Arie was amazed
to see how strangely they walked and he had the impression that their big blocky shoes were so large because they
affected gravity in some way kind of like they were mechanical shoes now the main ET in front of him
began to examine Arie up and down and paid special attention to his little air
pistol Arie had the distinct impression that this guy could see everything inside him almost as if he was x-raying
him or even memorizing or photographing him as Arie says it all felt very
strange but I was calm and safe in his power so after a few moments he's really
not sure how long the strange being just turned around and left AR stood there in
paralysis and this is when he realized that all the normal sounds around him had gone completely silent there was a
lot of animals around there he couldn't hear any of them them he couldn't hear any of the cats the geese the ducks
chickens and pigs and other animals in the area and he started shivering in the
cold still he couldn't move then suddenly he was amazed to see a silver
metallic craft Rise Up from behind a nearby Hill where there was a large
Gravel Pit this craft was moving at a 30° angle up into the sky so it wasn't
very big about 15 ft wide maybe 6 ft High but as it darted off his paralysis
immediately lifted and he now realized it was Twilight so Arnie returned to The
Farmhouse where they had all been playing all the other kids asked where had he been so he was apparently missing
and Arie was very forthright he told them I was with three little gray
martians so this experience left Arie absolutely amazed he knew it wasn't his
imagination and he got confirmation of that the next day when he tried to shoot his air pistol and it fell completely to
Pieces so he believes the ETS did something to it because this was brand new pretty
much so it was dark at this point everyone had to go home but the next day
Arie convinced his friends to go to the Gravel Pit where he had seen this UFO Rise Up from he was too afraid to go
there alone so they agreed and when they got there they found something very
interesting four equidistant holes in the ground deep Holes about 2T deep a/ ft wide and
they were conical in shape with the point being at the bottom they were about four or five feet apart and Arie
believes that they were caused by The Landing feet from the craft they also did find several lumps
of soft black tar-like material they did not save any of it
unfortunately they did find some other things they found that a flower stand from one of the neighbors had been moved
and was now filled with berries and not only that other bits of sticks and
things which must have been done by the ETS because nobody laid claim to doing
it and there was other bits of evidence Arie learned that three chickens were
mysteriously missing from the neighbors Coupe which was totally secured that should not be able to happen nobody
could explain that and that was pretty much the exent of it Arie never did see the ETS after
that however 46 years later in the summer of
1999 Arie and a group of people were celebrating the opening of a new restaurant at
nans 8 in the center of kalundborg Denmark fireworks were being launched as
part of the celebration and Arie was watching these fireworks when he saw an object flying in about 180 ft overhead
and 180 ft away it was moving slowly about 18 mph 20 he said it was shiny
metallic and appeared to be oval-shaped about 30 ft long it had a weird glowing
orange yellow section partway along its perimeter now Arie was only one of at
least a 100 Witnesses and in fact the sighting was published in the local newspaper but later authorities said
that the object was nothing more than a weather balloon which Arie calls quote a bad
lie now that's just one sighting wasn't long after that that he had another six
years later August 2005 Arie was attending a rock concert at the old
stadium near galor Denmark and part of this concert included a laser show and it was during
this laser show that something weird happened as Arie says I suddenly felt
like I was being watched but I didn't immediately know by whom none of the
bystanders showed any interest in me that could make me feel watched but I still felt it why I do not know then I
looked up into the sky and saw an orange and round object I forgot for a moment
all the music and the laser show and kept my eyes on the object it was about
a kilometer up and was the size of a penny had held in an outstretched arm
when seen from the ground I shouted to the people closest to me that there was a flying saucer in the sky but they
couldn't hear me over the music so they didn't respond I fixed my Gaze on the
object suddenly it moved further down towards the square I would estimate that it came down to a height of about 600 M
which is about 1,800 1900 ft now AR continues seen from the ground
it was now the size of a five cron which is a large coin held in an outstretched
arm it was perfectly circular but with a flat bottom the orange light had a
constant brightness across the disc and was a pleasant orange color when it was
furthest down I had been watching it for approximately 10 seconds then it slowly
rose up and finally it was out of my field of vision so that's interesting these two
sightings one which was apparently prompted by fir works the other by a laser show quite a few cases like that
now it's entirely possible that this was the same ETS Arie saw as a kid because
they did appear to be showing themselves intentionally but of course Arie doesn't know for sure and that turned out to be
his last UFO experience I think you'll agree that's a really compelling case
the fact that there were Landing traces uh other types of evidence in
terms of the missing chickens and the berries and fruit and such being moved
around in a way that nobody else claimed to be doing it apparently it was the ETS
but the description of the ETS as well everything from you know their eyes down
to their shoes head to toe really interesting though in many ways probably
your typical Grays but what an interesting case uh
especially you know with his little toy pistol but that also I found super
fascinating there's all these cases I think provide another piece of the puzzle to what's going on here and
that's a case that certainly deserves to be more well known which is why I wanted to include
it so now we move on to the next case which actually is pretty well known in
Brazil it's considered one of Brazil's best documented onboard experiences so
you may have heard of it I'm not sure but it's got some very fascinating
absolutely unique elements to it that I've never heard before I call this one
the case of onson patero that's of course the witness's name this involves
a series of encounters one major event which took place on May 22nd
1973 with a follow-up encounter one year later April 26th 19
1974 this took place in the town of Katan Dua in
Brazil yeah it's an extremely well authenticated case some good physical
evidence a lot of corroborating Witnesses and in some ways is very much
echoing the case of Travis Walton and that the witness was missing as we shall
see for a period of days missing time is usually an hour or to at most not in
this case now again this case is considered one of the most famous and
well authenticated onboard UFO experiences in Brazilian history and it was investigated in depth by numerous
researchers such as Dr Walter K buer and Irene granche and others and in fact
says Irene granche I met on Olson personally receiving the best possible impression
of him an impression of honesty that he transmits to everyone onson peto's
encounters there's two main events and the whole ordeal really began on May
22nd 1973 when on Olson who was then a 40-year-old salesman was driving from
itah hoba to his home in kanduva this is in sa Pao Brazil and he picked up a
hitchhiker it was around 11:00 p.m. again on May 22nd 1973
when he came upon a car parked alongside the road and there was this young blonde man standing there so he got out to help
and he noticed that this young man had large sunken blue eyes he was wearing a
dark suit and according to onson the Man's eyes were really peculiar they
were abnormally large and seemed to stare right through him he said this guy
had an oval face a small nose and mouth broad shoulders a muscular body so
pretty much a normal looking guy so he offered this man a ride the man accepted
the ride introduced himself as Alex and they talked for a while with Alex asking
most of the questions about on Olson's personal life and this strange
hitchhiker demonstrated an unusually good memory because at the beginning of their conversation onson had mentioned
his specific address and then an hour or so later just before dropping Alex
off the man told onson quote one of these days I'm going to pay you a visit
at your house and then named the guy's address repeating it exactly another weird thing the location
where Alex requested to be let out was remote there was nothing around there so
Alex explained that he had a car that was quote not from here okay okay so Olson left Alex and
continued on his drive it wasn't long after he had dropped this guy off that he saw what looked like the same car
Alex had been standing next to when he picked him up driving in the opposite direction he didn't see the driver so
can't be sure but at any rate it was now 300 a.m. and on Olson was on State
Highway 321 the Washington Lewis Highway near kilometer 7 and was just a few
miles from his home it was raining onon was listening to the radio when suddenly
it was overcome by increasing static at the same time his car a Chevy opala
began to lose power and soon as car slowed to a crawl and then a bright blue
beam of light Shone down into his car shown on the dashboard on onson himself
it shown on his briefcase at which point he was shocked to see it looked almost as if his briefcase and parts of the car
were transparent kind of like x-rays he did think momentarily that
there might be a truck behind him but no truck went by and the light was becoming brighter in fact he could start to feel
a real strong heat his car just went completely dead at this point headlights
radio the entire electrical system and the heat was getting suffocating so he
got out and the heat was worse and looking looking up he saw an oval-shaped
craft hovering about 60 ft up and 60 ft away he thought briefly it might be a
helicopter but instantly discarded this thought as the object was clearly saucer-shaped he said like two water
basins placed end to end it was about 30 ft wide 20 ft high and it was making a
low buzzing noise and this beam of light coming from it was lighting up the area
around him like daylight and then he watched as a tube of some kind extended from the bottom of the
object and he thought you know it's coming to get me he tried to run but felt rooted to the spot now looking
behind him he was shocked to see that the beam of light coming from the craft onto his car had turned his car
transparent like glass at the same time the heat from this beam felt like it was
burning his skin he finally maned managed to break free and run a short
distance cuz he knew this was a flying saucer at this point and really felt like they were trying to take him but he
still felt this strange Force pulling on him the car still looked totally transparent he wondered if it was
actually melting he was mad because he had only a few car payments left before
he paid off his car that was his last thought and he promptly fainted an undetermined but apparently
short time later two men we now know to be waldomiro baroso SE and celso Aero po
they were driving along the same road and Came Upon on Olson's car the headlights were on the driver's door was
open on Olson's briefcase and documents were scattered uh onson himself lay face down
on the ground in a puddle of water now the men thought that he was dead they thought there had been an accident or
perhaps that he had been robbed and murdered so they immediately raced to call the police officer Clovis quiros
showed up and went to examine on Olson also thinking that he was looking at a
corpse and was shocked when the witness suddenly jumped up and began to fight
the officer shouting they're after me they're after me so the officer informed
him no this is the police you're okay uh other weird things the the briefcase was
still locked so apparently nobody had opened it and yet all these documents were spread around none were missing and
these included some checks so some pretty valuable stuff there another strange thing is that on Olson's torso
his chest and back were dry his pants were wet I mean this was
raining at the time so this was curious so onson was rushed to the Padre albino
hospital and ex examined for one day and then sent home there were other bizarre
effects uh immediately after this encounter onson who had brown hair his
hair was now completely black this was confirmed by his wife it took only about
4 days to revert to its original brown color also interesting is that onson
says he suffered from intense itching all over his body and it was a few days
after the encounter that green yellow bruise-like spots appeared on its chest and abdomen it didn't cause him any pain
but after about two weeks they spread covering his entire body so he returned to the hospital Dr Elias Aziz shadik who
had examined him immediately after the encounter and later now when these spots
were spreading all over him was really Amazed by what he had seen and he later told reporters I am absolutely sure that
the man is telling the truth his statements are fully coherent and he presents no symptoms of mental
instability he was burned and the burns are no ordinary Burns they look as
though they were caused by some strange rays but again caused no pain and
thankfully they did heal later onson was placed under hypnosis and it wasn't super successful
in terms of recovering any memories he did talk about about being taken inside
the object and meeting quote a steel chested man he said that there were other figures inside this craft who
wanted to talk to him but he really couldn't recall much else however his encounter was widely
publicized and it was soon discovered that there were several other people in the area who had seen UFOs including a
couple who said that they saw this weird object with humanoids inside of it so
onson didn't know it at the time of course but he would later have a much more dramatic and extensive
encounter it was about one year later on April 26th 1974 he was on a business trip driving
between guanta and Cananda it was around 11:30 p.m. when he
noticed this glowing blue object pacing his car almost immediately his car
engine started to fail and looking outside he could now see that this object was apparently the same one he
had seen in his previous encounter and once again a really weird
effect his car started to look like it was transparent so he jumped out of his car
to run away and this is when a beam of light came from the object and pulled him right up into the craft onome now
found himself inside an oval room and standing there was guess who Alex The
Hitchhiker he had picked up last year Alex was smiling and was actually wearing the same clothes he had worn
when anelson had given him a ride so this man Alex put his hand on
olsson's shoulder and speaking in Portuguese told onson not to be afraid
that nothing bad would happen to him now according to onson the room was
illuminated by a bluish light Alex instructed onson to sit on a sort of
rubber looking chair chair in the room which on Olson did he sat down he was
there for only a minute or two when he passed out and then found himself in another room this room had strange
lights on the walls there was lots of Advanced Equipment in there which totally surpassed his ability to
understand or comprehend or even later explain to people Alex instructed on
Olson to undress which he did and then onson was given different clothes to
wear he said they looked like they were made of metallic fibers kind of like shiny n Nylon he said this these clothes
had a rough exterior but the interior was very soft on his skin so he was then
strapped into a chair of some kind a helmet or visor of some kind was placed
over his head this caused him some shortness of breath for a moment perhaps from Fear hard to say but once this
helmet or visor was placed on his head he started to see a unfamiliar scene a
valley which kind of looked to him like it was a small town in Europe with tall steep roofs and lots of churches Olson
also saw an egg-shaped object emerging from the ground in this area and along with it was this weird whitish cloud and
the ETS tried to explain to him that they were removing this dangerous substance from the earth so what that is
is not known onson says that he was then physically
examined he saw lots of weird things while I'm board this craft because at one point he says he saw what he
believed to be his twin or his double uh he also saw another room where
there were several hooded figures moving around on what looked like gliding
chairs at some point he remembered being placed in a container of some kind and
finally after undetermined amount of all of this he was released from the craft
using the same beam of Light which had taken him and was placed gently on the
ground so he he watched The Craft Dart away
and that was it but meanwhile on Olson's family had become concerned when he
failed to return home they began searching for him they quickly did find his vehicle but there was no sign of
onon and they couldn't find him anywhere for the next six days this search continued
they could not find him finally to their shock and confusion olon called them cuz
he was found wandering and disoriented on a hill outside of the city of ktina
this is in esperto Santo which is about 745 mil from where he was taken olon
himself says he woke up with no idea that it was now May 2nd almost a week after he had been taken he does remember
seeing this object D away but he was very confused disoriented had some trouble seeing in fact for a moment he
thought he was on another planet but thankfully there was some rain falling which quickly brought him
to full awareness and looking around he saw that it was night he was on a steep
hill that was very hard to get to he began shouting and was shortly later
discovered by a gentleman by the name of Caesar Manelli who's actually the owner
of the property where on Olson was found onson explained what had happened to him
and he was taken to the police and by this point word had spread newspaper
reporters were eager to get his story but Olson just wanted to call his family
because by this point they thought he was dead so he was taken home he was
besieged by reporters he did share his story it appeared in many newspapers and he said something very
interesting he said since his experience a year earlier he had been followed by government agents some of whom warned
him to stop talking about his experiences but he didn't he ended up
doing several more interviews and talked about his experience publicly so wow I mean how
about that case with the car apparently turning transparent that was his perception with his documents coming out
of his briefcase in that really unusual way he coming back from his encounter in
a completely separate location the things the ETS told him
seeing what he perceived to be his twin on board the craft there are quite a few cases like that again some of these
elements do turn up again and again in accounts but some are unique and this
case wow it's just so interesting to me the most interesting aspect was that he
picked up this hitchhiker who turned out to be an ET as you may know I did a
whole episode on extraterrestrial hitchhikers and this was a case that slipped under my radar I would have
included it but no here's another one of an alien hitchhiker that alone is
fascinating to me so let's move to the next case and this one definitely
deserves to be more well known uh I had heard heard about it but I finally decided to dive deeper into it and I'm
glad I did because this is a pretty well authenticated case particularly
considering what happened to the witness after his encounter I call this one the
case of David HL I think I'm pronouncing that right haml perhaps uh but this took
place on October 12 1975 in the rural area in British
Columbia called maple Ridge this of course is in Canada I like this case
it's got multiple Witnesses but to me the most interesting thing is that the
ETS had some very incredible information as we shall see to impart to this
witness that would completely change the course of his life this case comes from
pioneering Canadian researcher Graham Conway and originally appeared in the
journal Canadian UFO report but the case was also studied by Barry Henry and
others the primary witness is David haml a carpenter and he lived with his wife
Nora in a rural home on West Leon Lake Road this is in Maple Ridge Canada it's
a very sparsely populated forested area in the lower Frasier Valley but not too
far from Vancouver the hamls and a family friend on October
12 1975 were watching The Walton's TV show when suddenly the screen became all
filled with static and snow and to David's shock two human-looking figures
one male and the other female kind of Asian in appearance with reddish skin
seemed to emerge from the screen and they approached him he said that they were both wearing onepiece suits they
were walked right up to him touched his arm and began to speak with him telepathically saying that they were
going to elevate him up into a spaceship which was now hovering above his home
and David was astonished to immediately find himself in a different location presumably in this
spacecraft he was in this weird room which he says was about 30 ft in diameter 18 ft High had Windows all
around the edges he saw smaller rooms about 6x4 ft wide in fact he was given a
quick tour of the craft he saw that these smaller rooms contain drawers of some kind he did see a third person a
man with a beard now these beings told him that they were from another planet
which they called clayon and they told him it was a billions of miles from Earth these beings spoke to him
extensively answering many of his questions and providing all kinds of information that he described as highly
Technical and really deeply philosophical much of which was well beyond his ability to comprehend at
least at first but they did warn him about nuclear weapons and material they told
him that Canada should stop selling their can do nuclear
reactors they also interestingly claimed responsibility for the pyramids in
Egypt so David was then taken for physical exam he says they used a
strange instrument which displayed the interior of his body on a kind of
screen next he was taken to a kind of laboratory type room where they
explained how they are able to purify water for their craft at one point he asked them how they slept because he
didn't see any beds and they said they didn't need any beds as they were able to use a magneet magnetic device which
rendered their bodies weightless and that they slept while just floating comfortably in the
air they also told him that they powered their craft with sort of a free energy
perpetual motion device and that they would in fact show him not only how it
worked but give him stepbystep instructions on how to build it
himself so David estimates that this entire experience lasted about 15
minutes before he was returned to his home and it gets stranger here because neither his wife Norah nor their friend
apparently noticed anything so there was some speculation among researchers about
whether or not David was taken up into the craft astrally hard to say for sure
it's not clear but over the next few days and weeks more incredible and
strange events occurred David who had no college education said the beings returned and
began to instruct him on how to build this free energy machine an actual craft
now he could see them plain as day but his wife couldn't see them not at all
but she did hear their footsteps she could hear them walking around the house she saw doors opening and closing by
themselves occasionally various objects moving such as the blankets being lifted off the bed and so forth so it was clear
to her something was going on but David could see them and these beings promised
David that in the future they would show themselves to Norah in physical form
meanwhile they were giving him stepbystep instructions on how to build this alien motor this alien craft as
David says they're in my body I can't get away from them now David was not a rich guy lack
of funds and his lack of formal education were constant obstacles but
the ETS continued to tell him how how to move forward step by step instructing
him to buy certain materials and to contact various people in fact David did
reach out to many very prestigious institutions trying to get information
and assistance most just brushed him off a few did show some interest and said to
contact them should he be able to build a working model of this craft David did
try to get a government grant to do research but this was declined he was living on a disability income CU he had
previously been in the military but again not a wealthy guy he did finally
manage to get a bank loan for about 2,500 and spent his own money and as
time passed he ended up investing more than $6,000 on this
project now this engine was based on the principle apparently of counter rotating
magnetic rings with an off-center pivot in the middle you can see it he wrote
many many different plans for all of this and built working models in fact he
once completed the engine and placed it in an oil drum in his workshop and
prepared to retire for the evening but as he was lying in bed he started to
notice a red glow in his living room and jumping out of bed running into the living room he saw that his machine
which he kept kept in a barn had caused the oil drum to become red hot and
minutes later the machine exploded hurdling metal fragments in the magnetic components right through the roof of his
Workshop so disappointed but not to be discouraged David started over from the
beginning he ended up traveling to California to buy more magnets he says
he was led to certain bookstores to find information he needed to build his machine in certain books he says
sometimes he would receive information through a process of automatic writing
but yeah he created all kinds of very detailed plans uh and apparently really did
educate himself on free energy David did have his retractors some Engineers who
examined his ideas said the machine would never work however in other cases
in the UFO field many of Echo the same ideas of counter
rotating magnetic engines now at one point the beings told
David that they would be leaving as they had achieved their primary objective of teaching him but that they would
return and then one day David says they did come back they were driving this
weird car with weird license plates but it was them he said that they had the
reddish skin were Asian in appearance uh he re recognized them from his time on the craft and this time as promised they
revealed themselves to his wife Norah uh this kind of put David off a
little bit because they just wanted to talk to her which they did now Norah suffered from cerebral PSY and could not
easily communicate but it was very strange because when the visitors approached her they held her hand and
she was able to converse normally with them so so after this brief visit they
left again promising to return and here the case seems to end
however even as late as 2004 a reporter by the name of Mark
bakasi visited David haml in his home and learned that David was in fact still
working on his engine and he was kind of orinary and
said it will be done when it is done so what if I'm 80 it doesn't matter the
aliens planted these drawings in my brain they gave me all the instructions I needed it is now up to me to make it
work the end of the world is not far off and we need some of us to survive
otherwise All Is Lost the survival of the human race is at stake that's what
it's all about it's about the survival of our species so those who have looked into
his case uh are actually really impressed one lady by the name of Jean
Manning she wrote a book called the granite man and the Butterfly which
profiled his case in detail and she is an expert in free and clean energy and
she found his research to be very interesting another gentleman Robert
Thomas also wrote a book about David H's case the book's called
the word word made manifest through sacred geometry so unfortunately
ultimately David HL was never able to build a working Flying Saucer and at
some point he sold his property leaving much of the equipment behind the property is currently owned by Ray
Marshall and there's still bits and pieces of the this Flying Saucer project
on the property big rings of metal you can see where he was applying the magnets and all of this so a very
interesting case somewhat reminiscent of George Van Tassel and the Integratron
and many other cases in which people were taught how to build energy-free Motors I did a whole episode on that uh
so this case is pretty interesting in that regard such a shame that the
witness in that case didn't get to complete his invention this ET motor or
ET craft but such a fascinating case because there are a lot of cases where
ETS will take people down to the engine room and explain in detail how their
craft are powered how they fly and we'll provide in some cases details on how the
witness can build it themselves one of my early episodes on this channel
profiled cases like these and I think I mentioned this one very briefly in passing but I didn't have all the
information I found uh for this particular segment and yeah I mean this is an
undeniable case there's two books written about it and it's clear that
this is an absolutely valid case given that there are several outside Witnesses
and that this gentleman did in fact make some very interesting discoveries on how
these craft are apparently powered so I think it's a case that definitely
should be more well known and super
interesting and uh just really fits the profile what we see in so many different
cases all right moving on to the last and final case of this collection this
is another very little known case but has some really interesting and unique elements
to it I've never heard you know this one of the episodes in this case before it's
just interesting I call this one the case of Elizabeth Hess this occurred in
November of 1989 in Manhattan New York so this is
you know downtown very urban area where this lady was had her encounter so some really
interesting described ETS but it's what they did that to me is the most
fascinating this case first appeared in the winter 1991 issue of UFO Universe
magazine published by Timothy Green Beckley and was investigated by Mark
Landers and Janette Thompson of the Long Island UFO
Network the main witness again is Elizabeth Hess this is a pseudonym she
was born in 1954 and it was one year around Christmas time 19 1967 1968 Elizabeth
who was then 13 or 14 and her mother decided to go to a drugstore in Queens
New York to pick up a few items it was around 7:15 p.m. when they went but the
next thing they both knew they were standing in front of the store it was now closed and looking at the time they
saw it was 11:15 p.m. so they were missing like 4
hours they did not know what to make of this especially back then but soon more
answers will be forthcoming because it was many years later in November of
1989 Elizabeth now 35 went to bed around 2: or 3 a.m. in her second story
apartment on West 37th Street in Manhattan New York very densely
populated area her husband slept in a separate bedroom and Elizabeth had just
started to fall asleep when suddenly the room filled with a brilliant light and
opening her eyes she was shocked to see three or four short humanoids walk right
through the wall of her bedroom and stand by her bed the beings she said were about 5T
tall bald with larger than normal heads but not super huge their skin she said
was a dark kind of blue gray black color they had very large dark eyes with no
visible pupils wide flat noses a wide mouth she
said they had very thick necks also their arms and legs were quite thick had
very large hands with fat fingers thick nails they wore white coats kind of like
trench coats which went all the way down to the floor though she didn't notice that they were Barefoot and they began
to speak to her telepathically they told Elizabeth to rise out of bed and come with them
now Elizabeth who was sleeping without any clothes on asked them if she could get dressed the ET seemed to be somewhat
annoyed at this but they did allow her to quickly get dressed she put on jeans in a ski jacket and then walked Barefoot
with them downstairs and onto the street and boy this gets weird because on the
street she was astonished to see about 30 or 40 other people mostly women all
about her age they were all walking in kind of a trance right down the middle of West
37th Street heading towards the river she noticed that nobody else seemed to
be paying any attention to each other or to her and she was aware but she said it
was as if a force was drawing her towards a building by the river she
didn't resist and just walked along with this crowd of people she was amazed to see that there was no Street traffic nor
were there any pedestrians other than those who were with her the whole environment was eerily silent this is
just about impossible to imagine in this crowded Street in New York City at any
rate a short time later they reached the river and Elizabeth was amazed to see three classic flying saucers hovering
there complete with bright lights she also saw a tall thin creature
with no hair big black almond shaped eyes no visible nose a sort of pointed
chin and a tiny mouth which never moved what we would call a gray Elizabeth
thought she was female she said this tall gray had a very skinny body long
arms and fingers and was wearing a long flowing black robe with a hood she
couldn't see its legs but Elizabeth did have the impression that this tall gray
was in charge because this tall gray began to separate all the people people into small
groups and shortly later this tall gray called to Elizabeth again apparently
telepathically Elizabeth walked over and saw that this tall gray was standing near a table with a few different types
of glasses and pictures of water on it and Elizabeth noticed that some of these
glasses were very fancy and expensive looking While others were very plain and
simple and right next to all of this there was a bag lady a sort of homeless woman sitting on the ground and the tall
gry turned to Linda and said this poor woman is thirsty what are you going to
do about it so looking at the table with these different glasses of water on it
Elizabeth said I would like to give her a drink of water and the tall gry
indicated the table and said pick a glass so Elizabeth thought quickly and
looking at the different glasses she chose CH the largest and plainest and
gave it to the homeless woman this intrigued the gray who told asked her
what was the reason for your choice and Elizabeth explained that she didn't want anything to happen to the fancy glass
because the woman might not appreciate its worth and might drop it and break it
the next thing Elizabeth knew she was back at the foot of her bed in her Manhattan
apartment the beings who had taken her removed moved her ski jacket at this
point they pulled out what looked like a sort of large needle looking instrument this frightened Elizabeth she began to
struggle a little bit the ETS told her that they were doctors and they needed
to give her an injection and she was still struggling as these ETS place this
device onto her back right beneath her right shoulder blade and they seem to
extract this m mysterious white substance from her body the ET told told
her that this was poison and that she should stop smoking cigarettes and consuming so much
chocolate so they were giving her some dietary and uh advice on not
smoking so that's all she really remembers in the morning she woke up and did find a bump and a perfectly round
mark on her shoulder blade which was also swollen she told her husband what
happened and he was inclined to believe her her because he said that he recalled
someone telling him that night to stay in bed she noticed a few other things
following that night her stereo and clock radio no longer worked and she also began to wonder
about strange odors she had recently been smelling in her room before she thought it might have been pollution
from the street but now she wondered if it might be connected to these strange visitors in her
apartment now also related she believed is that prior to this and after she
suffered several miscarriages which doctors could not account for in fact in
her second to last miscarriage the doctors told her that they found no fetus in the sack and with her last
miscarriage she was rushed to the hospital this was during her third trimester but again there was no fetus
doctors told her that she must have lost the baby prior to this which Elizabeth denied
ended up giving her a DNC following this she stopped trying to get pregnant but
to her credit she did provide her medical records to researchers which did
verify what she was talking about including the missing fetus and as of
1991 her case was still under investigation so that was a pretty
interesting case don't you think I mean the way the ETS were described she does
have physical evidence as well phys ological evidence providing her medical
records to the researchers definitely adds a level of credibility the whole
missing fetus syndrome when I hear cases like that I have to wonder how people
can call this an interdimensional phenomena because where
are these fetuses going if this is like purely psychological or interdimensional
I mean that makes zero sense I know there are all different kinds of interpretations people have about their
experiences but I have to say that most people who have onboard contact do feel
it's extra terrestrial and certainly the witness does in this case even though
yeah there are some very high strangeness aspects to it I found her
description of the ETS particularly interesting because clearly at least some of them were not the typical Grays
but this whole deal with her being asked to choose a glass of water and which
glass she picked I found that really interesting so yeah I think all these
cases have some interesting insights and provide some real answers uh oh they
raise more questions too don't they but as I've said before each case provides
another piece of the puzzle helps us to figure out what's going on here uh shows
that we are being visited I mean I think at this point that's undeniable there are far too many cases to explain away
ignore deny inescapable that something is going on here I think we are being
visited it's that simple that's my assessment based on all the cases I've
researched and all the evidence I've looked at but that's what I'm just trying to do is provide the evidence so
everyone can make up their own minds all right I guess that's it for
today I hope you've enjoyed this episode profiling five really weird UFO
encounters all involving Landings and humanoids and onboard experiences all involving one form of
evidence or another different types of humanoids and cases from all over the world hope you've learned something and
found it at least entertaining but until next time I really want to thank you for watching
it's because of you guys that I do this show and I really appreciate that so
thank you thank you thank you and until next time keep asking those hard questions the answers are out there keep
digging for the truth it's up to each of us to farad it out I wouldn't look to
our governments for answers on this because they're not telling us the truth I don't think we'll ever get full
disclosure from them but most important of all keep having fun cuz if you're not
having fun what are you doing all right till next time guys I'll see you next Friday thank you very much
bye for now
