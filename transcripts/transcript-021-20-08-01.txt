UFOS OVER PRISONS
Aug 1, 2020

Summary:
Aug 1, 2020
UFOs are hovering over prisons!
UFOs are known to be attracted to technological installations such as power stations, military 
bases and more, including, evidently, prisons. These are not coincidental  fly-bys. In these 
cases prisons are being directly targeted. The objects hover at very low levels for long periods 
of time. They are often viewed by both prison officials and inmates.

There are more than 20 cases on record. These are not simple sightings, but also include 
physiological effects and strange electromagnetic effects. In a few cases, photographs have 
been taken. There's at least one case of a landing. Humanoids have been seen, and there's 
even an apparent abduction. Clearly something very profound is happening here!

San Quentin Prison, Lebanon Correctional Institute, Colorado State Penitentiary and many others 
have all had encounters. Some locations have been visited repeatedly. The question, of course, 
is why? After watching this presentation, you will know the answer.

For those who are interested in learning more about UFOs over prisons, I collected many of these 
cases in chapter six of my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three," now available on Amazon.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett i've  got a very exciting and unusual presentation  
for you today i think it's something  you probably haven't heard of before   and that's ufos that 
hover over prisons now  ufo investigators have long known that ufos  
are attracted to technological installations  like nuclear power stations or air force bases  
prisons i think fall under that category  so that may be what's drawing them here  
i can tell you that these are not coincidental  flybys prisons are being directly targeted these  
are typically very low level sightings often  they're pretty long lasting they're viewed by  
both prison employees and inmates in some cases  there are cases involving physiological effects  
cases involving electromagnetic effects there are  a number of photographic cases people have taken  
photos of these at least one landing humanoids  have been seen a possible abduction so yeah  
clearly something very profound is happening here  so let's just dive into these cases and see if we  
can figure out what's going on first case i  want to talk about took place on october 1st  
1997 at the peri correctional institution at  pelzer south carolina a correctional officer  
was in the wreck yard this is at night he  was getting ready to return the prisoners  
into the jail when a huge black silent object  moved at a very low level overhead it impressed  
him deeply however he did not report it to his his  superiors which i think is really ironic because  
that's kind of his job to report anything unusual  here he sees something that's extremely unusual  
it's so unusual he's afraid to report it because  he thought it might jeopardize his employment  
april he eventually did report it to new fork  so that's good the national ufo reporting center  
another case took place on april 8 1993 a group  of three people residents of the area were driving  
along highway 14 directly next to the prison in  newton iowa they there's this field right next to  
the prison and looking into this field they could  see these bright red lights that were rising up  
out of the field they quickly stopped the car and  got out and looked at this thing saw it for only  
a few seconds before it either disappeared or  darted off uh they did eventually report their  
sighting to the mutual ufo network mufon lots of  other cases july 13 2001 a corrections officer  
at chattagay prison or corrections facility in  new york was on his way to work to the prison  
and saw this bright glowing object hovering  over the prison it was making weird  
yo-yo movements going up and down repeatedly would  stop hover dart at right angles he pulled over  
and actually watched this thing through  binoculars for a number of minutes until   it suddenly darted away at he said hyper drive  speed toward the north when he arrived at the  
prison he found that there was another guard  at least one who had also seen the same thing  
another case occurred in june 1987 at  the correctional facility in coldwater  
michigan this case involves a number of  witnesses the main witness was a prison  
guard who worked at the facility he was actually  at home at the time his home is only four blocks  
from the prison and uh he was outside late at  night when he saw this huge triangular object  
move very low level over his house and directly  toward the prison the corrections facility  
uh his wife actually works at the corrections  facility so he was very interested to see if  
she saw it and tell his own story so finally  she comes home and he tells her what he saw  
and she's like wow yeah there was the whole  prison was on buzz about it it turns out  
other people had seen it there they sent out  a prison alert response vehicle and the people  
in that vehicle saw the same apparently the  same triangle so the next day the guard goes  
to the prison and he asks around and everyone's  strangely hushed and no one will talk about it  
another case occurred on may 15 2006 at the  prairie du chien prison in wisconsin it's a very  
interesting case three people were driving by the  prison when they saw these strange lights hovering  
over the prison smokestack they pulled over  and watched watched this thing it turned out it  
was not just lights it was actually a triangular  shaped craft and as near as they could tell it was  
hovering over the prison smokestack they watched  it for about 10 minutes before it darted away  
their residents of this area and started asking  other people and found out that a lot of other  
people had seen this same thing repeatedly this  triangular object hovering over the same area  
of the prison so yeah clearly not a coincidence  if it's happening multiple times here's another  
really interesting case which occurred in  2012 at a the prison in henning tennessee  
there were two witnesses a housing unit supervisor  and a perimeter patrol officer and i just would  
like to read a direct quote from the prison patrol  officer and let him tell you what he saw so here's  
this quote i was working a unit on the back  side of the prison when a mobile unit called  
into central control and reported an aircraft  hovering over the trees the outside supervisor  
was not able to come at that time so my shift  supervisor called me to go out the back of my  
unit and report this is a maximum security prison  so all aircraft reports are very serious to us  
i stepped out of my unit 250 yards to my right  was an aircraft hovering at treetop height  
no lights no sound the top of the trees were  not being disturbed i reported to my shift oic  
officer in command that there was an aircraft  and it was making no sound just hovering it  
hovered maybe three minutes then backed away from  the institution turning to its left as it did a  
report was written and turned into the shift o ic  it was boomerang shaped like the stealth fighter  
had two white circles larger than what airplane  engines look like where the engines would be  
so yeah another amazing case from a prison  guard himself the perimeter patrol officer who  
thankfully at least this was reported to superiors  so a lot of other cases here's another from a  
corrections officer at the evans correctional  facility located in bennettsville south carolina  
this occurred in the 1990s and again  i'd like to just give a direct quote
i was on duty that night and assigned to be  outside monitoring the perimeter of the prison  
at the time of the event i was driving  the security truck 10 miles an hour   around the outermost fence of the entire prison  the prison fence is in the shape of a rectangle  
but with rounded corners as i came around  one of the corners there was a huge object  
about three times the size of the moon  sitting on the tops of the palmetto trees  
at the back of the prison property i stopped  the truck and stared for a moment in disbelief  
then i raced to the hawk post located at the  back right corner of the prison i jumped out of  
the truck and banged loudly on the door to be  let in i had tears streaming down my face and   was hysterical i was screaming for the officer  in there to give me his binoculars i got them  
and got back in the truck and sped around to  where i had seen the object but it was gone i  
drove to the back of the prison and got out of the  truck and just looked around up at the sky after  
a little while i noticed two tiny lights in the  sky that zigzagged up into the sky and disappeared  
after about a half hour i received a call on  the radio asking why i was not making my rounds  
around the perimeter of the prison by a lieutenant  inside the prison i told him he needed to come  
outside he did and i told him what i had seen  and he went out back with me to have another look  
but i didn't see it again i knew when i had  first seen it that it could not have been from  
this world the whole object glowed white and also  looked as if it had tiny white lights all over it  
so yeah another really impressive report and  there's so many more most of these do seem to  
come from the prison employees this next case  i'd like to talk about occurred on august 15  
1983 at the bedford hills correctional facility  for women in bedford new york the witnesses were  
employees of the prison and they were on their  way there driving up to the prison when they saw  
this huge gigantic black boomerang shaped object  over the prison they estimate it was about two  
football fields wide uh and covered with lights  they saw other people driving by who also saw this  
what's really interesting about this case is the  witnesses reporting a very strange feeling of  
static electricity and all their hair stood up on  end they also had the impression that the object  
knew it was being observed and was  also looking at them studying them  
another case i'd like to talk about  november 3rd 2018 at umatilla prison in new  
erna oregon and this is from an inmate  and i'd like to just quote him directly  
so here's the inmate talking i was in prison  prisoning i just happened to look up at the  
right time and noticed a moving light that it was  that was at the right altitude to be a passenger  
or cargo jet but it was moving too slow and it  didn't have running lights like normal craft  
it was just me and one other guy out in the  wreck yard and i suppose he was looking at it  
at the craft as well when the craft slowed or  seemed too slow it's shown a white laser at  
one or both of us my fellow inmates said what was  that lighted shown at us i replied it stole our  
soul but deep in my subconscious i thought or felt  i had received some sort of information and that  
it would be main made known to me to my conscious  mind by some trigger or in my time of need  
i lost sight of it by looking away i hope whatever  it was will help positively benefit humanity  
another case i'd like to talk about took  place on june 4th the year 2000 this is at  
long larton prison in south littleton england  yeah cases from outside the u.s as well  
uh this one took place in england to a security  guard by the name of jim brace he had exited the  
prison his shift was over and saw this classic  flying saucer saucer shaped circling the prison  
this was around midnight there  were other people looking at it   he immediately tried to call the police  but strangely mysteriously his cell phone  
malfunctioned so he runs back into the prison and  calls the police from the prison gate house and  
the police said that they thought it was a blimp  but later retracted this statement another case  
took place on august 16 1997 at michigan  state penn this is in ionia michigan  
and this comes from another inmate and i'll  quote him here i don't know what made me do  
so but i looked up and saw something in the  clear blue sky i mean you get tired of looking   at men all day long i looked at it for about 10  seconds trying to figure out what it was that i  
was looking at it just hovered there in one spot  now the inmate then turned to his friend and said  
what is that his friend replied what is  what so he points to where he saw the object  
and it was gone so he scans the sky and  finally found it in a different location   and points it out to his fellow inmate and his  friend says man i don't know what that is says the  
inmate we then looked down into each other's eyes  and then looked back up this thing and it was gone
many other cases another one on april 8 1993 at  lebanon correctional institute in warren county  
ohio some of these objects stay for quite a while  and this is definitely one of these cases this  
glowing red object was hovering about 40 feet over  the prison and it was seen by multiple security  
personnel it stayed there was changing shape  stayed so long they finally called the police who  
confirmed that they had received multiple calls  about this object one caller said it actually  
chased him down the road but here it was staying  over the prison for a period of three hours  
the police called up wright patterson air  force base uh in wright-patterson ohio  
they denied sending out any aircraft said it was  not appearing on their radar and that they knew  
nothing about it they were later called again  about this incident and denied receiving any  
calls whatsoever which is a lie because we know  that the police did in fact call the prison  
uh so there are another case that's very similar  occurred on july 16 2016. this is at south boise  
correctional complex in boise idaho both staff and  inmates saw this silver oval-shaped object which  
remained for one and a half hours over the prison  and it was seen by most of the staff and all the  
inmates who were able to see it uh watch this  thing for a very long time until it finally left  
a really enormous case very complex and very  well known actually took place on august 13  
1960. this is over the town of red bluff  actually over several four or five counties  
in northern california the whole incident  began around nine o'clock when there was a  
loud boom directly over the tahana county jail  following this for the next two three hours  
this glowing red object was seen darting all over  the place over a fairly widespread area dozens of  
police officers from different counties saw this  thing it was chased on radar some police officers  
chased i mean it was caught on radar some police  officers chased this thing for a number of hours  
uh two hours at least two officers got very  close to it this was patrolman stanley scott  
and charles carson they approached within about  300 feet of this object and saw that it was  
sending down beams of light they described  it very clearly it was a metallic object  
several a couple of the officers uh provided  sketches of this thing so yeah this is a very  
long lasting sighting it's undeniable that  something was there at one point this thing  
was hovering directly over the red bluff county  jail and uh seeing that it was right over the jail  
some police officers called the jail the jail  guards to confirm this incident the guards were  
pretty busy with the prisoners so what they  did is they took all the prisoners or those  
that they could and marched them out under the  roof of the jail so they all could see this  
thing guards and prisoners watched this thing  this was a major case it was investigated by  
very prominent ufo investigators such as walter  webb james mcdonald and dr james harder and in  
fact dr james harder some eight years later would  testify about this exact incident before congress  
at the 1968 congressional hearings on ufos a  very impressive case took place on april 23 2007  
over the millbrook prison millbrook prison is  located in elmore county alabama and the main  
witness to this case was a correctional officer  by the name of dave david middleton edelin ii  
and uh this occurred right before he was doing the  head count he was actually doing the head count  
to return the prisoners back into the prison  he was out there in the prison yard counting  
the prisoners when suddenly there was this huge  blast of wind everyone there looks up and there's  
this triangular shaped it looked almost like  a cloud a triangular-shaped cloud-like thing  
moving over the prison people saw this from  different vantage points some said that they  
could see that it actually had a metallic surface  to it some said it looked almost translucent but  
it was very low about 500 feet overhead everyone  who saw it said it clearly looked artificial  
and uh it was totally silent this thing basically  buzzed the jail and moved off into the distance  
and was chased away when two military jets showed  up so david middleton edelin was called into the  
office of his superiors to report on what he had  seen he described his sighting and they said that  
yes many other people were talking about this  thing and they did not know what it was it was  
the buzz of the prison for quite some time david  middleton edelton edelind later reported this  
case to mufon it clearly impressed him and in  fact he would later become himself a paranormal  
investigator and wrote a book about  ghosts and other paranormal events  
probably the granddaddy of this these types of  cases is what took place repeatedly actually  
over colorado state penitentiary in  canon city colorado and if you don't  
if you think these sightings are coincidences you  own after hearing this case because this prison  
was targeted repeatedly over and over again at  least four times over a period of years decades  
really the earliest case i could find at uh this  colorado state pen occurred on august 2nd 1965  
a tower guard and two other guards the tower guard  main witness his name was donald steitz and he  
and two other guards saw this pulsating glowing  object very close by it was hovering for about  
30 minutes another case took place about  12 years later this is on september 1967.  
uh the main witnesses are a group of men who went  camping actually some distance from the prison on  
the other side of the crestone mountains there to  the west and they were out camping near creststone  
when they saw three glowing objects very very  high in the sky suddenly they came swooping down  
and scared the daylights out of them as you know  they came swooping down in sort of buzzed them  
rose up and went to the east over the  mountains to where this prison is cannon city  
penitentiary colorado state pen the next  day they scanned the newspapers and found  
there was in fact an article about this and  there was a huge event over the prison there  
turns out these objects targeted the  prison and were going all around it  
multiple police officers saw this uh dozens  scores or more they were chasing this thing  
which remained for two hours uh when it wouldn't  go away they finally you know they called in arena  
reinforcements thinking this was a prison break uh  and they chased this thing for two hours you know  
they were pretty nervous about what was going  on here to the point where they finally called   the local peterson air force base told them  what was happening peterson air force base  
agreed to send out two f-106 uh interceptors  to try to intercept this thing which they did  
one of the pilots got a visual contact on  this and had his instruments trained on it and  
asked his superiors for permission to fire  at this exact moment the objects took off  
in an upward arc very quickly the two f-106  interceptors tried to chase this thing but it no  
it was going way too fast they could not follow it  and it was gone uh some ten years later after that  
a another case occurred this was on august  in august 1976 an officer was on tower duty  
and saw this 100 foot disc came very low  very close to about 600 feet away he said  
it made a low humming noise it was moving  at about 20 miles an hour very leisurely  
and didn't stay that long and took off but what's  interesting about this case is he said it affected  
him physically he became very disoriented  in its presence and afterwards in fact for  
about a week or two weeks later he felt strangely  disoriented and had very disturbed sleeping habits  
so yeah these things are affecting  people physically in some cases   the last case that i could find that  occurred at this colorado state pen  
occurred on january 10 1998 in this case both  prison guard and inmates saw it the prison guard  
was returning the prisoners to the metal shop to  return the tools and uh when the guard and inmate  
he was with looked up and saw this thing this  one was very high in the sky which is unusual  
for most of these cases which are very low but  no this one was pretty high up there it looked   but it was chrome-like and gigantic while  it appeared very high it was huge and the  
officer estimates that this thing was probably  about the size of 10 jet airliners put together  
so yeah like a huge mother ship he's never seen  anything like it before a number of cases people  
have photographed these objects hovering over  prisons one case took place very recently in fact  
just a few months ago this year on february 20th  2020. this one took place in the town of preston  
in lancashire england lancashire  england in this case the witness was  
a lady by the name of gail jacques it  was around 1 30 am when she saw this  
very bright glowing white object and it was  moving over the house tops and went right over  
preston prison and hovered there so she quickly  grabbed her camera and snapped a photograph  
it hovered for only a few minutes before this  thing darted off at incredible speed she said  
uh she knew this wasn't anything normal  she didn't hear anything so she posts this   photograph online and asks people what they think  it is she got a lot of opinions of course some  
people thought it might be a star but it's clearly  not this was below the level of the clouds others  
mentioned helicopter but it couldn't have been  that or a plane because it had hovered and was  
silent other possible explanations were venus  perhaps or the international space station  
couldn't have been venus it was the wrong time  obviously wasn't the international space station   if it's starting away at high speeds someone  mentioned a drone but drones aren't permitted  
to hover over prisons so yeah it's unidentified  another interesting photograph i don't know much  
about this case other than that it took place  at barrow county jail in georgia in 2012.  
when a bunch of people in this area saw  this object there was more than one witness  
uh who saw this thing moving overhead  it was right over the barrow county jail  
when this one of the people managed to snap this  photograph so it's a pretty interesting photograph  
this is from mufon i was reported to the mutual  ufo network but uh you'll have to make your own  
judgment on the authenticity of these photographs  but another another case one of my favorite really  
i found very interesting very credible also  involves photographs and this took place on  
uh september 1st 2015 at around 3 p.m this is  in northern california over the very famous  
san quentin prison and it's an amazing case and  i'd just like to quote directly from the witness  
himself who was driving by the prison heading  south and i'll just give you his direct quote  
not sure how to start other  than to tell what i saw today   i was driving over the richmond san rafael  bridge from work towards corte madera california  
today and i saw this extremely bright almost  chrome-like sphere hovering over san quentin  
prison it had a little bit of a blue hue to  it and looked like it was rotating or pulsing  
i couldn't pull over on the bridge and lost sight  of it behind the hill i was sure i'd catch it in  
the past between the bridge and larkspur landing  so much so i got out of my car at the shooting  
range there and was perplexed that it wasn't  there i got back in my car hoping to see it again  
i was looking all over when i saw it over by the  village shopping center south of the 101 i lost  
sight of it at the hill next to the parking lot  it was because it was heading toward mount tam
it was very low in the sky i was  looking frantically to my left   and only glanced to my right to turn off the  freeway and spotted it on the opposite side  
on my far right between me and the north hill  of corte madera i pulled over immediately  
and used my work ipad to quickly snap  five pictures in rapid succession  
after 15 to 20 seconds it appeared to almost  fade into itself and disappear i sat there  
baffled the pictures don't show how bright this  thing truly was it was like looking into the sun
so yeah this was a case that was reported to  mufon uh i think it's a very impressive case  
and fits this pattern of these objects  hovering directly over the prison this  
one is interesting because it was midday  and a lot of people should have seen this
the only case i could find involving  humanoids that were directly viewed
was also reported to mufon case number 18809  and this one again is from a is from a prison  
inmate and i would like to quote him directly  because it's a very interesting story so here's  
the prisoner talking my name is kevin and for  over 10 years i have kept this to myself and  
have never told anyone till now on december 6  2006 i was at foothills correctional facility  
and at the time i was serving a 24 year sentence  for second degree murder i did not do the crime  
a co-defendant did and while at this  facility i was in a rehabilitation program  
for gang members on this  particular night i was in my cell   and out of the corner of my eye i saw  a light coming towards the building  
at first i thought it was an airplane because  there's an airport nearby but something told me   to look a light was coming over the trees i said  to myself that's too low for an airplane unless it  
was about to crash then i said helicopter and then  i noticed there was no noise coming from it at all  
it like floated over the treetops just high  enough to clear the top of the prison i was in  
which was a five-story building i couldn't  tell the shape of it because it was that bright  
as it got closer it appeared to have windows on  the side and as i looked hard to see if there  
was anyone inside i saw four beings at the window  of the craft looking out i said to myself no way  
there's no way i just witnessed a ufo i tried  to shove it out of my mind but i felt scared  
and i am a type of person who does not get scared  at anything i have been out of prison for two  
years now and just got the guts to tell this  the reason why i've never told this to anyone  
is because i felt like i would have been deemed a  crazy lunatic so to speak i do not know if anyone  
else has reported seeing anything at that date but  i do know what i saw i just wanted to tell my sort  
my story and i hope it sheds some light or at  least have someone look into see if there was  
any other reports around that time just to put  my mind at rest to let me know i am not crazy
so yeah pretty impressive report uh final case  and this is the only case i could find involving  
an apparent abduction this took place on august  9 1968 at the correctional facility in wales  
wisconsin and again i just want to quote the  witness directly so this is the witness talking  
i was abducted from a juvenile prison  brought back a few hours later and then  
charged with attempted escape because i wasn't  in my room for the 3 am count in the ship  
i was given a 7 dotted mark on my forearm and  a shot of some kind in the base of my neck  
the 7 dotted mark was with me for over 10  years the neck mark for only a week or so
so yeah it's a briefcase i wish i had more  information on it it's the only case i could find   where there were abductions but i'm guessing there  are more uh so i mean it's hard to draw any really  
firm conclusions on this but with 20 21 cases  i think we can see that there are some definite  
patterns very low level sightings sometimes  long lasting with some you know physiological  
effects and so on i did a study of these you  know i first found about three or four cases  
some 10 years ago and wrote an article about  these cases for fate magazine i've since located  
many more which i put together in my book not  from here volume 2. uh so yeah i think i know  
the reason behind these cases i think like as i  mentioned before prisons are very secure locations  
you know they've got these barbed  wire fences these gigantic walls  
electric fences searchlights towers these are  very much like military bases and i think that  
primarily is what's drawing ufos to them but i'm  not sure that's the whole story because let's face  
it there are a lot of people in prison there are  uh let's see some over two million people who are  
incarcerated in the united states alone that's a  lot uh now abduction cases are pretty widespread  
in fact a lot of investigators think they're  fairly common i'm one of them and the roper  
pull a survey organization did a survey on this to  see how many abductees are in the population and  
they found the markers of about 1 in 50 people so  if that's true that would mean there are about 40  
000 people in the who are abductees in the prison  population that's a lot of abductees who may be  
being abducted directly out of their cell and  who could they tell and who would believe them  
i think it probably happens a lot more  than we think but they're just not talking  
so yeah these are very strange cases and i think  it's important people know about them and i   think it sheds a little bit of a window into who  these visitors are to our planet and their agenda  
so that's it for now once again thanks  for watching and keep having fun
