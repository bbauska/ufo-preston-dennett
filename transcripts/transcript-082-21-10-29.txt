CAUGHT IN THE ACT! CASES OF OBSERVED UFO ABDUCTIONS
Oct 29, 2021

Summary:
Oct 29, 2021
Although UFO abduction cases number in the thousands (or in the millions according to some researchers!) there is an almost complete lack of cases observed by outside witnesses. UFOs are almost never caught in the act of abducting someone. How is this possible? How can so many abductions go completely unseen?

This scarcity of outside witnesses has caused some researchers to speculate that UFO abductions may be mental events with no basis in physical reality. However most UFO investigators are well aware of why there are so few witnesses. The main reasons seem to be that outside observers are put in a trance, made to forget, or are diverted to other locations. In other words, the mysterious absence of outside witnesses is apparently no accident. 

But nobody's perfect, not even ETs. Surely there must be some cases where somebody saw an abduction take place. And as a matter of fact, there are cases of observed abductions. But they are shockingly rare, so uncommon as to be almost statistically insignificant. But they do happen.

This video presents twenty cases in which ETs have been caught in the act of abducting someone. These accounts show that sometimes, on very rare occasions, outside observers are put in a position to witness events that almost nobody else gets to see.

These cases raise many questions. How and why do so many abductions go unobserved? Is the fact that some are observed an accident or is it intentional? What do these cases tell us about the nature of the UFO phenomenon and how advanced the ETs actually are? 

The cases presented here will hopefully provide some insights and answers to these many questions. If you would like to explore more about cases of observed abductions, you might be interested in my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three." Now available.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a brand new episode of ufos in the paranormal I call this episode caught in the act 20 cases of observed abductions 
ufo abductions are not nearly as rare as used to be thought they possibly number in the thousands tens of thousands or even millions according to the roper 
survey which found that one in 50 people show the markers of a ufo abduction 
so this might be quite common but what isn't common are cases of observed abductions there 
are almost no cases of outside witnesses observing people being taken on board ufos 
researchers believe they know the reason for this which is because ET's cover their tracks 
very well they will divert abductees to remote locations 
they will stop traffic they will put people in hypnotize or a sleep state or or suppress 
their memories they use various techniques to sort of make sure that these abduction 
cases are not observed by outside witnesses and yet there is a handful of cases in which 
abductions have been observed it's so rare to be almost statistically insignificant 
but there are enough cases I think that it deserves a closer look and that's what this episode is about I think these cases reveal some pretty interesting insights into the nature of 
the ufo phenomenon so let's just get started because i've got 20 cases i'd like to cover 
case one rivalino mafra da silva this is a very well known case in its country brazil 
this occurred on august 20th 1962 on that evening rivalino and his three sons were in their home 
when they observed shadowy figures moving about the house and it was shortly later they saw 
ufos two glowing objects described and I quote two large ball shaped objects 
which were hovering outside their home so this was observed by riva lino and his three young 
sons but at this point rivalino became somehow hypnotized and started walking towards the objects 
as if in a trance and as his three sons watched this object began to approach their father 
and it emitted a thick yellow smoke the smoke engulfed rivolino and when it cleared he was gone 
and so were the two ufos this of course frightened the kids badly they immediately called the police 
and an investigation ensued during which the boys were accused of murdering their father the boys 
of course denied this they stuck to their story they were questioned extensively and could not 
be swayed from their story it was later learned that rivalino himself or perhaps his neighbors 
actually had a prior encounter the day before in which his co-workers or him rivolino himself saw 
a pair of three foot tall beings walking past rivalino's house these were dwarf-like beings 
they were digging a hole in the dirt next to the home and when spotted ran into the bushes 
shortly later a glowing red ufo took off from the bushes and disappeared 
needless to say rivalino was never so that is the first case of of an observed abduction 
the second case I call case two filiberto cardenas this is probably my favorite case of this 
kind and certainly one of the best verified it's very well known in the ufo field it took 
place on january 3rd 1979 when filiberto cardenas was driving with his best friend 
his wife and his best friend's wife four people were in the car driving outside of hailey florida 
at this point their car mysteriously stalled so phil liberto and his friend got out 
lifted up the hood and were examining the engine and at this point they both 
heard a very loud buzzing noise coming from overhead and meanwhile in the car 
their two wives could see a large black object hovering over the men not that high up 
at this point the two men discovered that they were paralyzed unable to move and filiberto 
himself was levitated in full view of all three witnesses and abducted inside this object which 
quickly flew off as filiberto was being lifted up all three witnesses heard him screaming don't 
take me don't take me but of course the object did and immediately the three remaining people 
drove directly to the police and reported their story the police began a search and it was a few 
hours later that they found filiberto in a field about 10 miles away from the original location 
he was quite disoriented but appeared to be fine uh he was reunited with his friends and his wife 
about one hour later and the highly florida police department filed an official report 
detailing this abduction of filiberto cardenas by a ufo this account was told in the book 
ufo contact from undersea by virgilio sanchez osejo and wendell c stevens this case generated 
quite a bit of attention in the ufo community and in fact filiberto was interviewed by j allen 
heineck this started this was actually just one of several abductions and feliberto was eventually 
taken to what appeared to be an undersea base along with his wife and given many predictions 
it's quite a remarkable case but important here is that it was absolutely observed 
in full view of three other people this is extraordinarily rare but again it does happen 
that moves us along to case three oliver lurch which might be one of the first reported cases 
of a ufo abduction this occurred on christmas eve 1890 when 20 year old oliver lurch 
was abducted by something outside of his home in south bend indiana 
the event began when oliver's mother asked him to fetch a pail of water from the the well outside 
their home and he walked outside the house and suddenly everyone in the house heard him screaming 
help help it's got me everybody in the house dashed outside they could still 
hear oliver crying for help however his voice now was coming from above 
everybody scanned the sky but nothing could be seen what they did see was oliver's tracks in the 
snow leading about halfway to the well at which point they stopped and disappeared they searched 
the entire area including the well but oliver lurch was never found so was he abducted by aliens 
it's hard to say what exactly happened but they did hear his voice allegedly coming from above 
this is a controversial case researchers have looked into it and some believe that it's actually 
a hoax printed in the newspaper for attention as it turns out there is a story a fictional story by 
a very well-known author am bros beerus which has many details in this story which are identical to 
this account so some believe that this case is basically a hoax hard to say for for sure 
but I present it here for what it's worth and it's not the only case now move along to case 
for martin cohen this case took place in leeds england on a june 30th 1988. it's a pretty 
interesting case at 10 30 p.m on that evening martin cohen was walking through round hay 
park in leeds this is a very large park when he says he was struck by a purple beam of light 
from a flying object he was levitated quickly up in this beam of light and into the object at 
which point he lost consciousness the next thing he knows he is being deposited via this same beam 
of light back into the park and it's now several hours later meanwhile that evening according to 
the news desk at the yorkshire evening post they received several anonymous calls from people 
who said that they had seen quote a purple light in the park with a man in the center of it 
some of these apparently saw this man being pulled up martin cohen and others saw him being deposited 
one of the witnesses allowed his name to be used his name is michael kotran and he was jogging in 
the park that morning when he saw quote a purple glow ahead of him in the park the glow disappeared 
to reveal a man lying on the ground unconscious michael kotran ran up to the man who he actually 
thought had died and the man of course turned out to be martin cohen who had been abducted several 
hours earlier into this object so this case did generate a lot of interest from researchers in 
england they converged on the case and interviewed the gentleman there are a few researchers who felt 
that uh her michael kotran and martin cohen were hoaxing however they had no proof of this 
and both men refused to retract their story they absolutely stuck to their story and said that this 
happened so while they were accused of uh possibly making it up there's no evidence that they did 
so it's a very interesting case to say the least I find it convincing because of the accounts of the phone calls being placed towards the yorkshire evening post
and now we move along to the next case case five is anonymous this case occurred on june 14 1994 
in north east arkansas the witnesses are also anonymous i'll call them kevin and his 
girlfriend janice who are driving along highway 40 at around 1 30 am through northeast arkansas 
at some point kevin became disoriented and for some weird reason took an exit 
off of interstate 40. he had not meant to do this and so he was trying to find his way back 
onto the freeway when something very strange happened he came upon a house that was glowing in 
light and this puzzled him so he actually got out of the car to take a closer look and as he says 
i walked around the back of the car which is sitting in the middle of the road I stopped and listened crickets were chirping tree frogs were crying lightning bugs were lighting 
nothing was out of place except for the two-story waltons looking house lit up brighter than day 
so he says this house reminded him of the house on the television series the waltons at any rate 
he was quite startled by this so he crept down the driveway of the home and approached within 30 feet of this house and as he says then I saw what was bothering me it wasn't 
that the house was lit up brighter than daylight it was lit up inside and out bright inside and 
out how in god's name then I crept a couple of feet and I saw what haunts me to this day 
hovering above the house was a craft according to kevin and it was he says close enough 
to toss a rock and hit it he said it was a huge black triangular shaped object and he prior to 
this was skeptical of ufos he actually was an ex-military officer quite familiar with aircraft 
and did not believe in ufos but now seeing this he saw something he says quote I can't explain 
the craft was stable had no hum whine or rumble silent i'm taking this all in i'm seeing a large 
craft not man-made wow at this point he heard his girlfriend janice calling for him to come 
back into the car and he said no you come out take a look at this so she did she joined him and he 
pointed to this object hovering above the house she became extremely frightened and said we have 
to run away and kevin pointed out that there was no use running if this was truly a ufo coming from 
other star systems there was no way they could possibly outrun it and she was very frightened but 
kevin said he had no fear whatsoever and told her let's just look for a few more seconds and 
this is when things went from weird to truly bizarre as kevin says just then it got crazier 
a woman floated out of the light and in through a closed window I told my girlfriend okay i'm done 
get in the car this is too much and we got back in the car and left so this was was reported to 
new fork the national ufo reporting center or mufon because they felt that this was an event that deserved to be known and I agree it's a very 
unusual case of an observed abduction and it's certainly not the only one we now move to case six 
a farmer from hobbes new mexico we do not have the name of this farmer but this case was revealed by 
leonard stringfield who is a very well respected researcher this occurred on in a september 
day in 1974 and this anonymous farmer was driving his pickup and had just approached his home in 
the town of hobbes new mexico at which point a huge quote disc shaped object descended over 
the fields about 500 feet over his barn and almost directly over the farmer the farmer was amazed and 
leaned out of his window and was looking up at the object meanwhile watching from the home 
was the farmer's wife daughter and neighbor and according to leonard stringfield and I quote 
suddenly before their eyes the pickup truck with the farmer in it was lifted vertically 
from the ground and vanished into the underbelly of the disk hysterically the farmer's wife called 
the police needless to say this farmer was not returned he was never seen again though according 
to stringfield this case is quite reliable as springfield says the facts of this case still 
incomplete are in the confidential files of the international ufo registry the investigator in 
this case is a radio newsman prefers to remain anonymous through a good source 
he got the basic information about the incident from an officer only on the basis that the names 
and most of the data be kept confidential until the victim was found dead or alive 
so apparently this came as a leak from the police station itself in hobbes new mexico 
so yeah this is a very interesting case of an observed abduction and again the person was not 
returned according to stringfield and I quote the mystery of missing persons linked to a ufo is a 
sensitive subject most publicized cases involving missing persons and ufos turn out to be cultish 
shenanigans occasionally one like the hobbes case takes on serious overtones interestingly just 
two years later stringfield would investigate another similar case involving an entire family 
that disappeared following a ufo encounter so there you go yet another case and there's 
another one right behind it we now move to case seven kelly conway this occurred way back in 1973
prior to that a gentleman by the name of steve omar a resident of hawaii 
started to hear about numerous ufo sightings in the area he was intrigued by this and 
started collecting the reports and before he knew it he became a ufo 
researcher he formed a ufo group started holding meetings speaking publicly on the subject and on 
the radio he started publishing a newsletter and really started looking into these local sightings 
and by 1973 sightings were so numerous in the hannah district of maui hawaii that 
members of this ufo group decided to conduct a first-hand field investigation in the area 
steve omar didn't go on this particular outing but the director of the group 
kent liskam the secretary of the group kathy conway conway's brother and conway's boyfriend 
and a few others all went to camp at a location known as the seven sacred pools 
this was where most of the activity was taken taking place i've actually been to this area 
i've swam in the seven sacred pools so I know this area quite well at any rate steve omar 
got an incredible shock when his group returned the next day saying that conway was missing and 
that she had been taken inside a ufo and that this event was actually viewed by her brother
as steve omar says and I quote that day kent liskin her brother and the others 
arrived at my office shocked her boyfriend was traumatized they said my secretary kathy conway 
had been abducted by a ufo at seven sacred pools witnessed by her brother it the ufo moved out over 
the ocean near the pool's stream end and she swam under for a closer look a beam from the 
ufo hit kathy it flew off and never returned her brother was shocked she vanished kathy's 
boyfriend is now one of my best friends and was so in love with conway he has never gotten over 
it kathy never showed up for work as scheduled and never phoned wrote or contacted us ever again 
she was a very reliable responsible employee no internet search has found her at the time 
of this incident ufo abductions were not very well known that just started to be reported 
so this event took steve omar and his ufo group by complete surprise as steve says and I quote this 
case was the first abduction we had ever heard of in hawaii by 1973 there were hundreds of new 
abduction reports a part of ufology that had been rare before the 1970s however books and magazines 
were full of abducted people who returned we had never heard of an abducted person never returning 
that does seem to be a pattern in some of these cases however this next case is even more alarming 
case 8 todd sees this case took place on august 4th 2002 in north umberland pennsylvania 
early that morning around 5 30 a.m a farmer in the area noticed that his horses were skittish 
and looking up he saw a round object hovering over some power lines above montour 
ridge suddenly this object moved a few hundred feet to the east stopped sent down a blue white 
beam of light to the ground and according to the report on this case which was reported 
to the national ufo reporting center and I quote what was seen next was very unnerving he saw what 
appeared to be a man suspended in the light he was being pulled up head first he was moving his arms 
slowly in the light what looked like a man was being pulled up into the bottom of the craft 
a few seconds later it started shuddering went west very fast stopped briefly then went straight up and out of sight the whole incident lasted about 10 minutes 
meanwhile there were other witnesses including three fishermen on the susquehanna river who saw 
the object flare up dart upwards and disappear and two other farmers reportedly saw an object 
hovering over the power lines and here's where this case starts to get really bizarre 
because it turned out on that day a gentleman by the name of todd sees he was 39 years old 
a resident of the area or had gone deer hunting up montour ridge where this object had been seen he 
told his family he would be back around noon he left at 5 00 a.m and noon arrived and todd sees 
did not come home so his family went looking for him and found no sign of him they did 
find his four-wheeler parked about two miles from his home at the west end of montour ridge 
so they called the police and the next day he was declared missing and a huge 
search was launched more than 200 volunteers and a bunch of rescue dogs covered montour 
ridge fire chief leon geiss headed the search and actually brought in six teams of k-9 search dogs 
and these tracking dogs and bloodhounds were unable to pick up todd c's scent a 
state police helicopter crisscrossed the ridge and found no time no sign of todd 
either and it was about 30 hours after todd had officially disappeared at 9 00 pm on august 5th 
that one of todd's family members found his body in a wooded area at the base of the ridge only 
a few hundred feet from his home and about two miles from where he had parked his four-wheeler 
what's weird is that this area had already been very thoroughly searched and nothing 
was there todd's body was found face down he was undressed except for his underwear and had 
a red rag tied around his arm he was holding his throat and had an expression of fear on his face 
there were no visible signs of trauma on his body however next one there was a dead rattlesnake 
but they could not find any bite on his body so immediately agents from the fbi 
came in quarantined the area and would not let anyone else in including family members 
and later an autopsy revealed that todd's seas had apparently expired 24 hours earlier 
but no immediate cause of death could be determined toxicology tests were inconclusive 
and officials told the family that todd may have had an allergic reaction to bee stings 
this explanation was not accepted by todd's family and as it turns out their officials 
weren't certain either because they held todd's body for two months before finally returning it to 
the family and for a month following this incident military helicopters were seen by the family 
and other residents in the area crisscrossing over montour ridge where todd had disappeared 
and it was three weeks after todd's death that one of his boots was actually found 
in the top of a tree but no other trace of him was ever found so this is certainly a grim case 
i don't know quite what to make of it as far as I know it's actually unique none of the other cases 
involve this outcome but there are other cases for sure we now move to case nine radar 
we do not know rado's last name this is a case which was brought to our attention 
by ukrainian researcher marie cova this occurred on october 7 1989 in venita ukraine a 10 year old 
boy by the name of rado was in his bedroom with his pet dog and cat when he says three 
tall human looking figures came through the wall into his bedroom there were two men and one woman 
and they all wore silver colored coveralls jumpsuits and they asked rado to come with him 
and rito said he'd only go if he could bring his dog and cat along and the figures agreed and 
rado found himself flat floating through the wall towards two disc shaped objects which hovered just 
above the ground in his yard radio entered one of the disks and found himself visiting what appeared 
to be another planet and he said that the people there all had very large kind of glowing eyes 
at some point the ET's drew a sort of tattoo like figure on rado's body and uh
around 6 a.m the next morning this is when there were outside witnesses rado's grandmother woke up 
to find that rado was missing and nor could they find his dog or cat she looked outside 
and saw that the chain where the dog was kept was actually floating perpendicularly in the air 
and looking up she saw the dog floating down from the sky and onto the ground 
meanwhile rado's brothers were astonished to see rado himself float down by the roof and into a 
second floor window where he was gently deposited onto his bed rado told them what had happened and 
pointed to the marks on his body which were drawn by the ET's and these marks disappeared 
after one day it's a very unusual case but again has outside witnesses which absolutely lends a 
level of corroboration and credibility to these cases and now we move to the next case which is 
case 10 amy rylance some researchers have called this an incredibly well verified case uh 
although there are others who feel like there may have been a hoax uh how this all began was on october 5th 2001 when keith and amy rylance a married couple from 
australia and their friend petra heller were watching television in their home in australia 
it was around 9 30 p.m and they each went to bed for the night and about two hours later 
petra came out from her bedroom and to her complete shock she saw amy 
rylance unconscious floating out the window in a bright beam of light and into quote a huge 
spaceship that was hovering outside their home she fainted and immediately woke up and 
screamed for amy's husband keith by the time keith rushed outside the object was gone 
however vegetation below where the object had hovered appeared to be burned 
keith immediately called the police and told them what happened the police were skeptical about 
the ufo story but 90 minutes later an hour and a half later amy rylance was found at a gas station 
in mckay queensland this is almost 500 miles away an eight-hour drive at the quickest so 
amy rylance was extremely disoriented she was dehydrated she had unexplained marks on her body 
she was so disoriented she even had trouble remembering her own name but she did quickly 
recover and recall being taken into a brightly lit room where she says tall figures started taking 
bodily samples from her a police investigation followed and some of the investigators felt 
that this might have been a hoax though this was never proved and there was no evidence to support 
a hoax and in fact the evidence showed that this probably took place certainly the details that amy 
described are things we've heard in many other cases marks on the body extreme disorientation 
dehydration these sort of things and amy to her credit agreed to give a notarized statement 
attesting to the truth of her story and all three witnesses were extensively interviewed this did 
get a lot of press attention but when it started to get a lot more attention all three witnesses 
withdrew from the public eye and sort of disappeared from public view so it's an 
interesting case of an observed abduction and it's not the only one we now move to case 11 
whitley strieber whitley strieber is hugely well known I don't really need to tell you who he is 
he was a fiction author who came forward as an a ufo experiencer and his experiences have been 
very vividly described in many books that he has written and he had a very interesting encounter 
where he very nearly observed his son being taken this occurred on april 2nd 1986 and 
in the middle of the night whitley went to go check on his son and had as he says quote the most 
appalling experience of my life he walked into his son's bedroom who was just a very young infant 
and his son was gone he raced through the house and as whitley says a few minutes 
later i'd searched every closet and room I had to face the fact that my seven-year-old son 
was not in the house at 3 20 in the morning at this point he ran outside to check the yard and 
looking up he saw a massive black object hovering a few hundred feet above the house as whitley 
writes suddenly I realized what was happening that was a gigantic unknown object up there 
and my son must be in it I had interrupted the visitors in the middle of one of their abductions 
at this point a gray e.t appeared next to whitley and compelled him to return upstairs 
as whitley writes I might as well have been paralyzed for all the control I had over myself 
he went back to bed and fell asleep he woke up the next morning rushed into his son's bedroom 
and his son was asleep in bed so although whitley didn't actually see his son being taken 
he came darn close so I included this case in this video because it is pretty much a case 
of an observed abduction moving along to the next case we now move to case 12 jason andrews 
this is another really extraordinary case of very high credibility jason andrews is 
a very well known abductee from england his mother ann andrews has in fact written 
three books about his case and her own experiences with ufos and extraterrestrials after 
many many inexplicable incidents including close-up ufo sightings entity encounters and more 
they finally came to the conclusion that jason was in fact being taken by ETs and as he grew up 
this activity not only continued but intensified and in 1996 when jason was 13 years old he was 
being abducted from his room regularly on several occasions and woke up to find that her son was 
missing from the house and on each occasion she'd return to sleep and jason would be back in his bed 
the next day one night in early 1996 paul andrews the husband and ann were woken up 
by sounds coming from jason's room they got up to investigate and found jason's older brother 
daniel sitting on jason's bed holding jason's stuffed teddy bear and crying 
the bastards have taken him again daniel said I knew it was happening but I couldn't move 
i couldn't stop it I hate them so ann tried to comfort her son daniel and reminded him that jason 
has always been returned meanwhile paul jason's father became very angry and said 
i'm getting the police i've had just about enough it's out of hand this is not what normal families 
go through ultimately they decided not to call the police they knew that was just opening 
up a can of worms instead they called another abductee who was helping to counsel them through 
this whole situation and uh anne was speaking with this abductee on the phone when jason was 
returned in the living room right in front of her suddenly the room quote filled with an intense 
white light there was a loud crackling sound like thunder their dog chism began whining in fear 
the light became dim then the dog chisholm suddenly ran to the foot of stairs and began 
barking happily and there was and son jason walking down the stairs toward them 
jason explained that he had been taken to see one of the quote tall beings who told them that 
they had been who told jason that they had been watching earth for hundreds of thousands of years 
and that they knew all about jason's family so there you go another case they actually 
saw him being returned into their home a really shocking case of an observed abduction or very 
closely to being observed is very well known and this is case 13 frederick valentick 
there are a number of cases in which pilots have seen ufos and then disappeared and this is one of 
them on october 21st 1978 frederick valentik was flying a single engine cessna over bass strait 
in australia when he reported a ufo covered with bright white lights this was just a test flight 
this object approached and then began to hover above frederick's plane he said it was shiny and metallic and had a green light on 
on it said the object appeared to be toying with him and was orbiting above his plane 
his own plane he said was experiencing engine problems that had begun to idle roughly 
he was in contact with the tower control operator steve roby and was telling him all these details 
and he told steve roby it's hovering and it isn't an aircraft and then suddenly and without 
any warning the radio transmission was cut off in midstream there was a sound that steve roby 
described as a metallic scraping sound and then total silence steve roby immediately reported the 
event to authorities and a days long search ensued unfortunately nothing was ever found 
no wreckage frederick valentick was never seen again ufo investigators did uncover several 
eyewitness reports of ufos in the same area at the same time of frederick's disappearance there were 
some skeptics who tried unsuccessfully I think to debunk the case this case has never been solved 
and frederick's family and certainly his father guido believed that he has been had been 
taken by a ufo and never returned and it's not the only case like it we now move to case 14. 
felix mancla jr and robert wilson this is also known as the kinross incident this is 
fairly well known it occurred on november 23rd 1953 when the u.s air defense command 
radar tracked a ufo traveling over lake superior at an estimated speed of 500 miles per hour 
they immediately scrambled a an f-89c scorpion jet interceptor from nearby kin ross air force base 
to pursue the object lieutenant felix mancla jr was the pilot and robert wilson was the onboard 
radar operator and robert wilson watched the radar screens which showed this object getting 
closer and closer this was also reportedly seen on ground radar the tube lips got closer 
and closer and suddenly the images on the screens merged and the ufo flew off a massive search 
was launched to find the missing pilots and the missing jet but neither were ever found and these 
two pilots were declared missing and presumed dead at first this incident received zero publicity but 
thanks to researcher donald kehoe he found out about it and began an investigation and in 1958 
donald kehoe actually obtained an air force document which quoted one of the radar observers 
who said quote it seems incredible but the blip apparently just swallowed our f-89 and 
this event became famously known as the kinross incident and according to sergeant o d hill 
of project blue book was only one of many such incidents that had officials worried at that time 
the vast majority apparently had been covered up by the u.s government
so yeah the pattern is becoming quite clear in these cases many of which involve people who are not returned and that's what happened in the next case case 15 involving an anonymous pilot 
this occurred in june of 1965 and the witness is 16 year old jim cumber who would actually later 
become the state section director for mufon in the state of utah but at age 16 he and his family were 
taking a vacation at bottomless lakes this is just outside of roswell new mexico and uh jim cumber 
himself was an amateur astronomer on this occasion he did have a pair of seven by fifty binoculars 
and was looking at the sky when he saw what appeared to be a satellite as he says as it passed 
overhead I zeroed in on it with my binoculars and I continued to watch it as it moved directly 
between two small stars and stopped dead between them it didn't slow it just stopped and hung 
there dead still for several seconds then it went out as if someone had turned off a light switch 
so at this point he knew it couldn't be a satellite and he was amazed when 15 minutes later 
four pairs of jet fighters appeared and began to perform a grid pattern over the area where 
he had seen this object and jim cumber watched all of this through binoculars and was watching 
one of the pairs of jet fighters approach the area where the object had actually disappeared 
and as he says in his own words as this pair of aircraft passed through where the ufo had 
disappeared the wingman to the right rear of the element leader flew directly through the 
point where the ufo had vanished and he vanished as well I was watching through the binoculars 
and the wingman disappeared as if someone had flipped a switch no navigation lights no engine exhaust the element leader flew on for perhaps one or two miles 
before he apparently noticed the wingman was gone then his air burners bloomed and he dove straight 
for walker air force base at full burn straight in with no approach circle I looked up and saw 
all six of the other aircraft do exactly the same thing they lit their burners and dove directly for 
walker air force base forget the approach pattern within five minutes there wasn't a plane in sight 
what happened to that aircraft near roswell in 1965 occasionally even now more than 30 years 
after the incident I wake up at night with that very burning question in my mind 
seeing a jet fighter simply vanish before my eyes is something i'll never forget 
so yeah jim cumber later became the state section director of utah for mufan that's 
how deeply this event impressed him and now we move to case 16 which involves two 
anonymous sisters and this was reported to the website website phantoms and monsters 
anonymously by a gentleman who had another witness with him his brother but his brother had since 
passed away so he felt it was important to get this story recorded before it was too late 
this is a very interesting case again of an observed abduction i'll just quote the witness directly in this case and let him tell you what happened 
i have not talked about this for 55 years and it's time that I disclose a strange event which took place in 1965. my brother and I witnessed aliens abducting two young 
girls who lived in the trailer next door we never told a soul about this encounter and now that he 
has passed I am the only person left to recount the events of that fateful night which changed 
our lives forever we were living near bossier city louisiana as our father was working deep 
underground in the air force missile silos and he was gone for days at a time in these bunkers 
he had just come home on a three-day leave and we were so happy to be able to spend time with him 
my brother and I played with our dad all day and we were bushed come bedtime 
i slept in the upper bunk and my brother slept in the lower suddenly around 4 am we 
were both awakened by a low thundering sound in the most brilliantly colored light display 
just outside our window I moved to the window and looked down to see my brother looking out 
we both watched a flying saucer land in the field close to our neighbor's trailer
our family was very close to these neighbors and the two young girls living there were friends to my brother and myself I can't recall their names but they were approximately 7 and 10 years old 
we debated about waking our parents but were so frightened and thought if we woke them and they 
start turning on outside lights or walk outside with any weapons there would be 
sheer panic so we sat very quietly and simply observed this flying saucer was about 50 feet 
in diameter and had multi-colored lights around the perimeter everything beneath the craft was 
distorted and wavy as it was gently settling down in the dirt field there were four metal legs that 
slid down from the craft with round pads on each all the lights on the craft went out 
within 30 seconds after it landed but a light blue glow started to envelop the craft 
and it made the area around it glow as well then a ramp slid down from the craft and a door opened up 
we could partially see inside there was dull red and orange lights on the walls and an electrical 
crackling sound emanating from the interior then the interior lights went out the weird 
sounds stopped and suddenly a figure started to walk down the ramp followed by another the first 
two beings were walking down the ramp and made their way into the light of our neighbor's yard 
they looked human in shape and size but moved in a way that made them function more like robots 
every movement was very smooth and effortless as though they were moving about in water they 
now remind me of the blue man group from las vegas because they were completely blue all over 
then two beings exited the craft and they were green another two and they were red until there 
were six of them in all they walked in a line up to the door of the trailer 
they passed right through the door without opening it and that scared the heck out of us we were asking each other did you see that what are they going to do with our friends 
minutes later they passed through the door again and they were leading the two girls all the way back to their ship the girls appeared as if they were sleepwalking 
and even had their eyes closed but walked just fine without any help from these strange beings 
the girls passed right through the door without it being opened to only about five minutes later 
they exited the ship and led the girls back into the trailer but when the beings passed 
the door for the last time as they were coming out they all crouched down slightly turned 
and looked directly at our window each one did this in succession and they smiled and waved at us 
now at this point my brother and I were in complete shock we were unable to say a word 
they entered the ship and as the last one went inside the interior lights came back on 
the strange noise started up again and the door closed the ramp slid back up inside the craft 
and as it slowly lifted off the ground the four legs retracted up as well the colorful lights 
came back on around the perimeter of the ship and it slowly lifted skyward it was about 25 
feet in the air then it shot straight up and out of sight in less than a second 
the last being standing at the door of the ship waved at my brother and I before it closed 
that is the lasting image burned into my memory ever since that strange night so finally he did 
report it to the phantoms and monsters website and i'm glad he did because as you we've seen it's 
while unusual not entirely unique I do have my own case which I am currently researching at this time 
it's one of the reasons I was inspired to do this video because I actually did know of other cases 
i covered these cases in my book not from here volume three so I was quite surprised when I ran 
into my own case involving a lady in florida who was being returned to her home following 
an abduction and her father comes rushing in just in time to see this happen and he asked 
her you know what was going on and is this what I think it is are you being taken because he himself 
was an abductee and she admitted that yes she was being taken by the ET's and that was 
pretty much the end of the discussion i'll have more details when I do further research on this 
but it's another case of an observed abduction and there are many others but it starts to get 
repetitive I might mention of course the case of travis walton which occurred on november 5th 1975.
his co-workers watched him get struck by a beam of light from a ufo and as you may know they drove off and didn't see him actually taken but it was close 
another very famous case of an observed abduction I won't get into because I already covered this 
case in depth in another episode called the top 20 ufo encounters in new york this of course is 
the case investigated by bud hopkins involving a lady by the name of linda napolitano this is 
the brooklyn bridge abduction case which occurred on november 30 1989 and was allegedly observed by 
more than a dozen outside witnesses it's sort of the classic case of an observed abduction 
and again I won't go into it because I already covered it in depth but this case was presented 
in bud hopkins full-length book witnessed so that's another case of an observed abduction
and another case i'll just mention one more would be that of betty andreason again I won't get too 
deeply into her case because it's very well known her case was investigated by raymond fowler 
and he's written a half dozen books on her case she's written a couple herself 
and in brief one of her first encounters that she was actually conscious of was observed by outside 
family members betty andreason lived in ash birnham massachusetts at the time this was 
january 25th 1967 and grays came and took her from her house but before they did they were actually 
observed by her father uyno aho who saw them coming towards the house as he says and I quote 
the creatures I saw through the window of betty's house were just like halloween freaks I thought they had put a funny kind of headdress imitating a moon man 
it was funny the way they jumped on after another just like grasshoppers when they saw 
me looking at them they stopped the one in front looked at me and I felt kind of queer 
that's all I knew at that point he passed out meanwhile the figures continued to approach and 
the next person who saw them was betty andreasen's daughter becky andreason she saw a bright 
light outside and a silhouetted figure approaching and she also blacked out but it was a short time 
later she spontaneously woke up and saw her mother betty andreasen talking to the grays in the center 
of the family's living room and as becky says describing one of these ET's 
he looks like a clay man talking to my mom some kind of man creature and right behind to the right 
there's a little one and there are two after him that are just exactly like triplets 
they look like clay they are very kind and they don't mean any harm but they're scary to look at 
they look scary so there you go those are all the cases I could find of observed abductions 
i'm certain there are more yes these cases are rare but they're not unique and I think 
they do have some very interesting things to tell us about the nature of the ufo phenomena 
first is the fact that they're so rare this shows us just how advanced the ETs are if abductions 
number in the millions and I think they probably do then this shows how incredibly advanced the 
et's ability is to hide how to turn people off how to suppress people's memories how to influence 
people to move to a desolate location so they can do their abduction how to stop traffic all these 
different details show how incredibly advanced the ETs are a second interesting insight I think 
is that these outlying cases these observed abductions show that ETs might not be perfect 
sometimes perhaps they do make mistakes and certain witnesses are able to observe this 
or perhaps they're just letting people observe it perhaps they're letting people observe it 
on purpose or perhaps they don't care because there is sort of an interesting pattern in these 
cases where a number of these people have not been returned and that is unusual but a third 
insight and I think probably the most important one is that these outside observed abductions 
prove that these cases are physically real there are a number of researchers in this field who 
maintain that abductions are psychological events subjective not physically real as these cases show 
and I think as many other details show these are physically real events people are not where 
they're supposed to be when they're being taken they're left with medical evidence implants and 
so forth there are landing traces there's many reasons to believe that these events are physical 
and I think these cases of observed abductions add to that conclusion that these are physically 
real events so yeah again I covered these cases in my book not from here volume three 
i think these are important cases and that everyone should know about them and that they do have these interesting insights into the nature of the ufo phenomenon and that's why I wanted to 
do this video hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you once again for watching and until next 
time keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
