TEN UNUSUAL EXTRATERRESTRAIL ENCOUNTERS
Mar 1, 2024

Summary:
Mar 1, 2024
UFO encounters are by their very nature, unusual, but some cases are weirder than others. This is especially true with close-up encounters with humanoids. UFO contact is so much more than just being picked up and examined. UFOs and ETs interact with people in many strange ways. This video presents ten cases from all over the world involving humanoid encounters with high strangeness. Cases from the 1950s to the 2000s. Cases with compelling physical evidence. Cases that have much to teach us about the ET agenda.

IF THERE ARE ANY MORE WARS. On Aug 30, 1955, 21-year-old David Ankenbrandt drove near his home in Mulberry Corners, Ohio when a UFO landed nearby. Going to investigate, he was confronted by a human-looking ET who had an urgent mission for David. When David explained that he was unable to perform this mission, the ETs insisted. Two days later, they returned.

THE ALIENS IN THE CORNFIELD. On the evening of Sep 25, 1957, Sam Aellig and his wife were shocked when a UFO hovered over their home in Alliance, Ohio. Suddenly, a dozen 7-foot-tall ETs walked out of the cornfield and stood in front of their home. One of the beings began to approach. Mrs. Aellig hid under the bed with their baby while Sam stood guard at the front door to see what would happen next.

AN ALIEN IN THE ANTARCTIC. On Dec 11, 1958, AQ1 Navy officer Roger D. Benson was transporting waste from the base at McMurdo Sound in Antarctica when he came upon a landed UFO. Beneath it stood a short humanoid with a huge head. Realizing he was seeing something unusual, he radioed the base in a panic. His message was never received. Unknown to him, the base was being plagued by UFO activity.

THE GIANT ON THE BEACH. One evening in Sep 1961, PHD student Stan Suban was taking a walk along the beach near Fort Tilden, New York when he noticed a group of very tall skin divers standing in a row on the beach. Then he saw a 7-foot-tall figure even more close-by and realized with a shock that it wasn’t human. He hid and watched for several minutes, but fled the scene in fear.

ALIENS IN THE BACKYARD. On the evening of Aug 28, 1963, 12-year-old Fernando Sagrada, his brother Ronaldo (9,) and their friend Jose (9,) were stunned to see a UFO hovering over their backyard. Inside they saw four tall humanoids. Suddenly one came down in a beam of light and approached the boys. Fernando tried to throw a brick at the figure, but it struck him with a beam of light. The figure spoke and then returned to the craft.

THE SJAELLANDS ODDE UFO & HUMANOIDS. On Jan 18, 1967, three boys saw a UFO moving overhead near their homes in Sjaellands Odde, Denmark. Two ran home, but 7-year-old Jesper Andersen stayed and observed eight very short humanoids emerge from the bottom of the craft in a little gondola. They moved closer to him, then waved and smiled at him before moving off.

THE ALIENS IN THE WINDOW. Around dusk on Apr 18, 1971, engaged couple Dennis D. and Marion L. were driving on the outskirts of rural Evans City, Pennsylvania when Marion saw a UFO with and two 10-foot-tall humanoids peering out one of the portholes. They drove closer and came upon the craft landed in a field. They watched it for twenty minutes, then decided it was best if they departed the area.

THE ALIEN ON THE HAM RADIO. On the evening of Aug 12, 1976, David L Dobbs was monitoring his ham radio as he drove outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. Suddenly an odd melodious voice came on the radio and instructed him to drive to a certain location. Upon arriving, David was confronted by a strange humanoid who linked up with him telepathically and downloaded volumes of information into his mind.

WHY DO YOU HATE? On the evening of Nov 1, 1980, an anonymous police officer was on routine patrol near Lucky Point, Indiana, an area of known UFO activity. Looking up, he saw a triangular craft at low altitude. Through one of the windows, he saw five big-headed humanoids. Then he heard a telepathic voice asking him, “Why do you hate?” The officer was shocked and had a quick response to the question.

UFO IN THE SUBURBS. Around 2am on Feb 29, 2008, an anonymous man was walking home in the small but crowded suburb of Coogee, in Sydney Australia when he saw something he could hardly believe, a car-sized levitating sphere with a short humanoid looking out at him. The witness hid in fear, watched for five minutes as the craft flew away. Afterwards, a discolored spot was easily visible on the road.

These ten cases reveal UFOs and ETs that behave in very unusual ways. And yet, they are just a tiny sampling of the huge number of cases. With so many cases from all over the world, coming from multiple witnesses, stretching back decades to the current day, supported by various forms of evidence, the time for ridicule and disbelief is over. We are being visited by extraterrestrials. We have much to learn from cases like these.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal got a pretty interesting set of UFO and toners I'd like to present to
you today I call this episode 10 unusual extraterrestrial
encounters I think UFO encounters by their very nature are unusual but the 10
I've collected today are particularly unusual the ETS behave in ways that we
don't often see and that's what I wanted to kind of highlight in today's little
collection as usual I do have cases from all over the world cases from over a
number of different decades going through time cases involving all
different types of humanoids cases with all kinds of evidence such as Landing
traces animal reactions electromagnetic interference and these kinds of things
the cases I have today are from the United States uh South America Europe uh
Australia as well so yeah some really interesting cases that are just a bit
off the beaten path and I hope you find them interesting certainly I found them
interesting and that's why I chose them it's going to be about an hourong episode I estimate so let's just get
started and the first case I want to talk about today I call if there are any
more Wars this occurred on August 30
1955 in mberry Corners Ohio and yeah this is a very unusual and
little known case involving direct contact a landed UFO humanoids and a
very interesting message from the ETS the main witness in this case is a
gentleman by the name of David anken brat he was only 21 years old when he
had a very unusual encounter now this case was investigated by Alan roou of
the UFO research Council of Cleveland and that organization has been
in operation for quite a long time it was about 1:40 a.m. on August 30
1955 as David drove along shardan Road Route 6 this is about 3 miles east of
Willoughby Hills when he saw a bright yellow light drop from the sky to his
right he thought it might have been a meteor and he stopped his car to investigate and as he walked out into
the field he was shocked not to find a meteor but some kind of aircraft about
30 feet in diameter with a dome on top now naturally this frightened him a
little bit and he turned and started to run towards his car at which moment went
a quote green light bolted out in front of me so he turned around to see where
this light had come from and found himself unable to move and as he watched
a door opened in this Flying Saucer and a man emerged walked up and approached
David face to face and per David this man was more than six feet tall and clad
in quote something like a ski suit and the man began to speak to him this
man spoke in a high pitched voice saying quote do not be afraid and then he had a
very unusual message the man told David that they wanted him to inform the
government in Washington DC that quote if there were any more Wars here we will
have to take over now at this point David protested and said that quote a
kid like myself would never be taken seriously but this strange man insisted
and said that David had only one week to deliver this message the strange man
then turned around and returned into the craft David was now released from his
paralysis this craft was apparently still there but frightened David turned and ran back to his car and fled the
area without seeing the UFO take off now no no surprise David did not
deliver this message to the government in Washington DC but two days later at
the same location David again encountered the UFO and apparently the same humanoid who repeated the same
message that David needed to tell the leaders in Washington the message that
they gave him so again David fled the area and this time he did tell his
mother and about three days later he took a friend to the same location in
search of evidence but they didn't find anything now David's mother hearing about this did some research and found
the UFO research Council of Cleveland and this case was investigated
in fact in late October investigators from that UFO group checked the site for
any Landing marks or radio activity but unfortunately they found nothing but
this case did get some attention from government actually because it was 10 months after the encounter that Project
Blue Book officially investigated the case and I'll put that word investigated
in quotes because they didn't actually talk to the witness at all but spoke to
only his mother and then labeled the case as quote psychological apparently they did not
relay the message to Washington and Wars on our planet continued no surprise David anen
Brandt's family and his friends disagreed with Blue Book's conclusion
added as did the UFC and in fact they invited David to a
UFO convention in Cleveland in December of 1955 but David declined he didn't want
any publicity and he didn't want to talk about his encounter so that is certainly
a very interesting case which deserves to be more well known the ETS apparently
did not follow through with their promise so that's kind of interesting
uh also it's unfortunate that the witness elected not to speak anymore about it but I totally understand at
least he did come forward allow his case to be researched and it doesn't surprise me
that he doesn't want to talk about it anymore because most Witnesses don't talk about it publicly that is at all so
I have to give kudos to him for at least coming forth and now we move on to the next
case which is so unusual not only in how the ETS behaved but what they looked
like I mean the whole encounter is really strange I like this case because
it involves animal reactions it's quite a lengthy and interactive encounter and
just unusual on a number of different levels I call this one the aliens in the
cornfield some of you may have heard about this one it was new to me uh so I
think you'll find it super interesting this one occurred on September mber 25
1957 in the very small town of Alliance Ohio this very unusual case has not
received really much coverage at all but it's quite interesting it was originally researched by David web a pioneering
researcher there are two witnesses Mr and Mrs AIG and it was late evening when
Miss aleig noticed a large luminous sphere of light coming from the
direction of nearby Berlin lake to the Northeast and this object began to hover
overhead she immediately called out to her husband Sam and he of course also
saw the light and he could see that this was very unusual he was concerned he immediately
told his wife to take their 2-year-old daughter and herself and hide under the
bed he then turned out all the lights in the house at this point the object move
closer to the house and then stopped about 1,000 ft above the cornfield
across the road from the front of their house at this point this object was only
about 275 ft away they estimate this object
was sort of pancake shaped but thicker in the middle so pretty much your typical Flying Saucer though it was
standing on edge and as Sam watched this object dropped in a yo-yo fashion until
it was only about 20 feet above the cornfield and at this point it seemed to
fade out and disappear but Sam wasn't convinced it was gone he kept his eye on the area
where this object had been and sure enough after about 10 minutes he saw a
group of 11 or 12 humanoid figures and
they were quite large quite tall he estimates that they were each about 7t
tall and very broad shouldered Sam knew this because they Rose above the corn
which at that time was about 5 to six feet tall each of the figures was
wearing the same type of tight tight fitting gray divers suit and as Sam
watched these figures moved through the corn field towards him at this point Sam
considered getting his wife and child and fleeing the area but the problem was
his car was parked at the end of his driveway right near the cornfield and by
this time the figures had exited the cornfield and were standing in one long
row at the edge of the cornfield all of them facing his house and one of the
figures had started to cross the street and was now starting to move towards
Sam's driveway so he decided it was too late to go to the car and he rushed around in
the house and grabbed his 16 gauge shotgun but couldn't find the shells to
load it he asked his wife where the shells were and she informed him that they were actually outside in the
garage but by this time this figure was approaching and walking up the driveway
itself and was in fact only a few feet from the porch so Sam was not willing to
go outside at this point and really had no choice but to stand there and watch from the
window now at this point their dog Danny boy who was normally very friendly to
strangers lifted his head and as Sam says emitted a quote a low throaty growl
that seemed to come from the back of its tail then the dog laid its head down on
its paws and meanwhile This 7ot Tall humanoid walked right by the house
literally only F feet away right under the covered patio and went behind the
house now Sam remained where he was looking out of this big picture window at the front of the house because there
was still this long row of humanoids very close all of them facing
him now at this point both Sam and his wife heard quote very heavy breathing
coming from the behind the house it sounded to them like this creature was
having labored breathing having trouble breathing but shortly then they found
they heard this sound of shuffling feet so following this sound they could
hear that this creature this being was returning back towards the front of the house so Sam looked out of the screen
door to get a better look and he did he got a nice close look at this figure and
confirmed that yes its entire body was was covered from head to toe by this skintight gray jumpsuit except for its
face now I couldn't really see the face now as this being walked by Danny Boy
the dog it growled again but the creature paid no attention to the dog
the figure then walked back down the driveway rejoined the other figures in this long row and like all of them
turned and faced the house moments later all in un
all 11 beings turned around and went back into the cornfield and disappeared
into the darkness now at this point Sam's wife and his child came out from under the
bed they had hid under there they estimate for about 20 minutes or so Sam
himself stayed up the rest of the night watching this cornfield until sunrise but saw nothing but he did notice one
odd thing during this whole time no cars at all passed along the road so how
crazy is that case I mean all the ETS just lining up in a row like that one
approaching so close the dog reacting the way it did there's just a lot of
interesting elements to it one thing I did notice that the witness mentioned that there were no cars passing by that
does seem to turn up in a number of these cases so there's something to that I think for sure but I'm glad this case
was was professionally investigated by Walter web a very good I think and
well-respected researcher and it's a case that deserves more attention and now we move to another
case which I find super fascinating mostly because of its location I call this one an alien in the
Antarctic I don't know that I've ever covered another case involving a landed UFO and a humanoid in the Antarctic so
that in itself is unique and super interesting this one occurred on
December 11 1958 at McMurdo sound base in
Antarctica and I like this case also not only because of its location but because
the witness himself is very credible and a trained Observer a military officer
just a super unusual and fascina ating case this next case comes from
researcher Ivon s derfield who actually published the account in ideal UFO
magazine issue number two and the main witness in this case is a Navy officer
by the name of Roger D Benson he was 30 years old at the time stationed at the
McMurdo base in the shadow of Mount arabus now Roger D Benson was an a q1 or
an aviation Fire Control technician petty officer and part of his his duties
while stationed at McMurdo sound base was included transporting waste and on
December 11 1958 which was a warm day for this area at about 20° fahit Roger
was driving a 11 weasel track vehicle transporting waste and this is is when
he noticed a strange object off in the distance and I'll just quote the Navy
officer Roger D Benson directly as he says in his own
words there shouldn't be anything there I was curious I radioed that I was
getting out of my vehicle jumped out onto the ice and took a closer look at
first I thought I was looking at some object made up of girs like a Tower observation or a g gantic radar antenna
I looked through the binoculars I was seeing what resembled a side view of an
airplane fuselage and the beams were a network of support structures like a
gear train Landing the quote fuselage was a cigar-shaped metal capsule with a small
indentation that could have been a door this whole thing seemed to be about 500
yard from me which would make it the which would make the object the same
size as a DC airplane 3 although I am completely familiar with aircraft this
was not any plane that belonged to us or the Russians then I saw the creature so
at this point the strange craft was parked on the ice itself with what looked like large Landing legs and this
creature that Roger Benson saw was walking beneath the craft it was walking
in slow low circles around the base of the craft and Roger at this point could
clearly see that it was not normal it was not human because as Roger says
again in his own words the being was very thin and grayish in color its arms
were swinging as it walked on the ice from a distance I couldn't be sure but
it seemed to have humanlike facial features except that the face consumed
almost 2/3 of its body at full height I'm ashamed to say now that I did
exactly what I shouldn't have contrary to the training I received I panicked I
climbed into my vehicle went back to the base and screamed into the radio after a few seconds I controlled
myself to look back the fuselage capsule minus the beam shaped landing gear which
could have been retracted was now Rising into the air I stopped long enough to
see the thing Fly Away presumably with that strange creature
inside so now that this craft and being were gone Roger apparently afraid of
ridicule and disbelief did not report his sighting to his superiors he did
however learn that his second panicked radio transmission was never received he
later did tell his friends about what he saw and later of course spoke to re researcher Ivon derfield and as it turns
out a lot of sightings were occurring in this area at that time because as yvon
derfield writes as operation deep freeze spread across the Antarctic in
1957 to 1958 radar trackingsm common place and in fact Phi
step B bugs a member of deep freeze wrote quote we were getting radar
trackingsm by operators at three or four different locations on the air and
ground there was absolutely no doubt that real UFOs were observed regularly
and frequently and in fact it was only two months earlier that Dr Yuri I danov a
leading Russian glacer expert stationed at vasto near the South geometric Pole
wrote that he and his fellow scientists were quote pestered by a low flying disc
and as danov says in his own words it was like a flat stone but apparently
made of steel and it moved in total silence it flew over us and then made
another pass at lower altitude we had an eerie feeling not only that we were
being watched but that some force was attempting to communicate with us I
remember a buring in my mind I'm absolutely convinced that this was a
voyager from the cosmos so danov is clearly trying to
describe some sort of telepathic communication now operation deep freeze
which Roger D Benson was a part of was led by us rear Admiral George J duek Who
later in an interview said quote I believe in UFOs I think that the
existence of flying saucers cannot be discounted reports of meteors probably
were saucers driven from Venus or other planets by intelligent beings so there
you go apparently not an isolated incident but one of a series of events
going on at that time with enough activity to convince a lot of highlevel
military officials surprising to me that this whole subject isn't taken more seriously
to this day because what that is gosh 60 70 years ago almost and it was
it's still not being taken as seriously the subject as it should be in my opinion how many cases is it going to
take before we just embrace the fact that we are not alone and here is another case which is
equally fascinating probably you haven't heard of this one it's not very well known at
at all though it was uh researched by a
UFO researcher so it's not just pure hearsay I call this one the Giant on the
beach this occurred in September of 1961 near Brooklyn New York and this is
again a super fascinating case not only because of the very unusual appearance
and description of the humanoid but also the way the humanoid behaved this very
and unusual case comes from early pioneering researcher gray Barker author
of the popular UFO book they knew too much about flying saucers and editor of
the saucerian bulletin where this account appeared gray Barker interviewed
the main witness a gentleman by the name of Stan subin who had had a bizarre
experience with a strange humanoid on the beach at Jacob Reese park near Fort
Tilden outside of Brooklyn New York as you can see here and I'll just quote the
main witness Stan directly because he describes his experience in excellent
and Vivid detail as Stan says in his own words at that time I was studying for my
PhD in audiovisual education I usually studied until about
1 or 2 a.m. afterward I would usually take Take a walk on the boardwalk to relax I
usually drove to Reese Park and walked on the boardwalk on the second week of September of
1961 I was walking on the boardwalk about 2:30 a.m. when I saw a fire on the
beach above the fire a sphere of white light hung suspended about a foot in
diameter near the water I could see about five or six skin divers I could
see the black wet suits with the white strings drawn at their arms they were all about 6' 6 in tall and well built I
was about 50 yards from the fire and was going to approach the skin divers then a figure approached the fire
and appeared as if it would approach the skin divers from the direction of the water it came up to the fire and bent
over it it remained in that position for about 30 seconds I decided not to
approach the fire until I could determine what this person was doing he walked around the fire several times
then stopped and took off what appeared to be sweatpants what then terrified me was
the appearance of this figure he was white as snow 7 to 7 and 1/2 ft tall and
had no distinguishable facial features I couldn't believe my eyes but stared at
him in Fascination and Terror at this time I took Refuge behind a concrete
block which was about 7 ft high after looking at the creature for several
minutes I knew that he or it was not of this world he walked with an animated
gate like a football player I was impressed with the massive power it seemed to have within itself as you can
see from the drawing I am no artist but this is as good a picture I can make of
the creature I do not believe the person was human so yeah a very unusual encounter
and I have to wonder if the skin divers themselves were not human either with
all of them being 6' 6 in tall that seems pretty unusual such an interesting
case yes it is a single witness case and there's no real supporting physical
evidence or corroborating Witnesses but the details the witness
does describe do turn up in case after case and it's amazing to me because
these humanoids are often so similar in some ways and different in others there
was a study done that over 60% of humanoids are 4 feet tall or under then
there are these guys who are very very tall it's so unusual very hard to
categorize and now we move to another case which is well known certainly in
the country of Brazil but I think outside of Brazil a lot of people haven't heard of this it's very well
authenticated with Landing traces apparently and at least three Witnesses
so that makes it very important but it was very thoroughly researched as well I
call this one aliens in the backyard it's occurred on August 28th
1963 at Bell Horizon Brazil and what's super interesting
about this case is because this is one of the most unusual descriptions of ETS
I've certainly heard of and it appears to be accurate because we have three
Witnesses who saw this these very unusual humanoids very very close up so
there's very little chance of misperception here yes they were children but still it was a pretty
extensive encounter not only did the ETS look very unusual
they behaved in very strange ways as we shall see again this has got to be one of the most unusual humanoid reports on
record and again it's definitely one of Brazil's most famous and very well authenticated it was originally
published in the Brazilian UFO publication the SB edv bulletin and was
thoroughly investigated by well-known Brazilian researchers Dr Walter K buer
and jolio Brandt alexo among others the Witnesses in this case are
the two sagata brothers Fernando age 12 and Ronaldo age n and their friend hose
gualberto age n was after dinner on the evening of August 28
1963 that the three boys were sent to do a chore in the backyard they were to
gather some water from the sistern so they could wash the coffee strainer now it was a moonlit night but
as they stepped outside they all noticed it was unusually bright in the backyard
but didn't pay too much attention to it at first and it was Jose who bent down
into the sistern to collect water in a bowl and to do that he literally had to
pretty much put his whole front section of his body down into this sister turn
to gather the water so he didn't see what was happening when Ronaldo was the first age n to see a
very large spherical-shaped craft floating directly above their avocado
tree only about 25 ft away now this object was very low I mean 15 ft high
and they said it was about as big as a large room it was transparent or
appeared to be transparent cuz they could see inside so object did have two large antenna on top the craft itself
glowed quite brightly Illuminating the area all around but inside this craft
they saw four beings who were all sitting on single pedestal to stools in
a row all facing forward all of them were dressed identically in what looked
like diving suits which were Brown on the Torso white below the waist it looked to the witnesses like
like it was made up of wrinkled leather these figures also wore black boots and
had round transparent helmets on their head and the Witnesses were close enough
that they could see that two of these figures were men bald in the center were
two stools side by side the rest were sort of in a row but in the center one
figure was male and the other appeared to be female as the witnesses saw that she did have long blonde hair pulled to
the back of her head they said the man in the back was a little heavier than the others the man in the very front sat
in front of a panel with a computer or TV like screen and he appeared to be manipulating this panel now here's where
it gets weird because all the figures appeared to have only one very large
dark round eye the boys did not notice any nose this could have been a mask but
that was not their impression at any rate Jose was still getting water out of the sistern he hadn't seen any of
the craft or beings at this point but Ronaldo and Fernando did and they stared
in amazement as two yellow beams of Light Came From Below the craft and the
male figure in the center of this spherical craft descended slowly between these two beams downward in an upright
position and very quickly he reached the ground and this figure began to walk in
a weird way very heavily very stiffly directly towards the two young boys and
the sistern with uh Jose still bending over
it now ronal Ronaldo and Fernando were just too stunned to react at first but
when this figure raised his arms towards Jose apparently trying to pick Jose up
up they thought Fernando lunged forward grabbed Jose pulled him out of the
sistern and basically threw him onto the ground to prevent him from being taken
by this being at this point the figure turned and looked at Fernando and
Ronaldo both of them wanted to run into the house in fact Ronaldo tried but he
banged his knee and stopped and at this point all three boys were standing
together watching this figure and all three of them said that they felt that they were unable to move or to even
shout out now at this point this figure is only 6 feet away and they could see
it quite clearly he was tall maybe six to 7 ft and they could see this diver
suit appeared actually to be inflated kind of like an astronaut suit they said
the skin on this being appeared almost reddish and at this point this figure
began to make a serious Ser of strange hand gestures and spoke in a strange
language that they could not understand Fernando the oldest said that when the
figure did this all his fear left him and he felt unusually very calm at this
point the figure went to the sistern and actually sat down on the edge of it facing the
witnesses and they all noticed one unusual detail is that the figure appeared to have difficulty bending his
arms perhaps because of this stiff sort of astronaut likee suit but as the figure did this turned
to the sistern and began to sit down on the edge of it Fernando quickly lunged
forward moved behind the figure picked up a piece of brick and got ready to
throw it at the figure and as he later told researchers I wanted to hit
him now the figure apparently noticed anticipated this because he stood up and
very quickly faced Fernando and immediately a beam of yellow light came out of the figure's chest and struck
Fernando's hand causing him to drop the brick the figure at this point according
to the boys seemed to laugh and then spoke again with what they described as a thick voice probably meaning low and
grally and again began making weird hand gestures to the boys this figure was
sort of drawing circles in the air with his fingers in an apparent attempt to
communicate then he pointed upwards took both his hands pressed the Palms
together and put them to the side of his head in sort of a sleeping
gesture then he pointed to the moon and raised his hands several times the boys
thought that he was trying to communicate that they were perhaps planning to fly in that direction
they're really not sure what he was trying to say but at this point the man
turned and walked back under the craft and Jose turned to Fernando and asked
will he come back at which point the figure must have heard this because he turned around and sort of nodded or
shook his head but then continued walking he bent down and picked up a
plant or a leaf out of the flower bed then he walked directly beneath the
craft made a hand gesture to the people that were inside the craft immediately
the same yellow beams of Light Came Down levitated him back up into the craft the
craft started to moveed silently upwards and then towards the east over the house and immediately sort of disappeared and
a flash of light producing a gust of wind now the three boys were shocked but
now able to move and they immediately ran into the house and told their mother
Maria now she had to believe them because she herself had noticed a strange flash of light earlier
apparently when this UFO first arrived but really didn't think much of it until these three boys came running in and
said quote come and see what a horrible thing it is now one of the boys Jose he
refused to go back outside in fact he ran and hid under the bed in fear
so Maria called the boy's father elides who was away from the house at this time
but not far and he rushed home he listened to what the boys had to say
immediately went into the backyard and found he says strange triangular-shaped
depressions about 1.5 CM deep so news of this encounter spread
fast through the town many of their neighbors expressed disbelief some were skeptical the boys however were very
deeply affected by this they refused to leave the property which was absolutely
contrary to their normal behavior Fernando was disappointed and amazed
that people were skeptical and said quote they don't want to believe because
one day they will end up seeing what we saw and then it will be proven that we did not lie I'm telling the
truth now thankfully there was years later a follow-up investigation when the
boys were adults Fernando still didn't want to talk about it because he was tired of
the ridicule and disbelief that he had suffered from going public but all three stuck to their story Ronaldo was working
at this point as a jewelry Setter Fernando was a well-respected
mechanic Jose was perhaps the most deeply affected because he said going
through this encounter made him unafraid of anything and he very fearlessly
joined the military he said the encounter transformed him in other ways he became a spiritualist and a
philanthropist helping to prepare and give food to the poor so you can
certainly find out more information about this case at the website phenomenon. comom
dobr it's an amazing case quite an unusual case I mean I don't know that
there are a whole lot of cases of alleged oneeyed ETS and I do wonder if
that was a mask they were seeing I don't know it's just so bizarre but certainly
seems well enough verified that it's worth serious consideration a lot of cases involving
kids this is probably not as unusual as it might sound because kids are often
outside out there playing and doing what kids do so kids do comprise a large
number of witnesses to UFO encounters and that's absolutely true in this next
case which I call the shayin odd UFO and
humanoids probably mispronounced that city name but this one occurred on
January 18 1967 at shayan's odd Denmark and this is
one of Denmark's actually more famous cases and it does involve three
Witnesses who yes are young children but given that there were three Witnesses it's clear something very unusual did
happen here but again we have an very unusual description of ets a very
unusual description of a UFO craft and the behavior of the ETS as well is very
unusual so these are the bizarre of the bizarre if you will of UFO cases this
highly unusual case is apparently pretty well known in Denmark but virtually unknown outside the country and again
there are three Witnesses T Jensen his younger sister age four and the main
witness Jasper Anderson who was only seven years old it occurred along the road from
niking jayand to Jalen's odd near where the witnesses lived and it was about 44
5 in the afternoon again on January 18 1967 as the three young children were
walking home and suddenly they saw this gray cloudy like object in the sky up
and ahead of them now Tage the older boy became afraid and he wondered if this
was some sort of tornado or water spout or something but believed it was dangerous to remain and he grabbed his
little sister and they ran home to inform wared their mother Now Jasper
however he had no fear but he decided it would be a good idea to take cover in a
ditch and he did and from that vantage point he watched as this object now
transformed itself into a roundish ball with a Corona of light and two brilliant
beams of light projecting downward at an angle this object moved around in the
sky for just a few minutes as the coron around it faded and Jesper could now see
that this object was solid and shaped more like a flying saucer you said it
glowed orange it had a long kind of rectangular window along one side and
this was apparently the source of the two beams of light on the other end of the object were antenna below the window
was what looked to him like strange symbols that he'd never seen before and this is so bizarre on one
side he saw what he believed was an image of a black man now at this point the object
descended turning it right angles moving in a strange wobbling pattern which is
often what we do see but it gave Jesper the impression that the pilot was having
trouble controlling the craft but it appeared to be coming in for a landing because he watched three
short legs extend from the bottom of the craft as it came down to about 3 ft
above the ground and just when it looked like it was about to land it didn't the
three legs retracted almost all the way not fully the object then Rose moved to
the Northwest and it emitted what looked like little black boxes which fell to
the ground those were never found but at the same time he saw what looked like a
sort of squarish gondola or a basket likee device being being lowered down
from a rigid column or cable from the center bottom of the craft moments later
an opening appeared in this object right above the basket and eight figures each
about 3 feet tall came down one by one onto this little basket or G
Gondola this point Jasper was close enough to see that they each had long thin phases faces long noses propped
blonde hair except for one who had darker and longer hair one of the
figures only one wore a solid blue uniform but the others also wore a blue
uniform but it had red and white stripes on it they all had what looked like
oxygen tanks strapped to their backs with a hose extended to their mouth kind
of like skin divers this was Jasper's impression he said they all also wore a
c cap and each had a flashlight like device fixed to their shoulder which
emitted light in both directions so Jasper watched all of this with absolute surprise as this object
began to fly directly towards where he was hiding uh he could see that they were
manipulating some kind of device which he likened to a camera or binoculars he wasn't sure but he didn't get a hostile
impression from them at all he said the crew appeared to be very friendly and in fact as the object began to move off
over a Grove of trees several of them apparently saw Jasper and smiled smiled
at him raised their hands and he thinks they were waving goodbye but they did it
in an unusual way this point he was close enough to hear a low thrumming
noise and as the object began to move away seven of the eight figures moved
back up in into the craft at this point this craft changed from Orange to purple
and it moved off now J Jesper estimates that the entire sighting lasted only about 5
minutes he immediately ran home and told his parents who at first were a little
skeptical but they knew that Jasper wasn't the type to lie and also they
learned that his two friends confirmed at least the beginning part of the sighting so they took him serious ly
jesper's father showed him pictures of various aircraft but none of them matched what Jesper saw so in a search
for answers jesper's mother contacted the Scandinavian UFO information group
who did an official investigation because otherwise this case would have gone unreported but they were never able
to identify what Jasper Anderson saw it would be awesome if there was a followup
on that case because I'm very curious if the witness had further encounters after
this it's an amazing case I mean with the ETS waving at this little boy I'm
glad he did have other Witnesses even if they didn't see the whole encounter and another thing that's
interesting about this case is how it very nearly went unrecorded so it
wouldn't surprise me one bit if a lot of other people saw this but just never told anyone never talked to about it
again that's what that's how most people react they just don't talk about it even
to close family members and friends so I think there's a definite lesson there if
you have an encounter don't be shy to talk about it all right moving along here's another
truly fascinating case which I call the aliens in the window this occurred on
April 18 19 1971 in Evans City
Pennsylvania and this is just a fascinating case of a very close up
sighting of a UFO and ETS looking down at the witnesses from the port hole in
the craft it was a round dusk on April 18 1971 as a young engaged couple known
only as Dennis D and Maran L drove through Evans City this is a rural area
north of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and they were on their way back home to maran's house this is when they noticed
a bright white light that seemed to be pacing their car as they watched very
suddenly this light abruptly crossed the road from right to left ahead of them stopped for a second and crossed back
over the road and moved off they thought it was over but of course it was just
beginning and curious as to what they had seen Maran made a point to gaze in that
direction where the light had gone and it's a good thing she did because as she's looking they were passing by this
short grass covered airst strip which by the way was not in use on that night
this was when Maran very briefly and suddenly saw an object off in the distance hovering at low level over a
field she said it appeared to be football-shaped quite large about 25 to
30 ft in diameter with a rim of Windows around the
circumference now the upper half had a concave top and again a series of
vertically oriented Windows the bottom half had a series of round windows or
perhaps lights glowing red and from the top of the craft came a bright white
beam of light shining upwards and Marian looking at the upper
Windows was was amazed to see two humanoid figures and these were big she estimates
that they were about 10 ft tall and it was very unusual because they had their
arms lifted up over their heads now she saw this very briefly and was about to
shout out to her fiance Dennis to stop the car but before she could they passed
a hill which obscured her view so she immediately told him what she had seen
and they drove a short distance ahead where there was a little dirt road leading off the highway towards the
direction of this object and they followed the dirt road for about a half mile when suddenly right through the
windshield they could now see this object hovering over a grassy area or
perhaps landed it was very very low and only about 250 ft away so Dennis pulled
off the road and together this young couple watched with nervous Fascination
is how they described it they said this object was very Silent not moving
glowing with light at this point they could no longer see any figures Through
the Windows they were absolutely a struck and stayed there watching this
object for about 20 minutes they thought about trying to find other Witnesses but
the only visible house in the area was a farmhouse with all the lights off it appeared to be
unoccupied Dennis did suggest that they drive closer to the object but Marian
became fearful and told him not to do that in fact she wanted to leave and go
home and Dennis reluctantly agreed they turned around drove back up the dirt
road towards the highway they looked back several times as they did so and this UFO remained there in the same
location now once home Marian called a cousin of hers who was married to an
amateur astronomer and UFO researcher so they shared their story and the next day
they all returned to the site hoping to find evidence that the craft had been there Unfortunately they found
nothing now in somewhat confirmation of this incident was exactly one week later
at 900 p.m. and less than 300 miles away in Pottstown
Pennsylvania a woman was driving home when she saw a strange object over a farmfield and as she said it was a very
white pulsating light I stopped my car on the road next to the field and just
studied it I couldn't make out any shape just the light I rolled down the window
to see if there was an engine sound but there was none she then had this feeling that it
was quote just the light and me and drove drove off in fear she did tell her
husband who returned immediately to the site but by then the object was gone so
it's impossible to say for sure if this sighting was related to the object seen one week earlier by Dennis and Maran but
who knows certainly is possible a truly fascinating case because they watch this
object for a good amount of time from a pretty close distance you should count yourself lucky
if you have a witness with you like these two did because a lot of people who see a UFO alone seriously question
their own eyes but this is an amazing encounter uh it's a shame that there
wasn't more or really any evidence of this craft being there but I think most
cases are like that they don't leave a whole lot behind but it's certainly an important
case that was professionally researched and and doesn't appear to be any type of
conventional craft so many cases I mean it's mind-blowing how many cases there
are it's just case after case after case and here is another one this one is
super interesting this one I call the alien on the ham radio it's occurred on August 12
1976 in Cincinnati Ohio couple of Ohio cases here I like this one because it's
so unusual in that well as we'll see there is what we would call
electromagnetic interference or disturbance or intervention however you want to put it it's super interesting
this case was researched by a professional researcher as well very
experienced researcher but it's such an unusual case
again in the appearance of the ETS and how they behaved and just the whole
series of events in this encounter this next case comes from prolific researcher
Timothy Green Beckley who published this account in his publication UFO
review it was nighttime again on August 12 1976 as David L dos drove in his car
outside of Cincinnati Ohio while listening to his CB radio he was on a
channel listening to One truck driver giving directions to another truck driver who had apparently become lost
and this is when suddenly for no apparent reason David's vehicle began to
malfunction his engine began to miss his headlights flickered also his CB went
out very quickly his vehicle and headlights went back to normal but the CV didn't it remained off uh so he
punched the access code and this is when suddenly a strange voice came on and said quote priority break followed by a
call number which strangely he couldn't remember even after just hearing it and
as David says in his own words usually I remember calls but the odd quality of
the voice must have distracted me it was kind of melodious deep and compelling
with an accent I couldn't place I just said go break and kept
listening from that point on the whole incident had a sort of dreamlike quality
the fascinating voice went on to say his vehicle was disabled on old Route 84
near the Quarry and requested some assistance so dobs knew this location it
was only a few miles away so he said to stand by and he would arrive
shortly now the road at this time was old and decrepit it's no no longer there
so David had to reduce his speed to about 15 to 20 mph in fact the road was so little used
a branch blocked the road ahead of him he got out to remove it and this is when
David noticed a strange flickering Blue Light which he likened to a police car
siren over in the Treetops about 600 ft away and then as David says in his own
words then suddenly I saw him him seems to fit somehow but don't ask me why he
had come up to the car while my back was turned and he was standing near the open door in the glare of the headlights it
was hard to see well but he was short probably not 5 ft in height he had on a
silvery onepiece outfit that looked like aluminized coveralls or a wet suit
moving out of the headlight beams and towards the car I was was about to say hi when my first good look stopped me
dead he didn't have a recognizable face now the being looked to him almost
like a quote biological robot and suddenly David says he felt this weird
telepathic link to the being as volumes of information began to flow into his
brain at a quote fantastic rate as David says in his own words it was like a data
link between two computers ideas weren't expressed in words at all there was just
a stream of Impressions so according to David The
Impressions were that this being was from a distant star in the Milky Way a star which is normally only visible in
the southern hemisphere he doesn't talk about what else he got in terms of
information but he found himself walking with the being towards a crab
and he did say that he felt as though the et's purpose was to evaluate the people of Earth but the next thing he
knew the humanoid instructed David to return to his car because it was too
dangerous for David to be too close to the UFO as it took off so David went to
his car and at this point he did see this strange craft hovered briefly overhead before taking off in a burst of
speed unfortunately there is no more information on this fascinating case
thanks to Timothy Green Beckley for bringing us that case which is unusual as it sounds is not the only case where
ETS have appeared on the radio or you
know know I know a few cases where people have seen strange images on televisions I did a whole episode on
cases where people believe they had telephone calls from ETS so yeah UFOs do
have the ability to affect electromagnetic instruments in ways that you might find quite surprising it's
also interesting about that case is he had this big quote download of
information I wish we knew more about what exactly this witness learned from
his encounter U but certainly it is an interesting case and now we move to another case
which is quite brief but gosh it's interesting ing I like this case because
it does involve a witness who is a police officer so therefore a very careful and trained Observer and it
occurred in a place where there is an enormous amount of UFO activity I call
this case why do you hate and you'll see
why I gave it that title in just a second this occurred on November 1 1980
in Lucky Point Indiana quite a lot of activity in Indiana itself but
apparently this area this particular area is Super Active for reasons I shall
talk about in just a second what an unusual case this one is now this case
is quite brief but really interesting and it comes from muon researchers Francis Ridge and Jerry sers very
well-respected and experienced researchers and also the main witness is
quite credible because as I said he's deputy sheriff it was around 900 p.m. on
November 1st 1980 and the sheriff was on routine Patrol at lucky point in Indiana
an area locally known as the lovers lane and as it turns out also the location of
quite a few UFO encounters on this particular evening the deputy had pulled over to stretch
his legs and was standing next to his car looking over the top of the cruiser
when he noticed a quote black triangle about 200 feet away and tilted at an
angle he estimates that this object was about 100 feet long on each side he said
it had large windows and it was through one of these windows that he could see a row of five humanoid figures visible
from the waist up and they did not appear to be normal humans because they each had a very large head very thin
neck and very slim bodies so the deputy watched in amazement and
this is when this case gets so interesting because he says he heard a very clear telepathic communication
coming from the figures and they asked him quote why do you hate
uranians and the deputy immediately thought to himself I don't hate
anybody at this point two of the ETS at either end of the row turned towards the
center and faced the others the object then quickly took off and was out of
sight in seconds so clearly this really impressed the police officer and per researcher
Jerry sers there had been nearly get this 100
UFO sightings at lucky point in the past 10 to 15 years I suspect this is largely
because this is sort of the lovers lane and there's a lot of people out there at night late at night and are in a perfect
position to see UFO activity hard to say for sure but this area definitely has a
reputation for a lot of UFO activity so wow I mean there's a lot to learn from
that case uh this police officer saw this UFO very close up these
ETS I'm assuming that's what they are I don't know for sure I do think the
Extraterrestrial explanation is the one that best fits the evidence uh you can call them
interdimensional or Time Travelers or whatever you want but the fact is there are so many
encounters and just given the amount of stars out there and the fact that we ourselves exist on a planet I think it's
a fair assumption that there are other beings out there like us and that's certainly what the evidence is showing
us another very interesting thing about this case is the how the ETS
communicated or what they communicated to this police officer because often
people do have communication with ETS they express concern about wars and hate
and div divisiveness and greed and Corruption so perhaps that's what they were inquiring about and yeah I suspect
when they asked this gentleman you know about hate that they were not
questioning him in particular but perhaps all of humanity of course that's pure speculation
I honestly don't know I wish there was more information in that case but apparently it's not an isolated one
again an area of pretty intense UFO activity so moving along to our last and
final case in this little collection I like this case because it does involve
physical evidence some pretty substantial physical evidence not super well confirmed but it was investigated
by a very experienced and well-known researcher I call this one UFO in the
suburbs this occured on February 29 2008 fairly recently in the little town
of koui Australia so this is an interesting case
for a number of reasons as we shall see this case was investigated by well respected researcher Bill Chalker and
again quite brief but certainly very interesting and it has I think some important
aspects to it it was around 4 a.m. very early hours of the morning February 29
2008 when the witness a man who has requested anonymity he was walking down
a street in coui this is a suburban area by the ocean in Sydney Australia when he
was suddenly startled by a bright flash of light and looking in the direction of
the light he saw a a large spherical object about the size of a large car
according to the illustration on the case this object was actually now sitting on the ground at a te
intersection and even more interesting was that there was a window or sort of curved transparent section at the top
section of the sphere and looking down at him through the window was a little
man the witness became frightened at this point he quickly hit hid himself behind an electrical signal box but
still watched this object and he watched this little man inside this craft move
what he believes was sort of a lever at which point a shutter or a covering came
down over the window area rendering it opaque the witness said he could also
feel a strong heat being emitted from this object the object at this point
immediately took off upwards at a 40 5° Angle now the witness estimates that he
watched this for about five full minutes now the surface of the road in
this area was coated with vitamin this is a tar-like substance and the witness looking at
where the object had landed saw that the road surface had a sort of whitish circle on it so clear Landing traces
also the tree next to the object appeared to have been burn burned and there's an even more
interesting and frankly unfortunate end note to this case because it was shortly
after the incident that the local road maintenance crew actually repaved the
area where the UFO had hovered destroying the landing traces furthermore a new electrical
Telegraph pole was placed at the intersection and the wiring there was repaired according to Bill Chalker he
tried to collect some leaves but most of the landing trace evidence was
completely covered up and according to Bill Chalker and I quote the witness is
a shy man of nervous disposition and seems unlikely to be the type that would
make up a story of a UFO incident and does not appear to have much knowledge
of the UFO subject so a huge thanks to Bill Chalker for making us all aware of
this case and doing a followup on it such a shame that the physical evidence
was immediately destroyed after this case but we do see that sort of thing in
a number of cases where Landing traces are paved over or buried or plowed over
that happened in the westall UFO landing which did leave Landing traces right
next to the westall high school case in Melbourne Australia so perhaps this was an
intentional act to cover up UFO evidence
hard to say for sure but it sure looks like it and again kudos to the witness for stepping forward and going public
because it wouldn't surprise me one bit if a lot of people saw this and no one's talking about it it's a really
interesting case all right that's it for today I
hope you've enjoyed this episode where we explored 10 cases of different
humanoids cases from all over the world cases going back to the 1950s all the
way up to the 2000s and cases where ETS behaved in ways that's just a little bit offbeat a
little unusual and give all these interesting messages or
Communications still a lot to learn about this subject there's still a lot of questions surrounding it I think we
are making tremendous progress recently a lot more people are AC accepting of
this subject it's gaining a lot of legitimacy that it hasn't had for decades so that's great news but there's
yeah always more to learn so thank you once again for watching it's always truly
appreciated and until next time keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth it's out there
but most important of all because I think that's why we're here here keep having fun till next time guys thank you.
