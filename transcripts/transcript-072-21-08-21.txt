THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE UFO ENCOUNTER
Aug 21, 2021

Summary:
Aug 21, 2021
On the morning of January 17, 1994, a massive 6.8 earthquake struck the city of Northridge, California. It caused millions of dollars worth of damage, destroyed hundreds of structures, and 57 people lost their lives. What many people don't know about is the UFO connection.

On the night before this encounter, several people in the surrounding area had incredible UFO encounters. One of the witnesses, Marcellina X., was a resident of nearby Topanga Canyon. In the hours preceding the Northridge Quake, Marcellina experienced a series of precognitive events, and along with her boyfriend (and others) saw numerous UFOs. This led to a profound spiritual transformation and two weeks later, a face-to-face encounter with gray extraterrestrials. The ETs had a personal message for her that caused huge changes in Marcellina's outlook and worldview. Her life would never be the same. 

This video tells the story of Marcellina's strange encounters and the weird UFO connection to the Northridge Earthquake of 1994. This is one of many cases in which people have seen UFOs before major disasters. This case also provides some of the answers to the aliens' agenda on our planet.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in 
the paranormal I call this episode the northridge earthquake ufo encounter on january 17 1994 the 
city of northridge california was struck by a devastating 6.8 earthquake this caused millions 
of dollars worth of damage hundreds of structures were destroyed and 57 people lost their lives 
what many people don't know is there is actually a ufo connection to this earthquake at the time 
the city of topanga canyon which is located only a few miles away to the south 
was going through a huge wave of encounters this was actually the tail end of a two years long 
wave of sightings landings abductions virtually the entire range of the ufo phenomena the main 
witness in this case is marcelina she lived with her boyfriend louis in a high-end trailer park 
at top of tapanga which is at the northern end of topanga canyon overlooking the san fernando valley 
and it was the day before the northridge earthquake that marcelina had a series of very 
strange experiences on that day she felt a strange spiritual shift she decided that she was no longer 
going to let people take advantage of her and she was going to live her life in a more positive way 
that afternoon they decided to go down to the san fernando valley to do some shopping and have lunch 
they went to a new age store and bought some crystals and books and uh as they were driving 
along looking for some place to eat marcelina suddenly shouted out the words gasoline fire 
her boyfriend who was driving looked around and saw no fire and looked back at her questioningly 
marcelina apologized and said you know i'm sorry I have no idea why I said that she just felt 
compelled to blurt those words out later she would find out why at the time it made no sense to her 
so they went to go have lunch and marcelina started having incredible precognition she 
knew exactly what her boyfriend was going to order for lunch in fact she could predict the words he 
would say before he said them it totally freaked her out she wondered what the heck is going on 
another weird thing happened right before they pulled into this restaurant 
she looked up into the sky and saw what looked like fireworks exploding in the sky 
and her boyfriend did not see them but it totally impressed her was very obvious to her 
and it disappeared but she started keeping a much closer eye on the sky after that 
so after they had lunch it was getting pretty close to evening they drove around 
for a little while longer it was dark by this time and they headed back into topanga canyon 
and instead of going directly home they decided that they would drive through the canyon for a 
little while and then stop off at the spiral staircase this is a new age bookstore located 
in the heart of topanga canyon they sell books trinkets crystals these types of things 
and so they drove into the heart of the canyon and stopped off at the spiral staircase and 
went inside and bought some crystals and hung out there for an hour or two just sort of shopping and 
hanging out and by the time they got out it was now somewhere around 9 00 or 10 p.m 
and uh looking up in the sky they were shocked to see some weird lights lou they had just gotten 
into the car and we're heading north up highway 27 to panga canyon and boulevard towards their 
home which is just a few miles away and this is when marcelina and louis saw these lights 
and i'll just let marcelina describe what she saw as she says and I quote I started looking up in 
the sky and I started seeing what kind of looks like the bottom of a blimp and lights flickering 
there was yellow purple red and they kept flickering like changing from yellow red purple 
yellow red purple I kept looking and I kept seeing more and they were crossing over to 
panga and I said louis what the hell are those things their planes he said those are not planes 
marcelina said planes just don't fly over topanga that way and as she said there were more and more 
and they kept on going they were going in sync and lewis all of a sudden started getting the creeps
so they're heading back up towards their home at the top of topanga and they continue to watch 
these things in the sky they were quite low maybe a hundred feet up just over the ridge 
and it really impressed them both louis was freaking out marcelina didn't feel any fear 
she was fascinated by them and wondered if they were ufos what was really strange 
is that they were all traveling one after another almost looked like a train of ufos 
and much slower than a normal plane and very vivid the objects looked solid to her and 
there were so many of them that she started to count them and she counted more than 50. they 
kept hoping that another car would drive by them but strangely the road was completely deserted 
that's unusual even at uh this hour which was you know 9 or 10 p.m there should have 
been more cars on the road but strangely there wasn't so that also freaked them out 
turns out that is something that does turn up in ufo cases roads are strangely deserted 
so they were freaking out and it was about 10 pm by the time they arrived 
at their home in the trailer park and they were getting close to the entrance when 
marcelina instructed louis to stop the car he didn't want to but she insisted and she 
actually told him to back up a little bit and then they saw something even more strange 
as she says I look across the road over the water tower this huge humongous gigantic red 
object lit up red with little lights it came flying over the water tower and it was so big 
i thought they were maybe filming a movie there are two water towers up there and I 
would say it was about three or four times the width of those water towers the thing was huge 
it was very big and it started heading towards us lewis was freaking out I mean he was almost 
like paralyzed he wanted to get away and I kept saying no no don't move I want to see what it is 
it was shaped like a crystal like a rectangular shaped thing but it was pointed at the front 
the whole thing had red lights flickering the strangest thing was part of this object actually 
seemed transparent or see-through and all these theories of what it could possibly were going 
what it could possibly be were going through marcelina's head she thought you know are they 
filming a movie no she couldn't see any movie crew or people she thought could it be a giant kite but 
it was far too big for that she finally decided had to be a ufo and there was this very large 
blimp-like object into in the center with yellow purple and red lights was so big 
that she thought all these other smaller objects that were following it could have fit inside of it 
so perhaps it was a giant mother ship she could hear a low humming noise coming from it 
and in fact it started coming towards them and as she says it went right over our heads and hovered 
lewis didn't remember the humming I told lewis hurry up turn around let's go follow 
where it's going and all of a sudden it disappeared was kind of hard to even 
try and follow it because if we followed it we would have had to go off the cliffs of topanga 
so it had disappeared they quickly turned up onto the road that leads to their trailer park 
and went inside their home marcelina immediately called her best friend who lived a few miles 
away in the san fernando valley and told her to go outside and see if she could see any weird objects 
because this is the direction that this giant blimp-like object and these smaller objects 
was heading so her friend went outside and came back to the phone and said sorry she could not 
see a thing the entire san fernando valley was sucked in with a huge thick fog that was also 
really strange because topanga canyon was clear as a bell so all these weird 
things were happening lewis refused to come outside after this but marcelina went back 
outside because she wanted to see more see if there was any ufos and sure enough she saw weird 
big white beams of light as she describes it shooting over topanga horizontally 
they weren't coming down they weren't going up they were horizontal up in the sky like giant big 
searchlights and she heard weird buzzing noises again and sometimes they would come very close 
to overhead and then disappear so she kept on watching them and finally they disappeared at 
some point she went next door to get her neighbor michael and she knocked on the door and called 
him outside and she's like michael I just saw a ufo and his response was what were you smoking 
and she was totally serious and tried to convince him and uh he did not believe her 
so he returned inside while marcelina stayed outside and she saw more of these weird beams 
of light shortly later and she said the air itself the atmosphere had this weird energy to it it was 
almost like crackling with energy by this point it was getting quite late it was near midnight or so 
and marcelina finally went inside louis was still upset they were both wired and hyperactive 
with energy and stayed up late and finally they decided that it was time to go to sleep 
but for some reason they decided not to sleep in their bedroom and they decided they would just 
sleep on the living room floor this was very unusual behavior this is not something they've 
ever done before so that was also unusual and it was a few hours later at 4 30 a.m in the morning 
when the northridge earthquake struck it was very strong and shook for many seconds and 
it absolutely destroyed everything in marcelina's and lewis's home they ran outside and saw that 
several of the trailers in their trailer park had been completely thrown off the foundation many 
of them were completely destroyed water lines and gas lines were ruptured and huge flames towered up 
into the sky and now marcelina suddenly realized what she why she had shouted out those words 
gasoline fire because it was playing out right before her eyes she was having precognition 
so it was a very difficult night for them as they struggled to deal with this disaster and was in 
fact more than a month before the they got water and gas service back to their trailer park and she 
lost all of her possessions and it was following this incredible disaster and this ufo encounter 
on the net you know hours before the earthquake that marcelina felt a huge shift in her life 
she no longer felt at all connected to material goods things did not matter to her anymore 
instead what mattered to her was spirituality she began feeling an impulse to do a lot of painting 
and started producing paintings of alien-like landscapes and outer space scenes star fields 
and things like this so this caused a huge huge shift in her life in several different ways 
and it was shortly after the earthquake actually the next day uh she told her neighbor 
uh about her or actually her neighbor came up to her michael and apologized and said you 
were right something weird must have happened uh because he had heard of another sighting 
it turned out he had a friend in the valley who lived on sherman way not too far away 
who looked up in the sky and described seeing weird lights in the sky on the night before 
the earthquake she said it looked to her like a video game what's playing in the sky 
so marcelina did get independent confirmation of her sighting and it was several months later that 
i also heard of a witness who lived in simi valley actually a group of witnesses who also saw lights 
in the sky on the night before the northridge earthquake so numerous people saw ufos immediately 
before this earthquake occurred and there was a weird aftermath as I said of uh following this 
sighting and this devastating earthquake where marcelina became much more spiritual 
and it was about two weeks after the earthquake that marcelina experienced an alien 
visitation in her home she was sleeping or just laying down in her living room 
and looking outside she saw the image of a figure sort of coalescing in front of her and before she 
knew it was in her living room and as she said it kind of looked like it was a cat face without 
any hair and a combination of a skeleton face it was almost like a holographic type of thing she 
tried calling her boyfriend louis who was in the other room but strangely he would not respond and 
she desperately wanted to get another witness but he just would not come out 
she called his name several times and she was going to actually get up to call him because 
this figure is right in front of her and she tried to get up and call him and she could not move 
she was just there on the couch unable to move looking at this thing and it starts to talk to her 
and it was telling her that they were they were a alien species and that they were having trouble 
reproducing that they had lost the ability to reproduce and they were trying to invent new ways 
of producing babies that they needed babies 
and started telling her all these things telepathically it warned her that this northridge 
earthquake was just the beginning of what would be a series of earthquakes all over the world and uh 
he took uh talked about the paintings she had made and said that 
they that he had uh put those images in her mind but that she didn't have it quite right 
that it wasn't quite the way it looked there this being this gray type e.t 
said that their planet was much more crystallized there were lots of crystals where they came from 
it also told her that she would have the ability to heal herself that if she wanted to she would 
have the ability to not only heal herself but heal others and that they wanted her to use this 
ability to heal people and finally after she's not sure how long this vision just sort of disappeared 
she immediately jumped off the couch and ran into her bedroom where her boyfriend louis was and 
asked him why he didn't come he had no explanation and he she told him what happened and he didn't 
know what to make of her story but he could tell by her emotional response that she was absolutely 
telling the truth and it wasn't long after this that she got 
some evidence that what the ET had told her about healing at least was true 
because she developed a hernia and the doctors told her that she would have to have surgery 
to have this repaired and remembering what this cat-like e.t had said she decided she was going to 
try to heal herself and she put her hand over the hernia and meditated and this hernia disappeared 
and it was a few weeks later that she had another injury she accidentally dropped 
a slab of marble onto her toe her big toe crushing it she immediately grabbed her toe and healed it 
and she thought for sure her toe would be broken but it was just slightly sore after she healed it 
so she felt like she had been given this ability by the ETs and another weird thing happened 
following this visitation she found out that she was pregnant I should say that while she 
was having this visitation she did feel powerful uh erotic feelings pulsing through her body and 
actually reached an orgasm while she was sitting on the couch in front of this alien figure and 
uh so this discovery that she was pregnant really concerned her and she did connect it to this e.t 
visitation and here's where it gets very strange it was about four months following this visitation 
that she lost her baby she had a miscarriage the doctors were very concerned because they found 
no evidence of any fetus in this sac it was completely empty the fetus had been taken 
so now she's wondering about that she had she knew nothing about uh ufos or the missing 
fetus syndrome at this time as ufo researchers know this is definitely a thing where people's 
babies uh their fetuses will disappear and this apparently happened to marcelina 
and she definitely connects it to the experience because this ET like figure told her that they 
were trying to find ways to produce babies and now she wonders if she was used for that purpose 
she still feels like this was a positive experience because she had such a powerful 
spiritual awakening after this and kept having all kinds of precognition and intuition 
following this spiritual awakening and she also remembered encounters from her childhood 
as a young child she remembered she was once in her home when she looked outside and saw 
an alien figure looking in through the window at the time she thought it was 
a clown and she says its face was like a whitish face its face was like a whitish 
face the way my mind made it look was almost like a clown type face it had black eyes 
i wasn't afraid but I was always confused I was basically convinced I really saw this thing
and she thought it was a clown she thought it looked like a clown but wondered if it was the 
orange flowers next to its head that was making it look like a clown marceline of course did not know 
that many children who see ETs see them dressed up as clowns in fact I did a whole video on this 
the e.t clown connection and marcelina is one of several witnesses i've talked to who have seen 
ets dressed as clowns and so this was something that she remembered following this e.t visitation 
and she also remembered seeing ufos throughout her life these usually were just anomalous lights 
and in fact since she had moved into panga during the time of this ufo wave 
she recalled seeing ufos on a number of occasions but always kind of dismissed it 
these were always anomalous lights which she didn't know quite what to make of
but now looking back she realizes that they were probably ufos and following this whole 
series of weird events this earthquake and this encounter and this visitation
her attitude towards life shifted completely she used to be very materialistic somewhat angry 
uh and upset with the greed and the corruption in the world but after 
that she lost all interest in materialism and things that were important to her were nature 
and spirituality and she became obsessed with ufos and investigating them she eventually contacted 
a number of ufo researchers including myself and shared her story it's interesting about her 
experience her experiences it was fully conscious she felt no fear and was completely spiritually 
transformed as a result she continues to this day to have precognition in fact it wasn't 
long after that that she had this vision that a comet would hit the planet jupiter 
and boy was she shocked when in july of 1994 the comet shoemaker levy actually struck 
jupiter this was a huge astronomical event which caused great interest among astronomers and she 
knew about it before it happened it's one of many events that she had precognition of of and uh 
this would continue so it appears as if the ET's sparked this ability or awakened this ability of 
uh spirituality and intuition and precognition in her this encounter completely changed her life and 
this is definitely something we see with a lot of people who have very close encounters so yeah 
it's a very strange encounter but definitely fits the pattern I see with a lot of people 
so that's why I wanted to share this account I did write about this case in my book ufos 
over topanga canyon and marcelino's case is one of many it's not unique it fits 
the pattern i've seen in many other cases and that's really why I wanted to do this video 
because I think it shows the alien agenda they are here because they need to find ways to reproduce 
and they are here because they want to wake people up to their own spiritual abilities 
and this is absolutely true with marcelina so that's it for today I want to thank you once 
again for watching I really appreciate it and until next time keep having fun
