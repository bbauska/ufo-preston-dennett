TEN INCREDIBLE HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Sep 1, 2023

Summary:
Sep 1, 2023
There’s nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid. These cases are the heart of the UFO phenomenon. They are the cases that teach us the most about extraterrestrial contact. They’re also the most interesting. This video presents ten cases that span five decades and come from all over the world. They present nearly the entire range of UFO evidence, including multiple eyewitness testimony, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic interference, landing traces and more. They show how many different ET-types there are, and answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon: who the ETs are, where do they come from, and why are they visiting our planet?

“THEY WERE VERY GOOD-LOOKING.” One summer evening in 1946, Vida Goldsworthy and her sister were walking their dog in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa when they saw a huge craft hovering above a nearby hotel. To their amazement, two tall ETs came out and looked down at them. Vida was impressed by how beautiful they were. It was one of South Africa’s first recorded humanoid encounters.

“WE COME FROM CASSIOPEIA.” In Sep 1955, Joseph Wanderka rode his moped through a forest path in Arbesthal, Austria, and came upon a landed UFO. Going onboard, he met six child-like human-looking ETs. He told them about the many problems of Earth society and asked if they could intervene. They told him that although they had long since moved past wars, disease and corruption that no, they couldn’t intervene, and that Earth people had to solve their own problems.

ALIENS GO CAMPING. On Mar 10, 1961, Mr. Reynolds and his son went camping at Bowna Reserve in Albury, NSW, Australia and saw what they first thought were other campers. They saw strange figures and a vehicle of some kind. When it suddenly disappeared without a trace, they knew they had seen something very strange. They soon learned that many people in the area had seen unusual UFO activity.

ANOTHER HITCHHIKING ALIEN. On the night of Aug 27, 1972, Eduardo Dedeu was driving between Medanos and Bahia Blanca, Argentina, when he picked up a hitchhiker. He was fascinated to see that the man had an abnormally long face and huge chin. He did not look human. Then the car engine failed, and he came upon a UFO landed on the highway. His mysterious passenger exited, and the UFO took off, leaving Eduardo shocked to the core.

THE LE BIHAN FAMILY UFO ORDEAL. On Sep 29, 1974, the Le Bihan family of Riec-Sur-Belon, France was amazed to see a giant UFO hovering near their home. Three glowing figures came out and began to march towards them. Terrified, the Le Bihans fled their home. Unknown to them, their neighbors were also experiencing weird activity. It was an encounter that would affect them all for a long time.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SAW IT. On Jun 22, 1976, hundreds of residents of the Canary Islands witnessed one of the most dramatic UFO displays on record in their country. One or more UFOs flitted around in the sky for nearly an hour. Some residents saw the UFOs very close up, close enough to see two extremely tall ETs dressed in red jumpsuits looking down at them from above.

THE FLYING HUMANOID. On Jul 12, 1977, Adrian de Olmos of Quebradillas, Puerto Rico was puzzled to see a child-sized figure wearing a strange jumpsuit approach the front of his home. He called his family and the neighbors, and they all watched this short humanoid fly around among the trees near their homes. It caused a near panic in the town, and even the animals were acting crazed. 

MISSING TIME ON THE TUG FORK RIVER. On the night of Jun 14, 1978, teenagers Bryan Duty and John Wright when fishing near their home in Naugatuck, WV. Although they caught no fish, they did see a UFO which struck them with a beam of light. They were unable to move and the next thing they knew, they were running home. Both had vague memories of being taken onboard the craft.

ENCOUNTER ON THE MOUNTAIN. On Oct 3, 1978, Hideichi Amano was playing with his ham radio on top of a mountain near Sayama City, Japan. Suddenly his car blazed with light. The engine died, and then suddenly a weird humanoid appeared and pressed a strange device against his head. For several moments, Hideichi remained paralyzed. Finally, the humanoid departed and Hideichi fled the area. But he would never be the same again.

THE ET IN THE CORNFIELD. On July 23, 1982, three teenagers were camping in a cornfield near Sainte-Dorethee, Quebec, Canada when a UFO appeared overhead. Shortly after it left, a tall humanoid appeared near their tent, frightening them so badly, they ran away, leaving everything behind. Unknown to them, another nearby witness was watching the whole thing.

These ten cases reveal the startling complexity of the UFO phenomenon and provide compelling evidence for the reality of extraterrestrial visitations. They provide another piece of the UFO puzzle and remind us all that we are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I call this episode 10 incredible humanoid encounters these of course as I've said many 
times are my favorite type of encounter these are the kinds of cases where we get the most 
information and they're just darn interesting the cases I'm covering today include of course 
face-to-face encounters with humanoids Landings and onboard experiences so we're getting the 
whole gamut here and these cases are coming from all across the world all across Europe 
in Africa actually South America the United States Canada even one from Japan so really 
all over the world I think it's important people know that this is a global phenomenon 
also interesting is these cases span about five decades I've got some early cases dating all the 
way back to the 1940s and more recent all the way up to the 1980s and what I love about all 
these cases is a couple of things there's a very wide variety of humanoid types certainly not just 
Grays all kinds of different ETS or humanoids also what I find super interesting about these cases is 
that really they really contain the entire gamut of evidence that we often see with encounters 
so we have cases involving photographic evidence Landing traces medical effects animal reactions 
I mean all kinds of evidence people vastly underestimate just how much evidence there 
is to support these encounters and many of these are also multiple witness encounters 
which also strengthens The credibility of these cases and in a few of these cases the other 
Witnesses did not even know about each other so that adds even more Credence to their accounts 
so some really interesting cases I think you'll find this quite fascinating I certainly hope so 
and this is going to be a fairly long episode so let's just get started and the first case I call they were very good looking and this is an interesting case because 
the ETS were described as extremely good looking but it's also interesting because 
it's a very early case perhaps one of South Africa's earliest cases of humanoids on record 
so that alone I think makes it quite significant this one occurred in Johannesburg South Africa 
it involves two witnesses who had an encounter in the Heart of the City the least place you'd 
expect but it's quite a dramatic encounter this case occurred in the summer of 1946 and it comes 
from a very well-known and respected researcher by the name of John judge who personally interviewed 
the main witness Vida goldsworthy now Vida and her younger sister were living on delver's Street next 
to the luthjas Langham hotel which was located on the corner of Kirk Street and Von welig Street as 
you can see here and late one evening they came back from watching a movie and were taking their 
dog for a walk by the hotel when they heard a loud thumping noise looking up they saw a strange craft 
and it was hovering just about five feet above the hotel itself above the hotel and part of the 
street they estimate that it was about 600 feet away from their vantage point on Delver Street 
and it looked to them like your typical rounded saucer with a sphere in the center 
it was about 30 feet wide they estimate 15 feet high the rim was brown the center was 
whitish but the sphere the ball itself was bright golden in color and it hovered in perfect silence 
no they didn't think UFO at this time UFOs weren't really known at all 
they first thought it might be a military craft of some kind but it they really began to wonder what 
was happening when they heard this loud clicking sound and they watched as the central sphere of 
this craft began to descend and separate from the rim the rim remained in place the sphere moved 
downward until it was about level with the hotel roof at which point it stopped there was another 
clicking sound and the sphere then moved Upward at this point completely detaching from the saucer 
and it stopped about eight or nine feet Above the Rim and it was then that the two women could 
see what looked like two dark pillars perhaps metallic which seemed to support the saucer 
and they could now see two human looking figures they looked human except they were seven feet tall 
very well built very light complexions and had short wavy blonde hair 
both per Vita were identical in appearance and as she says quote very good looking 
you saw that they were both wearing all white uniforms with what looked like two chest pockets 
and what appeared to be buttons down the center though she couldn't really tell they weren't super 
close but they did have tall stiff colors on these uniforms and what appeared to be a brown belt 
now she had the impression that they were standing on a raised surface of some kind and leaning against rails and both sisters felt like these beings were watching them 
and absolutely aware that they were being watched so at this point the ball came back 
down appeared to rotate and moved off behind the hotel taking the crew and disappearing from View 
and the Witnesses were convinced for many years that this had been military until 
they started to hear about the UFO phenomenon and wondered if perhaps it was related to that 
they never really made up their minds about it though John judge the researcher does believe this 
was extraterrestrial in origin and he like many researchers was struck by the overt appearance 
of this object and he felt that it might be an intentional display as he says in his own words 
in this case if as seems likely we are dealing with the UFO phenomenon something seems to have 
gone out of its way to make sure that the two middle-aged women saw what it wanted them to see 
that Summer's night as you can see that case does have a lot of interesting elements to it I find 
it fascinating that the witnesses themselves were very reluctant to label this as extraterrestrial 
and it was only until they heard about the UFL phenomenon and realized how close that 
their encounter was to others that they considered this possibility but even then they were reluctant certainly John judge the main researcher believes that this was in 
fact an extraterrestrial encounter and a good example of what UFO researchers call a display 
and here's another encounter where the witness didn't report it for years for obvious reasons 
it often takes people quite some time to report their encounters and I call this one we come from 
Cassiopeia and this encounter does have some very interesting elements to it it occurred outside of 
Vienna Austria and it does involve one witness but it's quite an involved encounter involving 
a landed UFO and an onboard experience and it's so interesting not only because the 
description of the ETS is quite unusual but they did provide him with quite a bit of information 
and even said where they come from this case began around September 1955 the main witness is Joseph 
wanderka he was born on October 8th in 1929 and he was quite political he had joined an anti-fascist 
political group at age 15 due to All the Troubles that were going on in this country at the time 
and this caused him a lot of trouble particularly in trying to gain and hold employment 
so as a result he became something of a Wanderer traveling around the country on his moped 
and it was in the summer of 1954. that he was amazed to see a shiny cigar-shaped object hovering 
over the city of Vienna where he lived it was he estimated says big as a very large crafted jet 
he pointed out to a group of nearby Russian soldiers who said that they had actually seen this 
before on numerous occasions and they believed it to be a secret government craft he wasn't so sure 
but it was one year later he was taking his moped along a forest path this is outside the 
village of a barstal and it was around 2 p.m in the afternoon when he saw a metallic gleam 
of an object apparently landed ahead of him in a clearing in the forest so he drove up to it 
in his moped and was amazed to see a disc shaped craft roughly disc shaped about 35 feet wide and 
seven or eight feet tall he said it was perfectly smooth and featureless and metallic in appearance 
he did see a small square opening he estimates it was about six feet wide and 
there was a long sort of 12 foot long ramp leading down from the craft to the ground 
and inside of the craft it was brightly lit so he was immediately intrigued and 
drove right up to the ramp and actually right up the ramp and up to the entrance 
and he was amazed to see six people inside who apparently were waiting for him or expecting him 
and he said that they're all about five feet tall they were immaculately beautiful really beautiful 
faces he said much like children of about six to ten years of age he said that all of them were 
identical dull gray overalls with no buttons no zippers or Mark rings and it covered everything 
upset except their head uh he said the overalls did have an unusual collar to them but all of 
these figures looked very much identical all having blue eyes and medium length blonde hair 
he said the inside of the craft was lit with a pleasant yellow light but he could not see any 
particular light source and he was also surprised to see that the craft was pretty much empty there 
was nothing in there in terms of equipment or panels or tables or chairs or anything he couldn't 
be entirely sure because he was surrounded by these short figures but he didn't see anything 
so Joseph introduced himself he gave his name and where he lived and one of the ETS responded in 
what sounded like a female voice to him speaking in his native language Austrian German and said 
and I quote we come according to terrestrial standards from the highest peak of Cassiopeia 
now this is a star we have identified it's actually called Epsilon Cassiopeia or Seguin 
it's about 18 times bigger than our sun it has no known exoplanets it's not particularly conducive 
to life but this is what the ETS apparently according to him told Joseph so he asked 
where did you master my language because he was amazed that they were speaking in his own language 
and they said we learned it and he said they pronounced the individual syllables rather in 
a way that an English man does when talking German so slightly accented but perfect speaking language 
and the ETS seemed somewhat interested in his moped they could smell the oil coming out of it 
and they were asking about it and he explained how it worked that it was a combustion engine 
so at this point he's realizing these guys are not from Earth and he explained that 
on Earth there's great social injustice with a privileged upper class enslaving A 
working class there was lots of social upheaval in this country at this time he told them about the misdeeds of the Nazi party in Europe and he said the ETS listened patiently 
and then told him that such a social system as we have on Earth is outdated and primitive 
and that they no longer had any of the problems that he was speaking about they said and I quote 
in our system of State there are no more differences we consider the form of society on 
Earth to be long obsolete so this quite excited Joseph he's thinking he's found an ally in his 
political views and asked the ETS to intervene and help eliminate the injustices that are 
causing so many problems on our planet including plagues and famines he described all of this 
and the et's basically told him that they had no plans whatsoever to intervene in human Affairs and 
that Joseph himself as an inhabitant of Earth's Society had the responsibility to figure out 
and improve the society and the problems of our current social structures according to Joseph they 
said and I quote as a man of Earth you must engage such action yourself we did not at all come to 
interfere in terrestrial matters as an inhabitant of the earth you must know that such a revolution 
of the entire social structures of the Earth can be started but you must devote yourself to that 
so at this point he became very emotional pleading with them and explaining vehemently that the 
countries of Earth were being overrun by corrupt politicians whose only goal was power and money 
and the ETS themselves said Joseph became very emotional and actually began to weep so this got 
this made him quite embarrassed very uncomfortable and he decided that it was time for him to go to 
leave and he told them good day the et's he said bowed and Joseph left he said that the surface of 
the craft the floor was so smooth that he was able to swing his moped around as if the floor was like 
ice he drove down the ramp and returned home so this encounter really impressed him deeply and he 
hoped for another meeting because he felt you know some regret that he had cut this meeting short 
unfortunately it didn't happen certainly not an onboard experience however in June 
1973 while in the hanouche hospital in Vienna where he was being treated for heart problems 
he woke up around 1am looked out the window and saw a strange craft circling around changing 
colors from white to red and finally moving off he wondered if that could be the same ETS and it was 
two years later in March 1975 that he was walking in the forest near Saint Corona and saw five 
glowing objects this time he did have his camera with him and quickly snapped a photograph which 
you can see here it's certainly an interesting photograph on given his history of UFO encounters 
it's deadly enough to make you wonder so yes that case does involve some very unusual elements it 
was pretty widely reported a number of researchers have looked into it it's quite interesting because 
he does apparently have photographic evidence of his encounter and that's very rare but it's 
certainly an interesting case that deserves to be more well known that's why I wanted to include it and here's another case which I find fascinating this one actually occurred in Australia in a 
little town called Albury this is a New South Wales Australia this does involve two witnesses 
I call this aliens go camping and as you'll see it's an unusual case I like this one because they 
did see a landed UFO they did see humanoid figures but there are quite a few Witnesses outside the 
area who saw UFOs in the sky at the time of the encounter so some pretty good confirmation of 
this amazing humanoid encounter this case occurred on March 10 1961 again in Albury 
the main witness is Mr F Reynolds and his 15 year old son Lloyd who decided to go camping at The 
Bona Reserve in Albury which you can see here and I'll just quote Mr Reynolds directly as he says 
I went outside and saw a strange sight on the edge of the water this is at night time and as 
he says at first I thought it was a camp but wondered how the people occupying it could 
have passed our Caravan without hearing them by Caravan he means sort of a trailer a campsite 
and as he says the camp appeared to be a large Caravan with four windows and a red light nearby a 
fire on the right of the Caravan was visible about four persons seemed to be moving very quickly 
between the fire and the Caravan on the left I had a look through my binoculars and was surprised to 
see the whole unit that is Caravan red light and fire appear to move sideways in a jerking manner 
so at this point she knew something very strange was happening and this was not a trailer certainly 
not a normal one and as he says the flame was not constant it would flare up showing someone 
standing near it and then die down again to almost nothing before flaring up again 
so he was puzzled by the whole thing he didn't go to investigate further until around 9 30 pm 
he looked back and was shocked to see that the object and the people around it had disappeared 
which shouldn't be possible given the size of this object now when morning arrived he 
and his son Lloyd went to investigate and they saw no traces that anything had been there which 
seemed pretty unusual since the area was a very soft mud flat and should have left impressions 
so that was unusual so at this point he's beginning to think this could have been a landed UFO and he decided to write the local newspaper and ask if anyone else in the area had 
seen anything strange on that night and boy did it turn out that he was right there were quite a few 
other Witnesses there was a Miss Anderson from nearby barnawartha who said that around 10 pm 
on that night she saw a yellowish glowing object moving to the east in the sky towards beechworth 
another witness Mrs saw she said that she saw a quote a very bright light which appeared to drop 
behind the mountain to the east there were more witnesses Mrs Woodcock said that at 9 25 quote 
I saw a peculiar light like fine rain coming down which changed from red to Pink and then faded away 
and more witnesses Mr T Burns says I saw an unusual pink light in a narrow beam which seemed 
to extend for miles and finally Mr R staff said that he had seen an unusual multi-colored object 
in the sky around 5 30 PM that same evening so that's fairly good corroboration and confirmation 
of what appears to be an amazing UFO landing as you can see that's a pretty well verified case and 
typical in some ways and quite unusual in others it's a shame the witness didn't really completely 
realize that that was a landed UFO and not just a trailer hanging out in the camping grounds there 
because he might have taken a much closer look but he certainly did realize obviously that it 
was unusual when the darn thing just disappeared it's a great case and here's another case which I 
find so fascinating because I've looked into this type of encounter and I call this one 
another hitchhiking alien as you may or may not know I did do a previous episode called 
alien hitchhikers and I wrote about this in one of my books not from here I believe it's volume 4 
in which there are a dozen cases coming from all over the world of hitchhiking extraterrestrials 
so that's what we have going on here this is a new case I just located this one took place in 
Bahia Blanca Argentina and wow what an amazing case this is I wish I had known of it earlier 
I would have included it in the previous episode but here it is now and I think you'll find 
it quite interesting this case occurred on August 27 1972 again in Bahia Blanca 
and this is another case of a strange hitchhiking alien the main witness is 
Eduardo Fernando de Dua he's a mechanic who owns a shop at number 19 Calle De Cordova in Bahia Blanca 
but it was after midnight and Eduardo was driving from Medanos where he had eaten 
dinner to his home in Bahia Blanca which as you can see here is a distance of about 30 miles 
and he had just left the city of Medanos when he saw a strange man flagging him down 
now this man was basically human looking he wore a full-length coat with a turned 
up collar and a round hat but most strange was the man's face which was abnormally 
long with an immensely long chin so large that it actually reached down to his chest 
so this could possibly be a human being but given what happened next I don't think so 
Eduardo stopped the car the strange man got in Eduardo asked him if he was heading to 
Bahia Blanca the way Eduardo was going and the man made some sort of incomprehensible reply 
Eduardo was wondering at this point if the man was just too shy to speak or perhaps couldn't speak 
so he's just continuing to drive down the road in silence and at one point they reached the 
710 kilometer mark on the highway which you can see here this is national highway three 
at this point Eduardo's car lights suddenly went out forcing him to stop and right up ahead on the 
highway he saw we first thought was an overturned bus but a closer look revealed that it wasn't a 
bus at all it was a large object with a blue light in the middle and two white lights on either side 
and portholes so he exited the car when suddenly he was struck he says by a dazzling beam of light 
he felt intense heat so he took shelter behind the door of his car and looking at the object 
could now clearly see the windows and a green light glowing beneath the object he retreated 
into his car only to find that his mysterious passenger was now gone the passenger door was 
open and get this the door handle was on the car floor so how could that could happen I don't know 
so at this point suddenly without warning his car lights come back on the object and 
the visitor are gone and shaken Eduardo drove back to Bahia Blanca and immediately called the police 
who took his story seriously they questioned him for four hours so this case made its way 
to researchers and they discovered that other people in the area saw UFOs on the same night 
a gentleman by the name of Annabelle tato and his wife so that they saw a strange object overhead 
as did Juan Carlos Oro and finally there was a factory worker by the name of Sir Robert mistriana 
and he called the police to say that he saw a bus shaped craft with Windows hovering near National 
highway 3. so again this was the same road Eduardo was on and very much the same description that 
he gave of this object so there you go that's another case involving different types of evidence 
multiple Witnesses electromagnetic effects it's quite a compelling case and so unusual 
and here's another case which is just amazing I call this one the Le bihan family UFO ordeal 
and yeah they had quite a harrowing encounter in some ways it really quite frightened them 
and this one took place in France in a town called react Sur belong this is uh not too huge of a town 
it's kind of a small village certainly back then it was not as big as it is now 
but it's an amazing case because it is a multiple witness case there's animal reactions going on uh 
some physiological reactions that are quite dramatic multiple Witnesses in the area 
who weren't aware of what the behind family were going through so a really amazing case 
involving of course a UFO and humanoids this very dramatic case took place on September 29 1974. 
and one of the main Witnesses is 20 year old you Nick Le bihan who had spent the night with 
friends he's an Air Force Sergeant by the way and he was returning to his parents home at 37 
Rue depend more as you can see here and he noticed that the living room was bathed in 
a strange orange red light the family dog was howling and barking as was the neighbor's dog 
unique didn't think much of it and went to his bedroom and this is when he did see a bright red 
light coming in through his window and he's thinking perhaps there was a fire outside and looking outside did not see a fire he saw a saucer-shaped craft as big as a house hovering 
about 1500 feet away at eye level so pretty much right on the ground right above it very low 
he said the craft was gray in color it had large rectangular portholes that were blazing with this 
bright red light you could see a cockpit like structure on top of this craft and it was low 
enough that it was pretty much obscured by trees but he could see it enough to see a door opening 
up in the bottom and he saw what he first kind of perceived as Balls of Fire coming down so watching 
them he realized that these weren't spheres at all these were actually humanoids and he became quite 
alarmed he turned off his bedroom light grabbed his binoculars now through the binoculars could 
in fact see that these were humanoids which he said were glowing like white hot metal and 
we're beginning to advance towards his house in a weird waddling motion so he wasted no time he ran 
downstairs quickly woke up his parents LED them back up to his bedroom and showed them the craft 
Mademoiselle libyhan like her son first thought the house was on fire but looking out the window 
she and her husband and son saw this craft and as her husband the Surah leban says one would have 
said it was a steamboat lighted up in the middle of a prairie he said this craft was about 30 feet 
wide 20 feet high hovering in place but it was oscillating slightly from side to side kind of 
vibrating and he says that the base on either side of this craft were brilliant red lights
was quite frightened by this she said even the dog was growling he felt that 
something was happening I thought that I was going to die of fright 
so the three Witnesses watched as these glowing humanoids began to move closer though they were 
approaching at an angle so they weren't too concerned at this point they reminded 
Mademoiselle libyhan of the Michelin Man and they were moving heavily and rocking from side to side 
now unique got a very close look at them using the binoculars and as he says one was walking in the 
lead the other two were behind on either side they were the color of an electric Arc they seemed to 
be the size of a human being they were a stocky build the head proportional to the body and I 
could distinguish the legs they were moving in our Direction their walk was slow and heavy but they 
seemed nevertheless to progress at the speed of a person who walks quickly with their slow and heavy 
gate went to a slow rocking back and forth their movements perfectly synchronized they did not 
seem to make contact with the ground but it's seen that nevertheless they had something to stand on 
I could make out no features of the faces the Silhouettes appeared to be dressed in head-to-foot 
suits now at this point these figures turned and began to move directly towards the three Witnesses 
and Mademoiselle lebihan cried out they have spotted us they're going to irradiate us we must 
Evacuate the house so they basically panicked they fled their house and started running up 
the street towards the mother's mother's house the grandmother and at this point Mademoiselle 
libyhan became so terrified that she couldn't move she stopped in mid-stride told her husband 
and son to just abandon her leave her behind and go and form the authorities what was happening 
they ran ahead called the police then returned and carried mademoisella bihan to the nearest 
neighbor who later confirmed to researchers that the three Witnesses were very much terrified 
the police showed up shortly later but by that time the object and beings were gone 
the police searched the area but found no evidence so then the libyhons returned to their 
house they noticed that their clock had stopped at the moment of the appearance of the object 
Mademoiselle Libby Han was in clinical shock and for the next three days she suffered from 
insomnia headaches and she said pricklings all over her body and a feeling like her 
brain was wrapped in Cotton she actually lost 12 kilograms of weight and as they were going 
back to the house the dog was very nervous he groveled Upon returning and Monsieur Le bihan 
and unique his son so that they were both in a State of shock but suffered no physical symptoms 
now an investigation by researchers revealed that their neighbors this year and Mademoiselle 
degu also heard the loud Thunderclap they got to investigate and notice that their lights weren't 
working they felt a strong heat permeating the bedroom and saw a bright neon light coming in 
through the closed shutters but they didn't look out to investigate and after five minutes their 
lights began working again and later looking out their window they did see three rectangular traces 
on the ground about 60 by 90 centimeters where the grass had been apparently scorched as if by 
high heat I think you'll agree that's an amazing case with not only animal reactions physiological 
reactions but landing traces and with multiple Witnesses it's very hard to deny that something 
truly amazing happened to the Louis vihan family and now we move to another case probably one of my 
favorite in the bunch and I call this hundreds of people saw it you may have heard about the 
cinconer it's gotten to be quite famous because of some apparent photographic evidence of this 
UFO that so many people saw this occurred in the Canary Islands it actually involved many 
many people over multiple cities including many Military Officers police officers I mean a lot 
of people saw this craft most people just saw kind of a light or structured craft in the sky 
some saw this thing come quite low very low in fact within a few hundred feet and they 
saw humanoids and it's very unusual humanoids as well and the Witnesses are very high credibility 
there's quite a few of them it's a really really remarkable case it was on June 22nd 1976. 
when many hundreds of peoples saw a strange UFO overhead this case did generate International 
headlines as people in the cities of Tenerife La Palma and lagomera all witnessed this amazing UFO 
hovering overhead this was during the evening among the first Witnesses were the crew of the 
Navy ship the atrey Vida pictured here which was off the coast of fuerta Ventura Island 
was around 9 27 PM when the entire crew saw a brilliant yellow blue light moving 
from the shore towards the ship casting a beam of light in various patterns the crew watched 
it for about 40 minutes which is a long time craft appeared to put on some kind of display 
that was their feeling it was flashing brilliant colors and at one point actually sent out what 
appeared to be smaller craft one which spiraled upwards so meanwhile residents of Canary Island 
specifically in the towns of galdar Las Rosas and agate all watch this this included doctors 
Farmers teachers taxi drivers Housewives all kinds of people were watching this 
this was a big deal in fact later the investigator General Carlos Doles de Espejo pictured here later 
wrote and I quote the fact that a very strange and peculiar aerial phenomena occurred on the 
night of June 22nd is a true and proven fact as incredible as its behavior and conditions may seem 
and as you can see there is a photograph apparently though there's some controversy about whether this shows a missile test from a different date or the actual craft that was seen on that day 
but it's certainly a very famous photograph now the most fantastic report from this evening comes 
from Dr Francisco padron Leon pictured here was with another gentleman a taxi cab driver heading 
to a home in Los Rosas where he was going to visit a patient and They Came Upon one of these apparent 
smaller spheres he says it was blue in color a hundred feet wide and totally transparent they 
could see inside of it was hovering very low and the lower part of the orb had a platform which 
looked to them like aluminum silver in color with three consoles and at either side they 
saw two very tall figures very tall an estimated eight to ten feet in height now these figures were 
humanoid they had large heads with what appeared to be helmets and were dressed from head to toe in 
red they were facing each other towards the center of The Craft and Francisco turned to the turned to 
the taxi cab driver and said are you seeing what I am and the taxicab driver said my God what is that 
and I'll just let Dr Francisco padron describe in his own words Z says we were talking about hunting 
and as we entered the last part of the road the car lights pointed at a slightly luminous 
spear that was stationary and very close to the ground although I can't say for sure if it was 
touching it was made of a totally transparent and crystalline-like material since it was possible 
to see through it the stars in the sky it had an electric blue color but tenuous without dazzling 
it had a radius of about 30 meters 100 feet and in the lower third of the sphere you could see a 
platform of aluminum-like color as if made of metal in three large consoles at each side of 
the center there were two huge figures 8.5 to 10 feet tall but no taller than 10 feet 
dressed entirely in red and facing each other in such a way that I only saw their profile 
then I observed that some kind of bluish smoke was coming out from a transparent Central tube in the 
sphere covering the periphery of the sphere's Interior without leaking outside at any moment 
the sphere then began to grow and grow until it became huge like a 20-story house but the platform 
and the crew remained the same size it Rose slowly and majestically and it seems I heard a very 
tenuous whistling so this sphere expanded in size as it ascended and by the time they had reached 
their destination uh by this time they had reached their destination so they ran into the patient's 
house and called them out in time to watch this object zoom up very quickly towards Tenerife 
and it turned out he was not the only witness he and the taxicab driver and the people in the house the lady next door was watching TV when her dogs began barking the 
TV screen went blank so she went outside she saw the doctor's cab she saw the blue sphere 
hovering above it she saw the two beings inside and this frightened her so badly 
she ran back inside closed all the windows and doors and began to pray for her safety so this 
case was Sensational it created quite a fewer got a lot of press coverage and in fact researcher JJ 
Benitez wrote a book on the case called UFOs official documents of the Spanish government 
because it did have a lot of documentation and was officially investigated by government officials 
so there you go hundreds of witnesses that makes it really hard to deny photographs 
a lot of government documentation of this citing that lasted for over I think it was 40 minutes 
really really remarkable and here is another case which I just found super fascinating this one took 
place in Cabra dios Puerto Rico and I call this the flying humanoid this is a really interesting 
case which I think reveals some of the ET motives for encounters a lot of witnesses to this case 
and boy did it create a furor in the neighborhood where this took place it's really dramatic as we 
shall see this case occurred on July 12 1977 again in Puerto Rico in a small town called Cabra Dios 
and I was thoroughly investigated by researcher Sebastian robiu La Marsh 
the main witness is Adrian de Olmos Ordonez who was sitting on the balcony of his house 
around 9pm when something very strange happened and I'll just quote Adrian directly as he says 
I saw something emerge from the grounds of the farm opposite my house 
it was a small figure which stepped up from the darkness and passed under the barbed wire fence 
my first thought was that it must be some child or other playing about over there 
but then I perceived from the whale is dressed that it was a very strange being indeed and I realized that the situation would have to be handled with caution 
the being was walking in quite a normal fashion like a child 
so this little figure was walking closer to him and coming right towards the street 
light directly in front of his house at which point he could see that it was wearing a green 
bodysuit which looked like it was filled with air it wore a metallic looking helmet with an antenna 
on top it had a glassy flight which was quite reflective so he couldn't see the being's face 
and according to Adrian it got about 10 feet from the street light and 30 feet from himself 
and he could see that it was holding a matchbox sized metallic object with a point on it and it 
holding it in its hands and I was staring fixedly at the Street Lamp and Adrian had the impression 
that it wanted to test the electricity coming from this Street Lamp he was close enough that 
he could see it had four fingers on each hand and he's as he says quote feet like the feet of a duck 
and it also had what looked to him like a tail coming out of its backside this could have been 
part of his suit hard to say but Adrian called his daughter irasema to bring a pad of paper and 
pencil so he could sketch this being so she went to fetch the paper and pencil but she accidentally 
flipped on the wrong light switch the one which lit up the balcony that he was on and as Adrian 
says the minute the balcony light went on I saw the creature run back instantly towards the barbed 
wire fence it passed under the wire and then stopped it placed its hands on the front part of 
its belt and then a thing which it had on its back like a rucksack lit up and emitted a sound like 
the noise of an electric drill and then it rose up into the air and made off towards the trees 
so Adrian got a good look at this backpack this rucksack which he said had two red lights on it 
and two blue lights and they emitted a downward facing beam of Light which appeared to levitate 
the being so by this time Adrian's wife and other family members as well as neighbors 
were gathering to watch what was going on and for about 10 minutes they saw the light 
from this creature moving from tree to tree off in the distance until finally Vanishing 
from sight there were more than 10 Witnesses whose watched this and it was during this time 
that all of them noticed that the cows in the farm were quote acting as though crazy 
they were dashing back and forth and the dogs throughout the entire neighborhood began barking 
so the police were caught at this point who arrived on the scene word spread very quickly 
through this small town and basically people began to panic mothers were afraid for their 
children everyone was going crazy so the police ended up posting guards for the rest of that night 
now Adrian said he had never had any interest in UFOs but does now and in fact he was so shocked by 
deciding that he says he couldn't eat for two days and was very nervous and edgy a fact confirmed by 
his wife and as Adrian says now I believe in those things and I want to do some reading about them 
now it did turn out that two days earlier a neighbor had seen a glowing object apparently 
dropped down from the sky into the fields where that humanoid had come from so it could have 
been there for as long as two days hard to say but this is what she saw also another neighbor 
said that on the night of Adrian's encounter his own cattle became so frightened that they threw 
themselves against his fence in an apparent attempt to escape causing multiple wounds 
so pretty interesting because there's another encounter which occurred not too far away in 
Puerto Rico two months later a 74 year old man from Corazon this is about 60 miles away 
reported seeing a three foot tall being come down in a green flame walked right up to him 
and began to examine him examined his feet his knees his chest his head and then disappeared 
with a loud whooshing noise so that got quite a bit of attention due to the previous encounter 
it doesn't it's an unknown whether this was the same figure but it's certainly an interesting 
synchronicity yeah truly a dramatic case it's a shame that the witness didn't have a camera but 
as you can see he did draw the E.T in quite some detail and a lot of animal reactions in this case 
so so many witnesses I mean it's just an incredible case all around and here's another 
one which I found quite touching because it involves two young teenage boys who were 
really deeply affected by their encounter and I call this one missing time on the tug River 
this took place in Naugatuck West Virginia and it's not a super well-known case it does appear 
to be an onboard experience though they don't have a whole lot of recall of what happened when they 
had missing time and were apparently taken on board but they do remember some things and it's 
a really interesting case in a lot of different ways it was on June 14 1978 around 9 00 PM when 
two teenage boys Brian Duty age 14 as you can see here and his friend John Wright same age 
decided to go fishing this is something they had done many times very close to their home 
along the banks of the tug Fork River they both lived on a WinCo block road as you can see here 
and they were hoping to catch some catfish or Mud Cats as they baited their hooks with dough balls and worms and waited for the fish to bite strangely the fish were pretty quiet this evening 
it was about one and a half hours later with still no luck catching fish is around 10 35 pm 
when Brian Duty turned to John and said look here comes a UFO and as John says I thought he 
was kidding but it went on past we looked back up and there it was again about 40 feet from us 
the craft they described it as being gold and silver in color and as John says it was real 
pretty as Brian says the craft floated around in the air about the height of the power lines 
they both described it as being round in shape pretty large about 60 feet wide with a structure 
on top and what looked like a door of some kind on the bottom they said red blue and 
green lights flashed around the circumference and as they watched it sent down two beams of 
light directly on to both of them but it seemed to have no effect on them it couldn't feel anything 
at least not at first at this point neither of them were frightened but things changed pretty 
quickly because as John says we couldn't move we laid down and watched but still could not move 
my head felt like it was going in and out getting bigger and shrinking Brian also 
felt these strange effects and as he says it was like somebody was behind us and Whispering you 
couldn't understand what they were saying but you could hear it the next thing Brian and John knew 
they were running home in fact John could hear what he believes were footsteps following them 
and he saw a beam of light shining down from above so they did have missing time they were quite 
disoriented as Brian says I just remember going in the front door of my home I was scared stiff 
so both boys were left with vague memories of being taken on board 
John remembered sitting in some sort of weird chair and smelling a strange odor Brian recalled 
seeing a tall figure and said yeah there was a terrible smell John's mother Elsie Irene Duty 
said that when her son came running in that night he was very scared now she says he certainly was 
scared and trembling when he arrived home and I let him sleep until noon the next morning 
in fact they were so scared they abandoned all their fishing equipment which they had to retrieve the next day and it totally changed their lives they did not want to go fishing alone anymore 
as Brian says we're now scared to be out after dark now and only fish until about 9 30 pm 
and as John says we take some other guys with us now that is quite an encounter and I don't blame those boys for not wanting to go outside or fishing 
alone on the tug of Fork River anymore considering what happened to them it's a really dramatic case 
and here's another one I call this one encounter on the mountain 
this is one of Japan's best humanoid cases certainly according to the main researcher 
this one occurred in sayama City this is near saitama Japan it does involve two witnesses 
although one being only an infant not sure you can really count them as a full-on witness but 
certainly the main witness had quite an amazing encounter on a Mountaintop in Japan with a 
UFO and a humanoid that would change his life forever it was the evening of October 3rd 1978. 
when the witness haidichi Amano he's an amateur radio ham operator and the owner of a snack bar 
along with his wife he drove with his two-year-old daughter jury up to the top of a nearby Mountain 
to radio his brother in another part of Japan and a few other friends so this is a mountain which overlooks sayama city and after talking for a while on his ham 
radio he decided it was time to leave and his two-year-old was standing on the front 
passenger seat when without warning the interior of the car became flooded by a brilliant light 
immediately looked outside to locate the source of the light but saw nothing which 
totally perplexed him because the interior of the car was completely illuminated and looking at 
his child he saw that his daughter was now lying down and in fact her mouth appeared to be foaming 
so he saw this orange colored beam of light now coming down through the windshield onto his stomach and looking up so that it was coming from above the car 
he then felt this metallic object pressure being pressed up against the side of his head 
and turning as far as he could because at this point he couldn't really move he saw a weird 
figure standing next to the car and what looked like a metallic pipe-like instrument coming from 
where this creature's mouth would be and I was pressing pressing up against hadichi's Temple 
and it was causing high-pitched noises he said it was very much like sped up voices on in audio tape 
and it was kind of just going into his brain he thought they were trying to transmit some 
kind of message so he didn't get a super good look at this being so he's not sure if 
it was biological or could have actually been some sort of robotic type creature 
but he said it had a round face no neck what looked like big pointed ears two small eyes that 
appeared to Glow this bluish white light no nose was visible and he couldn't really see the mouth 
but it did notice a triangular shape pointing downwards on the top of the head 
so he he said it was quite short and he was very frightened he tried to start the car would not 
start the headlights would not come on and this is when he felt himself being totally overcome with 
paralysis and in fact he felt himself beginning to lose Consciousness time seemed to slow down 
he said this went on he can't tell for sure but about four or five minutes at which point 
the creature seemed to slowly fade away the beam of light disappeared all at once the headlights 
came back on the engine came on the radio began to play it seems likely he did have missing time 
he looked at his watch but it had stopped exactly at 9 37 PM apparently when this encounter began 
so he's in a complete Panic at this point he drove frantically down the mountain and when 
he reached the bottom this is when he finally turned and saw his daughter jury standing up 
and she seemed to be perfectly okay she said I want to drink of water Papa 
so he was reluctant to call the police but decided that it was probably a good idea 
that he did so and he did unfortunately he regretted it because not only did they not 
believe him but they teased him made fun of him he drove home told his wife who did believe him she 
could tell he was upset and he was suffering a very bad headache and went straight to bed 
so researchers heard about the experience and hadichi was placed under hypnosis on 
TV he talked about his encounter on TV and he recalled under hypnosis being told by the 
ETS that there would be a second meeting on a very specific date which has not been revealed 
and that they had given him some type of crystal-like bracelet which he would only recall 
and be able to find when the time was right and he would be able to use it to contact them again 
so as of yet there's no further information on this so-called bracelet or if there's been a 
second contact however hadichi does believe that the ETS may have placed an implant in his body 
and as I said he went on TV in fact I'm one of Japan's most popular TV shows and publicly 
talked about his encounter investigator June Ichi takanashi interviewed him and concluded that he 
told the truth and the experience was quote one of the strangest ever to have taken place in Japan 
and he and he talked about another case that was also very strange but he says I believe this is the most authentic and interesting humanoid encounter case in Japan 
I have to give kudos to the witness hideichi for stepping forward and actually appearing on 
TV especially after going to the police and not only being disbelieved but ridiculed but it did 
go public and it's a fascinating case that appears to be legitimate and certainly the 
main investigator found it quite compelling and it's a truly fascinating case and now we 
get to the last case I'd like to present today and I call this one the ETS in the cornfield 
and this is an amazing case which took place in Saint Dorothy in Quebec Canada 
and I love this case for a number of reasons one it involves three Witnesses who saw a close-up 
UFO which was followed by a Incredibly Close Up and quite frightening humanoid encounter with 
very unusual looking ETS and it was interactive as well it's got some very strange physiological 
effects some interesting Landing Trace cases in the form of footprints but most fascinating 
about this is while these boys were having their encounter there was another witness an ambulance 
dispatcher who was watching the whole thing well most of it occur from a short distance away 
so this is an extra level of corroboration certainly that gives this case a level of 
credibility it wouldn't otherwise have it's truly an amazing case it was around 2 A.M on July 23rd 
1982 again in Saint Dorothy Quebec when three teenage boys were camping out in the cornfields 
this is in a rural part of saint dorothay and the three Witnesses include Stefan Lido 
and his friends Francois cuisino and Michelle they looked up and they saw this glowing object 
quite low about a thousand feet overhead and pretty close a thousand feet away they first 
thought it might be a plane or a helicopter but it wasn't really moving around and it was totally 
quiet it had lights on it which were flashing red yellow and blue it was also sending down a beam of 
white light from the center and as they watched it hovered lower and went right above a nearby Barn 
they said it was about the size of a helicopter and it looked really beautiful 
and at this point started to move flying above some nearby homes at this point they 
could now hear a low pitch noise coming from the object they watched it move off into the 
distance and they thought at this point that the encounter was over and went back into their tent 
but the most interesting part was yet to come it was about five or ten minutes later when they were 
in their tent that they heard strange noises quote like electronic beep beeps this was in 
the cornfields right outside their tent it had decided to see if they could get a closer look 
and Francois one of the boys left the tent and to go get a better flashlight 
while the others grabbed their own smaller flashlights and went into the field to investigate 
and this is when they both saw a very tall figure with thin arms and legs walking in a weird hunched 
over manner it could make out eyes and legs but when one of them turned their flashlight at this 
being the flashlight actually malfunctioned but they both thought the being was looking at them 
so at this point Francois returned with a much larger better flashlight and this is when all 
of them saw other beings and heard many footsteps around them at this point some very strange things 
happened the wind began to blow furiously the temperature dropped dramatically and all three of 
them felt this weird pain in their stomach so this really caused them to panic Stefan managed to turn 
and Shine the flashlight and saw it he described as an extraterrestrial about 50 feet away 
as Stefan says in his own words he was five or six feet tall he had orange eyes bigger than 
ours his head was huge and brown colored I was so frightened I fled all three of them freaked out so 
they ran to the closest structure which turned out to be the office of an ambulance dispatcher by the 
name of Denise labret who worked at the ambulance dispatch at 521 Rue principal this is in Laval 
Quebec and she believed the boys because as it turned out she was watching this event take place 
she had seen them in the field in their tents and heard them screaming and went 
outside and saw this UFO what she said was hovering above the field behind her office 
she described it as being about three times larger than the apparent size of a full moon 
and uh yeah it was the boys shouting that had drawn her outside and she watched this object 
long enough to see it hovering and then move off and as she says in her own words the saucer 
was hovering about one or two hundred feet up in the air it projected a large beam of white light 
the sides of the object were equipped with many reflectors of different colors only the red colored lights blinked on and off in sequence giving the impression that 
the object itself was rotating so she was asked very pointedly was this a flying saucer you know 
was this unconventional and she said oh yeah this is absolutely unexplained 
and she did notice another strange detail she said that the whole time the UFO was in the vicinity 
she was unable to communicate by radio or dispatch any ambulances because the radio interference and 
static was too bad it prevented all communication so definite electromagnetic effects going on here 
she wasn't sure what to make of the creature the boys saw she tried to convince them that it 
might have been an animal but the boys vehemently disagreed saying it was bipedal and there was more 
than one of them had a very large head all the details that they described and she confirmed that 
the boys were petrified white with fears how she described it so after everything had calmed down 
they ran back to their tent very quickly retrieved their sleeping bags and Equipment but refused to 
sleep outside an investigators showed up you can see the tent here all the boys being interviewed 
and when morning arrived they inspected the field and they saw what appeared to be unusual shaped 
Footprints kind of like three-toed footprints so a very interesting case to say the least 
so that's it for today I hope you found this interesting 10 amazing cases of humanoid 
encounters Landings on-board experiences and again these cases show that this is a global phenomena 
but there are many different types of humanoids that they have all different types of effects on 
people I love that there's so much evidence to support these cases it's always funny to me when 
Skeptics say where's the evidence you know show me a photograph where are the landing traces all of 
this kind of evidence is prevalent there's a lot of it you just have to look for it and it's there 
so yeah this is absolutely I think really good evidence that we are not alone we have never been 
alone and uh just darn interesting so I think you know we can speculate all we want about why et's 
are here and what their agenda is but the answers to these questions are in the first 10 cases as 
I've said many times pretty much everything we know about extraterrestrials comes from One Source 
certainly not our governments who are lying about this subject certainly not scientists 
and commentators and pundits on TV most who have apparently never even picked up a UFO 
book or had their own encounter everything we know about extraterrestrials comes pretty much 
solely from contactees from Witnesses from people who have had encounters that's why I 
like to present first-hand cases without editing them and just lay out the facts as we know them 
so again I hope you've enjoyed this episode I truly appreciate you watching 
and until next time keep searching for answers keep asking questions and keep 
looking for the truth and most important keep having fun bye now.
