WEIRD WATER UFO ENCOUNTERS: TWELVE TRUE CASES
Jan 19, 2024

Summary
Jan 19, 2024
It’s a pattern that researchers have recognized long ago: UFOs seem to be attracted to water. Lakes, rivers, oceans…there are many cases where UFOs are seen diving into the water, coming out of it, floating on the surface, and affecting the water in unusual ways. Cases reach back decades and come from all over the world. Some accounts involve UFOs sucking up the water itself! This video presents twelve weird water UFO cases, each of which provides profound insights into UFOs and their strange connection to water.

USO WITH HUMANOIDS. One day in Aug 1914 as William Kiehl and other witnesses saw an odd object floating in Georgian Bay at Lake Ontario, Canada. Shaped like a bell-jar, he saw two humanoids holding a hose, sucking water from the bay. On top of the object were 3 other figures. The UFO departed so quickly that one of the little men clung to the outside of the craft.

“IT WAS WATCHING US.” When three people decided to take the ferry across Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada, in Aug 1952, they were awed to see a weird round boat zoom toward them on the lake. As it arrived, it rose into the air, showing itself to be a UFO. It hung there briefly, then moved back over the lake before darting off.

UFO ORDEAL AT ORADELL. Just before 8pm on Sep 15, 1962, three boys were shocked to see a UFO drop from the sky, plunge into the Oradell Reservoir in New Jersey, and takeoff. Unknown to them, others saw the object. The next night, the UFO was back. Soon, UFOs were being seen nightly, by hundreds of people. The UFO wave would garner national headlines.

THE PEROPAVA RIVER UFO CRASH. On the afternoon of Oct 31, 1963, more than 50 people observed a flying saucer lose control and plunge into the Peropava Rivera in Iguape, Brazil. As the water frothed and bubbled, the Brazilian military arrived and sent divers down to recover the craft. But after two weeks of searching, no evidence of the UFO was ever found.

A UFO FISH STORY? One evening in 1964, a group of fishermen at the Moraleda Channel in Castro, Chile were shocked to see a glowing man walk out of the sea. After staring at them for a few moments, the strange figure walked back into the ocean. They could still see a strange glow under the water. That’s when fish began to fill their nets in unprecedented numbers.

BEYOND MY POWER TO COMPREHEND. On Apr 9, 1970, Max Krauss was taking a walk near his home in Aufhofen, Germany when he saw a 2-foot-wide, transparent sphere with spokes pacing him. The bizarre device hovered over a small stream and began sucking up water through a pipe. Moments later, it departed. As an electrician Max was convinced that he had seen something extraterrestrial.

UFO DISPLAY OVER CHOLLA BAY. On the night of Nov 7, 1971, Albert Formiller walked along the beach at Cholla Bay, Mexico when a saucer-shaped craft appeared and sent down a beam of light nearly a half-mile wide onto the surface of the water. The craft remained for 20 minutes before slowly moving off. Unknown to Albert, many other people saw the strange display.

“MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE.” In Jul 1973, “Masaaki” worked as a night-guard for a lumber company along the coast of Tomokomai, Japan. To his great fear, a UFO dropped down and began sucking water out of the bay. At one point, it moved overhead and was close enough that he could see strange humanoids inside.

USO AT PITYILU ISLAND. One evening in the 1970s, a missionary was staying at tiny Pityilu Island near Papua, New Guinea when a UFO appeared. It hovered for a few moments and then plunged into the shallow reefs offshore. A group of men sent a boat out to investigate, but before they could arrive, the object was gone.

FISHING FOR UFOS. On the evening of Jul 15, 1981, 14-year-old, Carl E. Moore was amazed to see a UFO drop from the sky and float on the water of a small lake in Newberry, SC. As it hit the water, it sent up a cloud of steam. He watched it from 50 feet away, for three minutes before the craft darted away.

“FOLLOW THAT UFO!” One night in August 1981, a group of 5 witnesses driving in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada followed a red, glowing object as it made a controlled descent into Lake Ontario. Going to the shore, they saw two submarine-like objects emerge in the same exact location. Although the witnesses waited for hours, the UFO never emerged.

“THIS WAS REAL SCARY.” When a father and his two sons went fishing off the coast of Seaforth, England, they were awestruck to see a fleet of five UFOs dive into the Mersey Estuary. Shortly later, all five objects emerged from the sea and flew off. Several other witnesses saw the whole thing.

These twelve cases only skim the surface of the huge number of cases involving UFOs and USOs. These cases show that the waters of our planet might be holding vast numbers of extraterrestrial craft, hidden from sight. And they show beyond any reasonable doubt that there is a strange connection between UFOs and water.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to another episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's
episode is called weird water UFO encounters 12 true cases I love the
cases involving Usos unidentified submersible objects because there are a
lot of them and they haven't gotten a whole lot of attention but if you map out UFO encounters you'll see that there
is definitely a connection to water lots of cases of UFOs hovering over larg
bodies of water small bodies of water reservoirs Rivers streams Lakes you name
it there's absolutely a connection some people have speculated that UFOs use
water as a fuel source I haven't found any evidence of that but I do think that
there is good evidence that they use it to perhaps cool off their ships and of
course to use water in the same ways that we do and what I've done today is
I've found 12 really interesting cases which are just a bit
offbeat unusual have unique elements to them which I think help explain some of
the ways and the reasons UFOs are attracted to water these cases come from
all over the world Canada across Europe Japan uh New Guinea even of course the
United States as well really all over the world stretching back into time all
the way to the 1900s I found some really early cases as well as some Modern cases
a few cases involving humanoids as well I love humanoid cases as you know so
yeah a lot of really interesting encounters that I think have something important to say about the UFO phenomena
and about the connection with UFOs and water so this is going to be a long
episode let's just get started and the first case I'd like to talk about today I call Uso with
humanoids and this occurred way back in August of 1914 over Georgian Bay this is in
Ontario Canada it's quite an unusual case and I think you'll find it quite
interesting the primary witness in this case is William J ke then 16 years old
though some accounts have him at 18 either way it was late in the afternoon
one day in August 1914 and William was with two other kids
camping near the Waters of Georgian Bay again in Ontario Canada along with them
was a family with three small children suddenly one of them saw a deer staring
out at the water and following its gaze they all saw a strange craft with
humanoids on it floating out on the surface of the water this craft was only about 450 fet from Shore so quite close
they said it was shaped kind of like a flattened sphere or like a bell jar about 15 ft high this had had a flat
gray surface a chrome colored ring likee structure around the bottom and colored
lights on it at the bottom of the craft were two short men they estimate about
4T tall both dressed in tight fitting iridescent purple green jumpsuits with
yellow box-shaped helmets on their heads both these little guys had skinny
bodies and oversized heads and they appeared to be manipulating a green hose
which emerged from a door in the center of the craft and hung down into the water and it looked to William like they
were trying to work out the Kinks and the hose which was about two maybe three Ines in diameter with a rounded device
on the end of it now on top of the craft were what looked like three short pipes
or rods William could actually see through the hatch where the hose was coming out
into the craft itself and saw what looked like bright green
tiles now I'll just let William describe a little bit of this in his own words as
he says I saw this deer about 12 ft from the water's edge looking out on the bay
and I looked out and saw this object there were two little men with square masks on their heads working with some
kind of hose coming out of the water and going up into the machine there was a green zigzag around
the center like it might be electricity traveling around and a bright silver band around the other
side so after watching for a few minutes the witnesses observed three more little
men appear from the top of the craft these three also had yellow box- shaped
helmets but they wore cocky colored clothing they were working with the
three pipes on the top of the craft which William thought might be manipulating the hose or connected to it
in some way but after a few moments the three men on top of the craft turned and
looked piercingly at the deer not seeming to notice the humans who were watching them too at least that was
Williams impression but as soon as they saw the deer they quick went back inside the craft at which time the pipes on top
of the craft also retracted into it one of the little men on the bottom of the
craft jumped inside the hatch but the hatch closed before the other little man could get inside and very quickly this
craft began to rise from the water in fact it Rose so quickly the
water that was on the bottom of the craft streamed back into the bay and
this one little guy who didn't get back inside was still hanging outside of the craft clinging to this chrome ring at
the base of the craft clinging desperately appeared to William and this craft rose about 15
feet and at this point William could see a strange sort of lattice work of what looked like Square metal on the bottom
and as he says in his own words it must have gone to a larger ship somewhere
because it seemed too small to have traveled millions of miles from another planet by itself it was not from this
planet at this point the craft tilted at an angle Rose Upward at an angle
trailing Steam and moved rapidly out of sight with that one little man still
holding desperately onto the outside of the craft everyone who saw this was very
much startled by the incident and yet strangely none of them talked about it
though William says he often thought of this little man who had been locked outside side and wondered what became of
him so what a fascinating case that was I do Wonder as the witness says what
happened to the humanoid it sounds like that UFO that Uso got out of that
location in a hurry for some reason but it's certainly an interesting case because there aren't a whole lot of Uso
cases that involve humanoids but that's definitely one of them and it's super
fascinating and here is another really interesting case which I call it was
watching us this is also by chance from Canada as it turns out Canada has more
Lakes than any other country I think that's one of the reasons we do see a
lot of Uso cases coming from Canada this one occurred in August of
1952 at Okanagan Lake this is in British Colombia Canada and this is a super
interesting case because it occurred during the day it's quite long lasting it's very widely viewed and this Uso
behaved in a way that I can only call uh intentionally trying to show itself what
UFO researchers call a UFO display in August of 1952 Gordon Sanborn his wife
Dorothy and their cousin Stuart Sanborn had an experience that would change the
way they felt about UFOs at that time Stuart lived in
Summerland located next to Okanagan Lake again in British Columbia Gordon and
Dorothy had come to visit so they decided that they were going to take a ferry across the lake to Colona so they
could see some of the countryside but they were about to see something much more
interesting and as Stuart says when we reached the fairy slip to cross over to
Colona we realized we would have to wait a bit bit because we could see the ferry still on the other side and then about
half a mile north of the ferry we noticed this thing Dorothy saw it too and as she says
I remember pointing it out and saying what a beautiful white boat it was it was moving around so gracefully and
though we still couldn't make it out very well at that distance it seemed to have a smooth round design we had never
seen before so at this point they're still in their car and they watched this strange what
they thought was a boat for several minutes and as they joined the line of cars waiting for the ferry to arrive
they got an even closer and better view of the lake and the object and to their
amazement they noticed that this weird object was now moving directly towards
them and as Stuart says it in his own words we could see the wash coming out
from either side yet somehow the boat as we thought it was didn't seem to be
moving very fast as it CLA came closer we still thought it must be some unusual
kind of modern boat it looked like a round hard hat sitting on a platter but
there was something about that wash that looked different and that started us
wondering so this perfectly circular craft seemed to move lightly along the
Lake's surface kind of reminding them of a stone skipping across the lake but it
glided smoothly and there was something about the way it was kicking up the water around it that seemed unusual
though they couldn't say exactly what that was but as it got closer they began
to realize that this was much more un unusual than they thought as Stuart says
then suddenly it really surprised us it was a few hundred yards away when all at
once the Wake disappeared and we realized this thing was in the air it
changed direction to the right so that it came straight towards the fairy Dock
and then it stopped dead less than 100 ft in front of us and about 50 ft above
the water so at this point the three of them could hardly believe their eyes it
clearly wasn't a boat it was some kind of UFO and they weren't the only ones seeing it there was a whole crowd of
people watching it as Dorothy said we sat in the car Spellbound we couldn't believe what was
happening they estimate the object was about 30 ft across they could see that
it was surrounded by a strange haziness which gave an indistinct fuzziness to
the edges of the object they said it looked almost translucent but they did feel certain
that anyone inside that thing could see outside of it easily without being seen
and as Stuart says it stayed there absolutely silent for a minute or so and
we definitely had a feeling it was watching us then it started back across the lake by this time I was out of the
car to get a better look and I told the others I wish I had a pair of
binoculars now at that moment an American Tourist in the car behind them
heard Stuart and said here take mine I've seen enough and he handed Stuart
the binoculars Stuart said this tourist looked frightened by what he had seen through the
binoculars so Stuart grabbed the binoculars and looked through them at the object watching as it moved off at a
leisurely speed he estimates about 20 mph it took about 5 to 6 minutes to
reach the opposite shore of the lake which was about 2 mil away then this
object flew parallel to a trail bordering the far side of the lake for just a few moments then quickly shot up
and disappeared Stuart was absolutely a struck he handed the binoculars back to
the American Tourist and as Stuart says again in his own words I guess I looked
just as shocked as he did and it must have affected the others the same way we
were a pretty quiet Bunch going across on the ferry although all three of them saw the
Str craft very clearly and never forgot the sighting they never talked about it
Dorothy did record the sighting in her diary shortly afterwards but strangely
there was no conversation about what they had seen as Dorothy says afterwards
for some reason we had no desire to talk about it it was as if we had been told
not to so given the path of the UFO Moving Straight towards the witnesses and then
stop stopping it appears that it wanted to be seen it was decades later that the
witnesses finally did report the encounter by this time sadly Gordon Stewart had passed on so his testimony
remains unrecorded but an interesting end note to this case as it turns out Lake
Okanagan is the home of the famous lake monster Ogo Pogo a crypto Zoological
creature which is perhaps Canada's most famous lake monster yet like UFOs
ultimately remains unidentified definitely an unusual case
I like it because the witnesses didn't immediately jump to the idea that this was a UFO not of course until this
object Rose from the water and flew off I also think it's an interesting coincidence that this is this took place
in Okanagan Lake where there is a very famous crypto Zoological creature
that would be interesting if there was a connection there uh but it's certainly a interesting coincidence to say the
least all right moving along and here is another really extensive case which has
really only a peripheral connection to Usos one of the events and there's a
series of them did involve a Uso encounter that's why I included it but
it's a very long complicated series of events involving this amazing UFO wave
and I call this one ordeal at orodell and there's a Reservoir in
orodell New Jersey and that's where this took place this was on September 15 1962
at orodell Reservoir in New Jersey and I'm surprised this case is not more well
known because it is an incredible series of events that's extremely well verified
really widely viewed and caused quite a sensation to say the least September 15
1962 was a big day for the city of idel in New Jersey as astronaut Walter Shira
who is the only astronaut to participate in the Mercury Gemini and apolla
missions was returning to his home of idel to a crowd of about 40,000 people
but it was the events that occurred later that night and in the days that followed that captured National
headlines and are still being talked about today was at 7:55 p.m. again September
15 when three boys Robert Decker Steve ngi and David Finley were standing on
Oradell Avenue this is a little Bridge which crosses the orodell reservoir and
this is when they saw a saucer-shaped craft dropped down from the sky it
hovered over a tree moved South hovered again and then dropped straight into the
river making a big splash they said it remained on the water for only a few
moments before suddenly taking off passing over their heads at only 500 ft
altitude so they were very impressed and the next day they reported their sighting to the
police now the police did investigate and in fact found another Witness who said he heard a loud Splash at the time
and the same general location now later two more witnesses
William Cooper and Alfred tus aged 16 called the police to say that they also
saw an object moving over the reservoir on that night and as William Cooper says
it looked like it was looking for something then we heard a loud bang like a door slamming only
louder they said this out object was saucer shaped with a dome on top and what appeared to be two windows and
there were more witnesses another Resident Miss Misha said she saw a round
red object and in the days that followed even more witnesses surfaced including a
Navy pilot JJ MC Vickers and a UFO researcher by the name of Victor
seoa so the police were taking these reports quite seriously and they did informed project Bluebook from the Air
Force who was interested in the sighting and asked to be kept updated on any
developments and there were events had really just begun because it was the
next night September 16 at 8:00 pm David Finley who saw the UFO on the first
night returned with his two friends Paul betti and Ed Lomi who were were
skeptical but they went to the same area and amazingly this UFO showed up again
in fact they saw a fisherman nearby and pointed it out to him and this fisherman
ran away in fear after this UFO darted off they went directly to the police and
reported the sighting and as one of the kids says we didn't believe him meaning
Dave Finley till we saw it so this was now creating quite a
sensation and on September 18 a crowd of about a 100 people were crowding along
the idell avenue bridge in hopes of seeing the UFO they didn't see anything but
apparently they didn't stay up late enough because that night at 4: a.m.
police officers ail rudoff and Eugene Troy saw a huge object glowing yellow
round on on top with a what looked like a cone on the bottom moving again over
the orodell reservoir and it was less than an hour later two other police
officers Martin Hanlon and Peter mcale saw an unexplained bright light in the
area it was just one hour after that that two maintenance employees James
rafy and Ernest couver saw two UFOs which disappeared in a puff of what
looked like smoke all also Witnesses were two Milkmen and two others including Robert
Pega who saw what they described as a brilliant beam of light coming down from
above so saucer fever was striking the town of orodell in a way they've never
seen before and in fact the Lucky Strike bowling alley took advantage of all the
interest in UFOs and started using it in their advertising so it was 2 Days Later
September 20th four boys said that they saw a craft near the reservoir and a formation of
three fighter jets came to try and intercept it at which point the craft glowed brightly and Rose silently
upwards and disappeared and it was just day after day these UFOs kept returning on the
21st UFOs were seen over the nearby Sam Breen Quarry just a few miles away there
were five police offic officers who witnessed it and the Quarry night
Watchman William stocks saw it too and he said he saw it on the 20th the night
before as he says it looked like a big ball of light at first it was stationary
but then began to move from side to side and then turned around as it turned
around I could see what appeared to be headlights it then disappeared very fast
so when it appeared again on the 21st first he was the one who called the police and all these police officers saw
it including officers Edward Welch and Frank Saul on that same night the 21st six
glowing objects were also seen at Pulaski Park in hackin saac which is only 6 miles from orodell and 10 miles
away at Patterson get this more than 200 people watched UFOs from Garrett
Mountain they said they saw numerous objects moving across the sky putting on
an obvious display and the activity continued on September 24th more than a dozen police
officers and a newspaper reporter George deap Penta watched a UFO hovering over
the sourine Quarry again in fact one of the officers shown his police car
Spotlight on the object at which point it moved off and according to reporter
George Penta he says he filmed the object though what became of this film is
unknown but there are many more witnesses more descriptions of encounters really enough to fill an
entire book ironically these events as far as I know have not been covered in
any books now many attempts were made to explain away or debunk the sightings all
kinds of explanations were being tossed around including that these settings were caused by satellites rocket
launches Birds shooting stars and more and in fact Project Blue Book they
joined this sort of debunking effort and really without any investigation at all
apparently labeled these sightings in different ways once as a misidentification of a bird and another
time as Reflections caused by strong thermal inversions then this all came to a head
on September 24th when an anonymous letter was sent to the Record newspaper
and apparently to the police saying all the sightings were the result of some
young boys who created a balsawood flying saucer they said filled with
helium balloons and outfitted with a 1/8 horsepower motor this letter was signed
quote the bergenfeld Pranksters Now by this time there were
too many reports too many witnesses for anyone to take this debunking claim with
any seriousness in fact the police and several local
newspapers denounced The hoax explanation the new Evening News science
writer Philip deltio said a hoax quote would have been
impossible the Hawthorne Observer said that the UFO reports should be taken
seriously the Hawthorne News Record wrote to imply so flippantly that our
police officer spent almost a half an hour looking at a balloon and then watched it speed away at an incredible
rate is insulting and the Riverdale Sunday Trent
I think they said the best thing they said that the real hoax was the letter claiming a hoax how amazing is that case
I mean hundreds of witnesses several who were independent of of each other a lot of police
officers seeing this thing that weird connection to the astronaut visiting his
hometown makes me think that this may have been an intentional display perhaps I don't know in some way
commenting Upon Our Journeys to the Moon hard to say I'm totally speculating
there I just found it to be an interesting coincidence and I also like this case
because it shows the amazing debunking efforts that our own governments go to
to try to explain away these encounters and the witnesses weren't having it the
police said no this is real even the newspapers got into the act and absolutely refuted these attempts to
debunk this case definitely deserves to be more well known and that's why I
wanted to include it on this list and now we move to another case which is
apparently quite well known certainly where it occurred I had never heard of it before and I'm not sure that most
people know about this case here in the United States I call this one the parava
river UFO crash this occurred on October 31st
1963 in aape Brazil and it's a fascinating case because it does involve
physical evidence it does involved a lot of witnesses and an apparent UFO out of
control crashing into a river and it's an amazingly complex event as well as we
shall see this case was first reported on by Coral Lorenzen of AO and it just
had legs from there many people started to talk about it this event began around
2:30 p.m. again on October 31st 1963 when 8-year-old rout de soza was
outside her home in iguape Brazil when she heard a loud roaring banging sound
and looking up she saw a silver Flying Saucer flying at very low level over her
house low enough to almost hit it it didn't it went over the house but it did strike the top of a palm tree and then
gyrated uncontrollably seeming to struggle zigzagged erratically and then
plunged into the nearby pero pava River so shocked by the sight she ran
towards the house to tell her mother Elia desuza who actually also heard this
roaring sound and came running out and seconds later route's Uncle rul Des soza
came running up it turned out he had been working outside and heard the roar
now all of them all three of them looked at where this disc had plunged into the
river and they could see the water quote boil up it was surging and erupting with
water and mud meanwhile on the other side of the river fisherman tetua yoswa watched the
whole event happening including the disc striking the tree and then diving
uncontrollably into the river he said the craft itself looked kind of like a
quote wash basin and like the other Witnesses he said it appeared to be out
of control he said the noise of The Craft was so loud as to be almost
deafening and there were other Witnesses another was a farmer nearby by the name
of iso okii and according to a report by the
Brazilian government there were probably about 50 other Witnesses all over the
area who saw this disc coming down and after it went down some of the
fishermen who saw where it went quickly drove Stakes into the river bank to Mark
the exact location where this craft sunk down into into the
river the water in that location wasn't deep only about 12 ft deep though there
was an estimated 15 ft of soft mud on the bottom the disc was not terribly large
estimates vary between 16 and 25 ft with a 3ot high
Dome now Brazilian military officials quickly arrived on the scene and began
to investigate and in fact troops were deployed to keep a aroundthe clock
watch first the investigator sent down divers with face masks who were unable
to locate the craft they got better equipment and next they sent down professional scuba divers who also were
unable to find any evidence of this craft turned out the deep mud proved to
be a huge obstacle in looking for this thing and speculation began to mount
that this disc was hiding in the deep and inaccessible mud they tried using M
detectors to locate it which was also unsuccessful they did take samples of
the damaged palm tree which were collected for study the entire investigation lasted some two weeks and
then was terminated due to being unable to find this craft so whatever happened
to it remains a mystery and as Coral Lorenzen of April writes we must
consider the possibility that the disc after settling to the bottom either proceeded through Locomotion of some
sort away from its initial resting place and is not now in the original spot if
so it could be anywhere in that River also the size indicates that it may have
been manned and if so perhaps repair could be affected underwater and escape
from the river and the mud accomplished during the night hours at some spot more isolated than where it originally sank
as far as I know that UFO Uso was never recovered and apparently it was managed
to slip away to wherever they go off to but it's an interesting case I don't
know if any quite like it being so widely viewed having so many close-up
observers to it and the Brazilian government taking it very very
seriously uh so certainly an important case and here is another one which is
probably virtually unknown and I don't know that it was ever officially investigated and it's a
quite a briefcase but so unusual that I decided it deserved mention at at least
and I call this one a UFO fish story because I wonder about it it is a bit
unusual this occurred in 1964 in Castro in Chile in South America
and it's quite a bizarre case I don't know of anything like it but it
certainly is a Uso case and you can make up your own mind about it this case may
sound like a fish story and technically it is but it appears to be a serious report from Chilean researcher Antonio
cardinus tabis who recounted it in his book Pacifico
Sur the main witness is Renato cardinus Alvarez who one evening in
1964 was fishing along with a group of other fishermen in the morala channel in
Castro Chile they finished they fished by throwing Nets into the water and pulling
out fish and as they were doing this suddenly rato and the other men saw a
tall male figure glowing white emerged from the water and he stood still and
stared intently at them this time he was still waste deep in the water just
staring at the fishermen and they were all afraid but continued fishing after just a few moments the
glowing man walked back into the ocean and disappeared beneath the surface
however even after he was no longer visible the men could see a strange glow
under the water and here's where the story gets even weirder shortly after
the man vanished the fishermen's Nets were suddenly filled with fish in fact
the fish jumped in droves like they had never seen before the fishermen returned
home with an unprecedented huge load of fish but they s s talked about what
happened so I don't know about that case I found it fascinating because perhaps
there was a connection to the fact that these fishermen had such an amazing
catch of fish immediately following this humanoid encounter could be a
coincidence I don't think so was a multiple witness counter I wish it was
more thoroughly investigated and validated but it is what it is and it is
certainly fascinating and here is another case which was very well
investigated and it's so unusual I don't know that there's another case in the literature quite like this one I call
this one beyond my power to comprehend and that is a direct quote from the
primary witness who saw some things so unusual he wasn't sure quite what he was
looking at this occurred on April 9 1970 in Al hofen
Germany and it's a really bizarre case which a UFO is showing a very strong
interest in what appears to be collecting water a lot of cases like that in the literature but this one has
some unique elements as we shall see this case comes from German researcher
Hubert maler and the sole witness is Max Krauss I retired electrician it was
around 400 p.m. on April 9 1970 as Max was taking a walk near alen by a little
stream of water alongside the road which was swollen from recent rains and this
is when he heard two sharp banging sounds kind of like a sonic boom though
he says it was more muffled but not seeing anything unusual he continued walking now suddenly a
murder of crows took off at high speed by that I mean a flock of crows now Max
says he never saw crows fly away so quickly before then for some unknown
reason he turned around and saw something very peculiar it first looked to him kind of
like a network of branches from a small Bush being blown across the street in front of him but as it got close he saw
that it was in fact a transparent sphere here about 1 to 2 ft wide and it had
eight gray green spokes radiating out from a dark Center which inside showed a
faint tetrahedral prism inside and I'll just let Max describe
this in his own words as he says seen from where I was the thing was rotating
on a vertical axis and anticlockwise and was floating indeed gliding along rather
than rolling a mere hands breath above the ground as the thing passed me I
increased my pace and stepped out after it at the moment of the encounter I was
not frightened merely astonished and curious but I was incapable of doing
anything whatsoever such as picking up a stone or going over to the thing and
giving it a kick with my foot I was stopped from doing so and could only look on and observe the thing may have
rolled along in this way beside IDE me for about 150 M or so then it halted did
a right angle turn towards the little stream of water and it stopped there the
rotation stopped what I now observed is beyond my power to comprehend from the
dark center of the ball there emerged downwards something resembling a
hosepipe which bent itself back and upwards like a u and then wried about
sideways several times in the bend nearest to the ball there appeared a
gleam like a brightly glowing hot iron the hose pipe started wriggling about
like a worm extended itself and went down to the ground I am convinced that
it reached the water so as he watched this weird hose
pipe seemed to suck up the water and in fact you could now see the central part
of this sphere become milky and as he says it looked like quote water before
it boils at the same time the outer shell of the object emitted a bluish tinge he
says kind of like ionized air around electrical high tension wires and as Max says in his own words
then the strange object slowly started its rotating gliding movement again
passed across the road quite close to me to a point a pace or so across the field
and there it vanished so absolutely silently and at such lightning speed
straight upwards into the sky that I was unable to follow it with my eyes now he saw for quite a while this
device had kept pace with him for about 450 ft with a distance from him of about
20 ft though at its closest approach he says it was only 6 feet away
and he's convinced that the purpose of this device was to collect water from the stream beside the road and the whole
encounter left him absolutely dumbfounded he was physically okay just
astonished and as a professional electrician with more than 40 years experience he was very familiar with
technology especially engines but this was very clearly extremely advanced in
fact he returned to the spot the next day to take photographs and look for any
evidence unfortunately he found no evidence he did tell his wife who dismissed his story but Max felt it was
important enough to talk about and later decided to share it with researcher Hubert
maler and as Max says if the affair ever becomes known here locally I suppose it
will be all up with my reputation I assure you that that I have told the
truth in every respect so yeah a single witness case but the witness swears up
and down that this did happen and I find it really interesting because there are
so many cases where UFOs are collecting water and that appears to be what this
UFO was doing it's also an interesting animal reaction case and that it
affected that murder of crows uh so yeah ruy fascinating case
and here's another one which is fairly standard when it comes to Uso UFO water
accounts but I certainly think it's an interesting case multiple
Witnesses quite a large craft with this enormous beam of light I call this one
UFO display over choya Bay November 5th
1971 this was in choya Bay Mexico and it's a interesting case
because it is multiple Witnesses who are of high credibility and it's just unusual UFO
Behavior it was a calm day on November 5 1971 as Albert for Miller a 70-year-old
retired Chicago police officer and his wife Alice who at that time lived in
Phoenix Arizona they decided to spend the day down in choya Bay Mexico where they were
fishing for black sea bass Unfortunately they didn't catch any fish but around
900 p.m. that evening Albert decided to go down to the beach to take a walk and
suddenly he says the ground and part of the ocean around him quote lit up like
daylight and looking up he saw a rounded saucer-shaped object coming towards him
suddenly it stopped he says only about about 2 to 300 ft above the water and
just hovered there it then sent down a huge cone of light onto the surface of
the ocean now Albert was standing only about 25 ft from the water's edge and
says that the light from this object extended about a half mile across almost
up to the Shoreline the craft itself was gray white oval-shaped with a dark colored
tube on the bottom about 14 in he estimates in diameter he
said light was coming from a tube-shaped protrusion on the bottom of the
craft and as he watched this light beam narrowed to about a quarter mile now
when he first saw this thing Albert thought it might be a helicopter but he heard no sound so he discarded that
explanation and then after a few minutes he says a cloud kind of began to form
around the object and began to Billow around it after about 5 minutes the UFO
retracted the beam of light it sent another similar cone of light upwards
Illuminating the clouds around it it then made 180° turn and began to move to
the West Albert watched it for a total of about 20 minutes and could then see that
this object was actually glowing giving off a green light before it fin finally moved
off so the next day Albert started asking other people in the area if they
had seen anything strange and he found a security guard who said that yes he had
just entered the bay and saw a strange light in the air which moved to the West
casting a green light in the clouds around it just as Albert had reported so later investigators looked
into this and located another group of Witnesses in including Norman Norris a
Phoenix police officer who was in the area with Grady Hendrick his brother-in-law and Grady's wife Norman's
sister the three of them were about 12 12 miles Northeast of Pelican Point and
were driving to choya Bay when they saw what apparently the same object but they
did describe it as white oval shaped with a dark colored rim around the
center AO the are phenomena research organization was looking into this and
they said that there were also additional Witnesses but there is no other information on their
testimonies but Albert told investigators that he would quote swear on a stack of Bibles against any
government official who say that there are no UFOs and he says quote I saw what
I saw very hard to say what was going on in that case I mean the UFO could have
been shining down that beam of light on the water for a number of different reasons it is technically not a Uso case
in that the craft actually touched the water but given that it was so close to
the water and interacting with the water I think it's fair to include it in this
little collection here now here is another case one of my favorite in this little Bunch because it
does involve what appear to be humanoids it's quite an extensive case I call this
one more dead than alive this case has a lot of interesting facets to it because
it is quite extensive it involves a night Watchman whose job it is to look for anything
unusual going on and he did see something really unusual it's a really
good example of how profoundly a person can be emotionally affected by a UFO
encounter this one occurred in July of 1973 over to Tomo comai
Japan and as you'll see it's an incredible Uso encounter the witness in
this case prefers anonymity and is known only as masaki he was 20 years old
school was out for the summer so he was working as a night Watchman for a lumber
yard in an isolated area of Tomo Kai he was sitting in his car one night in July
of 1973 just watching the area looking up at the night sky and this is when he saw
a quote streak of light fly across the sky and disappear and he automatically assumed
this was a shooting star until this light reappeared and suddenly grew in
size and began hovering and pulsating and looking at it he knew
instantly that this this was a UFO and as he says in his own
words I felt as if my head would explode and then felt my hair stand on end but
after an instant of extreme surprise although I was aware that I was still
afraid I was making frantic efforts to follow the movement of the UFO the light
moved to and fro in all directions within the limit of one meter visually
suddenly it began to descend with a spiral motion and having come down to an
altitude just above the Dome of a cement factory which was visible in the far
distance it began to send out intermittent green light rays in every
direction as the scene was too science fiction like I wished what I had been
observing would prove to be a dream or my imagination but in spite of such
wishing the UFO did not stop its action and in fact at this point the
object came down over the Waters of the bay moving very quickly in a long
sweeping Arc and masaki could now see that this object was now much closer to
him than he had originally thought he says it dropped down about 60 ft above
the water and stopped it was now a brilliant orange and lit up the
surrounding area and then as masaki says in his own words then from the underside of The
Light Came what appeared to be a glass-like transparent tube and when the
front edge of that tube touched the surface of the water that part of the tube began to glow and appeared to be
sucking up the Bay Water accompanying the elongation of the tube I heard a
faint sound just like the sound of a cicada but the sound was not so
monotonous and appeared to be lower in Pitch after dropping my head down for some
minutes having been affected by the scene in such a way I looked up again
and saw that the light had finished its sucking action and was maintaining its
position in the same place so here we have another UFO taking
water after a few moments the light began to move and masaki realized it was
heading right towards him and in seconds it was about 50 ft directly over his
head at this point it diminished in brightness and now appeared to be a
white solid object not just a light as masaki says I was frightened and felt
more dead than alive the feeling I was assaulted by at that moment was that I
would be attacked and killed by that object then I saw a row of what looked
like small Windows around the center of the object which was round and in one of
the central ones I saw one and in another just two windows to the right I
saw two Eerie shadow likee figures which were too small and deformed to be called
the shadows of men so at this point masaki was overcome
with fear and rested his head on the steering wheel groaning out loud in
sheer Terror he said he looked back up and he now saw three or four additional
glowing spherical-shaped objects and a large dark dark brown cylindrical craft all
hovering in perfect silence and very quickly as he watched the four glowing
spheres entered into the cylindrical object which shot off to the north at
Fantastic speed and masaki's had a physical reaction to all this as he says I began
to feel my whole body go numb just just as after we sit for a long time for a
yogi practice it was then that I perceived that my radio was emitting
meaningless sounds and at the same time I felt my head aching I could not relax
after this terrifying experience and was anxious to be replaced by the other man
at dawn so there you go I think that case just goes to show how you never
know how you're going to react if you have a close-up encounter with a UFO I'd
like to think I wouldn't react in fear but I can understand if some people do I
think this is partly because of this vicious brutal worldwide coverup where
this subject is shrouded in fear and confusion and disinformation and it's
really such a shame because I think a good objective look at these cases shows that we have nothing to fear from these
guys they're an agend they're agend agenda is not nefarious this is my
opinion based on the firsthand cases so you can make up your own mind about it
uh okay moving along and here is a really fascinating case I like this case
it was thoroughly investigated it was quite widely viewed it occurred in a
very unusual location I call this Uso at
ptiu Island and this occurred in the 1970s we don't know the exact date but
it was in Papa New Guinea there have been some really interesting encounters
coming out of this area but this is a tiny itty bitty little island and this
Uso encounter is really unusual this case comes from Carl Fain author of UFOs
and water he is perhaps the leading Authority on Usos
and the witness to this case is a friend of his sisters she worked as a
missionary for about 28 years and it was one evening in the 1970s she doesn't
know the exact date while she was staying on this tiny island called pilu
that she and the local residents had a really remarkable Uso
encounter again this is a tiny Island located nearly on the equator
it's only about 3 miles long less than a half mile wide it played a vital role in
World War II it had an air strip but back in the 1970s it was occupied by
only a few hundred people and it was again one evening in the 1970s during a
full moon the witness was sitting on the beach at the North End of the island
when the people on the West End began shouting and as the witness says so
everybody came running look look look and there about
three meters high not very high we saw this blimp
flying it had white light and then it had some red and green and when we saw it first it was
flying in sort of a bizarre way it was weaving back and forth and all of a
sudden it straightened out and of course the crowds gathered more and more people
look look then it went down the island it turned at the Eastern end and it
landed in the water which was all Reef it wasn't very deep according to the witness this craft
did have Windows it had what looked like red lights above each window and green
lights below and it was very close close enough that they could all see that this object had no wings no antenna no
baskets or couple copas uh no engines of any kind it
resembled a blimp only in shape also the surface of it was completely smooth the
size was difficult to determine but it didn't look that big the wind witness estimates it was about the size of a
compact car maybe about 4.5 ft High 10 ft long the witness at that time had
never heard of UFOs and it was some years later that she finally concluded that what they had seen was in fact a
UFO and as she says in her own words when it landed in the water the men
pulled their canoes into the water to go to rescue anyone who needed it but when
they got there there was absolutely no Trace whatsoever and this was strange she knew
this area well they all did and even at high tide which it was the water there
was only about 10 ft deep Carl F says of this case I feel
confident that the event as related to me is true in as much as the witness is
devoutly religious and has not sought publicity for herself I like that case
because it was investigated by Carl F who's really the go-to guy when it comes
to UFO water cases it's such a shame he's passed on because he was doing
really important work in this aspect of you phology and it's such a fascinating case
with this UFO Uso going into such shallow water really interesting I
always wonder what these ETS are thinking about when they're doing their things it's one of the reasons I like
doing this research is trying to figure out what's going on inside these craft and what these ETS are up to and here is
another fascinating Uso encounter which I call fishing for
UFOs and while this is a single witness encounter by all accounts the witness is
absolutely honest and sincere it was thoroughly investigated by a very professional and prominent researcher it
occurred on July 15 1981 in Newberry South Carolina and it
was pretty widely reported at the time but I'd be surprised if you've heard of
this before let really closeup sighting this next case was investigated by muan
member John shler who had actually later become the head of muan the mutual UFO
Network it was a beautiful day in Newberry South Carolina and 14-year-old
Carl E Moore and his friends were fishing at Lake at a lake in Newberry
South Carolina Unfortunately they only caught a few fish evening arrived and and they
all decided to go rest on their CS some distance away from the lake however
around 10:30 p.m. Carl decided he would go down to the boat ramp and check on
his Trot lines and instead he saw something else that left him quote quite
Disturbed looking up he saw a 30 foot long silvery white cigar-shaped object
traveling slowly above the water only about 20 maybe 25 miles hour he saw that
this craft had no windows or doors but it was covered with small whitish blue
lights which flickered back and forth all across the surface and as he watched
The Craft maneuvered to avoid the trees surrounding the lake then stopped and
slowly settled down on the surface of the water at this point it was no more
than 50 ft away from him him and as this craft touched the water a cloud of steam
rose up around it it remained there for about 3 minutes then Rose slightly and
hovered about 1 foot above the surface so this sounds like this craft
was trying to cool off hard to say for sure but clearly it was hot because
steam rose up when it touched the water Carl was very excited to see this he
could see it was very unusual ual but he managed to as he say says keep his cool
and he observed it carefully suddenly it shot upwards instantly accelerating to
250 mph he estimates and disappeared Skyward Carl said only it moved quote
fast at first he told nobody because he didn't think his friends who were asleep at the time would believe him but when
he later heard about a UFO study group he felt compelled to make a report I
think you'll agree that's a very interesting case and yes quite brief there isn't a whole lot to it but
something I find super interesting is that it does appear that this craft came to the lake to cool down again I'm
speculating it could have been sucking up water I don't know for sure but it's certainly a fascinating case another
interesting takeaway for me was that the witness very nearly did report it makes
me wonder if anyone else saw it and just didn't report report it and how many
other cases go completely unrecorded as we know the vast majority
go unrecorded again such a shame and I think we can directly blame our own
governments our own military-industrial complex for basically spending an
enormous amount of time money and effort to ridicule UFO Witnesses and cover up
UFO information thankfully times are changing and the truth is coming out and
here is another case which I call follow that
UFO this also comes from Canada it occurred in August
1981 near Hamilton right in Ontario on the shores
of Ontario Lake uh again in Canada it's a super interesting case that's quite
lengthy and a really unusual type of behavior
from this UFO that went into Lake
Ontario this very interesting case also comes from water UFO expert Carl Fain
and it involves five witnesses three men and a woman who are driving east of
Hamilton and south of Lake Ontario early one August evening in
1981 the main witness interviewed by Carl F is one of the woman and she's
requested anonymity she said it was around 5 or 600 p.m. still light outside when
someone in the car shouted out oh my God look at that over there and as the
witness says clear as day the five of us saw a bright red saucer with a dome and
yellow lights radiating from the bottom part of The Craft the radio in the vehicle became static
there were many comments regarding where it was going and then someone mentioned follow that
UFO all were in agreement so according to the witness
this object was fairly large she estimates about 50 to 60 feet in diameter maybe 10 to 15 feet in height
but she said it was hard to estimate because they weren't quite sure how big it was or how far away it was but they
saw very clearly that this object was descending slowly towards Hamilton Bay
and they followed it in their car and they were at high enough elevation to clearly see this object approaching the
water as the witness says the craft was sighted to the right of us moving in and
towards our Direction and then crossed our path moving left just ahead of us
and then proceeded to slow down just above the Bay Harbor and then appeared to just level itself down into the water
ever so gently and totally submerge the yellow lights of the craft
appeared to settle into more of a pale yellow to white lights and then seemed to dull out there were more excited
comments of oh my God it just went into the water all of us were wide eyed and I
think in a form of shock so at this point they quickly drove down to the spot where they had
seen this craft go into the water and they sat in their car waiting and
watching to see if anything would else would happen they did notice small waves
and wondered whether or not the craft had caused them though they couldn't be sure but they remained in that area for
a number of hours very patiently waiting for this craft hopefully to emerge and
it was about 1 a.m. their patience was rewarded when they saw not one but two
metallic submarine looking craft which were situated on either side of where
this original craft had submerged now one of these objects looked kind of squarish and the other
had what looked to them kind of like a periscope but none of the Witnesses were familiar enough with submarines to
identify what they were seeing as a submarine or possibly a
Uso as the witness says in her own words one was on one end of the water and
another across from it if the craft was still parked where it went down then it
would have been sandwiched between the two subs of course conversation and
excitement regarding this element was this a part of the craft or were these
objects actual Subs these objects stayed there unmoving all the while we were there so they
watched for another hour and the these two Sue objects never moved and finally
all of them just became too tired and they left now while the US Navy does operate
Subs in the Great Lakes it's not likely that these were Subs as the craft
submerged very close to the shore and that's where these subs or these objects
were seen and it's quite shallow there also these objects never moved which is
certainly unusual though not impossible ultimately it remains a mystery Carl F
who again spoke with the witness says and I quote I believe that she had
witnessed a UFO event it's too bad as the witnesses didn't stay a little
longer to see how that whole incident ended but you can't blame them they were
there for hours watching this thing I wonder about the two other craft were
they submarine or were they ET very hard to say the
Great Lakes have an enormous amount of Uso activity I'm surprised there isn't
more books written about it because the activity going on you know the activity going on there
is off the chart I mean there is a lot of it all right and now we get to the very
last case of this Bunch which I call this was real
scary and this is another example of how people can have a very strong emotional
reaction uh tending towards fear to what is apparently just a simple type of
sighting maybe not simple actually because this one involved a fleet of
Usos quite a big number of them it occurred in April of
1988 in a very populated area actually Mercy estuary off the coast of sea forth
in England this is not far from Liverpool and yeah very uh very well
populated area though it did occur quite late so there may be more witnesses
there might not be but it is a multiple witness encounter and it's super
interesting the witness in this case goes by David that's a pseudonym it's not his real name
but David often enjoyed fishing with his two sons aged 13 and 10 and one of their
favorite spots was at the mouth of the river Mercy in the Estuary off sea forth
near Liverpool and this was something they did most weekends one evening
around midnight again in late April 1988 they and a group of a half dozen
other fishermen were by a lighthouse in the middle of the estuary when a
veritable Fleet of UFOs appeared there were they estimate about
five of them and they appeared one after the other one appeared and swooped down
into the water and followed by another and another these objects were sort of
bow-shaped kind of like a banana they estimate about 20 ft in diameter and
deep orange in color the entire display lasted about 5 minutes each of these SE
objects submerging into the water all the witnesses were shocked and
scared they wondered what they were looking at could this be a secret government craft or something much more
strange and exotic and as the main witness says they
stayed the same shape everybody was very shaken and frightened Carl his
10-year-old son was shaking and crying and insisted on coming home we had
planned on staying hours it was scary I have never believed in flying saucers
before but this was real scary after some time the Witnesses were
shocked to watch all the objects now emerge from the water again in the same
way they had arrived one after another heading out to sea in the direction
towards Ireland now the witness did report his sighting to the Liverpool Echo newspaper
who showed no interest in it though later the account was published in another newspaper and then in the
northern UFO news edited by Jenny Randall poor 10-year-old Carl was so
traumatized by the sighting that even 2 months later he refused to go back to
the area but the main witness insists that they saw something very strange as
he says if it was a windup I'd tell you but it was genuine honest there you go
another example of UFOs going into the water Usos unidentified submersible
objects I suspect our oceans lakes and rivers are quite busy with these objects
because it is a perfect place for them to do what they do without being
bothered or observed by outside Witnesses and I do know of cases
involving not just one or two objects or even 10 or 20 but many it would be
fascinating to know just how much activity is going on underwater but that's one of the reasons
why I think Usos are enjoying a lot more interest in fact I did write a whole
book about Usos I call it undersea ufob base it's
an in-depth investigation into Uso activity off the Santa Catalina Channel
and while I didn't cover any cases from there in this episode I have done so previously because this that is one of
the busiest Uso locations on the planet but I wanted to do these cases here
because it shows again how this is a worldwide phenomena and it should come
as no surprise that there are so many Uso accounts because let's face it the majority of our planet is covered in
water so that's the show for today I hope you've learned something something and found these cases interesting I
really want to thank you for watching it's truly appreciated this is such an important subject it's time the cover up
ends and the world knows about the reality of the Extraterrestrial presence
on our planet it's undeniable in my opinion there's far too many cases and
far much evidence so until next time keep searching for
answers keep asking those hard questions and most important of all keep having fun.
