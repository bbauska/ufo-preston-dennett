UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE EIGHT
Jan 31, 2025

Summary:
Jan 31, 2025
UFOs are being seen all over this planet. To prove this fact, I put out a challenge: name any town or city, and I will find an encounter there. And I have! I have explored almost 100 towns and cities and every one of them has a history of UFO encounters. Not just sightings, but landings, face-to-face meetings with humanoids, onboard encounters and even UFO crashes. In this latest episode, we explore eight new places including, Albion, MI; Austin, TX; Leesville, LA; Whittier, CA; Huntsville, AL; Elkton, MD; Seoul, South Korea and finally, Oshkosh, WI. These cases reach back decades and have lots of evidence: photos, radar-returns, landing traces, animal reactions, medical effects, and even metal fragments. We are not alone!

ALBION, MICHIGAN. In 1967, Charles W. Smith encountered a UFO which told him telepathically to talk to his priest. Two sightings later, Charles told his priest who turned out to have a close UFO connection himself. Later, Charles encountered a landed UFO with humanoids. In 1973, numerous police in Albion reported UFOs. In 1980, the Shive family described their harrowing encounter with a UFO that stalled their van on a lonely road at night. Even as late as 2007 UFOs continued to visit Albion.

AUSTIN, TEXAS. This large city has a rich UFO history. In 1950, three men saw a craft hover over downtown. In 1971, a craft landed in a lady’s front-yard and out stepped three humanoids. In 1974, Ray Stanford and his team captured an amazing long-exposure photo. In 1977, Ray had his own daylight sighting. In 1988, three men came upon a landed disc and humanoids; they all had missing time. More incredible encounters occurred throughout the 2000s, including UFOs captured on videotape.

LEESVILLE, LOUISIANA. On April 12, 1960, a UFO was seen and heard by dozens of people as it moved overhead and exploded into the ground before flying off. It left behind landing traces and metal fragments. Project Blue Book wrote an 80-page report on the case which remains unsolved. In 1975, a mother and her son had a very close-up encounter with a disc-shaped craft. In 1996, UFOs over the town generated numerous calls to radio stations and newspapers reporting strange lights over the town.

WHITTIER, CALIFORNIA. In 1957, people across Whittier saw up to six saucer-shaped craft hovering and maneuvering overhead. In 1966, a car was chased for many miles by a craft. In 1967, two men had a close-up sighting of a metallic craft with portholes hovering over their front yard. On the night of March 23, 1977 when dozens of police and military officers sighted UFOs over a wide area for nine hours! In 1978, a lady saw a craft over the freeway.

HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA. In 1950, two men saw a metallic craft over the city. Two sightings occurred in 1952, both with many witnesses. In 1975, a man followed a UFO in his car into the woods and had two hours of missing time. In 1981, a woman had had an onboard experience involving a strange humanoid. That same year, another man reported his encounter with a giant craft. In 1988, a craft rose out of Gunterville Lake. It followed them home. In 2023, a witness captured photo of UFOs over the city.

ELKTON, MARYLAND. In 1971, a family and other witnesses encountered two UFOs while driving into Elkton. In 1988, a family driving into Elkton were followed by a UFO and had three hours of missing time. In 1993, two boaters on the Elk River had a bizarre encounter with a USO. That same year, a man had a scary encounter that resulted in hours of missing time. In 1994, a witness had a scary encounter with a saucer hovering over a field. And in 2012, an Elkton man reported a missing time encounter.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. So many cases! In 1970, seven military officers and many residents saw a silver disc move overhead. In 1951, fighter pilots observed green spheres which were also caught on radar. Sightings occurred throughout the 1950s, some of which were also caught on radar. In 1979, a soldier stationed at Kunsan Airbase says a humanoid entered his barracks. In 1981 and 1982 there were two sightings of a cone-shaped UFO.  From 1995-2012, three cases occurred, all involving photos!

OSHKOSH, WISCONSIN. Way back in 1886, at midday, a darkness settled over Oshkosh causing a city-wide panic. In 1947, three witnesses came upon a hovering craft with humanoids looking out the window. In 1956, a group of children had two sightings of UFOs on one day. In 1979, many people called the police reporting a red UFO which apparently crashed into the ground. In 2012, people over a wide area reported strange lights in the sky. In 2022, a UFO was captured on photograph over the suburbs.

So many cases involving close encounters of the first, second and third kind. Too many cases to deny or explain away. The only alternative is that these cases are true; we are being visited by extraterrestrials. It doesn’t matter where you live on Earth, UFOs have been there!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal
today I'm going to be continuing my ongoing series about UFOs in your
hometown this episode is called UFOs in your hometown episode 8 and if you've
seen previous episodes you know that this series stems from a challenge that I put out quite some time ago name any
Town any City any location on this planet and I bet you I can find a UFO
encounter there I'm still doing real well you guys have definitely put out some locations that are quite difficult
to find cases in but I'm still doing pretty much 100% there's a few that have
stumped me but I'm not giving up on those I'm going to continue to dig to see if I can find cases there but I am
presenting eight new locations that were provided by you guys the viewers so
thank you for that pretty excited about it I always learn something new when I do research for
this series and definitely I found some interesting cases that I've never heard
before and I'm pretty sure you haven't too these do of course include cases of
all kinds not just sightings which are interesting but definitely cases involving Close Encounters of the second
kind that affect the environment Landings face- Toof face encounters with
humanoids on board cases and even in this episode actually some very rare
cases of what appear to be UFO crashes so that's certainly interesting what's
also interesting is that these cases do include a wide variety of evidence so we
see cases involving Landing traces and physiological effects electromagnetic
disturbances U much more than that too I mean there's quite a few photographic cases that's always interesting and even
some radar return cases so this is not just relying on eyewitness testimony but
has actual evidence to support it so the eight locations I am covering today are
from Mostly the United States but I always like to go outside of the US in these episodes and I do in this one but
the eight locations are albian Miss Michigan after that is Austin Texas then
there's leeville Louisiana whiter California Huntsville Alabama Elton
Maryland soul in South Korea and finally Oshkosh
Wisconsin all of these cases do have an interesting history of UFO encounters as
we shall see so let's get started with our first location which is albian
Michigan this was requested by nordland so thank you nordland found some really
interesting cases here this is a pretty small town of about 7700 people located
in South Central Michigan Michigan does have a lot of UFO cases so I'm not
surprised to find some even in this small town didn't find a whole lot about four or five but one is a really amazing
aming incident um I mean involving Landings and humanoids telepathic
communication even more than that it's quite an extensive case so I think you'll find it quite interesting the
first albon case I could find was researched by mufon's then Chief field
investigator a man by the name of Dan Wright and I have to say this is also
one of the strangest cases I could find in albian it involves sightings Landing
humanoids and more and quite a few Witnesses it began one evening in August
of 1967 the main witness is Charles William quote Bill Smith he's a 35-year-old
butcher he was driving his pickup along a remote Road near albian when suddenly
his engine mysteriously stalled looking up he saw a large domed saucer hovering
overhead Charles said he then received a telepathic message instructing him to
contact his priest a man by the name of Father Gerald Boer just a few minutes
later he arrived home he was in his front yard with his wife Marge when they
both saw two 15t wide fiery orange red spheres moving over their Barn this is
just 250 ft away from them so quite close up these glowing spheres mooved
directly over the house and into the woods about 900 ft away and quote winked
out now at this point Bill did not follow the UFO's telepathic instructions
to talk to his priest but then on November 24
1967 bill and his wife Marge saw another smaller red orange Fireball type object
move directly over their home and then accelerate off into the distance and out of sight so after this bill decided to
tell his priest and when he did he got an incredible shock father Gerald Boer
not only believed him but said that he himself was actually an
ET he said he would come to Bill's home to watch for a return visit from the
UFOs so that's quite a shocking Revelation but father Gerald Boer was
apparently completely serious about this and then on March 14 196 8 bill and his
wife Marge father Boer and eight other Witnesses including four nuns were
shocked when three fiery objects showed up and approached Bill's house the four
nuns seeing this object fled in fear but the others remained and watched this object until it moved away until these
three objects moved away and that was not the end of it because 2 months later
on May 7 1968 Bill and father Boer and another witness saw what they described as a fat
glowing orange cylinder-shaped object move overhead it began to eject several
smaller glowing disc-shaped craft which they estimated were each about the size of a small car and it was later that
night when events came to a climax bill was outside his home when one of these
small discs reappeared and then proceeded to land in the field by his house and per Bill several 4 and 1/2t
Tall humanoids dressed in silver suits came down a ramp from the craft and
spoke directly with Bill asking him to quote go for a ride Bill had quite a bit
of fear and refused but they told him that they would later have messages for
him to tell father Boer and they left not long after this that same night
night a helicopter landed in the same field Bill asked what they were doing there on his property and he was told to
quote get out shortly later a plain cloth man who identified himself as
major Holmes knocked on Bill's door and proceeded to ask Bill all about his UFO
encounters but Bill wasn't having it he refused to talk to this guy over the
next few months UFOs continued to plague the Smith residents and dozens of
relatives friends neighbors were regularly spotting glowing spheres
flying over the house it happened so often Bill began to keep a diary of all
these events and researcher Dan Wright calls this case one of his quote best
ever and he said that after he completed an investigation he had plans to write a
book about it unfortunately this apparently never happened but it
certainly sounds like an amazing series of events and not the only one to occur in
albian because it was about 6 years later August 28
1973 that numerous people in albian and the surrounding areas reported unusual
activity in the night sky some called the police and it turned out that at least seven police officers themselves
became Witnesses the activity began around 1 a.m. when a team teenage couple
saw a light that they said was much brighter than any star in the sky and
they could see that this light was hovering then gaining altitude occasionally darting around it would
flicker flash fade and reappear at one point one of the witnesses flashed his
flashlight at the object and he said it blinked back at him in response so after an hour and a half of
watching this they called the police two deputies arrived on the scene and they saw this UFO too they described it as
similar to a quote super brilliant search light and they watched it with
this young couple for about a half an hour the subject was still in the sky when the officers left they told the
witnesses to call if there was any change because this object that point was just hovering there in the sky and
there was change 1 hour and 15 minutes later at 3:45 a.m. this object darted
dramatically the young couple called the police again at this point these two officers were at
26 mil Road and the I94 you can see it here and they looked up and saw this
object they could see that it had red and blue lights was accelerating rapidly
up and down and back and forth in what they called quote silly Maneuvers so
they quickly radioed other police in the areas and three other deputies in three
separate locations also saw this object which remained in the sky for at least 10 more minutes
darting its super high speeds stopping and finally moving away the next really
significant albian case I could find occurred about 7 years later on October 19 1980 this is a close encounter of the
second kind and it received considerable press attention Donald shive and his
wife Mary Star were driving with their two children Renee h 5 and Scott H4 near
B Drive South and this is when Donald noticed a strange light in the sky and
he pointed it out to his wife now he had seen UFOs while out driving late at
night in the area many times before but his wife never took him really seriously
she wasn't sure if she believed him or in UFOs but seeing this object she
immediately changed her mind as she says it was almost like it was florescent a
white fluorescent light this thing just hung in the sky and then to Donald and Mary star's shock this object moved
right over their 1972 Ford van they can now see it was oval or maybe diamond
shaped had two white lights on the sides a red and blue light on the front and
back and as Mary Star says as it went over all the power stopped in the van my
husband and I rolled down our windows and stuck our heads out to see if there was a sound but there was no sound so it
was obvious to them at this point that this wasn't anything normal they weren't really sure how big it was as Mary Star
said it had to be very large I never really believed in UFOs until last night
she told reporters the next day now I'm a Believer so the UFO moved off they
immediately started their van without any problem and it turned out the next
day more than 100 people in surrounding areas flooded local police and radio stations with calls reporting UFOs a
final case in albian occurred on the night of August 10 2007 a couple had
just stepped outside to watch the leonids a meteor shower when they noticed a group of dim lights moving in
the Eastern Sky very low just above Treetop level these were clearly not
meteors the wife shouted out what is that and her husband thought briefly that
this might be a flock of geese he immediately decided no as he says I
immediately dismissed this notion it looked like dim lights moving across the sky so these objects were close enough
that they should have been able to hear it but there was only silence it was a very brief sighting about 15 seconds but
as they watched him they could see that these lights were actually attached to some kind of Sol ID object because it
was blocking out the Stars it really affected them quite profoundly as the witness says I was a little worried
excited and puzzled so that's just a brief overview of the cases in albian
Michigan I mean there are a few others that I didn't cover which are mostly anomal lights or cases that are just so
brief in detail that it wasn't really worth recounting this should only be
considered a cross section of the actual number of cases um there are many more
that were reported and far more than that that I'm sure were not reported because most people don't report their
UFO encounters to places like newfork or muon or other UFO Reporting services or
the police or the Air Force or what have you so yeah just an example of the huge
number of cases that are likely taking place in albian so thanks nordland that was pretty interesting now let's move to
the next location which is quite a large city Austin Texas this was actually
requested by two of you guys illustrious treasure and Jack Parsons so thank you
for suggesting this location pretty interesting this is a quite large city
nearly a million people lots of cases I did find mostly cases involving
anomalous lights but a few that were definitely more interesting than that of
course a few cases involving humanoids as well which to me is the most
interesting of all so hope you enjoy it as reported by the Associated Press the
first significant case in Austin Texas that I could find occurred on March 30
1950 when three men observed a quote kind of flat silver object suspended in
the air this was directly over the intersection of 34th Street and Lamar Boulevard you can see that location here
the first witness to see this object was Sam Roper he worked as a design engineer
for the state highway department and he turned to his two friends Jean Ravel
who's president of the junior Chamber of Commerce and John marshling who was then
the Austin representative of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing company so these are good Witnesses Sam
roer turned to them and said say do you see what I see Gene Rell says he looked
up and saw this object which he said looked silver flatten shape with no wings was hovering in the air as if it
was suspended and the three men just watched it for a few seconds when as Jean says it stayed there 3 or 4 seconds
and then disappeared to the Northeast this next case is quite bizarre but apparently a serious report involving a
landed craft and humanoids which comes from Trudy van rer she shared her story
in the December 1972 issue of Fate magazine according to Trudy she says
that on the night of November 4 1971 she was woken up by her cats who
were quote growling and carrying on so this is a typical animal reaction case
she opened the door and her cats did not go outside they immediately ran and hid under the living room couch looking out
the window she saw a bright light Illuminating the backyard and the field Beyond going to the front door to see
what was causing it she was shocked to see a small strange craft sitting on her
lawn she said it was shaped very much like a Volkswagen bug but no fenders no
doors nothing like this just a sort of silvery craft and as she watched she
says three small men dressed in dark jumpsuits came out of the top and one of
the figures spoke to her t apically saying according to Trudy are there any
pigs in that field they are hungry now per Trudy standing next to these three
humanoids were two quote peculiar animals who had fuzzy hair all over their bodies standing erect not normal
animals and apparently this is what the humanoids were referencing so Trudy as you can imagine
was a little freaked out rushed back into her house closed the door looked out the windows and saw this craft
flying away and per her letter to fate magazine she later learned that a nearby
Farm was missing several of their pigs so I don't know that's a strange case
here's another really interesting case involving seven Witnesses this occurred
on October 2nd 1974 researcher Ray Stanford a scientist
had recently formed project Starlight International in Austin in hopes of
capturing photographic evidence it was at 8:55 p.m. again on October 2nd
1974 that a glowing yellow white object was seen passing overhead and at one
point making two sharp angular turns it moved very quickly but this team of
seven Witnesses had a camera ready stabilized on a heavyduty tripod and
were able to capture a long exposure photograph as this object moved across
the sky they recorded it on Trix film with a 300 mm telephonic lens using 35
mm film the exposure was 10 seconds long but the image showing this object was
only about 2 to 4 seconds and it was again during this time that this object made two apparent 90° turns according to
Ray Stanford after analyzing all of this he estimates theze object was moving at
about 15,000 to 25,000 mph and was at
about 90 to 100 miles altitude this is again an estimation but as Ray Stanford
says the photo demonstrates that UFOs are not so Elusive and as difficult to
get data on as some people have imagined the fact that such objects whatever
their origin can make 90° turns at high speeds should cause scientists worldwide
to at least probe the aspects technological and physical of such
objects and events now it would be 8 years later at 4:31 p.m. on November 10
1977 that Ray Stanford would have a much closer and more bizarre encounter he was
walking his dog near his Austin home when he saw what he describes as a metallic gray object stationary in the
sky he said it appeared to be wobbling or vibrating and as Ray says for maybe
10 seconds the object remained as was a profile of something that looked more
flat than round and remarkably like a vertical cross-section of an overweight
Coke bottle as you can see from his drawings per array this object then disappeared leaving behind a strange
vaporous spot in the Clear Blue Sky he immediately rushed home and quickly made
these drawings and notes of his observation he calls it quote a freak sighting which
as he says quote is almost embarrassing to report this next very strange case
and I'm not sure this was actually investigated or if it's just a simple report it comes from Ebe online was
reported by Albert Rosales in his book humanoids and this involves two
witnesses who had decided to tour the Austin area following a powerful storm
and Report T tornado on June 18
1998 the two witnesses were driving along an isolated Road when they s they
saw a landed saucer in a field so they got out of their car and approached this
object and were immediately confronted they said by two humanoids who began to
inquire about the storm asking them about this funnel cloud so the two
witnesses explained about tornadoes and according to them their
next memory was waking up they were lying down in the field and watching this object shoot away at high speed so
this looks like a missing time encounter unfortunately there is no further information or verification on this case
but here is another really interesting case this one occurred on June 30th 2000
and comes from Craig and Carol cill with 8:30 p.m. still daylight when they saw a
bright white object flying at about 4 to 5,000 ft altitude they estimate it was
reflecting in the sun per Carol it looked like quote a large white
cylindrical object with a very distinct round flat rear end so they watched it
move silently across the sky for about 30 seconds and by chance or not it
entered the only Cloud that was in the sky and disappeared inside it but as Carol says the two areas in which my
husband and I disagree are the angle at which the object flew he says at a tilt
and I say parallel to land and what the front of the craft might have looked like my husband believes the front was
flat and I just couldn't tell because the object appeared suddenly and the front end was past our point of
determination four years later another encounter September 18 2004 an amateur
astronomer noticed a glowing object hovering very low he estimates 500 maybe
1,000 ft overhead and as it moved he saw that this was not just a light but
looked actually triangular in shape it was hard to see he said its color was
very nearly the same as the sky almost like it was cloaking itself but he said
it was hovering directly over the bich middle school which is located at William Cannon and South First Street
and remained hovering there for a full 5 minutes then suddenly accelerated at an
estimated 500 mph or faster coming directly over his house almost as if
targeting him and as it did so he noted that it was making no noise but he did
notice something else as he says strangely the air became thick and humid
and there was a barely detectable electrical smell and a final Austin case
occurred on the evening of October 29 20 08 when two men Carl Lancaster and Doug
muli were outside their apartment and noticed an object with red and white
lights zigzagging across the sky as Carl says it was just incredible and just
unexplainable the lights flew on top of each other and then side by side it was a UFO ET probably now they had a camera
ready and videotaped it and as Doug says we you got proof it's great to finally
capture something on video now they did allow this video to be analyzed by torald hessle the director of Austin's
Planetarium and he was skeptical of UFOs but could not explain it he at first
tried to explain it as a shooting star but said no this does not explain how it
had colored lights or zigzag movement said it was not a plane or helicopter was very unlikely that that was the
explanation and ultimately he said that he had quote no idea what it is so there you go
illustrious treasure and Jack Parsons that's an overview of the UFO activity in Austin Texas again just a
representative sample quite a few cases involving anomalous lights Austin's a
huge place there I could have done quite a bit more on Austin but those to me
were the most interesting ones the ones that had something to off offer in terms
of our understanding of the UFO phenomenon so now let's move to the next
location which is a tiny little town leeville Louisiana this was requested by Trent
Rush thanks for requesting this it's always interesting to explore these new
locations and see if I can find some encounters there and I did I found three
one is actually not directly in leeville but close enough that I decided to
include it because it's so darn interesting involving an apparent UFO crash actually but I did find a couple
of others which proves my point once again that UFOs are being seen
everywhere including in leeville which a as I said a small town 5,000 6,000
people but has produced some amazing UFO reports this first case is so
interesting and sounds like a UFO crash on April 12
1960 a farmer by the name of Monroe Arnold he's well respected in his community called deputy sheriff Oscar
hayon to report a fiery red object which he said was about 8 to 12 feet wide
either a round disc or spherical in shape hurdling through the sky this was
at 9:20 p.m. April 12 1960 and it was at Treetop level and to his shock as he
watched it this object actually hit the ground about 00 ft from his Farmhouse
which is located about 3 mil south of lamp Louisiana 25 miles east of leeville
this is along Road 489 Fullerton Road just south of the Oak Grove Church you
can see that here but when this hit the ground it caused an incredibly loud
explosion that was heard for miles around many people heard it per deputy
sheriff Oscar Haron after landing it bounced around on the
ground in an easterly direction for about 1,000 ft then Rose and headed west
just above the Treetops you could see where it bounced on the ground and the places where it hit the ground it made
an impression about the size of a water bucket it scorched but did not burn the
grass it cut the top out of a tree and as strange as it seems hit only one tree
when it Rose it turned West fire about a foot long was burning out the rear of
the object so that's the statement of deputy sheriff Oscar Harmon and you can
see photographs here of the landing location and the actual Landing
traces uh per the farmer Monroe Arnold this object bounced on the ground a
total of nine times he said quote like a stone skipping on water then after
Rising back up reportedly turned West and moved off into the
distance now that did leave behind a dark substance which resembled somewhat
metallic paint this did catch the interest of Project Blue Book who were
very very interested in this case and conducted a full investigation lubok
officers major Ray F grad house and Master Sergeant Robert F Plimpton were
heading the investigation and they learned that many people had heard this object as it passed overhead and it was
also apparently caught on radar at the 1 1908 aacs Repcon unit in fact raidar
operator George D malard said that this radar blip indicated movements of about
700 to 800 mph one of the witnesses was farmer WP Harper who said that his TV
blacked out as this object passed overhead so what caused electromagnetic
interference so Bluebook investigators at this point wrote wrote it is
impossible at this time for me to give any estimate of what could have caused the sighting but they sure were
interested in it I mean they ended up filing an 86 page report and you can see
some of the documents here of this Blue Book investigation they did analyze the
material allegedly left by this C which turned out not to be paint but was some
kind of metal that it was not connected that they could tell to any military
missiles and this was the theory that was going around as to what this object was they did find that this metal sample
contained some iron and zinc and in a few of the samples chromium but again
Blue Book was very very interested in this case so if this was military they
certainly seemed very L by it with an 86-page report they took numerous photos
of the various Landing traces but ultimately were unable to identify this
object weirdly as you can see here there's a little supplement to this file
mentioning a monkey which was drawn in on this file with a handwritten note
giant purple pader I mean this appears to be a joke really hard to say what the
author meant by this but certainly a strange thing to appear in an official Blue Book document it is quite possible
this was military reverse engineered or maybe a genuine UFO given that it was
described as disc-shaped certainly it's not a missile and the Air Force's intense
interest and in-depth investigation all the way to studying this metal sample
shows that they were certainly puzzled and interested in it this next case
occurred sometime in 1975 or 1976 the witness is not quite
certain about the time but it's a really interesting case involving a landing that took place at the intersection of
VFW and comp Road the Witnesses were driving down this Old Logging Road comp
Road and They Came Upon This craft just sitting there and as he says at first it
looked like a circle of Lights of course we could only see our side of the circle but the individual lights illuminated
the metallic craft this was around 700 p.m. and as the witness said it emitted
super bright lights and Rose into the sky right above the trees it just sat
there when we got back to the main road and stopped got out and just watched it
it was dead silent I mean no sound at all so we went into town and got a friend we got back to the site and and
it was sitting in the original place with its lights dimmed I don't remember
anything else on this sighting I know we hauled butt to get out of there so they
were about 75 to 100 ft away they could see this thing was about 60 feet in
diameter they're estimating uh and they just watched it take off with this bright brilliant
shimmering light this was something they remembered quite vividly for a long time
in 2023 the witness approached his friend and asked again about it and his friend
said I think about the sighting every day sadly he just passed away uh but the
witness got another interesting tidbit of information about UFO activity over
leeville when as he says we later got a call from our church that there was a
sighting happening at that very moment and they asked us to go out there to a subdivision about 6 miles north of town
everyone in the subdivision was out in the road looking at a shimmering silver
blue and green object they said it was over the barn that it was real close and
flew out to where it was he also says that they heard a lot about UFOs in the
summer of that year now the next case I could find in leeville occurred on
December 23rd 1985 it was around 700 p.m. as the witness
and his mother were driving to a Christmas party in leeville they were approaching the intersection of swan
road and Savage Forks Road as you can see here when as the witness says we saw
lights hovering just above the Treetops my mom stopped the car the lights slowly
moved closer and at that point we could make out that it was a disc-shaped UFO
within 75 yards of us my mom yelled UFO and hit the gas pedal before we could
really get moving the UFO went from sitting still to faster than bullet speed and was over the horizon in an
instant so they drove to the party told everyone about the UFO and as the witness says everyone laughed and called
us crazy but they got some measure of vindication when UFOs came on the news
the very next night though this sighting was in Japan as the witness says
thinking back I realized there is no way what we saw was man-made it was completely silent and no man-made craft
could accelerate at that Speed without tearing apart and a human body would
turn to Mush at g-forces that would have been felt in that craft the next
incident I could find in leeville the last one occurred on December 12 1996 when several residents reported
seeing four bright lights in the sky around 7:30 p.m. m one of the witnesses
hadie Louise Styles described four bright orange lights in a row and
another on the side slightly smaller than the moon the radio stations and newspapers in the area also received
calls uh there is an Army base Fort pulk nearby they denied conducting any tests
but unofficially a wife of an officer who was stationed there said that there were in fact tests going on on that
night so I think the fact that Fort pul is near leeville could be an important
factor in a number of these sightings thank you very much Trent I found it very interesting to explore leeville UFO
history even with just a few thousand people I expect there are quite a few more cases there couldn't find any but
again most people don't report most people have never heard of muon mutual
UFO Network or new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center which are the two major
UFO Reporting centers here in the United States but there are others as well so I
don't know again just a crosssection of actual cases Now we move to another city
which is fairly large Whittier California this is by special request of
Cyclops thank you Cyclops I'm pretty familiar with Whittier having grown up
in the LA area area whiter is really part of the gigantic sprawling
megalopolis of Los Angeles but it its own separate City and has about
87,000 residents so there should be a lot of cases coming from Whittier and I
found about a half dozen that I found of really great interest uh a lot more than
that but these were the ones that really caught my eye I and I think again had something to offer to our understanding
of ETS and UFOs and what's going on with these visitors to our planet so thank
you Cyclops I hope you find this interesting an amazing event involving
hundreds of Witnesses in Whittier occurred on the evening of August 22nd
1957 was just after 7 pm. when Sandra little age eight ran into her house and
told her parents quote there are two eyes looking at me from the sky now it
took her some time to convince her parents to look outside but finally glancing out the window her father saw
two glowing disc-shaped craft high up in the sky he could see two Jets appeared
to be approaching them so he rushed outside but by the time he got outside the discs were gone he was so intrigued
by the obvious strangeness of this sighting he immediately retrieved his telescope went back back outside and was
rewarded because moments later six discs appeared overhead they were each grouped
in pairs in three different locations it was interesting because they were all tilting at a slight angle towards each
other and they proceeded to move in this circular pattern rocking back and forth
and looking through his telescope Mr little could see that these objects were identical they were solid objects dis
shaped with an angular Dome on top very much he said like a Mexican
sombrero after about 5 minutes one pair of these craft moved slowly away
followed shortly later by the other pair Mr little had his telescope trained on one of the objects that had remained and
when it didn't move away he said but instantly blinked out he called the Pasadena air defense center who showed
zero interest in this sighting but researcher itel erson heard about it and
she did an investigation and soon located other Witnesses in Whittier including John ieli and his mother
Evelyn both who said they were skeptical of UFOs until they had this sighting and
they reported the same exact details as the littles as did another witness Miss
FR who lived two blocks away from the littles and another witness Miss Eugene
Jones one mile away and more witnesses Thomas F Rogers and his wife who lived
four miles away other Witnesses include don t Frost and his daughter who watched
them from six miles away from the little family Elle soon located other Witnesses
who requested anonymity but after doing an investigation getting all the details of
these sightings and triangulating the observations Elle erson estimated that
these objects were about 2300 ft in elevation soon more witnesses came forth
police stations were contacted and admitted that they had received quote numerous reports throughout Orange
County of possible flying saucers here's another briefcase which I only mentioned
because it was investigated by J Allen heck who unfortunately did not provide a whole lot of details other than to say
that on December 17 1966 a young couple who worked as antique dealers in Whittier observed a
quote nocturnal light was in the sky for a period of about 5 minutes and the wife
told jayen heck I kept saying what can it be and her husband just kept
repeating oh my God so apparently unexplained it really impressed them and
less than one year later 7 p.m. in March 1967
a couple were having dinner at a co-worker's home in Whittier both these gentlemen were electricians the one was
the owner of the house and the friend both stepped out onto the porch to discuss work while their wives remained
inside and this is when suddenly a large disc-shaped craft appeared in the sky
very close they said it was moving at about 100 to 200 mph in a level
trajectory and huge 500 ft long 100 ft wide and had what looked like
hundreds of Windows or Port holes along the side they estimate these were about
3 ft wide and spaced 10 ft apart and illuminated with a bright white light
this craft was no higher they said than 125 ft and only about 150 ft away and
although it was dark out the craft did appear to have a silver GL metallic glint to it was blimp shaped but ly not
a blimp they said Looking Through the Windows they did not see any movement no Shadows no figures and it was in view
for only a few moments they immediately rushed back inside and shared what they saw with their wives and they were
getting ready to call the police when a news story came on television that some children had apparently released helium
balloons much earlier that day over the Golden State Freeway causing a traffic
jam and generating a number of UFO reports the witnesses wonder if that's a
bogus explanation to sort of cover up the fact that people were reporting UFOs
pure speculation but certainly an interesting incident that I don't think you can explain as helium balloons I was
unable to locate any other info about a very brief case which occurred on August
16 1975 other than quote a large illuminated object followed a group of
people in their car for 20 miles i' only include it because it's
one of many cases like this where UFOs Chase cars down highways for quite some
distance now whittier's most famous Case by far occurred on the evening of March
23rd through March 24th in 1977 when numerous Witnesses including
many sheriff's deputies Highway Patrol officers Air Force personnel reported a
ser of UFO sightings in Whittier and the surrounding areas quite a wide area
actually and because of the High Caliber of the witnesses this case generated
National headlines the sightings began around 9:30 p.m. when an LA Sheriff's
helicopter crew piloted by Raymond Davis and Theodore roach described seeing two
lights hovering above the Whittier Hills area they actually gave Chase to these objects in their helicopter the these
objects easily darted away it was flying uh
oh I'd say probably towards the Southwest at about 200 plus uhhuh all it
had on it was U it was white to Orange at about 600 ft something white fell off
of it hard to tell if it was burning or what it was it that the object of fell went for about 75 ft and extinguished we
b a thing at about 80 mph it ran off and left us and disappeared over the city of
Norwalk just uh completely blanked out yeah it was like I said it was white
light there was no U no navigation lights on it all as far as the red or green type thing but it was white
primarily we Ops coming towards us uh it passed probably about A4 of a mile to a
half mile in front of us that's where we picked up the estimate of speed we were in an aircraft at the time that's where
we had the altitude on it it was just 8 hours later 3:30 a.m. now March 24th at
seven security guards at nearby March Air Force Base to the East Saw unexplained glowing objects overhead in
fact major Brian Daly said that there were two quote diamond-shaped objects
glowing silver with a blue stream trailing behind when asked what he
thought these objects were he said beats the hell out of me I wish I knew they
estimated that these objects were at about 3,000 ft altitude and it was at the same time of this sighting that
Highway Patrol officers Robert scha and El Orchard reported their sighting of a
UFO also deputies Lonnie Hicks and Robert Carr saw two objects chasing each
other 10 minutes later Deputy John Murley saw two Bright Lights hovering
over the Long Beach Airfield 5 minutes after that 12 mil away more FES were
seen by police in Huntington Beach yeah it's uh we were flying I'm a I'm a cop
and uh we were flying patrol and we cited two similar two falling stars but
we they were not falling stars they were they were in formation and they went all
the way across our windshield which is probably about 78 of the entire Horizon and uh that was about it but uh it was
quite exciting they were uh very high and very fast very fast uh they covered the
Horizon I I estimate we watched them for about 4 seconds rain formation one was ahead and the other one
was uh kind of like a wingman off to the right a little bit you know right rear type thing yes and both of them were
identical in brightness uh size shape uh speed direction everything was identical
they were definitely in formation and they just uh they were they were getting it out I'll tell you um we were uh
myself my partner I believe you already talked to him right we're uh heading Northbound along Golden West Street
which is a North South Street in our city and uh I believe we're about 800 ft
we're in a helicopter and U we're watching the uh The Horizon and my
partner was in the left Cate of helicopter uh called my attention to objects we saw moving across the sky and
uh I looked at them they were on the left side of our helicopter Bubble at that time and uh I looked up and saw two
objects um kind of a light bluish in color a bluish glow to them or something
and they were heading all in from a southwesterly to North easterly
Direction and very high rate of speed and we had them in visual for about uh around 5
Seconds they were uh both exactly identical uh in size and shape a uh like
a teardrop with a tail on it and both uh one was flying just a little bit uh to
the uh left I believe and ahead of the other and they were looked like they were in formation mhm flying across and
it was very odd the first time I've ever seen him like that so there was a huge wave going
on the the same time of that sighting officers in Ventura County were reporting UFOs deputies Bob boor and Jim
Evans described their sighting of a quote a cigar with a light at each hand
people may think I'm bananas I don't know if it was a UFO or not but it was something so police over a very
widespread area were reporting UFOs phones were ringing off the hook at various police stations from residents
reporting activity so hundreds of people were watching this one witness was
Ronald cash a grocery clerk who said I never saw any shooting stars like these
and I never heard of two comets side by side Steve hos said he was driving along
Highway 101 when he saw two glowing golden discs moving side by side as he
says there were definitely something I've never seen before other Witnesses include fisherman
John ganschow his brother Fred and their friends Ed kug and Ed Allen they were
fishing at the pudding Stone Reservoir in nearby sand Deus when they saw two objects move quote faster than anything
man could have built we were stunned and I'm still shook up after seeing them now
reporters did contact an Air Force spokesman about all these sightings and his only reply was that there were no
aircraft operations at that time and that quote the Air Force is no longer in
the UFO investigating business which we now know is a lie they were taking these
reports very seriously and are still taking them seriously these sightings
occurred over a 9-hour period and ended up being reported not only over Whittier
but Los Angeles orange Ventura Riverside San Deus and San Bernardino counties
something was going on that night sounds like a major display to me yeah this s
in a police department yes sir how many calls have you had tonight quite a
few they were neat hey I was just talking to some of the people down here I'm in I'm in Southern California yes
okay well I was talking to I started calling around uh to uh some of the
different uh control Towers uh talk to LAX uh their control tower the
controller set there said he didn't see him but he had two reports on them from a pilot and and then I talked to Ontario
and he hadn't heard anything but the military based uh when I was trying to come up with a number this number of
this UFO s remember uh military March said March Air Force Base spotted them
and uh all the police departments in between here and God only knows where mhm and boy were they moving I we saw
them only for about I'd say four or 5 seconds and they were coming out of the
South kind of the Southwest going Northeast and uh that was
almost well from the south hor Southeast Horizon to where we couldn't see him over some buildings but uh according to
this pilot that reported LAX he saw horizon horizon in about 10 seconds well
after I called it in just fooling around with a dispatch I said we got UFOs in the area about three other officers
calling and said yeah I saw them too I had two officer standing with me at the time and we watched them and apparently
talking to the military police down here they heard on their scanners that the
sheriff's office here and several the other police departments heard are observed yes uh this is Kent Pierce
calling from KC television uh in Sacramento California yes sir uh where
are you located Seattle Washington Seattle I didn't know what 206 was I got your number from the FAA Tower here at
Stockton field yes in uh Central California we had a reported sighting uh
at 5:30 this morning uh did you receive a report of that 5:30 5:30 this morning Pacific Time
6 sanen County deputies uh sheriff's deputies uh at three different locations
each in teams of two uh indicated that they had seen a
hovering light form and it was moving from west to east at high speed it
hovered then it moved and uh two other deputies indicated it it was from 50 to
100 ft long with a black border around it climbing at about a 25° incline until it disappeared from
sight and that was firmed up by one other pair of deputies we've had three different deputies that uh three teams
of deputies all of whom reported citing this thing at 5:30 this morning right here in central California well
approximately all we could see that were really good tell of it where the there was two distinct lights uhhuh appeared
to be two different objects and all we could actually see on
it would be like a giant light bulb in the sky that's what it looked like we
could see no body no form to the object itself and the there were two of those
yes okay about what time did you spot those
I this be about 5:15 515 okay and we had them ins sight for
probably 10 minutes at the most I seen two lights one was a little bit higher than
the other one they kind of 45° angle uhhuh I only seen it for about a second
and a half and that's after I heard a report of lights and eat okay when I looked over I seen the two lights they
blipped off now was just about so 5:30 just Before Sunrise I got on my binoculars I looked
in that direction I seen them looked like it was almost straight up and down
a dark brown or almost a black What Might Have Been a vapor trail yes okay
it just it remained in that position off the Horizon for approximately 3 or 4
minutes and I got out of the patrol car took a look at it I could I remembered
about where it was at I could barely see it with a naked eye so I reached in and got the binocular as I was coming back
out I could still see it and it started to it was moving closer to the West towards that another
final case in Whittier is really quite dramatic it was 2:00 a.m. one morning in
1978 a lady was traveling north along the 605 Freeway in whiter heading
towards the 210 she had just passed Rose Hill Memorial Park and this is when she
noticed something above the freeway ahead of her there was no traffic at this time this object she said was
hovering completely still and only about 500 ft above the freeway as she says I
slowed as I approached it looking at it in disbelief when I was under it I came
to a complete stop on the freeway and just stared in amazement it was incredibly huge it wasn't shiny but it
was metallic with circular indentations like pores all about it it
was a very peculiar shape nothing you could describe as a rectangle or Circle but the size just overwhelmed me I
remember not being frightened but just a SED so she actually stayed stopped on
the freeway for several moments she said this craft was so large it reminded her of something out of that TV show battl
Star Galactica but realizing she was stopped on the freeway she started to pull slowly forward and at that point
this craft suddenly disappeared and was gone how amazing is that I love these
cases where people see solid craft with Port holes real close up this sort of
thing um these are the cases that I think are very hard to explain away as you know Venus or a balloon or something
along those lines uh most people I think certainly in my experience are very
reluctant to report a UFO unless they're sure it's very strange unconventional
unexplained in some way and again so many more cases than we
see here let's move to the next location which actually I got three requests for
and that is Huntsville Alabama this is by special request from ancient
Mysteries Ernie blue and Tony O'Neal of course Huntsville is very famous mostly
for the US Army Redstone Arsenal which contains the Marshall space flight
center NASA uh works out of there so it's very
well known for that which could be a draw for some of the UFO activity we see
here because we do know that UFOs are very interested in monitoring our
technology our exploration into space and there's some indication that that is
drawing some of the attention of UFOs in this area this is a large city some
220,000 residents it's Alabama's most populous city and I did find cases
reaching back all the way to 1950 pretty much to the current day
that's true in most of these locations UFO activity really ramped up following
the 19407 crash of Roswell the Kenneth Arnold sighting coinciding with the
atomic age which I don't think is any coincidence so that's where we usually
get most of the reports is from 1947 50
onward so I think you'll find these cases pretty interesting uh I certainly
hope so the first case that I could find in Huntsville has very little information but is still quite
interesting at 5:00 p.m on July 13 1950 two employees from the Redstone Arsenal
in Huntsville including a gentleman by the name of Mr Washburn saw what they
described as a polished aluminum looking object shaped like a bow tie that was moving in a horizontal trajectory
overhead then one half of this object rotated a quarter turn in the the opposite direction then returned to its
original position the object then made a right angle turn and accelerated away so
clearly not a plane or helicopter or balloon another very interesting incident occurred 2 years later this was
at 740 p.m. on July 14 1952 when George L Davis a draftsman was
sitting on the porch of his home at 212 West Rett Avenue with him was the
neighbor's child Bert Bryant who noticed it first he pointed out a bright light
zipping across the sky George looked up and was shocked to see this object he
said it was surrounded by a bright glow was clearly moving in a controlled flight he it puzzled him because there
was no evidence of any exhaust no way for this object to propel itself but
unknown to them there were other Witnesses Ralph Martin a mechanical
engineer whose home was off Athens Pike not far away also saw it was apparently
the same object he and his wife were also sitting on the porch when they both noticed this object and they described
it very much the same as Ralph says suddenly without slowing its speed the
object practically reversed its flight glowed a cherry red around the white
light and traveled back generally towards the north there was a third witness unknown to the others Larry lace
of 10410 Street who said that he also watched this object circling the neighborhood before
finally darting away while all three did report their sightings to the Huntsville
times they all said that they had no plans to report it to the Air Force probably due to the ridicule that was
surrounding this subject was only 9 days later at 6:45 p.m. on July 23rd
1952 that a gentleman by the name of Herman H King who lived at 909 muli
Avenue called the Huntsville times to report his observation of an object which was appearing over the Northwest
area of Huntsville and moving in an irregular fashion he said across the town and it turns out there were other
residents on this same street including wood R Garner who was basically Herman's
neighbor 907 molik Avenue and Mona King and her husband who also saw this object
they described it as shaped like two cones placed mouth to mouth they said it was black in color they said it moved up
in a vertical climb turned East then zoomed overhead at high speed another
really interesting case involving apparent missing time occurred to a gentleman in March or April of
1975 he says he was driving with the friend North on ride out road when they
saw a low-flying light over the woods on the east side of ride out Road just north of of Sherwood Park you can see it
here this was much less Incorporated I'm sure at the time but he followed this light to the dead end of Bradford Drive
and still seeing this light in the woods he parked the car left his friend in the
car and walked down a path into the woods he said he got as close as he could to these lights stood there a few
minutes and at one point Heard a Voice say to him are you afraid of your own
mud which was a peculiar thing he then walked back to his car and this is when
he got an incredible shock because his friend was sitting in the car and said that immediately after he left to go
into the woods all the insect sounds seized and there was this intense Eerie
quiet which remained for a full 2 hours this friend waited in the car for 2
hours until the friend came back he says immediately The Crickets started again
making noise but getting back into the car this gentleman who walked into the woods discovered to his great
astonishment and confusion that his jeans were covered with mud he says after this incident he developed a rash
on his upper arms so apparently there's more to this encounter than he can recall here's another one that is
definitely more than a sighting uh the witness believes this wasn't an onboard experience it occurred in
1981 and she says she recalled it as a dream but as she says I now believe it
was not a dream but an abduction experience she has three distinct Memories the first was being placed in a
curved plastic seat with a high back and once she was in this seat she found that she was unable to move she could see
another man human looking sitting in an identical seat in front of her her
second memory was lying on a table in the middle of this room she could see a rounded ceiling part of a rounded Gray
silver wall she saw a Strang looking figure who she had the impression was
female walking up a ramp nearby as the witness says the woman was wearing a red
bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit but her head was different larger in the
back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin she had a
big forehead and bigger eyes than a human her nose was extremely small her
mouth was small too very thin lips I have never seen a face similar to hers
the third and final memory she has was of sitting in another seat looking out a window or a por hole to just complete
Blackness outside she said this window was kind of rectangular in shape but had
rounded Corners so not a normal window another interesting case from Huntsville
occurred in October 1981 to Jeff Whitner he said he was driving between
Huntsville and decar when when he saw a giant egg-shaped object with one light
and covered with a bunch of orange lights as Jeff says it was the size of a
football field and hovered about 100 or 200 yards over me I slowed down to about
15 m per hour and drove underneath I was right beneath it and I couldn't hear a
thing was getting lower and lower and finally stopped over me I drove a few
more yards and started to pull off the road and looked back and it was gone on I'm positive it wasn't an airplane I
always thought UFOs were possible I'm a Believer now so yeah that's a very
closeup sighting and here's another really interesting case this occurred around 9 or 10 p.m. and February of 1988
the witness was a high school student and was sitting on the boat docks at Gunter lake with a friend when he says a
large Bell or thimble shaped object actually came out of the Waters of
gunterville Lake just about A4 mile away from them he said it had colored lights
that Rose in this weird kind of diagonal line pattern on the outside of this object from bottom to top this object
went straight up above the tree line and stopped so this freaked them out they became afraid they rushed to the car and
took Highway 72 through Scottsboro to Huntsville this is about a 35-minute
drive and as the witness says the op object followed us just above the tree
line rapidly moving from one side of the road to the other the object was bright
enough to be seen through the street lights once we reached Huntsville and it followed us on a twisting path through
town so he arrived at his house and he and his friend grabbed a pair of
binoculars and a rifle scope and watched this object it was hovering nearby over
a neighbor's house they were immediately joined by his father and a neighbor and they all watched this object for about
10 minutes as it hovered appeared to rotate then Rose rapidly and sped off
quite a few cases in Huntsville in 1994 investigators Sue pittz and Jeff Ballard
as you can see here were investigating several sightings in the Huntsville area
in 1994 I couldn't find any details on it unfortunately but here's a final case
involving photographic evidence a group of four friends had gone to the A hotel
in downtown Huntsville on May 27 2023 was 8:20 p.m. as they sat in the
second floor bar patio of the hotel when they saw three orbs of light in the
Western sky one of them had their camera ready and managed to capture the photograph you see here these objects
were hovering directly over the First Baptist Church Bell Tower for the witnesses there did appear to be an aura
or haze around the object thank thank you ancient Mysteries Ernie O'Neal and
Tony blue really cool I learned quite a bit about exploring Huntsville and the
UFO activity there uh it's amazing I do think that the
space research going on there uh NASA and all of that is part of what's
drawing UFO activity there it's just pure speculation but given that there
are so many other cases where UFOs pure during rocket launches and this sort of thing I think it is a factor but
certainly fascinating stuff now let's move to another location which is Elton
Maryland and this is a not a very small town but not what I would call a huge
either I got two requests for Elton coming from oxter and Steven Douglas so
thanks guys again I found some really interesting cases I've never heard before uh this is a town of about 15
16,000 residents in uh Maryland which is a fairly small state but still has quite
a bit of UFO activity and yeah some really great cases including a few
apparent onboard cases cases involving missing time and this sort of thing so
again not just simple sightings going on here we have the full range of
encounters the first Elton case to get any real publicity was quite interesting
this occurred on January 21st 1971 Ellis Keith Arnold his wife Sharon
and his sister-in-law Lynn hodling were driving north along Old fieldpoint Road
near Romney Hill when they saw what they first thought was a plane but they quickly changed their minds because as
Ellis says there were no engines windows or markings there was a large cluster of
flashing lights on the bottom of the object and lights on the ends of the Wings and
moved silently down Oldfield Point Road and then went over Elton so they watched this object
stopped and hovered he said so they began to wonder could this be a helicopter but as they got closer they
disregarded that explanation because they saw that it had no blades and it was totally silent they watched it move
down the road hover over Elton where it was amazingly joined by another object
one of these objects moved off over Elkton and the other turned back and began to hover over a field off the road
just a short distance away so Ellis stopped the car and got out for a better look and as he says and as he says it
was about 60 ft from the car and hovering about 80 ft in the air so he
walked directly towards it at which point it turned away and disappeared from sight over Hollingsworth Manor they
called the police who said that they hadn't in fact received another call from an Elton resident who saw one of
these objects moving over Route 40 in Elton interestingly just prior to this
sighting the three main Witnesses had been discussing the subject of
UFOs so that's an important detail because there are a number of cases where the subject of UFOs come up and
suddenly a UFO shows up here's another very interesting and somewhat concerning
case which was invest investigated by muon field investigator George
Reynolds it was one evening 8:30 p.m. in October 1988 that an anonymous married couple
and their two children had gone out for dinner they had just left Highway 896
leaving Delaware and Crossing in to Maryland into Elkton which is right on
the border when their children suddenly cried out that weird lights were following their car immediately the area
around them was flooded with this really intense bright white light the car engine promptly lost power and the car
rolled to a stop the wife stepped out of the car to see what was wrong and the
next thing the husband knew he says he was driving in the other direction in a
different area back towards Newark and he was being pulled over by a police
officer who said he pulled him over because he was driving erratically I can imagine uh they arrived home shortly
later to find that it was now 11:30 p.m. so they were missing approximately 3
hours of time later seeking assistance to understand what happened to them they
did contact researcher George Reynolds who advised that they speak with Dr
David Jacobs PhD who specializes of course in using hypnotic regression to
recover missing time associated with UFO encounters so according to this family
the next day they received a phone call from an unidentified gentleman they first thought it might be the policeman
who had pulled him over but apparently not because this gentleman said quote
about last night you live in a beautiful world don't do anything to upset it
don't talk about what happened investigator George Reynolds feels like this is an overt Threat by hovert
government agents uh definitely a concerning case and here's another one which is quite
interesting this next one occurred at 5:30 p.m. on July 15 1993 as two
witnesses a father and son were on their boat going up the Elk River towards
Elton and they saw this light descend from the sky and actually enter the water about a half mile in front of them
so they continued on their boat up to the spot where this light or this object had entered the river but they found no
evidence of it it they were pretty sure they saw what they saw as the witness
says other residents in the area have stories of strange things they seen
including odd-looking craft in the sky moving at unusually fast speeds or
sometimes just hovering and doing outrageous Maneuvers such as sharp sudden turns with later that same year
at 3:30 a.m. on November 20 1993 that a man had an very frightening encounter he
was out deer hunting in the woods outside of Elton when he noticed an object with three white lights and a row
of multicolored lights in the back he said that they were red green blue
yellow and orange and as the witness says as it came closer I could tell it
was a triangular shape it came down to Treetop level about 25 yards away from
me on the other side of the creek the row of colored lights went out then a
beam of light came out the middle so according to this witness this object proceeded to move directly over him
until he it was only about 15 ft away from him he said it moved very slowly
and it was in view for a full 5 minutes or so he thought because as it
disappeared the witness now saw that the sky was brightening with the Rising Sun
so this sighting began at 3:30 a.m. and now the sun's coming up so he estimates
he's missing 2 three hours or so but as the witness says now I'm wondering what happened I
guess I'll never know I only told a couple of people of course they all laughed at me and told me I was crazy
but I know what I saw and it's the truth less than one year later 10:28 p.m. June
1st 1994 a witness was standing on the front porch of his friend's apartment this is
an apartment complex this had a view of a farm with a barn and a field of cows
just off in the distance there and to the witness's amazement he saw this
strange object it had yellow and orange lights on it was blinking in a seemingly
meaningful pattern looks almost like it was communicating to him he said this object had a round Dome on top with what
looked like Windows he noticed that it was very low to the ground right next to these cows says the witness I was so
scared that I just stood there and looked at it then I went inside afraid and didn't say anything for some strange
reason I felt a lot like I wanted to cry he came back outside a short time later
but this object was gone he ended up reporting his sighting to new Fork but with a caveat he said please don't send
anyone to my house or I'll hide so as you can see it affected him profoundly a
final case also reported to new Fork contains very little information and the
wi refused to identify himself or provide any other details he said it was
New Year's Eve in 2012 just after midnight when he heard a strange noise
outside and going outside to investigate he saw a quote ship emitting bright
light flashes after that he has no recollection of this object moving away or anything other than he quote woke up
200 ft from my house without my shirt and a strange pain in my abdomen so unfortunately this case is
not professionally investigated so it's just eyewitness testimony but certainly interesting
thank you oxter and Steven Douglas for providing that location I have so much fun finding a city and wondering will I
find a case there kind of knowing that I will but you never know for sure uh
Elton delivered no doubt about that UFOs are being seen everywhere they are
ubiquitous and that's true for our next location which is soul South Korea this
is by special request of Soju and I really expected to find a lot more it's
difficult for me to find cases in Soul Korea being here in the United States uh
don't have access to some of the resources I think that perhaps someone living there would most of the cases I
found in fact were reported by US military folks who were stationed in
South Korea for one reason or another including of course Wars and conflicts
uh which is unfortunate but still really interesting some amazing cases I did
find some cases involve or one involving humanoids but some really interesting
photographic cases as well Sol is an interesting place it is the capital of South Korea it's got a huge po popul of
just under 10 million as it turns out about half of South Korea's residents
live in the so in Soul or the surrounding areas so there's quite a few
people there and the cases I found I'm sure are just the very very tip of the
iceberg and from I there are indications there's quite a bit of UFO activity
going on there but I think you'll find the cases that I did find quite interesting so thank you Soju I hope you
enjoy this the earliest case I could find in Soul Korea occurred at 12:57
p.m. on September 30 1950 about seven American Marines
stationed in Saul described their observation of a classic Flying Saucer that they said moved from east to west
over the city among the Witnesses were Lieutenant EJ Ambrosia who said and I
quote it seemed to be a silvery color and was going two or three times faster than any plane I've seen over here Staff
Sergeant Robert J Bowden said we all saw it there were about half a dozen of us
with the lieutenant when we went over to check a report by natives that there were four dead Marines on a hill we saw
a bunch of Korean kids looking up and we looked up too it looked more yellow than
silver to me but it was round and traveling really fast staff sergeant
Franklin ryer also saw it and said it sure looked like a saucer to him so these are military officers uh who are
trained observers certainly good Witnesses and another case occurred one
year later Less on July 1st 1951 USMC Pilots were flying four F4U 5n
Fighters and they reported their sighting of bright green spheres which were apparently also caught on ground
radar unfortunately no other information on that case but quite a bit of UFO
activity going on at this time from August 1951 to May
1952 multiple reports of unexplained radar targets were caught by the
electronic repair officer aboard the USS Essex this is an aircraft this is an
aircraft carrier that was stationed off the east coast of Korea at this time
according to this officer these targets could not have been planes as the speeds were clocked at some 3,000 mph and at
altitudes in excess of 70,000 ft here's one from flight Sergeant Kenneth Dudley
Smith of the 77th raaf squadron at kimpo oh now named Gimpo Airport in
Soul he described his observation of a coin-shaped object Dole silver spinning
and tumbling at a speed of 345 mph this was also observed by flight Sergeant
Kenneth faer it was the very next day an officer at guardpost 14 at the Fifth Air
Force compound in Soul said that on June 7 1952 an object was seen at 1,000 ft
altitude hovering it then Rose to 2,000 ft but then descended back down to 1,000
ft hovered for another minute then ascended in a rapid climb back back up to 2,000 and it did this repeatedly
bouncing up and down rapidly stopping again at 1,000 ft for 3 minutes zooming
back up to 2,000 ft before finally moving off from a level trajectory to the east according to the witnesses this
object changed color several times from red to blue then orange then yellow and
white now despite all these amazing details the Air Force explanation of
this event was quote a balloon I don't know here's another case April
20 1953 four US Army Airmen reported their citing of a quote white rounded
delta-shaped object they said it was flying at 60 to 80 mph two of the Witnesses were Lieutenant
Julius Morgan and the other was Lieutenant James o rimus another witness
was also Lieutenant Jack e Meyers that same year Marine pilot Henry Covington
was stationed at k6 Basin Soul he was scheduled for the First Flight of the day so he went outside to check on the
weather and to his shock there hovering overhead was an orange disc-shaped
object dark in the center giving it an almost donut-like appearance he said it
seemed quite low hovering it maybe 1,00 to 1500 ft he rushed back inside to get
another witness and about a dozen pilots and crew members came out in just in time time to see this object move slowly
away to the North in a weird zigzag pattern another sighting occurred on November 6 1957 when Witnesses described
a glowing blue white barrel-shaped object which was so low to the ground the light was reflecting on a pool of
water below it they said it Rose and vanished quote like a light switching
off here's another case 1978 gentleman with the initials Mr G D he's a
transport engineer working in Soul he was on a plane with a relative when they
both saw a bright light in the daylight sky this was 10:30 a.m. they said it
moved west across the sky suddenly stopped fell downwards stopped again
moved horizontally and then repeated this strange maneuver twice more before
suddenly shooting off upwards and out of sight in 15 seconds the witness says
this was not an aircraft as no aircraft can do what this did now here's another
case not in Soul proper but at cson Air Force Base in South Korea so interesting
I had to includ it it was one evening around 1979 when the witness woke up to find
himself on the floor his wife was still asleep in bed and this is when he saw a
quote large dark figure wearing a hooded cloak or Cape standing in the doorway of
his bedroom he said it didn't walk but appeared to Glide slowly across the
floor floor towards him just two or 3 feet he was unable to move his fear
mounted as this thing moved slowly closer to him he couldn't move couldn't
cry out but finally with great effort he managed to make a small squeak and then
called out his wife's name this broke the paralysis and he immediately dragged himself back onto the bed and the
strange figure was gone so he remains unsure if this was sleep paralysis a
weird waking dream he allows that possibility but this does not explain
how he ended up on the floor and later in life he would have a few quite a few
very dramatic missing time incidents and one incident where he actually gained time he took a 20-minute car trip in
only about 10 minutes he says he also has a few unexplained scoop likee marks on his body and as a child suffered from
unusual nose bleeds so these are quite a few of the markers we look for in UFO
contactees here's another really interesting case August 8th 1981 this gentleman was on active
military duty in South Korea he was with his unit doing helicopter training when
as he says quote I saw a cone-shaped flying object move up the valley it had
circling lights around it that were multicolored and rotating in the opposite direction so he could see no
propellers or rotors this object was moving silently but interestingly it seemed to repel the fog that was filling
the valley an officer of higher rank was with him and also saw it and immediately
ordered the witness to quote never mention a word about what they had seen But as the witness says I actually saw
what I believe to be a UFO a remarkably similar case occurred almost exactly one
year later September 15 1982 to a helicopter mechanic also stationed in
South Korea with 6:00 a.m. he was outside and this is when he noticed that
the heavy fog in the valley where he was at was parting and as he says out of the
fog came a cone and top shaped object of silver color smooth skin and had
rotating green blue and red lights at the top and the bottom he said it was
about a half mile away but close enough to hear a soft humming noise it soon moved directly overhead very slowly he
looked at another officer who was there and asked him did you see what I saw the
man nodded and said we didn't see nothing he turned around and walked away and refused to ever talk about it the
witness did tell a squad leader who laughed it off and then told him to forget about it this witness was later
pretty highly placed in the military he became a master sergeant held a secret security clearance and he insists that
what he saw was not military a few more interesting cases on September 4
1995 UFOs made the evening news in South Korea when a television cameraman just
north of Soul captured 4 minutes and 44 seconds of footage showing a fleet of
what appears to be 10 small brilliant saucers moving overhead the cameraman
Lee HEI Hong says and I quote the flying saucers were accidentally taken by my TV
Camera while I was on a trip trip to scoutout locations so this film was taken in kyong this is 50 km Northeast
of soou turns out another newspaper man had captured a UFO the day before and
reportedly numerous people in the area were witnessing UFOs in that area at
that time all through the first week of September 1995 here is another amazing
case involving photographic evidence which occurred on December 28th 2009
when an elementary school student was on the balcony of his family's apartment he
saw a flying saucer hovering over a nearby group of buildings quickly ran inside grabbed his mother's mobile phone
camera and snapped a photograph which you can see here this was taken to
various photo analysts who concluded that this object was not CGI that this
was a genuine photograph Michael Cohen who wrote the article said fightings of
UFOs are common in South Korea one final case also involving photographic
evidence occurred on April 7 2012 when a passenger in a plane flying over Soul
shot a few seconds of video of a UFO which ended up going viral this did
generate International headlines it's quite controversial but certainly an
interesting bit of footage which you can find pretty easily online if you just type typ in the date April 7 2012 but
you can see the images up of it here thank you again Soju that was so
interesting I found some of these cases just super fascinating two of those
cases that were so similar the way this UFO is causing the fog to burn out the
photographic cases were of course fascinating and I'm sure another researcher would be able to write an
entire book on the cases just going on in South Korea super
fascinating but now let's move to our last and final location in episode 8 of
Home UFOs in your hometown and this is ashkash Wisconsin this is by special
request of Mir nuisance AKA Justin s and
thanks for suggesting this location I know you're a huge supporter of my
channel so I was very excited to explore ashkash found some amazing cases not a
whole lot but some really interesting ones for sure including one sounds like a UFO crash although there was no
evidence found of any debris or anything like this quite a few witnesses to this
one incident and he has some really interesting cases ashkash is a pretty
big city 70,000 people it's uh Wisconsin's ninth most populous city and
in the past was higher up on the charts uh but a really beautiful location from
what I can tell and I think you'll find the cases that I did find quite
interesting the first weird incident I could find in ashas isn't technically a
UFO incident but it's so strange that I thought it worthy of inclusion and it comes from pioneering researcher Charles
Fort he published it in his groundbreaking book book of the Damned he's really one of the first researchers
to write about UF CL in the Paranormal and according to his report on March 20
1886 on a sunny day at 3 P.M in the city of ashkash the entire city was plunged
into pitch black darkness that was equal to midnight as Charles Fort writes
people in the streets rushing in all directions horses running away woman and children running into cellers this
darkness which lasted for 8 to 10 minutes occurred in a day that had been
light but cloudy it passed from west to east and brightness followed then came
reports from towns to the west of ashkash that the same phenomenon had already occurred there a wave of total
darkness had passed from east to west this sounds like one of The Twilight
Zone episodes but apparently this was not an eclipse theories have ranged to
explain this everything from thunderstorms to dust clouds but what actually happened happened remains a
mystery and it hasn't happened since now here is a very early case which comes from scientist and UFO researcher Dr
Alan utki he writes that in the fall of 1947 three Witnesses observed a 150 ft
wide disc-shaped craft hovering just above the Treetops looking up they could
see that this disc had illuminated Port holes and even more interesting behind the port holes the Witnesses said that
they could see humanoid figures looking down at them unfortunately there is no
other information on this case but it's certainly a very early report of humanoid here's another very interesting
case this occurred on August 21st 1956 when 13-year-old Richard Kaufman
said he saw UFOs twice in one day the first sighting occurred at 11:15 a.m.
when he and two friends heard jets flying overhead and looking up saw a quote little white dot this thing zipped
across the sky but then it stopped paused for a few minutes and then disappeared in the direction of the Sun
so clearly not anything normal it was just a half hour later that Richard Kaufman was with six other boys and
again they looked up to watch a jet but this time they saw a solid disc-shaped
object traveling quote real fast so fast it had a little tail as it moved across
the sky and disappeared the next case occurred on October 29 1979 when several
residents of ashkash called the police to report their sighting of a red glowing object one man who lives on
Shady Lane right next to Lake Winnebago overlooking the lake told the police that at 10:30 p.m. he saw this large red
ball of Fire in the Sky which descended and apparently crashed because it made a
loud booming noise deputies were sent to the area but they could find no evidence of anything crashing there however other
residents also called the police to report the incident and they said this was definitely not fireworks or anything
normal here's another multiple witness case this occurred on September 10 2012
and this involves unusual glowing objects darting around in the night sky one of the witnesses Tammy weeks writes
I saw a little bit of it as I was driving home from ashkash a couple of Lights would be lit up and in one place
and go out they would then show up in a different spot I've seen these before
about once or twice a year another witness Shannon Barry writes I saw it I
also saw an orange orbl likee light hover and then shoot off out of nowhere last night was weird for sure a third
witness Zack Nelson writes there were lights over ashkash I live in watoma and
at about 3:20 in the morning I could see three lights moving extremely fast followed by three more so here's one
final recent case this occurred on at 10:45 p.m. on August
9222 and this involves a photograph the witness writes as I was taking my dog
out I noticed one very bright light randomly moving above my neighbor's house yet farther away I watched and I
knew that it wasn't a normal plane or aircraft so I went inside and grabbed my phone I took photos it could not be
explained when zooming in 3D details of the craft and its spinning rotation was
clear I'm a Master's degreed Teacher I am not a UFO
Enthusiast there you go mere nuisance Just hope you enjoyed my coverage of
ashkash I certainly learned a few new things it's amazing to me people have
some incredible misconceptions about the UFO phenomena one is that this is
something that's quite rare I'm not so sure that's true if I'm finding UFOs in
pretty much every location on Earth I mean it's a lot more common I think than
the general public certainly realizes uh there are well over a million documented cases in the various
UFO databases around the world world I mean newfork and muon alone have two
300,000 documented cases together and those are just two it doesn't include
naikap or AO or qos and other UFO Reporting organizations and again that's
just in the United States so yeah I think we can safely say there are millions of documented cases and quite a
bit more that are undocumented it's one of the reasons I do this research I don't want all these
cases is to just be lost to posterity it's such an important subject I really
think all of humanity deserves to know the truth that our planet has been visited by
extraterrestrials that people are having face-to-face encounters with ETS that they're going on board that there is
such a thing as UFO crashes that there is a cover up so these are all really
important details that I think have the potential to change the world so thank
you when again guys for offering these locations for me to explore and study
and find out if there are UFO encounters there and if you want to provide me
another location I'm certainly happy to put it on my list but I must warn you I
have well over 700 locations on this list I've explored about 70 or 80 of
them so I'm working my way through it but honestly this is going to take me years I'm happy to do it it gives me
lots of fodder lots of room for more investigations so yeah thanks guys for
providing these locations really appreciate it it's so much fun but
that's it for today hope you've enjoyed this episode hope you learned something hope you found it interesting and until
next time keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth
it's up to you to find it don't think you're going to find it with our governments who are still lying about
this subject I mean I'm happy to see disclosure happening but I still feel like it's tightly controlled and we're
just not going to get it voluntarily from our own governments at any rate till next time keep having fun bye for
now
