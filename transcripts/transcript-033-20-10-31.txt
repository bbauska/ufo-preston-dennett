ANDY'S UFO ABDUCTION
Oct 31, 2020

Summary:
Oct 31, 2020
All across the world, people are experiencing onboard UFO encounters. This is the story of two young brothers who were abducted into a UFO in 1978 from their home in a quiet suburb in the Netherlands.

This is an important case because the main witness, Andy, recalls his experience consciously without the use of hypnosis, and is able to provide a clear description of the interior of the craft. Also, it's a multiple witness case with many interesting and unusual details, including a weird encounter with a "USO," an unidentified submersible object. 

Andy was only twelve years old when his bedroom filled with light and he found himself taken into a UFO. Now, many years later, he has bravely stepped forward and allowed his incredible story to be told.

Most UFO investigators today agree that UFO abductions are a real phenomenon. They still represent the cutting edge of UFO research, and provide the most opportunity to learn about these strange visitors to our planet.

(Introduction)
Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and today i'd like to talk to you about a first-hand 
case of UFO contact. An on-board UFO encounter involving two brothers from the Netherlands. 
I call this case "Andy's Abduction". I think it's important for a couple of reasons. 
One is that the main witness recalls this fully, consciously, without the use of regressive hypnosis. 
It's also a multiple witness case. It's also important, I think, because it's really a typical 
case. The kind I hear quite a bit. I think it's very common and a lot of people are having this 
type of encounter. And for that reason, it's important and really deserves to be told.
(Background)
This case occurred in a quiet suburb a housing  tracked outside of a major city center in  
the netherlands it occurred in 1978 the main  witness his name is andy he's andy contacted me  
through social media after learning  I was a ufo researcher he was very  
ear to have his story told I would describe  him as a very kind person very intelligent  
sort of a introvert kind of a shy sensitive guy  very empathetic overall really wonderful guy I was  
really delighted to be contacted by him and  very happy he agreed to share his experience  
because I think it's an important one  for yeah as I said a number of reasons  
as I said this occurred in 1978 and he was  about 12 or 13 years old it was a school  
night when this occurred he had gone to bed one  evening and woke up in the middle of the night  
to find his room filling with light and i'll  just let andy describe what happened to him in  
his own words well I was about about 12 years old  and I went to bed because I had to go to school.
(The Incident)
So, I was sleeping and suddenly I woke up because there was a lot of light sometimes my brother  
took some books from my from my room and  he put on the light so I said put down the  
light so he turned off his face so he said no  it's me I'm taking the books and I said okay  
but this time he didn't say nothing  and the light didn't went off  
so I thought what's happening here so I started  to open my eyes and the first thing I saw was a  
lot of light of course but the first thing I saw  was my blanket was gone so I said hey where's my  
blanket and uh at the same moment I saw those  I was lying on a metal table and then I saw  
then I looked a little up and I saw this big  window this big window and then I saw this bench  
in front of the window it was around round edges  and it was one with the floor that's uh and  
um yeah or all everything everywhere was light but  I don't wanna know lance or something I don't know  
where it came I think it was kin coming from  outside through the window but I don't know  
there was light everywhere yeah I thought what's  happening where am I am I in the hospital or  
something and then I started to look around  and on my right I saw two two people two beings  
but they were black very dark so I  couldn't see their faces and then I  
looked further and I saw a sliding door and  someone was walking through it and then I looked  
further and I saw this this little uh thing on the  floor maybe for maintenance or something like that  
uh further nothing the the room  was around then I looked to my left  
and I saw a little uh being and then  I looked further and I saw another one  
and then further on the third one this the third  one was smiling at me I was making a nice gesture  
and then I turned back and I saw this thing  above my head there was a tube with two rings  
emitting light a kind of red purple with a big  needle in the in the middle and it was coming  
down to my left eye so I started to shake my  head it's only the I could only move my head  
and this thing was coming down so I started to  shake my head I told them that he's the big alien  
because uh one one eating was one hat bigger  than the other one and the biggest one  
literally took my attention so I stopped shaking  and looking at him and then he said in my language  
don't be scared this won't hurt and then I got  this amazing feeling in my body and in my mind  
i've never felt so good before so I thought  okay I trusted him and then I let it happen  
i thought okay so as uh I was waiting for  it and then it went black and then the clock
was going off because I had to go to school  
when I woke up I was laying  straight at my bed not not folded or  
but then I opened my eyes and the first thing  I said is oh my god this dream do look so real  
and then okay I'm not then I was sitting on my  bed and I was totally exhausted I was never so  
tired in my life before and then I said I thought  was that sleeping was to rest I'm more tired than  
before I went to bed but then I thought okay  
i have to go to school um I thought it was a dream  and the next day uh I we were in the living room  
with my parents and my brother said out of nothing  he said hey I dreamed I was abducted by aliens so  
that ain't me too but maybe he was thinking that  I was kidding him so he didn't say anything more  
but he never said he dreamed about anything  but this time he said and I had now I think  
this really happened as you can see a very  important experience andy estimates that he
(Andys Memories)
recalls about two minutes of what happened  consciously but that a lot more occurred and  
he would later have mem some memories coming back  of some other events he thought it was a dream but  
kind of knows it wasn't there was one clue that  it wasn't a dream is he did find his brother's  
shirt in his room that was weird one detail about  this experience which I find very interesting  
is that the et spoke telepathically to andy and  spoke to him in his native language perfect danish  
i just find that a very interesting detail  and he was able to describe the interior  
of the ufo in great detail he saw this weird  object on the floor some sort of instrument he  
couldn't really describe well because it was just  so foreign looking some weird spinning object  
you saw another room with a bench  very low benches and a large window  
he also saw this very strange instrument coming  down from the ceiling these and other details  
he would later find out were described by  other witnesses so that was very interesting  
so i'll just let andy describe a little  bit of the interior of the ufo and what  
he saw in his own words but sometimes  later I saw uh this uh documentary 
(National Geographic Documentary)
and from the national geographic channel and there  was this uh drawing I think from an up up the tee  
and there was exactly the same device with the two  rings except for the needle there was no needle  
but it was exactly the same and that that was the  moment I thought this really happened around the  
(Andys Strange Experiences)
time of this abduction event andy had a number  of very strange experiences which he thinks are  
related uh certainly I think they're related  as well these are details I hear from a lot of  
other experiencers uh one detail andy described  was waking up one morning to find that he'd had a  
very severe nosebleed spontaneously it was always  puzzled about how this happened and was shocked  
to learn that this was a symptom that's often  reported by other experiencers another morning  
he woke up to find that his feet were laying on  his pillow and his head was at the foot of the bed  
he was lying the wrong way in bed he wondered how  the heck that could have happened he couldn't have  
done it himself I don't think he did because  i've heard this from many other experiencers  
i don't think this is a mistake perhaps it is  but I honestly think the ets do this on purpose  
as sort of a hint a sort of a calling card  to let people know that something strange  
happened very hard to say another very weird and  significant event which occurred around this time  
occurred actually at school it was at the end  of the school day and everyone was about to go  
home the bell rang but the school director would  not let any of the children out of the classroom  
because he said a ufo was hovering over the school  and he kept the kids in class for another five  
minutes at the time andy thought it was a joke now  he wonders if perhaps it was real another weird  
event that andy has never been able to explain  and he didn't think was significant at the time  
he woke up one uh evening and was surprised to  hear this weird beeping noise he thought it was  
his alarm clock but his alarm clock doesn't make a  beeping noise he got up looked around and couldn't  
find the source of this beeping noise when he  realized it was actually coming from inside his  
head so definitely all these weird events were  starting to pile on top of each other all at the  
same time probably the most significant was a ufo  sighting which occurred again around the same time  
andy and his family were vacationing in spain he  thinks perhaps italy they were out on a boating  
trip a little fishing trip when andy had a ufo  sighting actually a uso sighting an anti-den  
an unidentified submersible object i'll just let  andy describe what he saw in his own words but we 
(Andys Experience)
were on a vacation with my parents me my father my  brother or my mother and we were on a speed boat  
i think it was spain but it could be italy but I  think it was pain but suddenly I saw this black  
disk shape going underneath our boat and I  said to my brother my father for look look but  
they looked but it was too late it was already  gone and I asked my brother if it was possible  
for the for uh for uber to come there but he  started laughing he said no no it's too shallow  
because I could see the ground in  the water it was I think two meters
and that was another story so following this whole  cluster of events other strange things began to  
happen around age 15 or 16 andy moved out of the  house with his girlfriend and they had a strange  
experience with the levitating couch yeah uh I  was uh living with my girlfriend when I was 15 
(levitating couch)
because my mother had a new friend and we didn't  go well together so I i had to uh I had to leave  
i went uh living together with my girlfriend  and there was this couch and family and that was  
spooked and nobody wanted to have to do a nobody  wanted to couch but I don't believe in ghosts  
or that kind of stuff so I said give me the coach  off the couch give me so we were looking at the tv  
together uh in the evening and suddenly  the scouts started shaking for two seconds  
and it came from the floor a half an inch  from the floor and we looked at each other  
from that you fell there and she said yeah  and we jumped off and we put the couch we did  
we threw it away as andy grew up he and his  brother remained very close unfortunately they  
(suicide)
never discussed their ufo experience at the  time andy wasn't really thinking about ufos  
and never connected the dots and tragically  at age 24 andy's brother committed suicide  
and he's not sure uh if this was  related to the ufo experience or not  
like andy andy's brother was a very sensitive  guy very empathetic had a lot of trouble with  
selfish people with the evil and  corruption and crime in the world  
this was a huge tragedy for the entire family  andy took it particularly hard he now had no one  
to discuss his ufo experience with and it was  later uh following this experience as an adult  
and he got a computer and went online and started  to uh learn about ufos and that other people have  
had the same experiences he's had he found a lot  of details reported by other people that matched  
perfectly his own including what the room looked  like and the instrument that came down and other  
weird experiences he read about strange scars on  people's bodies scoop marks he had never examined  
his own body and was shocked to learn that yes  he did have these weird scoop marks on his back  
one detail that I think is very significant is  that andy has a strong connection with animals  
this is very very common among ufo experiencers  and it's definitely very strong with andy he's  
always had pets some of his pets won't let any  other humans touch them only andy wherever he  
goes animals love him he's just holds a  very strong respect for all forms of life  
(animals)
i even if I have a mosquito in my room I take a  glass I catch it and I put it outside a lot of  
people kill it I don't kill the smallest things  I don't kill I have respect for the life animals  
always come to me this is this is so sick  everyone I'm going to play cards with my friends  
at different houses they have different dogs  and every house every dog always sits or the  
whole time with me and he had one very unusual  experience where he woke up in the middle of the  
(psychic experience)
night turned on the light turned towards  his fish tank and saw that his pet fish  
was just beginning to give birth it was kind of  a psychic experience a very weird and cool event  
he also wondered about another weird event in  which he found two of his fish missing from  
his fist fish tank he always wondered about that  but definitely a strong connection with animals  
also important I think is andy  has had another ufo sighting  
he saw ufo very close up believes that  they were showing themselves to him  
UFO sighting on purpose I had this uh I saw two  uh ufos I'm living in an apartment
nine yeah nine stories high and I haven't a big view on  the sky I saw i've sent you the I did thank you to  
this drawing with a big cloud in the middle and  the sun was almost down under and there was this  
big cloud on the right and a very big cloud on the  left and a very big dark cloud in the middle and
when I see something shining outside I immediately  I immediately look outside because I want to see  
the I want to see ufos I want to I'm waiting for  them so I'm looking and I'm standing for my window  
and I saw this one ufo uh above the clouds and one  was coming through the clouds and he go up again  
so I saw him then he was wet up again so it didn't  sound then he came again down and I saw him again  
and then he went up again and then they were gone  that could not absolutely not never have been a  
star it was the brightest star i've ever saw on my  life but a star cannot shine through a dark cloud  
not and he and a star cannot  come down the clouds two times
more recently he saw a strange light in his  kitchen that was weird was never able to  
explain that and he still has a lot of questions  about his experience ultimately he feels it was  
positive and it was a benevolent event and he  would definitely like to have another encounter  
he feels nothing but good will towards the et's  
no I love him these beings uh from my  abduction I wish they were here now
because I got this overwhelming  when he said don't be scared of  
moon hurt you know when you  go with your parents to the uh  
the dentist and your parents say to your  phone don't be scared you believe him
uh this feeling was ten times maybe a hundred  times bigger I trusted him I felt so good I  
said okay do it and I want to know what what  what they did with this with this needle  
what I want to know what they did did they  put something in my head or take something out  
yeah because it's this little guy who smiled  at me I have a sort of uh friendship with him  
and I uh uh 10 years I have no flu or maybe 20 or  15 years now I think yeah 15 years I have no flu  
I'm not sick one detail andy always wondered  about was was he alone in his family.
(Other memories)
he couldn't talk to his brother and other  families denied having any experiences though  
more recently his sister did admit that she did  see three alien beings once standing at the foot  
of her bed also andy recently found out  that his cousin has had ufo experiences  
ufo sightings and apparently missing time  as well so this was incredible confirmation  
and sort of fit the pattern we see in other  cases in which these contacts run in families  
and he has since had other memories returning uh  he remembers being on board the ufo again at age  
13 he was lying on his back and the et's were  operating and said okay we're done now he  
also remembers being on board the ufo and walking  down a curved corridor with one of these et's and  
asking them about his brother and where his  brother was and he's a final memory of just waking  
up spontaneously and finding himself floating  outside the through outside of his bedroom through  
the window and up in the air he was scared he was  going to fall the ground was some distance and he  
was getting very frightened and thought to himself  this can't be happening this isn't possible  
when he looked up and saw one of these  beings and the beings said yes it is possible
so this is andy's experience I wrote about  it in my book on board ufo encounters  
and as I said I believe it's significant because  it's a multiple witness case it's consciously  
recalled without the use of hypnosis it's the  kind of experience a lot of people are having  
probably the most common I hear and for  that reason I think it's very significant  
and that people should know about it it's  definitely a story that deserves to be told  
and I want to thank you all once again  for listening and keep having fun
